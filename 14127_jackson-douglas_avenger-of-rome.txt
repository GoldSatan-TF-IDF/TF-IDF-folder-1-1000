douglas jackson avenger of rome i having restored their discipline domitius corbulo held back the parthians with two legions and a very few auxilia sextus julius frontinus stratagems a mans sword could be his friend or his enemy every sword was subtly different a rich mans sword would be forged of the finest carbonrich iron and have the edge of a surgeons scalpel an auxiliarys sword would be one of a thousand crude and poorly finished in some provincial armoury a poor sword might bend or break the best swords were like the men who wielded them tested to their very limits in the balefire of battle the sword gaius valerius verrens held was a warriors sword valerius studied the blade in the light from the oil lamp a simple legionary gladius twentytwo inches long honed to the sharpness only a veteran soldier could give it and with a leather handgrip moulded by use to the grasp of his fingers the gladius was a killing weapon no more and no less in the right hands it would harvest flesh as efficiently as a scythe would harvest wheat only the decorated pommel a gleaming silver bulb embossed with a snakeheaded medusa differentiated this sword from any other his fingers flexed on the grip and his mind sought to gauge the approaching danger he had felt the vibrations first the almost imperceptible shiver resonating through the heatseasoned earth of the road to the family villa at fidenae now the sensation was swiftly transformed into the muted thunder of galloping horses there was no fear if anything he felt an odd serenity he had always known they would come it was only a matter of when a rustling sound alerted him and he turned ready to meet the new threat only to find himself staring into the wide liquid eyes of his sister olivia of course she would have heard them in her own way she had as much to fear as he he smiled gently and shook his head they had gone through this often nothing to be done they would each meet what came in their own fashion the pale almost alabaster features turned resolute she nodded farewell before retreating to make her peace with her god and find comfort in the dagger that would save her the terrible end the emperor had dictated for those who worshipped the man christus valerius had debated long and hard whether to follow that route he knew exactly where to place the point the angle of penetration and the force required he raised the sword in front of him turning the blade into a bar of flickering gold so beautiful how many men had felt the sting of its cold metal to use it on his own flesh would have a certain terrible symmetry but would that make it his friend or his enemy a smile flitted briefly across his scarred face as he made his decision others might take that road but gaius valerius verrens hero of rome and last survivor of the temple of claudius would not he emerged into the grey softness of the predawn nero would have sent his best he would face them in the open where his speed and his skill would give him the greatest advantage the result was in no doubt nor did he intend it to be but he would give them a fight to remember a soldiers end because whatever they said he would always be a soldier the shrill sound of a horses whinny cut the still air and the rhythmic thud of individual hoofbeats reverberated like the snap of a ballista volley twenty at least but then they wouldnt have sent fewer soon valerius readied himself as the cavalry galloped into the broad courtyard with their red cloaks streaming behind them his sudden appearance from the shadows gave him the element of surprise and there was a moment of confusion before the decurion in charge sawed his mount to a halt and gaped in disbelief at the tall commanding figure with the sword in his left hand it lasted all of a second before he heard the nervetingling hiss of twenty blades being unsheathed he waited unflinchingly for the command that would begin it and end it but before it could be given a hooded figure emerged from the centre of the mass and drew back the cowl that hid his face i see you still know how to wield a sword a tall man spare and neat with his prematurely white hair cropped short the voice was soft almost gentle but it was belied by basilisk eyes that hinted at just how dangerous he could be it is a fine weapon valerius attempted to hide his astonishment at his visitors identity as fine as the day you placed it in my hand but somewhat rash to bare it in the presence of a consul of rome he replaced the sword in its ornate sheath and bowed to gaius suetonius paulinus formerly britains governor and destroyer of boudiccas rebel armies later political outcast and now against all reason restored to high office by his emperor welcome to my home paulinus looked around appreciatively at his rustic surroundings a fine estate but then you have had ample time to concentrate upon it this last year valerius smiled politely at the unsubtle hint of course paulinus would be fully versed on his selfimposed exile since returning from africa where he had served as quaestor to the proconsul aulus vitellius but his heart pounded as he sought a reason for the consuls unlikely appearance it was five years since they had last met and the then governor of britain had recommended him for the honour that had changed his life this was no social visit belatedly he remembered his manners i know it is early but perhaps you would like to sample our wine he offered i will have my slaves see to your horses and feed your men paulinus shook his head a little water and whatever you normally break your fast with we have matters to discuss gaius valerius verrens private matters the words private matters rang a warning bell in valeriuss head as he led paulinus inside he felt as if a dozen arrows were aimed at the centre of his spine he saw a flash of olivias pale features in the doorway of the triclinium and steered paulinus past to the library which was the most secluded room in the house the consul pretended to admire a marble bust of valeriuss grandfather while they waited for the slaves to deliver food and leave valerius unbelted his sword and placed it on one of the two couches in the room the other man gave a smile that asked permission to inspect the weapon and took valeriuss look of indecision for acceptance he slid the sword from the ornate scabbard and weighed it in his hand his eyes narrowing as he studied the blade just for a moment valerius thought he had misjudged the situation and paulinus had been sent to kill him but eventually the consul nodded in satisfaction and slid it home a fine sword indeed a sword worthy of the man who held the temple of claudius to the last man he reached beneath his cloak and withdrew a slim object which he handed to valerius you served your emperor well at colonia now you have your opportunity to serve him again what valerius held in his hand was a leather tube dark brown and weathered with age about twelve inches in length and with the scuffs and scrapes of long usage clear beneath the layers of constant waxing the imperial seal an image of the emperor nero as the sun king was embossed in wax across the join open it he felt paulinuss eyes on him as he wedged the tube in his right hand and worked at the stiff flap with his left the contents were a single sheet of parchment read it please aloud valerius was surprised at the power in his voice as he deciphered the neat clerkish hand gaius valerius verrens hero of rome is to assume the rank of senior military tribune and proceed to the headquarters of general gnaeus domitius corbulo there to take up the position of second in command and to undertake whatever duties the general sees fit in the service of the empire there was more travel details and a list of personal equipment a warrant for passage on a ship leaving from ostia in one week his head spun gaius valerius verrens hero of rome is to assume the rank of senior military tribune and with corbulo romes greatest general the man who had outfought and outthought the tribes of germania and whose feats of engineering had astounded the empire so why did he feel as if he held a squirming viper he looked up and sensed the almost mocking glint in the granitechip eyes that surveyed him from beneath paulinuss heavy brows the appointment does not please you valerius stared at the older man it pleases me well enough but the method of delivery surprises me i ask myself why a serving consul of rome should rise before dawn and ride six miles to convey a routine message from the palatium that could have been delivered at any time by imperial courier call it an old comrades whim paulinus suggested the pale lips curving upwards in a parody of a smile call it a trap if you are going to play games with me consul perhaps it would be better if you left now valerius kept his tone unforgiving and he allowed his eyes to stray to the sword i am no longer the boy you knew paulinuss rasping laugh surprised him so the pup has not lost his fangs yes he admitted there is more but i doubt it will give you any greater pleasure a direct order from the emperor to his subject which must be delivered by someone trusted by both and conveyed by word of mouth only it is this the consuls voice hardened along with the eyes gnaeus domitius corbulo is suspected of overstepping the powers of imperium granted him in the east by his emperor while you are on his staff you will compile a report on his activities and those of his senior officers that report will be thorough and objective and when it is completed you will find a way to get it into my hands you are asking me to spy paulinus sniffed i am told you have some talents in that direction that was different valerius remembered his pursuit of petrus the christian leader two years earlier the man was an enemy of the state general corbulo is successful quite ruthless and utterly vain and that vanity makes him certain of his infallibility so certain that he believes he can overrule the emperors advisers and follow his own policy in armenia and cappadocia if that suggestion is confirmed it may be that corbulo will be withdrawn perhaps even retired the words contained a hint of satisfaction and valerius was reminded of something else that before his disgrace suetonius paulinus had vied with corbulo for the position of romes paramount general it will not be an easy assignment corbulo has friends in the palatium and at court he may well hear of your mission and if he does he will try to delay you or stop you entirely paulinus hesitated and the younger man noticed the unnecessary emphasis his visitor placed on the last three words the task requires a man of resource and courage but gaius valerius verrens has proved himself to be such a man in the past your emperor has every faith in you if his situation hadnt been so perilous valerius would have laughed at the blatant flattery instead he said i am honoured by the emperors confidence in my abilities but i do not believe i have the capacity to complete this mission successfully i am a simple soldier without the subtlety required he has other men better qualified than i he can call upon im sure he stood but paulinus remained seated and fury flared like a flash of lightning in his eyes boudiccas conqueror might be a consul in name only but he still had power and knew how to use it you forget yourself young man i can think of a dozen others who would cut off their right arms for the chance to prove their faith to the emperor he cast a contemptuous glance at the carved wooden fist that had replaced valeriuss right hand they now lie in the depths of the palatine awaiting his pleasure paulinus had raised his voice and it must have been a signal because valerius heard scuffling behind him he turned to find olivia held by two of paulinuss bodyguards a helpless waiflike figure shivering with fear it would take but a single word and the family of verrens would join them do not think we are unaware of the conflicting loyalties within this house you cannot hide from reality for ever as you have hidden here from those who could have linked you to the traitor pisos cause consuls senators and knights have been imprisoned and tortured their families forced to take poison your old mentor seneca did you believe your isolation freed you from his taint gaius valerius verrens should know better than most men that there are no innocents on the battlefield and that in a fight to the death those who believe otherwise will be crushed for a moment valerius considered making a grab for the sword lying so conveniently at paulinuss right hand but he knew that even if he reached it olivia would be dead before he could turn paulinus saw his glance and smiled think yourself fortunate that you have been given the luxury of choice the reality was that there had never been any choice and they both knew it paulinus nodded as valerius acknowledged his defeat and olivia protested as she was taken from the room she will be safe under the emperors protection while you are in antioch you understand your orders the answer was no but the word that emerged from valeriuss mouth was yes paulinus rose to his feet you will visit the palatium where they will be explained to you in more detail methods of communication friends you may depend on and those to avoid valerius turned to go but paulinus wasnt finished with him it is possible that your investigations may uncover something more than mere vanity and overenthusiasm at corbulos headquarters he paused to allow the full significance of his words to register should that be the case you may be required to take further more direct action he picked up the sword with the silver hilt and placed it in the younger mans left hand do we understand each other valerius nodded because the words would have choked him yes they understood each other if he discovered any link between romes greatest general and the piso conspiracy he would become gnaeus domitius corbulos executioner ii valerius twitched the reins to steer the big gelding around a stationary cart portus which emperor claudius had begun building at the tiber mouth almost twenty years earlier and was still only half completed must be the busiest port in the world he thought it was a bustling place of trade and commerce where wagons and packhorses thronged the streets and smaller boats scuttled like water beetles among the stately giants loading up for the grain convoys to the east they had to ask twice before they were eventually directed to where their ship was docked by mars sacred arse will you look at that valerius reined the horse to a stop and followed his companions eye towards the vessel that waited to carry them to syria he would have expected a wellworn cargo ship or at best a fast military galley to transport general corbulos new second in command to his posting this was anything but it was larger than any normal merchant vessel forty paces from elegant bow to angular stern with a breadth of perhaps ten or twelve where the hull bellied out like a pregnant sow between them astonishingly the ship was painted a bright gold so that it shone like a jewel in the sunlight the figure of a swan with wings outstretched was carved above the bowsprit a substantial curtained awning had been set up behind the single central mast and a pair of twin steering oars projected from below a platform in the stern as they watched lines of slaves hurried up the gangplanks carrying assorted sacks and amphorae an imperial ship or a floating whorehouse serpentius offered either way it cant be for us but he was wrong an ancient sailor burned almost black by the sun ambled up and gave an awkward salute tribune verrens valerius nodded my captain requests that you embark your horses and equipment within the hour we sail as soon as our other passengers arrive other passengers the mans face took on the blank stare of a legionary on parade valerius exchanged an amused glance with his companion curiouser and curiouser in that case send some slaves to unload the mules and get our mounts aboard the two men supervised as the nervous animals were walked up the unfamiliar wooden gangplank and into the stifling darkness of the hold ill come down twice a day to make sure theyre properly fed and watered serpentius said as they returned to the deck valerius nodded he wouldnt like to be whoever was responsible if serpentius discovered that the horses were neglected the former gladiator was the most capable fighter he had ever known and a slave in name only part companion part bodyguard the wiry spaniard wore his manumission on a leather loop round his neck and swore he would use it when he elected and not when some roman decided it was time they had been together almost three years and the first time theyd met on the dusty surface of a gladiatorial practice ground serpentius had tried to kill him the resentful eyes and shaven head with its patchwork of halfhealed scars made men wary of him and they were right to be there would come a time when the gladiator needed to be told the true nature of his mission for the moment all he knew was that valerius was travelling to a new appointment in antioch they emerged into the sunshine to the usual organized chaos of a ship being prepared for sail with one peculiar difference amongst the sailors loading lastminute provisions valerius saw one man sprinkling water on the planking perfumed water if his nose didnt mistake him that masked but didnt quite overcome the stench from the bilges and the familiar scents of sea salt male sweat and new laid pitch serpentius shook his head muttered something about being right about the brothel and went off to check their equipment was properly stored valerius noticed a heavily built man in conversation with a young legionary officer the older man looked up and they both hurried across to greet him aelius aurelius magister navis the captain introduced himself in a voice that would be useful in a howling gale his accent marked him as a southerner as did his looks dark soulful eyes shone from heavybrowed features weathered to the colour of polished teak and his hair was styled in long ringlets a thick gold ring hung from the lobe of his right ear my apologies for not welcoming you on board the golden cygnet tribune but if i take my eyes off these dogs theyll turn the deck into a latrine valerius smiled at the exaggeration he doubted if a single ropes end was out of place in this ship unless my nose is mistaken your deck smells more like a ladys bedroom than a latrine captain i had expected a less elaborate transport aureliuss laugh sounded like a seal barking she may look like a fatbottomed old tart in her imperial livery but shes the sweetest sailing ship in the mare nostrum and can lie closer to the wind than most you may thank your fellow passenger for the emperors generosity the young soldier noticed valeriuss look of surprise and shook his head please dont think im the cause of all this sir tiberius claudius crescens junior tribune on the way to join general corbulos eastern forces and may i venture to say that your fame precedes you valerius studied him for any hint of mockery hed seen the pinkcheeked soldier dart a glance at his sleeve where the walnutcarved fist replaced his right hand the only visible scar of his encounter with boudicca the boy was what the legionaries called frontier fodder one of the young officers rome sent to the farthest points of her empire to learn fast or die fast tiberius had the plump earnest face and bright eyes of a teenager but he must be past twenty and well connected to have been given such a prestigious assignment eventually to the younger mans relief valerius smiled acceptance of the compliment then who is responsible for our good fortune his question was answered by a commotion on the far side of the harbour which alerted them to the arrival of a fourwheeled carriage escorted by a detachment of german auxiliary cavalry the coach clattered over the cobbles and drew to a halt by the foremost gangplank about time the golden cygnet s master grumbled id have preferred to wait until the next grain convoy east but my sailing orders were specific the only consolation is that well have a pair of galleys from the base at misenum to keep us safe from any sea scum as far as creta the gods be thanked that she sent her baggage in advance still we should make neapolis by nightfall say a prayer to poseidon and well be in seleucia pieria in twelve days he let out a roar ready the sails the ship burst into life around them and valerius watched as a slim figure in a blue veil dismounted from the coach and swept up the gangway accompanied by a pair of dark slave girls the little procession was followed by another older woman and finally four of the cavalry escort relinquished their mounts and marched towards the ship tiberius crescens laughed i almost forgot im supposed to take command of her guard he rushed for the top of the gangway grinning over his shoulder the lady domitia longina corbulo the generals daughter it should certainly make the voyage interesting iii with a favourable wind and light seas the cygnet made good time on the first leg of her journey south and as her captain had predicted she set anchor off neapolis as dusk fell there was just enough soft roseate light to show the bay in all its glory the familiar sweeping curve of low grey cliff and white sand washed by a gentle sea the colour of aged niger wine above it the rustic cloak of grey and green that garbed the great mountain which dominated the city shone gold in the dying embers of the day valerius was relieved that hed seen little of his fellow passengers during the sedate timeless run down the coast from ostia the guilt he felt over his unwanted mission was more than enough without being confronted by corbulos daughter to remind him of it he had spent his time trying to discover some kind of escape but without success for the moment all he could do was carry on and make his decision when the moment came makeshift accommodation had been created in the bow for domitia and her women and theyd stayed there all day behind screens amid rumours that the lady and her entourage were stricken by the usual firsttime sailors malady seasickness had never bothered valerius and the same was obviously true for tiberius crescens who had divided his time between his duties as guard commander and badgering his superior for stories of the british war valerius had told the tale a thousand times and had perfected a version that played down his own part in the defence of colonia and gave credit to the real heroes men like falco veteran centurion of the twentieth legion and commander of the colonia militia brave lunaris who had stood at his side through the dark days of the temple and the legionaries gracilis and messor who had given their lives so that he could fight on so all you did was stand back and direct the battle the younger man didnt try to hide his doubt that is what a commander must do valerius said airily as i am sure you will find out one day tiberius preened at the flattery but he refused to be discouraged yet the emperor awarded you the corona aurea the gold crown of valour valerius shrugged colonia was a disaster but just one of many when the last battle was won and boudicca dead the governor of britain needed a hero a live hero as the only roman survivor of the temple of claudius he had little choice but to honour me tiberius had stared out over the sea as it flowed beneath the wooden keel endless and anonymous barely rippling in the light breeze that carried them southwards the land was just a faint presence on the far horizon and the barbarians took your hand i think i would rather die than not be able to hold a sword again if the words hadnt been spoken so innocently a little boy musing on whether the moon might be made of cheese valerius would have been tempted to throw the young man over the side but tiberius probably couldnt swim and since hed just come off duty his buoyancy was unlikely to be helped by the plate armour that covered his chest and shoulders he sighed well see how well i can hold a sword tomorrow tribune exercise for you and your men at dawn im sure they will have some wooden practice swords and a couple of shields aboard that we can borrow tiberius turned and saluted was there just the hint of mischief in his eye of course sir i will arrange it tomorrow at dawn exercise with sword and shield sir by the time valerius woke the golden cygnet was well under way and the sun came up between two hills on the eastern horizon creating a spectacular bridge of light between ship and land he took a deep breath of invigorating sea air and tasted the salt on his lips serpentius had already risen from his place on the deck and the distinctive clash of two wooden swords followed instantly by the boom of a blade against one of the big curved scutum shields reminded valerius how he had planned to start the day his first action as it was every morning was to oil the mottled purple stump of his right arm and fit the wooden hand on its thick cowhide socket over the end with his teeth and the fingers of his left hand made nimble by habit he tightened and knotted the leather bindings the arm had been chopped off four inches above the wrist by a celtic battle sword and the replacement was designed to exactly match the length of the original satisfied he wrapped a short kilt round his waist and set out along the deck towards the small group of men gathered just behind the bow as he approached serpentius tall and leopard lean walked past and whispered beware of the puppy valerius raised an eyebrow and the spaniard grinned taking his seat on a coiled pile of rope tiberius looked relaxed as he stood among his men dressed in a short white tunic my apologies for keeping you and your men waiting tribune valerius took in the glances at the carved walnut fist which as always ranged between amusement and contempt either of which was better than pity no apologies required sir tiberius smiled we were eager to get started and put on an exhibition of basic swordplay for your slave he seemed most interested perhaps you should have him trained he has the build for it and a slave who can fight might save your life one day valerius somehow kept his face straight i will think on it tiberius but a slave with a blade seems quite wrong the spanish rogue is as likely to slit my throat as protect me a big curveedged shield of raw wood lay against the bowsprit and valerius pushed his arm through the leather strap and fitted the walnut fist which had been carved specifically to take a standard scutum to the grip one of the cavalrymen handed him a practice sword cut from seasoned oak and he weighed it in his left hand it was the same length and design as the basic legionary gladius but almost twice as heavy it had no edge and a blunt point but in the right hands it could still be dangerous all right whos first the german cavalrymen eyed him warily taking in the hard eyes and sharpedged angular features of a face that wore its trials like a badge of honour onehanded or not the scars he bore were evidence they faced a veteran fighter valerius had always been powerfully built but daily practice with serpentius had broadened his shoulders and toughened his arms and legs the former gladiator had taught him the merits of speed and footwork as well as a useful assortment of dirty tricks from the arena he looked confident because he was he chose the most likely of the four you sir the man saluted and faced up to him three paces away on the wooden deck crouching with his shield in his left hand and the sword in his right his first moves were tentative because he had never faced a lefthanded man valerius allowed him to take the initiative meeting each attack as it came and leaving it until late to counter gradually the cavalryman gained confidence and his attacks were launched with more venom valerius let him work up a sweat before calling a halt and ordering the next man forward there was nothing to be gained by humiliating the soldier bad feeling in the cramped confines of a ship even one the size of the golden cygnet would only fester and spread the bouts proved what he had expected the gladius was an infantrymans weapon designed to be used in a shield line doubleedged and with a needlesharp triangular point it was a highly efficient deadly weapon in the hands of a man who knew how to use it in battle each legionary braced his shield against the man on his right and once they were in contact with the enemy rammed the shield forward to create a narrow gap through which the point of his gladius could dart into an opponents abdomen they were taught never to inflict a wound more than three inches deep but when combined with the classic ripping twisting withdrawal such injuries were invariably fatal valerius had seen a legionary cohort cut down a force of attacking tribesmen twice their number like farmers harvesting a field of corn these men were cavalry troopers more used to wielding the longer and heavier spatha from the saddle the spatha was a fearsome killer in the hands of a man who knew how to use it but the technique basically hacking and bludgeoning an opponents head and neck was entirely different from the gladius wielders it meant the men were slow and awkward on their feet lacked any feel for the sword and held the shield as if it was an encumbrance and not a weapon of both attack and defence he resolved to repeat the exercise every morning so that when they left the ship they were better equipped for battle than when they boarded he felt an unaccustomed surge of joy overwhelm the melancholy that had settled over him since hed left fidenae he was a soldier again i suppose i must be next tiberius smiled absently as he untied his tunic and pulled it over his head for some reason valerius felt the hair rise on the back of his neck it was exactly the feeling hed had when hed led patrols among the innocent woods and harmless rolling hills of southern britain right up to the moment the innocent woods had turned out not to be so innocent and the rolling hills had spewed out fifty bloodcrazed celtic champions iv beware of the puppy tiberius crescens might have the face of a benign cherub and the bumbling awkwardness of a fledgling philosopher but when he stripped to his loincloth valerius immediately recognized what serpentius had known by sheer instinct he was facing a warrior the young tribune had the stocky muscular physique of a professional athlete and short solid legs but he balanced on his feet like a dancer the boyish features were like the velvet glove that covered a boxers brass knuckles the disguise that made you underestimate the danger beneath there was something else too a fierce concentration in the eyes and a tension in the body that reminded valerius of a bear trap ready to snap shut the last time hed seen the combination was at the gladiator school in rome where hed found the spaniard all that was missing was hate tiberius picked up a shield and moved into position the wooden gladius steady in his right hand at first valerius wondered why the boy had revealed his true self why not maintain the disguise and take his opponent by surprise a hint of a smile flickered on the younger mans face and gave valerius his answer it wasnt as hed half suspected arrogance or conceit quite the opposite tiberius wanted him to know because above all tiberius wanted his respect a fair contest between the unblooded boy and the seasoned hero of rome no subterfuge no tricks just warrior against warrior valerius felt a rush of energy as he realized he could be in the fight of his life battle madness they called it but there were different kinds of battle madness he had seen british warriors drunk on blood charge into a wall of shields and try to tear out roman throats with their teeth he had felt it himself in the final moments in the temple of claudius when the great double doors had smashed open in an explosion of fire and smoke and there was the mechanical madness of the fighting machine that was the roman legion as it killed and killed again until there was nothing left to kill on the slope where boudicca had fought her last battle this was the white heat of war when a man lost his mind and rose above the field of blood on a redeyed wave of elysian rapture then there was the kind of madness valerius needed now the cold detached madness of the true killer a man had to seek this madness within it took a different kind of courage to allow some inner power to rule heart and mind and body to let speed and power and instinct be dictated by a force beyond understanding or design valerius never took his eyes off his opponents and he saw the moment tiberius found what he sought he allowed his mind to clear and his body to empty of emotion it was like being inside a flawless diamond the coldness started at the centre before expanding to fill him from head to toe fight to the watchers the early movements were less a battle than a courtship a gentle collision of sword and shield a ritual coming and going of bare feet on boards now hot from the morning sun a seeking without finding probe and counter probe stroke and counter stroke in the cold core of his mind valerius understood that tiberius had watched and analysed every action of the earlier bouts and from that briefest of scrutinies had formed a greater understanding of a lefthanded fighters strengths and weaknesses than any other man he had faced but valerius was a lefthanded fighter and he knew what tiberius had only seen each attack came from the angle he expected when the young tribunes deft feet carried him to an impossible position of strength valerius was there to meet the blow before it began to fall a moment of comedy with each man so attuned to the others movement that they appeared to be dancing slowly the tempo increased as they found each others measure sword against sword shield against shield feinting right and left up and down always seeking that elusive opening the cavalrymen gasped at the speed of the attacks and even serpentiuss face wore a puzzled frown by now the sweat was coursing over valeriuss eyes but his unconscious mind saw beyond it tiberius was like a wraith in the distance where the spectators saw a halo of blurred movement valerius experienced everything as if the two men were fighting under water it was as though he could read his opponents every thought and intention prepare for each attack and have the time to choose the exact manoeuvre that would nullify it he wasnt aware of effort or tiredness or pain he was what he was gaius valerius verrens hero of rome a blades length away tiberius barely noted his opponents existence he recognized the sweatslick muscled figure with the swordscarred face only as a machine that countered his every move make one attack and three came back in reply find an opening and the body that had invited the sword was gone before the point could reach it at times it was as if he was fighting two men by now he understood they were equal in strength and speed and stamina their ability with the weapons matched as if they had emerged from the same womb still he knew that he would win because this was what he had been born for the rattle of oak upon oak was a neverending roll of thunder the speed which for ordinary men would have been impossible to maintain for a few minutes had been kept up for more than fifteen and still the swords flew and the noise grew to a climax it could not last surely one of them had to give no man was capable of sustaining such a tempo a snapping crash a fracture in the rhythm a scream of victory no valerius felt an iron grip on his sword arm his eyes focused on serpentius standing beside him tiberius lay on his back with the splintered remains of his sword in his hand and the point of valeriuss wooden gladius an inch from his right eye he was still smiling i think weve given the ladies enough entertainment for today serpentius nodded over valeriuss left shoulder and he turned his head to look towards the curtained pavilion ten feet away the scene resembled a marble tableau he had once seen in neros private quarters in the domus transitoria three young women in almost identical poses but wearing different expressions domitia longinas two slave girls had their hands to their mouths one in horror and the other in delight the generals daughter stood slightly behind them tall imperious and obviously fully recovered from her seasickness wearing a red dress and a look of puzzled amusement it was the first time valerius had seen her face properly and something lurched inside him as he realized whom she resembled before the older woman emerged from the tent to shoo her charges inside he felt an almost physical pain as he remembered another momentous meeting in the courtyard of the temple of claudius a meeting that had changed his life and almost cost him it i hope i didnt tire you sir tiberius stood at his shoulder his eyes on the group disappearing behind the curtains no a pity it ended so quickly i was just getting into my rhythm tiberius grinned at the lie do you have any suggestions for an honest journeyman now it was valeriuss turn to smile it took him a few moments to remember the words of marcus the arena veteran who trained the gladiators on the day he had met serpentius an old gladiator once told me dont fight like a onehanded man or a twohanded man fight like a killer the younger man nodded solemnly but i think you already know that tiberius the tribunes grin deepened and he turned to walk away and tiberius yes sir never underestimate your opponent v the golden cygnet passed through the strait of messana on the morning of the fourth day with the vast dusty bulk of sicilia a mile to their right and to their left the province of lucania the most southern point of mainland italia valerius stood beside the steering platform with captain aurelius as they left the mainland behind make course due east the sailor ordered the steersmen grunted as they hauled the massive oars against the force of the waters rushing below the hull and the sailmaster a tall nubian trimmed the sails to make the best speed on their new course valerius watched as the two naval galleys kept station sleek and narrow as a pair of dolphins three shiplengths off the bow aurelius reached up to touch the tutela the carved talisman of poseidon that protected the ship if the wind gods favour us well make landfall on the achaean coast two hours before dark i have a mind to anchor up early today the lady domitia has graciously invited us to join her for dinner aurelius misinterpreted valeriuss look of alarm yes it is unusual but she is an unusual young woman her fathers daughter i would say her mother died in antioch two months ago after a long illness and the emperor offered the use of this ship as soon as he heard she bears her grief like a soldier your companion the young tribune is also invited to attend as well as the commanders of the two classis galleys the masters entreaty to poseidon must have been successful because the cygnet and her two outriders cut an arrowstraight furrow across the cobalt waters of the aegean and they anchored in a sheltered bay with the mountains of central achaea a brown haze in the distance when the sun was still well above the western horizon valerius could make out a settlement on the far side of the bay after consulting with their hosts freedwoman a widow called tulia whose every disappointment was written in her curled lip and small suspicious eyes aurelius sent a swimmer to organize fresh fruit and vegetables and anything else that would enhance the meal while a rough table built by the ships carpenter was set up in front of the lady domitias curtained tent the arrival of an imperial ship had caused a sensation in the village and within an hour small boats were ferrying back and forth with the produce of the land others filled with spectators simply anchored while the occupants stared in awe at the great goldpainted hull keep them away unless they have something to sell aurelius roared as one boat came too close to his paintwork i dont want any thieving greek getting on board this ship valerius washed on deck in a bucket of sea water and serpentius erected a curtain to allow him to dress in privacy over his best tunic with the broad stripe of a senior tribune on the hem and sleeves he wore a moulded leather breastplate embossed with silver and the white cloak which differentiated him from any other officer in the legion no sword or crested helmet for this was a purely social occasion he ran his hand through his hair and exchanged a glance with the spaniard you look like a scarred old tom leopard in a dress but youll do was serpentiuss opinion ive seen you looking less nervous before a fight mind you that tulias face is enough to scare a scythian swordswallower into an early grave or is there someone else who frightens you valerius decided not to hear the final sentence tiberius scrubbed polished and wearing armour buffed to a mirror shine was waiting just the right distance from the table to be polite beside him stood the two captains of the escort galleys who if anything appeared even younger than their companion they saluted valerius warily eyeing the wooden hand and the vivid red line that scarred his face from below his left eye to the corner of his mouth but tiberius noticed his smile i apologize if we have amused you sir never apologize for amusing someone tiberius there is not enough amusement in the world and never mistake jest for insult or you may find that winning a battle costs more than you are willing to pay i was just thinking that you fight as if you were born with a sword in your hand the young man nodded accepting the compliment as his due thank you sir and its almost true my father was legate of the fifteenth primigenia and later the eighth augusta so my brother and i grew up in military headquarters on the rhenus and in moesia we loved him of course but he was a man of little imagination and our education was limited to basics such as grammar and rhetoric he was very insistent that we should be selfsufficient in every way so we trained and exercised with the soldiers each day the armourer first fashioned me a small sword when i was four years old i believe and apart from the occasional childhood illness i have held one every day from that to this he was interrupted as the curtains of the tent fell back and the lady domitia longina corbulo took her place at the head of the table she had exchanged red for blue a long flowing gown that bared the unblemished flesh of her shoulders and was low enough to give a hint of shadow between her bound breasts dark piercing eyes took in each of the guests in turn she could only have been seventeen at most but the way she carried herself reminded valerius of an egyptian princess slim and lithe and at one with herself and her destiny confident but not arrogant clear of mind and clear of purpose tulia the freedwoman emerged to sit on a second small bench the younger of domitias slave girls a pretty darkskinned child who looked about fourteen led aurelius to the longer bench on the hostesss left before returning for tiberius and the two young naval commanders and finally valerius who ended up sitting closest to domitia in the place of honour to her right the generals daughter waited until they were settled before she spoke you must forgive me for the unorthodox seating arrangements honoured guests but this is an unorthodox occasion i hope you will not find it too upsetting not to recline i fear our couches are so narrow that we would all end up falling to the deck that is what we call the floor of the ship is it not master aurelius she said it with a smile and aurelius answered with an embarrassed grunt which domitia gracefully accepted as agreement she clapped her hands twice and the slave girls appeared with silver cups and a jug of wine i have taken the liberty of watering it but only slightly because it is very fine and fine wine deserves not to be adulterated too much do you not agree tribune the question was directed at valerius but the wine and the ability to answer seemed to stick in his throat it was a few seconds before he was able to speak and when he did the banality of his words horrified him i am afraid my acquaintance with wine of this quality is so fleeting as to deny me an opinion my lady domitia but tiberius saved him a falernian i think brother valerius he interrupted and perhaps aged ten years but im sure you would have outed it in the end the sweetness is the key nothing that came off those slopes could generate so much honey in less time valerius heard a snort of annoyance from the far end of the table i am afraid tulia disapproves of our gathering domitia explained as she disapproves of much that i do but surely it is not right to be confined to our quarters on an adventure such as this it will be the first time in two years that i shall have seen my father in any case i wished to congratulate you on the condition of your ship captain aurelius i had heard sea voyages were arduous and dangerous but apart from tulias constant complaining this has been most pleasant aurelius bowed his shaggy head may i ask how long it will be before we reach antioch we are at the mercy of the sea gods lady the sailor ventured but with good fortune we will reach syria in just over a week in a few days we will call in at creta to resupply and take on cargo he produced a rare smile timber olive oil and cloth will offset the cost of the voyage the emperor is a generous man but he likes his ships to turn a profit the fare was surprisingly good domitia had brought on board a plentiful supply of preserved food and a selection of fresh and pickled vegetables from the village was followed by shoulder of hare cuts of salted pork and two whole chickens aurelius had supplied a sizeable tunny fish cooked black on the outside and bloody in the middle as the crew of the golden cygnet preferred it the taller of the two naval officers ate voraciously as if he never expected to see food again while the other held valeriuss attention with a lecture on shipboard fighting tactics the key is to fight on your enemys ground if he outnumbers you which he generally does in our case once he has boarded you it is only a matter of time before he prevails so you must board him the first two or three over the side will probably die of course his smile said it was regrettable but necessary but once you have formed your shield line you will find your roman soldier or even marine is a match for any pirate valerius thanked him he kept his eyes on the table but his attention was drawn to domitia who was discussing the uprising in judaea with tiberius the war had begun so disastrously for the roman commander of the province cestius florus that rumour said he was to be replaced by titus flavius vespasian one of the generals who had conquered britain for claudius almost a quarter of a century earlier i had thought we might be diverted there but it will be an honour to serve with your father the younger tribune said smoothly his success in armenia has brought new laurels to the empire they say that even now their king is in rome paying homage to the emperor domitia nodded gravely you may find serving with my father more of an honour than you are comfortable with tribune his reputation as a disciplinarian is well deserved and i have no doubt that you are replacing some young officer who has failed to meet his standards discipline comes easily to me my lady tiberius said offhandedly but no soldier is so perfect that he cannot be improved by more training i will use what time i have on board to prepare she smiled he would have been impressed by your display yesterday morning though possibly not by the fact that i witnessed it my apologies lady valerius found his voice at last we should have taken more care from now on we will exercise in the stern you will not be disturbed again i hope do not concern yourself tribune domitia gave a coarse little laugh i found it most instructive if ever i discover myself with a sword in my hand at least i will know what to do with it in any case if blame there was it was mine i was curious and as tulia is always reminding me sometimes curiosity takes you places you should not go vi summer ad the sun king looked out upon his people from the balcony of the great golden house he had built over the ashes of romes third district and felt an unexpected surge of affection less than two years ago thousands of romans lived their shabby little lives on this very land but the gift of fire had allowed him to substitute splendour for squalor and magnificence for mediocrity the houses and apartments had been replaced by a vast country villa in the centre of the urban landscape three hundred and sixty paces from wing to wing with three hundred rooms each filled with rare bronzes gilt statues and the finest artworks in the empire all surrounded by trees and pasture and lakes and a great park in which roamed wild animals from all over the world a golden house for a golden age and this would be the greatest day of that age with perfect timing the morning sun rose above the hills and everything around him gleamed as its rays reached out to caress the gold leaf and gold paint and golden statuary which covered the front of the vast building the effect was such that it blinded those unfortunate enough not to be shielded by the huge cloth awning which portrayed him in his chariot driving the four horses of the sun god his heart swelled with pride he wanted them to be blinded blinded by his magnificence awed by his power he was not a fool he understood he had lost the senate and the aristocracy but he still had the people and he still had the legions and he still had his praetorian guard these were the triumvirate which cemented his power not the whining politicians who complained at every expense and every little excess the golden house which stretched between the palatine and esquiline hills had come close to bankrupting the imperial treasury tigellinus his commander of the guard could only ensure its completion by ordering the officials to cut the silver content of the denarius but it was all worth it because this and his heart beat faster as he considered what he had achieved this was his legacy to his people no longer could he be compared to divine augustus and found wanting in the golden house he had created a monument to romes glory that outshone anything his illustrious ancestor had been able to devise a monument that would last a hundred lifetimes of ordinary men caesar with a smile the emperor nero claudius caesar germanicus turned to his imperial secretary he had been quite lost in his own thoughts king tiridates is here thank you epaphradotus this was the second ceremony to welcome armenia into romes keeping the first in the forum had been a mere appetizer compared to what was to come nero looked to the rear of the balcony where the king of armenia waited in his long robes a swarthy predators face the clubbed beard reaching his chest nose like an axe blade and heavy brows topped by a shining thatch the colour of pitch and styled in tight ringlets a savage face but a noble head a head awaiting a crown had another emperor been in neros place king tiridates would now be in the carcer romes prison awaiting the bite of the strangling rope for tiridates had been an enemy of rome he and his brother vologases of parthia had fought two long expensive wars against the empire if nero had followed his generals advice there would have been a third and tiridates would have been crushed on the battlefield and slaughtered with his army but wiser counsels had prevailed and now the king was here to pay homage to his emperor and to rome he called tiridates forward and as the king stepped out into the light the massed ranks below and on the surrounding hills and on the faroff houses erupted into frenzied cheering so that the balcony was hit by an almost volcanic wave of sound nero felt himself grow along with the volume of applause this was what he lived for this adulation and proof of his dominion this was what had spurred him to invest so much effort and expense in his voice and his bearing for a moment he was possessed by an overwhelming urge to sing to give them the joy that came entwined as one with his talent but the moment passed and now tiridates was on his knees laying the triple crown at his feet and he was looking down at the mass of dark greasy curls and the cheering was ever louder together the two serving consuls telesinus and paulinus handed him the jewelled diadem of laurel leaves with great ceremony he placed it over the other mans head tiridates murmured something in his native parthian it could have been thanks or mortal insult but nero cheerfully offered his hand to his new brother king and drew him to his feet bestowing a kiss to show his affection turning to the crowd he raised his hands and in that single movement commanded a hundred thousand people to silence let the celebrations begin he called in his highpitched manboys voice and the cheering reerupted the two rulers took the broad stairway to the ground floor where nero deliberately conducted his guest through the shadow of one of the wonders of the empire the astonishing statue he had commissioned of himself as the sun god sol close to one hundred cubits in height and covered entirely in gold leaf it was the largest marble sculpture in the world dwarfing even the legendary colossus which had stood astride the entrance to the harbour of rhodes it portrayed a pensive benevolent nero with the suns rays radiating from his head like a crown his left hand holding a globe stretched towards his people and in his right the whip with which he would drive the horses drawing his chariot it was a glorious piece of uninhibited selfindulgence a thousand lifetimes of wealth incorporated in a single piece of art as he passed it king tiridates wondered at the colossal vanity of the unprepossessing almost effeminate young man beside him there was more to wonder at in the great banqueting hall where the armenian king dined on the most sumptuous food the empire could provide in a bewildering room which revolved around its guests while the ceiling periodically showered them with flower petals and perfumed water such technological marvels impressed tiridates profoundly even more than the displays of military might nero had been careful to provide an empire capable of sustaining such extravagance could send a dozen legions against him at any time he had been right to make the treaty and his brother vologases wrong to want to continue the war nero contemplated tiridates bemused expression with satisfaction and left the room to summon his praetorian prefect offonius tigellinus tall and thin with a long nose and a fringe of russet hair that clung to the back of his head like a stray squirrel tigellinus didnt look like the most dangerous man in rome he had the face of someone who had just drunk sour milk and the hangdog demeanour of an undertaker nero felt the familiar flutter of nerves when the man he depended on so completely approached so many had abandoned him or wronged him in some way that forced him to remove them of all the long list tigellinus was the only man left he could trust what if something happened to him for years the former horse trader had supplied all his needs nothing was beyond his reach boys girls men and women rich and poor and in any combination or number senators wife or slave concubine or virgin tigellinus knew where to lay hands on them and if he could not persuade buy or terrify them into the emperors bed his praetorians would force them if the emperor needed money and emperors always needed money tigellinus would find a benefactor who could be induced to contribute to the imperial purse licences could be granted subsidies controlled and monopolies awarded and the praetorian prefect would maximize the profit what was more that long nose had an infinite capacity for smelling out traitors and the mournful expression hid a pitiless cruelty and fertile imagination it had been tigellinus who had torn the heart from the piso conspiracy with his blades and his hooks and his hot irons tigellinus who had invented the exquisite refinement of torturing a man or a woman to the very brink of death and having them restored by a physician to face the same fate again and again and again it had never failed nero had been so delighted by his aides successes that he had awarded him the triumphal regalia normally reserved for senators and consuls and erected a statue of him in the palatine gardens it had been tigellinus who suggested removing neros former teacher seneca once and for all when piso and his nest of vipers were being stamped out that was what he liked about tigellinus his clarity of purpose no attempt to fabricate evidence or bribe witnesses just a simple tying up of loose ends neros agents in senecas household had reported that the old man had met his fate with dignity protesting his loyalty to the last a pity but he had long since outlived his usefulness and he knew too many secrets to be left alive a most satisfactory day he welcomed tigellinus cheerfully i have never seen the people so proud of their emperor king tiridates was suitably awestruck by my splendour and overwhelmed by the power of their love for me a triumph a triumph for rome a triumph for romes emperor tigellinus corrected and a triumph for her legions all the long years in the imperial court and his training at senecas knee had given nero an ear for nuance he caught a certain inflection in the praetorians voice yes a triumph for her legions and it is right that men should fear romes legions you have news from judaea a few months earlier the syrian subprovince had risen in revolt after a punitive expedition against an assortment of religious fanatics had resulted in hundreds of deaths in the violence that followed the best part of two legions had been wiped out and the eagle of the twelfth fulminata lost it was the greatest military disaster of neros reign and it was imperative that it should be avenged swiftly and mercilessly gallus has been removed from his command vespasian will form a task force from the syrian and egyptian legions and lead them against the rebels meanwhile general corbulo has returned to antioch and will offer what support he can to vespasian there it was again that slight change in tone he had come to recognize two of our finest generals nero ventured and our most loyal just so caesar a moment of clarity but you have concerns general vespasian is your own appointment a new man who is intelligent enough to understand that he would never win enough support to aspire to the throne and his hands will be kept busy for at least two campaigning seasons general corbulo romes most successful commander in the past ten years neros voice rose an octave as he was forced to come to corbulos defence has been heard to cast doubts upon your policy of reconciliation in armenia and parthia there is talk of giving armenia away nero waved a dismissive hand a soldiers grumbles even tiridates told me that i have no more loyal commander than corbulo of course the prefect said smoothly i venture no accusation i only caution the emperor stared at him the piggy eyes narrowing proceed general corbulo was appointed on the advice of seneca tigellinus pointed out he has been in the east in asia and syria for twelve years with the same legions some would say enough time to create his own personal empire nero didnt have to ask which some he knew the praetorian had agents in every military command but tigellinus surprised him with his next admission he is a difficult man to get close to his senior officers have been with him for years and are unfailingly loyal the juniors take their lead from the legates only now have i been able to place someone in a position of trust although as i have said it is generally known in his headquarters that he has been critical of your policy and your orders to act upon the defensive his legionaries regard him as something close to a god tigellinus saw the emperor stiffen as hed intended only emperors could become gods normally this could be dealt with simply enough a new posting to some less arduous front a summons home for some new honour a long and happy retirement on his estates in the north but but the situation in judaea means that syria is also vulnerable it would only take one small spark for the rebellion to spread therefore it is important that syria is in safe military hands and there are no safer military hands than general corbulos nero nodded and what does my faithful tigellinus advise we wait and we watch if general corbulo does his duty and defends romes and the emperors interests all well and good if he were to overstep the mark however the emperor stared from the window overlooking the luscious parkland its vivid greenery nourished by the blackened bones of a thousand plebeians still lying in the burnedout ashes of their homes not corbulo never corbulo but then tigellinus had never been wrong before so they would wait and watch very well see to it and keep me informed tigellinus saluted and walked from the room the first piece was in place vii sail to the north at the sharp cry aurelius followed the lookouts pointing finger to where a faint strip of cream could be seen between swells on the far horizon julius the captain shouted youve got the sharpest eyes get up the mast and tell me what you see while they waited for the mans report valerius strapped on his sword and joined aurelius at the ships side he noted with approval that tiberius already had his men in full armour serpentius emerged from the hold where hed been checking the horses to join the young tribune and the four cavalry troopers it was early morning on the second day since theyd left creta the ship had called at the port of hersonnisos to take on a cargo of timber and the islands olive oil which was said to be the best in the mare nostrum and would sell for a good price in antioch or alexandria theyd said farewell to their escort there and when the galleys left it felt as if they were losing an old friend aurelius nodded when he saw the swords good no need for concern yet but best to be ready julius a small ship under full sail could be a galley or a fishing boat the sailor guessed wait i see regular flashes of white at her sides a galley under oars and making good speed on a course to intercept anything else valerius noted that the captains voice had lost some of its customary assurance the lookout strained his eyes towards the tiny speck almost lost in a vast undulating carpet of azure julius thought hed done well enough to mark the splash of the oars but when he looked again there was something hed missed a flash of colour at the head of the other ships mast looks like shes running some sort of signal aurelius jumped for the mast and with surprising agility for such a big man scrambled up to the main spar could it be one of the escort galleys with a message for us valerius shouted they should be halfway back to misenum by now the captain didnt hesitate turn due south and run before the wind he shouted to the steersman when he returned to the deck he called valerius to the stern pirates he spat over the side valeriuss hand automatically went to his sword but aurelius smiled and patted him on the shoulder therell be time yet for that tribune he studied the sky to the north where a few puffy white clouds had gathered shes a scout not one of their big fighting galleys which gives us a good chance of outrunning her outfighting her too if her plundering bastard of a captain wants to push his luck well give it an hour before we turn northeast again that should still allow us a chance of making landfall on cyprus before dark it looks like we might be in for a bit of a blow which will suit us better than her because she carries less sail and shes lower in the water i thought we had got rid of the pirates along the cilician coast long ago aurelius laughed bitterly just because theyve disappeared doesnt mean theyve been defeated they cant take on the big grain convoys and most single merchants arent worth their while so when the navy raided their ports crucified the most prominent captains and burned a few of their ships they simply vanished like smoke it doesnt take a great deal of effort to turn a pirate galley into a coastal trader and most of the pirates were as much merchants as they were thieves and murderers but if a juicy target lands in their lap the seaman glanced towards domitias pavilion the girl i doubt they are after the timber and olive oil in our holds tribune someone will have seen us dock in creta in a harbourside bar one of the crew boasts that his passenger is the daughter of the famed general corbulo they wait they watch they see us leave unescorted if they catch us they might take us all but probably not no it is the girl they are after they will move her along the coast to a sheltered cove past tarsus maybe and smuggle her into the hills where they will sell her to one of the bandit kings who still rule in the disputed lands on the borders of cappadocia and armenia those men have little love for her father they will ask for a ransom that will make his eyes water and he will either pay it or get her back one pretty piece at a time then let us hope they dont catch us aurelius sniffed the air as if testing the wind for scent sharpen your swords and pray valerius nodded and tribune dont mention this to the generals daughter the last thing i need is a hysterical woman panicking all over my deck three hours later there was still no sign of the poor weather aurelius had predicted but they were back on course and thered been no hint of the other ship for more than an hour aurelius had a man permanently at the masthead but the captain still stood on the steering platform scanning the northern horizon with a worried frown on his tanned face valerius wasnt certain whether he was concerned about pirates the clouds which had turned into a brooding darkfringed pyramid or the atmosphere which had become sticky and breathless though there was still enough breeze to stir the sails the frown deepened when domitia left the curtained tent with one of her serving girls and approached the stern good morning captain she gave aurelius a smile that would have melted another mans heart i wonder if i might trouble you for some fresh water to use for washing sea water is all very well but im sure that can be arranged lady aurelius said briskly the dwindling water reserves had been on his mind but if they made port as planned at cyprus it wasnt a major concern if for any reason they missed their landfall he would have to turn north to seek water at some settlement or river outlet on the asian coast he had no doubt he would find somewhere suitable hed sailed these waters since he was ten years old but it would take time and he would prefer to preserve stocks if he could still it would be worth a pint or two to get the generals daughter off his deck julius a bucket of clean water for the lady and her serv sail due north the whole ship froze at the sound of the lookouts voice and another just to her east his voice faded and he muttered what sounded like a prayer what else aurelius snarled captain a third a mile further east still aurelius darted another look at the clouds gathering in the north but there was no help there he turned to domitia im sorry lady he said quickly im afraid your request is denied and i must respectfully ask that you and your slaves take up your quarters below decks it will be safer there domitia longina lifted her dainty chin and glared at the captain i will go below decks when i see fit and not before she snapped safer from what captain lady i command this ship and i do not have time to argue you will go below tribune will you escort the lady domitia and explain our situation he nodded to valerius and ran off roaring to the helmsman cronos set course due south i want her running before the wind with every ounce of speed she has sailmaster check every rope we need every stitch straining domitia was left staring at the captains disappearing back caught between a patricians natural inclination never to accept defeat and the knowledge that if aurelius was concerned perhaps she should be also finally she turned her anger on valerius well for a moment he thought she might stamp her foot if you would accompany me i could explain our difficulties as we go do not patronize me tribune her eyes he noticed for the first time that they were a deep walnut brown threatened to catch fire i am my fathers daughter and i will not be made light of i valerius heard a shout from the deck and looked up to see the pale ghost of a sail on the far horizon this was no time for talking if you are your fathers daughter you should be able to obey orders he took her arm and bustled her to the hatch which led below decks he saw serpentius grinning and tiberius looking on with a puzzled frown and it only made him more angry at her foolishness that sail belongs to a pirate galley you understand about pirate galleys well these pirates want you and when they get you they will use you to destroy your father if he pays the ransom and leaves them alive he will no longer have his honour if he does not he will no longer have you and that will be infinitely worse in an instant the wildcat inside her retreated his final sentence and the way he said it first confused then intrigued her she frowned and shrugged herself free as they reached the ramp if you had explained yourself so eloquently a little earlier she said sweetly perhaps we would not have had this misunderstanding come suki valerius couldnt help noticing the way her body moved under the thin skirt as she walked down the steps into the hold he shook his head idiot to think of something like that when they could all be dead in the next few hours he ran to the stern and prepared to face the enemy viii theyre gaining aureliuss voice remained steady but the concern was written stark in the lines of his weathered features i thought we were holding them but they are making ground on us with every minute his eyes darted constantly between the heavens and the waves and the three sails that were now clearly visible on the horizon they will not use their oars until they are close because their rowers can only maintain their hunting speed for a short time there is no point in using up their strength until they need it but all is not lost we may be fortunate yet his hand reached up automatically to touch the carved figure of poseidon where years of habit and countless maritime dramas had worn a shining circle on the knee valerius tried to judge the distance between the three pirate craft and the golden cygnet how much time did they have aurelius read his mind we have a following swell and that tells me there is more likelihood of the winds freshening than backing there are still four hours till dark but if we dont lose a steering oar or snap a rope we should be able to stay ahead and they will not relish continuing the chase after dusk they are cowards at heart they will always seek a profit but not if it is likely to cost them blood we may be only a single ship but we can still put up a fight the only reason they have not turned tail already is because of the prize he frowned and spat very well aurelius valeriuss voice took on the authority of a man who had commanded a legion an african legion but still a legion you are in command of the ship but who is in command of the defence of the ship aurelius nodded solemnly my men are not fighters though if it is fight or die they will fight but understand this if it is a choice between fight and run we will run what do you need to know valerius signalled to the watching tiberius who ran to them and saluted sir the young tribunes eyes were bright with expectation and valerius thought here is one man who will defend the ship to his last breath a man to fight alongside another man to fight alongside was standing a few feet away trying to look uninterested but valerius knew serpentius would be listening to every word first we need to know how many weapons are on board and how many of your sailors you can spare to fight i have a crew of twenty and in a stern chase i can give you a dozen of them armed with either a sword or a spear though i doubt theyll be much use with either tiberius snorted dismissively attracting a glare from the captain but valerius only looked thoughtful what about axes aurelius brightened oh yes they can all handle an axe give a sailor an axe and watch the blood and teeth fly so we have seventeen including the tribunes cavalrymen and my servant tiberius we will leave one of your troopers to provide protection for the lady domitia and her staff the question is how many will oppose them the captain chewed his lip the cilicians pack them in tight a big pirate galley can ship fifty men over and above those on the rowing benches tiberius gave a short whistle but at least one of the galleys is the scout ship we saw he will carry no more than twenty the figures were double what he had expected but valerius hid his concern very well tribune crescens i have my own thoughts on the defence of the golden cygnet but i would value yours tiberius struggled to hide a grin when he spoke his tone was professional and his words considered as i see it from a military point of view the golden cygnet is simply a walled fighting platform and it can be defended in the same way i would defend any fortification if we can get enough men to the point of attack we can fight off a force of greater numbers especially a force of pirate scum valerius smiled i wouldnt underestimate the pirate scum tiberius but i agree with your conclusions my only concern would be if we were attacked in more than one place which id suggest we have to assume is a possibility aurelius nodded gloomily these pirates they climb like the monkeys they are given even the slightest opening they will swarm all over the ship valerius exchanged glances with tiberius then we must consider another option we cant let them get on to the cygnet the younger man glanced uncertainly towards the pirates we fight them on their own ground fight them on their own ground and kill them on their own ground valerius turned to the captain do you have anyone on board who has served on one of those galleys aurelius didnt need more than a second capito the wizened sailor who had met valerius and serpentius on the wharf in ostia ran up to them he looked abashed to be singled out but brightened when he realized what he was being asked aye they had me chained to an oar for nine months and would have thrown me and those chains overboard if yon navy lads hadnt been so quick can you draw a picture of a galley and point out its strengths and weaknesses for me the sailor told them i can do better than that i can show you he ran below and returned with a lovingly carved wooden model every spar and every oar in its place now this here is the biggest of the type twenty oars a side fifty feet stem to stern and a dozen across the beam he pointed to the centre of the ship your scouts they have but ten a side and are maybe eight feet across and besides the oarsmen the bigger ships carry say fifty fighting men and the smaller twenty capito frowned that would be as a rule sometimes less sometimes more a pirate chief he would be hard put to it to fill his bigger ships these days with the pickings so slim they must have a weakness tiberius said studying the little model critically capito looked blank as if the thought had never occurred to him but after a few moments his face broke into a gaptoothed grin he patted the solid oak of the side of the golden cygnet their weakness is that they wont ram this their captains are savages thieves and murderers who revel in torture and cruelty they abused us slaves horribly but they are also businessmen the galleys are built for speed light fast craft that can fairly skim across the water if the oarsmen are driven but that strength is also their weakness ive seen a roman galley shear clean through a pirate hull capito returned to his station and the three commanders discussed the situation for a few minutes more before valerius made his decision aurelius in that curious ebb and flow of confidence that affects men before a battle had pondered whether they should turn and use the ship as a seaborne battering ram it was an idea that appeared to have merits but valerius pointed out that while they were tangling with one ship the other two would undoubtedly converge on them and they would eventually be overwhelmed by sheer numbers no he said firmly the answer is to try to outrun them if we can but to engage them one at a time if there is no other alternative he looked out over the waves the little group of sails was closer still we need to lighten the ship in the depths of the hold valeriuss eyes took time to adjust to the gloom and bring into focus the individual objects around him aureliuss face had crumpled when valerius had announced his decision he had argued and growled and ill be damned until it had been pointed out that his most precious cargo was the generals daughter and that if they lost domitia they were unlikely to survive her fathers wrath or neros valeriuss gaze fixed on rank after rank of earthenware amphorae he nodded to aurelius form a chain and over the side with them aurelius winced he could have wept seeing his profit for the entire trip jettisoned but he waved forward the men who had been waiting by the ramp whats in here valerius pointed to an enormous stack of oddshaped parcels and packages set to one side of the hold the lady domitias personal baggage aureliuss eyes widened you wouldnt back on deck valerius studied capitos model of the galley and tried to ignore the closing presence to the north above the familiar creak and groan of the constantly shifting puzzle of ropes and jointed wood that was the golden cygnet s rigging he heard the rhythmic splash as the ships cargo of finest cretan olive oil was consigned to the depths a sharp feminine shriek broke his concentration and he looked up to see tulia domitias companion wrestling with a sailor who was attempting to push a crate over the side the crewman was twice tulias size but from what valerius could see he was getting the worst of the encounter and would bear the scars for some time to come he was about to intervene when the generals daughter emerged from below decks she took in the scene and he saw her fists clench and her eyes narrow her face took on the combative look hed last seen on an iceni warrior charging a roman shield line she advanced on the struggling pair what is going on tulia she demanded the freedwoman disentangled herself from her opponent they are throwing your things overboard my lady she said tearfully the tribune says anything heavy must be sacrificed valerius felt the moment she turned on him and when he raised his head it was like looking into the mouth of a volcano before she could speak he nodded towards the stern her eyes followed his and widened as she realized how quickly the pirate had closed since the last time she had been on deck in that instant her whole demeanour changed and he was reminded of the difference between other women and a roman lady bred to rule the aggression drained from her to be replaced by a languid grace and the headlong charge was transformed into a neat turn then if the tribune says they must go they must go tulia kindly show them where to find the tableware and the boxes containing the statuary valerius rose and went to her side thank you my lady i appreciate your cooperation if it had not been necessary she shook her head and looked again at the pirate galleys which were now less than half a mile away in times of war we are all soldiers tribune and we must all make sacrifices she turned and forced him to look deep into her eyes is that not so we place ourselves in your trust when she was gone and his heart had stopped thundering he forced his attention back to their pursuers wondering at the turmoil she awoke in him another complication he didnt need he imagined the big galleys gaining stroke by stroke coming closer and closer until they touched hulls with the cygnet what would he do then how could he confound his enemy he thought back to the defence of colonia when he had tempted boudiccas warrior chiefs with the only remaining bridge to the city and they had taken the bait this was different he was being hunted by three wolves and when the first wolfs jaws closed the others would move in and together they would tear him to pieces look he joined tiberius at the side something strange is happening the younger man pointed out perhaps they are abandoning the chase valerius looked back to where two of the galleys had closed and their movement seemed to stutter for a moment his hopes rose before the ships parted and the smaller of the two suddenly surged ahead of its brethren whats happening aurelius i need to know what theyre planning the golden cygnet s master scratched his head i do not know unless he looked again to where the single galley was powering towards them each stroke bringing it closer and allowing him to see it with more clarity capito come here tell me what you see the old sailor hurried to his captains side he understood in an instant poseidon save us ive seen it done before but only once theyll have run a plank between the sterns of the two ships and reinforced the crew of the smaller one when a slave tires they throw the poor bastard overboard and hes replaced by a fighter it means that they can maintain their highest speed but youll face up to forty pirates instead of only twenty he took in the distance between the scout galley and the cygnet and his voice faltered theyll be upon us in minutes valerius saw the moment capitos nerve snapped the sailors eyes spun in his head and he let out a terrible cry they wont take me again before anyone could stop him he ran to where a stack of amphorae lay against the side of the ship picked up one of the great stone jars and leapt over the rail valerius searched the spot where the wizened seaman had jumped but it was as if he had never existed the weight of the amphora had taken him straight to the bottom in the appalled silence that followed aurelius barked an order and another sailor picked up one of the amphorae preparing to heave it over the side valerius put a hand on the mans shoulder how many left these are the last twenty i think sir keep them i want the oil poured into as many buckets as you can find and get me a couple of iron files big ones tiberius looked at him as if hed gone mad but when valerius had explained his plan the young tribune shook his head in admiration madness but it might even work he drew himself up to his full height it is a soldiers privilege to volunteer to commit suicide tribune and i ask to be first over the side valerius shook his head there is someone better qualified tiberius you are young you will have other opportunities for glory youre right tiberius grinned where you lead i will follow in any case i doubt any of us will get back alive even if we succeed his grey eyes turned serious i underestimated you tribune for all your laurels i thought you had gone soft but i was wrong youre as hard as the iron in that gladius you wear are you sure they all have to die all we can reach we will have one chance if we cant sink the galley we have to disable it the sailor returned with a pair of heavy metal rasps valerius handed one to tiberius here you know what to do he took the other rasp to where serpentius sat near the stern calmly running a whetstone up and down the edge of a sword the spaniard nodded as valerius took his place beside him so we fight fight or die maybe both isnt it always so i have a job for you a special job serpentius gave a bitter laugh isnt it always so he handed valerius the sword which was the one with the silver pommel valerius took it and nodded gravely before he bent and removed his sandals the spaniards eyes widened as he started working on the leather sole with his knife to further expose the metal studs in the base why would you be ruining a perfectly good pair of marching boots so valerius told him ix i need five of your strongest and steadiest men have them issued with axes and tell them to report to me for their instructions you know what to do when they reach us aurelius nodded he didnt trust himself to speak his eyes never left the pirate galley three hundred paces away powering its way towards them through rising whitecapped waves whipped up by a wind that strengthened with every passing minute the two larger pirates hampered by their low freeboard in the heavy seas had fallen back but were still less than a mile away valerius studied their motion and reckoned that he had five minutes at most to do what he needed to do he replayed the plan in his mind and thought about the decision hed taken was there any other way the answer as it had been every time hed considered it was no but it didnt make him feel any better it was murder pure and simple not war not selfdefence murder tiberius waited by the side with his cavalrymen they had expected nothing more than an uneventful cruise nursemaiding the generals daughter and it showed on the drawn tense faces would they follow him only the gods knew and valerius had never placed much faith in the gods he gripped his sword tight and it seemed to shrink in his hand as he lived the next few minutes in his mind it was a sword that had been forged in the fires of victory a sword of honour the gold crown nero had placed upon his brow might have given him fame but the sword suetonius paulinus had placed in his hand had given him freedom freedom from the guilt of survival freedom to live again was he about to sully it he looked round and found serpentiuss shrewd eyes on him the spaniard knew without a word he took the blade and returned a few minutes later with another from the cygnet s armoury valerius nodded his thanks but serpentius had already turned away to focus his attention on the pirate judging the effect of every wave and every stroke of the oar with the fierce intensity of a man who knew his life depended on it the sword he held was a long cavalry spatha a doubleedged bludgeon of a weapon that only someone exceptionally strong could wield with any finesse serpentius could use it though valerius had exercised with him most mornings since they had met and outmatched him only once and that by trickery the spaniard could weave mesmerizing patterns with the heavy sword that left a man dazzled by a whirlwind of bright iron old marcus had boasted affectionately that he could remove your liver and serve you it for dinner before you even realized it had gone and he had only been exaggerating a little each of them had a dangerous job this day but serpentius had the most dangerous one of all when he heard that the spaniard was to lead the attack tiberius had argued against it until valerius explained why he had made the choice serpentius the gladiator had faced five and even six fighters in the arena and lived to tell the tale he knew how to kill and he knew how to survive and the second of those skills was as important as the first if the men valerius led were to get back to the ship alive fight the enemy on his own ground the naval prefect had said well that was what he planned to do but first he had to get there and then he had to stay long enough to make it count a cough from behind made him tear his eyes from the galley and he turned to find the sailors aurelius had promised in a small jostling group behind him a couple wore nervous grins most were gravefaced but one or two were clearly terrified the five burliest men held axes although only two were of the brutally effective longhandled type valerius had hoped for tiberius took them aside and explained what was expected of them and valerius was pleased to see that none flinched when they heard their orders he told the rest to be ready to resist any boarders from the galley and lined them up behind the buckets full of olive oil four shiplengths he looked back to the stern where aurelius stood by the steering platform talking urgently to the broadshouldered steersmen four now for the manoeuvre he planned would place a huge strain on the big steering oars beside the mast waited the big nubian sailmaster susco his face tense and his eyes on the men who stood by the lines that secured the sail it was up to them now aurelius assured him it could be done if he was wrong they were as good as dead the outcome depended on how well the cygnet s captain could judge the speed of his ship and the speed of the galley how well he knew the capabilities of them both the timing had to be perfect the sea and the wind were rising all the time salt spray whipped across the deck and every few seconds the ship would lurch as another wave pounded the sternpost was he imagining it or had the course changed fractionally to the west would the captain of the galley notice three shiplengths he could see the pirate crew as an amorphous mass with the occasional movement as they hurriedly switched places when a rower slumped forward exhausted from the mighty effort of powering the galley forward minute after muscletearing minute he thought he heard a scream as another scarecrow figure went over the side but he couldnt be sure fight them on their own ground it had sounded so simple when the naval officer had said it but now looking at the galley so slim and so deadly as it slipped through the waves he felt his mouth go dry somehow he kept his face impassive the others deserved that much inside his guts were churning and something liquid had formed at the base of his stomach he was gaius valerius verrens hero of rome he had been through the fire and the iron of the temple of claudius and he had lived he had faced boudiccas horde on the field before colonia and he had never taken a step back but he had never fought on a ship fear was a warriors enemy and he had never felt a fear like this he looked at the churning waters between the galley and the golden cygnet and he imagined what it had been like for old capito what had he felt as he plunged into the depths still clutching the amphora he had chosen as his doom valerius adjusted his iron helmet with the reinforced crown and heavy cheekpieces and checked the straps of his lorica segmentata the jointed plate armour that covered his shoulders chest and back which he had chosen rather than the pretty but less protective leather breastplate the armour would be his doom if he made a single slip in the next few moments tiberius had set aside a shield for him the grip had been subtly altered so that he could release it with a twist of his wrist it was potentially dangerous because it was less secure but he might have to move fast and the ability to jettison it could be the difference between life and death he slipped the walnut fist into place and took up his position at the ships rail a pace from serpentius ready a dismissive snort was the only reply behind him where tiberius and his cavalrymen stood he heard someone mutter a prayer two shiplengths the pirates were visible as individuals now no jeers or threats just fierce bearded faces waiting implacably for the moment of contact now the roar came from aurelius at the stern in a single smooth movement the spar holding the huge mainsail dropped towards the deck instantly slowing the ships forward momentum at the same time the four steersmen leaned on the steering oars and the big merchantman leapt like a bucking horse straining against the enormous pressure as the sea forced itself against the broad wooden paddles the ship seemed to stop and turn simultaneously its remaining impetus taking it across the path of the galley valerius clutched the side to steady himself he heard a roar of surprise which immediately turned to triumph as the cilicians concluded as aurelius had planned that the cygnet had lost a spar and was now disabled the manoeuvre had been timed so that even the pirates master a man who had spent a lifetime at sea would have no chance to alter course the galley would meet the bigger ship bow first amidships exactly as valerius had hoped the pirate chiefs frantic orders rang in his ears and he saw the flash of backing oars before the galley struck the golden cygnet s hull with a heavy crash in the same instant the first of the grappling hooks fell on the deck and were hauled back to catch the ships side this was the moment even as the hooks landed five of aureliuss crewmen hurled the contents of their buckets on to the men in the prow of the pirate galley of all the elements fire is the seamans greatest enemy and when they felt the viscous liquid covering their bodies the pirates took an involuntary step back then another as they looked up in fear for the lighted torch that was certain to follow but there was no torch only serpentius the spaniard landed like a cat on the raised platform in the bow his sword ready and his eyes promising death confused by the oil the vanguard of the boarding party took vital seconds to recover they had crammed into the first dozen feet of the galley and were hemmed in by the rowing benches and their surviving occupants the deck beneath them was slick with oil and their feet slithered and slipped on the planking as they fought to stay upright the long spatha flicked out and the first pirate fell before they even realized serpentius was among them a growl went up and the leaders prepared to surge forward but the gladiators blade was a blur of bright metal and the surge died stillborn instead of attacking they were forced to retreat a step and then another two steps were enough valerius launched himself from the deck of the golden cygnet and crashed on to the bucketing galley in the space the spaniard had cleared with his sword the wooden planking was made treacherous by the olive oil but the sharpened hobnails of the romans caligae gave him a purchase that was denied the barefooted pirates a heartbeat later he was at serpentiuss left shoulder smashing his shield into the bearded wildeyed faces in front of him another thud told him that tiberius and his men were following and a second later the young tribunes shield locked into place beside his within moments they had been joined by the three cavalrymen and serpentius was able to step back his job done valeriuss wall of shields created an impassable barrier across the narrow breadth of the scout galley anchored at the flank by the curve of the ships wooden sides the pirates could only attack two at a time up the narrow passage in the centre of the ship or over the crowded rowing benches and that meant they would never be able to focus enough power momentum or numbers to break through but it wasnt enough already valerius could hear the sound of aureliuss men reaching the deck behind him and those men needed room to work on me he roared now as one the five shields battered forward with the automatic twist of the wrist that opened a gap for the lunge of the gladius at the same time the five men stepped into the space before the first of the wooden benches that would hamper their further progress as much as it hampered the pirate attack valerius was on the left of the line where his lefthanded sword would do most good with tiberius to his right he could feel serpentiuss comforting presence behind him ready to aid the hardest pressed or fill any gap in the line now was the moment for the pirates to feel the scorpions sting of the gladius in an instant three or four of them were writhing on the deck and only the cavalrymen in the centre remained face to face with their attackers chained to the bench in front of valerius a blackened husk of a man with shoulders whipped to raw meat by the overseers lash raised his hands and pleaded for release but the chains were an inch across and the only way they could be removed was if the galley were to be captured valerius had always known that six men could never take the ship two inches in the right place is better than six in the wrong one he heard the words of his first instructor as the triangular point of his short sword punched through the breastbone of the captive oarsman and into his heart the mans eyes widened and his body slumped to the side leaving just enough room for valerius to take another step into the centre of the ship if he could not kill all the pirates the only way to save the golden cygnet and domitia was to disable their vessel the galley slaves had to die so that the generals daughter might live the slaughter had begun valerius had killed before more times than he could count but the men he had killed had either been trying to kill him or deserved to die he had never done murder he took another step forward screaming at the pirates to come to him and his sword flicked out again more than anything else he wanted to take a life that deserved to be taken as if that would cleanse him of the slaughter of innocent men when he had landed on the pirate galleys bow he had felt a terror that had never affected him on land the lurching deck and the cramped confines of the fragile wooden hull tested his courage and his confidence but now that the killing had begun the battle calm settled over him a hulking unshaven brute in a loincloth clambered between the slaves at the rowing benches and stabbed at his eyes above the shield with a short spear valerius used the curved rim of the scutum to force the point up and was rewarded by a howl as his gladius pierced the mans unprotected belly spilling blood and entrails on to the boards to his right tiberius and the man beside him carved a path through the pirates in the central aisle the water in the ships bilge swirled and slopped an awful slaughterhouse pink and valeriuss nostrils filled with the stink of gore and oil raw fear ingrained sweat and the dried shit that painted the galley sides an enormous figure naked to the waist and with a shaggy pelt like a bear burst from the pirate ranks and vaulted the rowing benches on the right of the roman line before the cavalryman facing him could react the giant tore the mans shield from him and tossed it away then picked the soldier up and threw him shrieking over the galleys side the big pirate howled in triumph and turned towards the next man in the shield line but before his comrades could profit from his victory serpentius had stepped forward and sunk his long sword into the mans belly ripping the blade free with a twist of his wrist the cilician collapsed disbelievingly into the ships bottom and the spaniard snarled defiance at his enemy and called more of them forward to die they had won three benches before valerius heard the sound he had been waiting for the sharp thunk of axes chopping into the galleys wooden hull brought a howl of dismay from the pirates and a screamed order from their captain that launched a ferocious attack on the roman line another spear flicked off the rim of valeriuss shield and caught him a glancing blow on the cheekplate as he fought off two pirates one of them he noticed dispassionately in a rusting roman helmet of a pattern that hadnt been in use since the days of pompey the great with a cry the first of the men fell into the gap between two rowing benches where a galley slave already cowered for a moment valerius puzzled over whose sword had accounted for the pirate it was a mistake that almost killed him just in time he sensed movement and darted a look towards his feet the pirate had wriggled below the benches and was now readying his sword to stab upwards into the romans unprotected groin it was too late to bring his own sword round to meet the blow and evasive action was impeded by the body of an oarsman he had killed earlier he saw the fierce light in his killers eyes even as an axe blade from behind split the grinning head in two spattering blood and brains on his legs he shouted his thanks to his saviour who turned out to be julius the lookout but the sailor was already gone throwing an oar overboard and bringing his big axe down to bite into the ships bottom with all his weight behind it how long had they been fighting valerius had no idea but the bloody water at his feet reached past his ankles now the ship was holed and that meant they couldnt fight for much longer the other pirate galleys would be closing fast they had done what they could now they had to do the impossible without taking his eyes from his enemy he shouted the command prepare to disengage tiberius grunted to acknowledge the order as he flicked a spearpoint aside with the edge of his shield one step at a time on my shout now somehow keeping his shield steady and fending off his attackers valerius made the awkward step back over the rowing bench and the body that was still chained to it he could only hope that the other men were doing the same in front of him the pirate crew howled as they realized what was happening and renewed their attack with redoubled fury he risked a glance at the boards and saw water gushing through a jagged hole low down on the side of the boat a sword stabbed at his throat forcing him to duck behind his shield and another hacked at the leather covering drawing splinters from the wood now at last the galley walls began to curve inwards and he could hear cries from the golden cygnet as the axemen clambered back on board tiberius he cried get your men out of here ill close on you and well hold them from the centre serpentius you follow them by now the pirates were fighting with the frenzy of the damned as they realized they had to regain control of the galley before it sank under them he could hear the captains roars above the howls of the gutted and maimed and the groans of the dying someone must have found a bow because for the first time arrows began to zip past valeriuss head one hit his shield with a sharp crack and a cry from behind told him another of the shafts had struck home he felt hands working at his waist below his armour but he didnt have time to wonder what was happening tiberius sir the tribune gasped his own breath rasping in his throat valerius found he was uncommonly pleased that the younger man was showing signs of tiring at least it showed he was human when i move forward you go i can hold them thats not a suggestion tribune get back to the ship now as he shouted the word valerius smashed his shield at the pirates contesting the narrow passageway he hadnt worked out what came after all that mattered was to give tiberius and his men time to escape the other galleys would be almost on them now and aurelius had orders to get the golden cygnet under way before they were in a position to threaten him no matter who was left on board sword blades clattered against the big wooden shield and he knew it was only a matter of time before someone worked their way over the oar benches to flank him or stabbed his legs beneath the shield the pressure was almost unbearable he remembered the last moments in the temple of claudius and realized he was grinning lord valerius his heart quickened further at serpentiuss shout now a hail of spears arced over his head into the crowded passage in front of him and the pirate crew hesitated for a precious moment with a twist of his wrist the shield dropped free and he ran x with the pirates so close behind that he could feel their breath on his neck valerius sprinted towards the galleys bow the crew of the golden cygnet had cast off the grapnels and the big merchant ship was already five feet away with the gap widening every second he glanced up to see a row of anxious wideeyed faces and registered the ropes hanging from the bigger vessels side still travelling full pelt he mounted the low platform in the bow and dived for the ropes reaching out with his left hand even carrying the weight of his armour he would have done it he was certain he would have done it but as he launched himself a callused pirate hand clipped his heel and turned the leap into a sprawling tumble that smashed him against the ships side his helmet struck the seasoned oak with a clang and the impact knocked the breath from his body before he plummeted into the blueblack void under the cygnet s rail the shock of the freezing waters seemed to stop his heart and for a fleeting moment he had no idea what was happening his bewildered mind registered the ships weedstreaming timbers through the opaque curtain of blue water and silver bubbles as the light above him faded to a tiny window as he sank the fingers of his left hand scrabbled for the straps of the armour that was carrying him to his death but he knew it was useless he had drowned before trapped in the narrow aqueduct tunnel below the viminal hill but that had been a terrible violent drowning while this was almost dreamlike by comparison he made no conscious decision to hold his breath his bodys natural inclination to survive was automatic but he could only hold it for so long gradually the pressure grew in his chest and his nose and throat began to fill he looked up at the wooden hull for the last time before a convulsive jerk made him choke and the darkness closed in ive seen it done before the words seemed to come from very far away put him on his stomach and pump his back he felt himself being turned over and the pressure of strong hands on his ribs at first nothing happened then he felt a burning sensation in his chest and throat one of the steersmen fell overboard in the harbour at alexandria we thought he was gone but his bunkmate who was sweet on him lay on top of the body and gave him a good squeeze suddenly all the water came out and he was good as new valerius noisily vomited what seemed like gallons of salty water his eyes opened and he watched the contents of his lungs and stomach slowly spreading across the smooth planks of the deck good as new he tried to raise his head but it seemed terribly difficult someone turned him over so that he was looking up into a patch of darkening sky circled by a ring of inquisitive concerned faces rough hands pulled him into a sitting position and his head spun as if he was on his third jug of wine tribune tiberius stared at him as if he were a ghost which he supposed in a way he was how many deaths must one man endure he tried to speak but the drowning and the vomiting had torn his throat how it was a sound really not a word but tiberius seemed to understand your slave is a man of some resource he said cheerfully when you ordered him away he tied a rope to your waist the sailors were able to haul you in like a fish after you fell but it took so long we thought you must be dead someone serpentius placed a cup in his hand he looked at the clear liquid suspiciously but other hands raised it to his lips and the water was cool and soothing as it ran down his ravaged throat he nodded his thanks the pirates the water seemed to have helped his voice they are gone our axe men must have done their work well the galley foundered the others ran not even attempting to rescue their friends for the first time valerius realized that the deck was pitching much more wildly than when he had left it he looked up at the big mainsail taut and straining at its stays the wind whistling through the ropes tiberius pulled him to his feet and serpentius wrapped a cloak around him not for the first time he owed the spaniard his life it was only then that he noticed the other little group huddled over a bundle by the ships side tiberius saw the question in his eyes and shook his head aurelius he wanted to help and picked up a spear it was just bad luck really valerius pushed his way through the crowd and knelt by aureliuss side the captains face had taken on the colour of old parchment and already bore the unmistakable stamp of death he saw immediately what had happened aurelius must have been lifting the spear to throw when the arrow pierced his lower right chest angling its way up towards the heart they had torn away his tunic and there was very little blood but the point was buried deep with only a short span of shaft and the feathered fletching showing above the bruised flesh each laboured breath was accompanied by a hoarse groan and small frothy bubbles of red that clicked as they burst on his lips the captain opened his eyes and beckoned valerius nearer his voice was the merest whisper and the roman had to lean close to hear what was said east aurelius gasped you must go east judaea settlements by shore plenty of them cronos is a good seaman but a poor sailor he will want to go south for egypt because it is easier to run before the wind and a storm is coming but by the time you get there water will be short and unless fortuna favours you all you will find is desert he closed his eyes and drew in a long agonized breath for a moment valerius thought he was dead but even though the captain was drowning in his own blood he had one last message to impart good crew but keep the women out of the way shouldnt allow women on ships bad luck pour a libation for poseidon and give his knee a rub for me he has never let me down a smile flickered on his lips he sighed once and was gone no funeral oration dispatched claudius aelius aurelius to join his beloved sea god four sailors carried him to the side and weighted the body before consigning it to the depths as was their custom in the nervous silence that followed valerius called tiberius and cronos to the steering platform by now the wind had risen to a low howl and the sky was dark though it could only be midafternoon he addressed the helmsman with aurelius gone you are the man we depend on for our knowledge of the sea cronos what is your understanding of our situation cronos frowned he was a heavily built man with wellmuscled shoulders from working the big steering oars but he had a petulant mouth and a truculent almost dismissive demeanour valerius had had little contact with him during the voyage but he seemed capable enough perhaps the sullen attitude could be explained by the sudden change in his responsibilities a fine seaman but no sailor aurelius had said the man looked up at the brooding sky as if measuring their chances we were a days sailing from cyprus when we first sighted the pirates but we have been driven far south off our course by now we are at least two days from land and must keep the wind at our back this he gestured at the sky is poseidons punishment for taking women on board without sacrificing to him first if we do not placate him the god will whip up a storm above and below and when the time is right he will rise from the depths and drag us all to his lair valerius felt tiberiuss eyes on him then we will make a libation to him at the appropriate hour and ask his forgiveness a few drops of olive oil or wine will not be enough to placate the god for this insult cronos glowered if we are to survive we must make a suitable gesture i have spoken to the crew we should make a gift of one of the women tiberius stiffened and his hand strayed towards his sword but valerius only nodded as if he understood the crews concerns he lowered his voice and laid his hand on the seamans shoulder the physical gesture was reassuring almost friendly but the fingers closed like a claw digging into the flesh and the words that accompanied it held all the threat of a drawn blade i want you to understand cronos that whatever you and your friends believe i command here and i would sacrifice every one of the crew before i would allow harm to come to the generals daughter or her women let it be known that if there is to be a sacrifice i plan to be generous and storm or not the ships master will be first over the side it took time for the words to sink in but valerius was satisfied to see the man go pale beneath his sunscorched skin we will not sail with the wind at our backs he went on we will turn east for judaea where there is more likelihood of making landfall close to some community who can supply us in the meantime i want all food and water to be placed under guard tiberius will organize it and we will ration its use cronos bristled at the order but he had no choice but to accept valerius saw the hatred in his eyes and knew that before long it would be reflected by the whole crew sailors were superstitious by nature and if cronos told them the storm had been caused by poseidons anger and the presence of the women he would be believed pouring a libation wouldnt be enough unless the winds died down instead they worsened two hours later valerius stood beside the steering platform whipped by spray and soaked to the skin the steersmen battled to keep the golden cygnet on an easterly heading but time and again her hull rang as it was battered by a big wave from the flank and she took a lurch southward the winds had redoubled in force to a full gale and cronos ordered the curtained awning on deck to be dismantled before it was torn away now he studied the cloth sail with anxious eyes as it rippled and cracked because of the angle of the wind across its surface if we dont run before the storm we will lose it tribune valerius reluctantly nodded his agreement clearly aurelius had never envisaged a tempest of this magnitude the largest of the waves carried a terrifying power each time one struck the whole ship lay over so that anything not secured cascaded across the deck if they carried on with their eastern course there was a danger they might capsize an unceasing bellow like an orphaned bull calfs filled the air so that even a shouted conversation became difficult and every so often a rainstorm swept out of the darkness with the sound of arrows striking a cohorts shields time meant nothing in this whirling vortex of wind and water at one point valeriuss senses told him he should sleep and he huddled in his sodden cloak jammed between the steering platform and the ships side but fear discomfort and the constant motion denied him the oblivion he sought daylight brought little respite if anything the winds strengthened shifting at the same time so that cronos believed they were now being driven east all through the long day valerius watched the seaman and his exhausted crew fight to keep the golden cygnet afloat cursing at his own impotence around nightfall the motion of the ship subtly changed and he could feel her wallowing beneath him as if she was trailing an anchor a shadowy figure crawled out of the darkness and tiberius shouted something into his ear he had to repeat himself three times before valerius worked out that he was wanted below together they staggered across the pitching deck just as the next rain shower arrived driven horizontally so that every giant drop stung like a slingshot against exposed flesh tiberius hauled open the hatch and valerius felt a surge of relief as they slipped below and away from the incessant howl of the wind his respite was short lived when he reached the base of the ladder he was up to his knees in water that surged and foamed with the motion of the ship the disturbance intensifying the bitter stench of decay bodily ordure and fresh vomit the torment of the wind was replaced by the incessant creaking of the ships planks and a tortured rending as some piece of cargo worked itself to pieces as their eyes adjusted to the gloom an almighty crash shook the whole ship instantly followed by the terrified scream of a panicking horse and a series of smaller thunderclaps your slave serpentius is with the horses they are kicking their stalls to pieces but thats not the worst of it the ship reeled beneath their feet and something huge and pale sailed past valerius and crashed into the side with enough force to make him wonder that the hull hadnt been stove in some of the timber cargo has worked its way free tiberius explained in a voice that was an eye of calm amidst the echoing clamour of the hold the crew are securing what they can but theres still enough loose to shake the ship to pieces unless the storm dies down he led the way to where the sailors had erected a temporary cabin for domitia and her women valerius realized hed been so busy and so exhausted during the past few hours that hed forgotten the other passengers only now did he understand the agonies they had suffered as they lay here in the pitching bowels of the ship battered physically and mentally in a groaning waterlogged chamber that must have felt more tomb than sanctuary im not sure how much more of this they can take the young tribune said theyre being very brave but somehow theyd managed to light a small oil lamp and domitia held it aloft to identify the intruders all the patrician arrogance had vanished she was just a pale frightened face more child than woman in the flickering yellow glow of the flame her expensive cloak stained by the vomit that dribbled from the corner of her lip yet the dark eyes still contained a reservoir of pride and defiance as if domitia longina corbulo had vowed to go to her death undefeated by the elements she sat on a couch just clear of the stinking bilge waters the cloak encircling the slave girls who huddled at her side tulia lay with her head in her mistresss lap eyes closed and her face a deathly shade of green my lady i apologize for your discomfort but i domitia raised her head and his heart lurched as he saw how close to collapse she was it took her a second to recognize him and her voice was barely audible above the noise of the storm she managed a bloodless smile im sure you are doing everything you can tribune we understand that our fate lies with the gods now he shook his head the ship was built to withstand these conditions it will be unpleasant for a time but we will survive even as he said the words the gods were laughing at him she frowned i believe the water is rising faster than before the lady is right tiberius cried for a moment valerius was almost overwhelmed by the troubles which threatened to overwhelm him the womens situation among the darkness and the filth was unspeakable but on deck they would be exposed to the driving rain and the knifeedge of the gale he considered trying to create some sort of shelter but knew it would be torn to pieces within moments but what choice did he have now in the seconds he had taken to consider it the water had risen another inch serpentius appeared in the doorway with a question in his eyes the horses it would be a release but something stopped him from agreeing he shook his head weve no time tiberius get your men to carry tulia and the girls on deck serpentius help me with the lady domitia he reached out a hand but an almighty crack from the deck above froze everyone in position xi valerius was first to react get them out he raced for the hatch and looked up to see that the big linen sail had split and was now hanging in long streaming tatters that flapped and cracked like a slavers whip in the fierce wind the golden cygnet was now at the mercy of the waves which were already turning her side on to the storm if that happened it could only be a matter of time before the ship was battered into splinters a shout alerted him and he ran up the steps and across the lurching deck to where cronos and three other sailors wrestled with the great steering oars take my place the captain ordered our only chance is to get her stern on to the wind again valerius took the thick wooden shaft under his left arm and heaved with all his might as it kicked against his body a flash of lightning split the night sky and he saw a huge wave approaching the side and braced himself it broke over the deck in a foaming white surge just as tiberius emerged from the hatch with domitias freedwoman valerius shouted a warning that was lost on the wind and when he looked again the young tribune was clinging to a wooden stanchion as the wave receded around him tulia had vanished as if she had been plucked from the deck by the gods cronos reappeared with two lengths of thick rope and with shaking hands quickly fixed the steering oars in position gradually valerius felt the motion of the ship steady as the action of wind and water on the paddles brought her bow round so that her stern was to the waves once more he ran to where tiberius still floundered serpentius tiberius shook his head with a look of stunned bewilderment the hatch was a few paces away and valerius waited until the next wave that battered the stern broke across the deck before he dashed to open it serpentius stood unsteadily at the bottom of the ladder with blood masking his face and the women holding him upright he fell when the wave hit us domitias dress clung to her body beneath the cloak and she was shivering but her voice was calm i think he is only stunned the generals daughter ushered her girls up the ladder and serpentius groaned as valerius helped him follow when they emerged into the wind and rain they saw domitia and her slaves huddled in the lee of the ships stern where most of the crew had taken cover and joined them there cronos stood by the steering platform peering into the murk ahead what can we do valerius shouted pray the steersman mouthed food and water cronos laughed you really believe well survive long enough to be hungry better to be prepared the seaman nodded and put his mouth to valeriuss ear take julius hell show you where the spare water skins are stored fill them all dont worry about the food if we need it well find it valerius beckoned to the tall sailor who reluctantly struggled to his feet together they fought their way back to the hatch and into the hold where the water was now waist deep julius muttered to himself as they inched their way through the darkness but he never missed a step and steered valerius past trouble until they reached the butts the first they tried had been contaminated by seawater but the second was sweet if musty with age they filled twenty skins and took them to the deck where valerius stored them at cronoss feet and placed one of tiberiuss men to stand guard over them despite the loss of the sail the wind and the waves continued to drive the ship forward at astonishing speed more than once he feared the ship would pitch sideways and broach but the twin steering arms stabilized her course now we must endure and survive cronos said solemnly and reached up to touch the figure of poseidon the lookout in the bows must have been asleep or blinded by the spray because the first warning of disaster was the sound of the footthick oak mast snapping just as the ship crashed to an abrupt halt and twisted side on to the waves valerius was thrown helpless across the deck and smashed into the ships rail where he lay for a moment feeling strangely detached as cronos who must have been on the steering platform testing the oars was catapulted screaming over his head into the darkness in seconds the deck became a chaos of panicstricken wailing shapes who screamed all the louder when the next wave smashed into the ships exposed side the snapped mast saved them or perhaps poseidon approved of cronoss sacrifice it had fallen forward across the bow and was still attached to the ship by a tangle of ropes crossed by the spar that had held the sail the twentyfive feet of oak acted as a sea anchor and when the next wave struck instead of capsizing the golden cygnet it threw the stricken ship on its axis with the stern closest to a shore which was just visible as a faint fluorescent line of breaking surf four or five shiplengths away valerius serpentiuss shout was just audible above the screams and the smash of the waves he picked out the spaniard in the crush of people in the centre of the deck here he called a shadowy figure detached itself from the dark mass dragging a second smaller figure with him take your hands off me i will not go without my girls domitia struggled against serpentiuss wiry strength but he pulled her effortlessly to valeriuss side the slaves are with tiberius the spaniard said bracing himself against the rail as another big wave crashed sickeningly into the bow we need to get off the ship before the sea smashes it to pieces if that mast goes we could only have seconds valerius ran to the side and as a flash of lightning lit the far horizon his heart quailed at the rush of brown water churning past the hull the ships bottom appeared to be sitting on sand which gave him hope but the power of the waves would knock anyone who tried to escape that way off their feet and suck them under the stern showed more potential here the wave line was broken by the ships mass and there was a chance that at least some might escape with his knife valerius cut the ropes holding the steering oars and serpentius retied them so that they dropped over the rail into the area of relative shelter in the lee of the stern can you swim lady valerius demanded domitia shot him a startled look i was taught as a child then get ready she hesitated only for a moment it was clear that if she took to the water in her long stola of fine wool she would drown in seconds she dropped her cloak and began working at the ties of the dress the outer garment fell to the deck to reveal a short tunic of filmy material which in the rain clung to her body like a second skin her slight frame shook with the cold and valerius picked up the cloak to cover her taking her in his arms at the same time to provide her with the warmth of his own body he felt her start and thought she would break away but she only moved a little closer for a moment he was torn between a burning need to keep her safe and the greater responsibility he had to the surviving crew of the golden cygnet we dont have much time serpentiuss voice cut through his thoughts you go first ill lower the lady domitia down to you see there that line of white the beach will be just beyond make your way there and ill join you when i can serpentius disappeared over the stern when the spaniard shouted valerius led domitia to the rope youll be safe with serpentius there is no better man in a crisis my girls we will get them off next she gave a little nod of thanks and picked up the fallen dress before scrambling over the side it was such a female thing to do that it made him smile but his heart sank as her head disappeared below the waves he only breathed again when she surfaced and serpentius appeared at her side to support her through the heavy surf tiberius arrived at the stern with the two slave girls already stripped like their mistress a collective growl went up from the seamen crowding behind no slave is leaving this ship before me julius the tall lookout who had saved valerius on the galley with his timely axe stroke forced his way to the front of the crowd you can go tribune and your little fighting cock here but ill be next down that rope youll stay until these women are off the ship valerius stood between the sailor and the slave girls he knew any sign of weakness would trigger a mutiny if we maintain discipline and do our duty well all come out of this alive like fuck i will julius produced a long knife from his tunic and dashed forward valerius reached for his sword only to discover it had slipped from its scabbard when the ship struck he looked for something he could use as a weapon but julius was almost upon him a glittering dart flashed across the deck and julius stopped as if he had walked into a marble pillar with a terrible choking noise he collapsed to his knees and keeled over on his side without a word tiberius stepped forward and lifted the dying mans head to retrieve the knife that was buried to the hilt in his throat valerius went to stand at the young soldiers side your shipmate received the justice he deserved he shouted and anyone who thinks otherwise should say so now there will be no more mutinies prove that you are romans not pirates and nothing more will be said if we survive this we may be here for days so well need all the food and water we can gather the grumbling had been replaced by a sullen silence and valerius hesitated as another big wave pushed the ship further aground tiberius get the girls off now he placed himself between the crew and the stern but no one moved to stop the young officer i will be the last man off the ship but now i want you to collect up the water skins and anything else you can carry there was a moments hesitation before they moved off to gather water skins from where theyd scattered when the ship ran aground valerius heard a frightened whinny from the hold below and realized hed forgotten the horses he lifted the hatch and dropped into the surging waistdeep waters of the hold two of the beasts were down their eyes opaque in the gloom and their already bloated bodies floating among the swirling filth of the stall but a pair of frightened white discs told him the gelding still survived he drew his dagger and stepped closer to the big chestnut to place the point just behind his ear there was an odd moment of calm when he could feel the horses warmth and trust he steeled himself for the killing stroke but something made him hesitate quickly he ran to the hatch and somehow manoeuvred the hinged ramp into place the gelding shook violently as he was cut free and valerius spoke gently into his ear before covering his head with a blanket that hung by the side of the stall the big horse seemed to understand what was required of him and allowed himself to be led up to the deck a dropdown panel gave access to the gangplank when the ship was in harbour and valerius unhooked the bolts that held it in place there was still an eight foot plunge to the sea but the gelding would have to take his chances he slapped the horse on the rump and whipped the blanket from his head as the animal leapt over the side and vanished into the darkness by now the last of the crew were disappearing over the stern and his legs said he should join them instead he forced himself to fight the fear that threatened to overwhelm him as the ship rose and fell in the surf her keel crashing against the bottom with each hammer blow of a wave he searched from bow to stern shouting into the hatches as he ensured that no one was trapped or injured as he struggled towards the stern the last frayed rope securing the shattered mast to the golden cygnet finally parted no longer anchored the whole ship spun side on to the waves and canted over until the deck was almost vertical valerius made a frantic grab for a stanchion as he flew over the side rail into the angry sea where the surf picked him up and spun him like a falling leaf in an autumn storm there was no up or down just a rolling vortex of brown water that forced its way into his nose and mouth his face broke the surface and he sucked in a breath that was as much sea as it was air but in the same instant he was under again dragged along the bottom where shells and gravel tore at the bare skin of his arms and legs he tried to control his momentum but the power of the surf had him in its grip and gradually he began to weaken just when he thought he was finished a hand grabbed the neck of his tunic and hauled him clear of the water he found himself blinking into serpentiuss glaring face only a fool would sacrifice himself to save a horse the spaniard snarled since when did you become a fool domitia valerius choked out the name with a mouthful of sea water safe but she twisted her ankle when she dropped from the rope she wont be walking anywhere in a hurry they struggled along the beach to where the former occupants of the golden cygnet gathered in two distinct huddles whipped by the winddriven sand closest to the shore the dejected crew shivered where theyd crawled from the pounding surf further back tiberius and two of his surviving cavalrymen provided what shelter they could for the lady domitia and her two slaves the third german trooper lay nearby still alive but halfway to another world empty eyes staring into the rain and a purple dent four inches across in his forehead somehow tiberius had retained his cloak and the generals daughter had wrapped it around herself and the girls valerius spoke reassuringly to the crewmen and ordered them to gather the food and water and place it conspicuously between the two groups he knew better than to risk angering the sailors by seeming to monopolize the supplies so soon after the wreck better to wait to reimpose military discipline until their situation became clearer in the morning serpentius offered him a drink from one of the skins but he refused it cant be long until first light well issue a ration then but i want you to stay close and make sure no one else touches it he left the spaniard and walked across the soft sand to where domitia sat one of the slave girls was tying a bandage round her ankle i hope its not too painful my lady she looked up by some miracle the girls had managed to make her hair and clothing presentable it barely hurts at all tribune although it is a little swollen he smiled at the lie i must thank you for what you did she continued if we had stayed on the ship we would all have drowned i was wrong to delay you sometimes it is more prudent to retreat than to stand your ground but the decision is never easy especially for a soldier or a soldiers daughter she nodded at the compliment and in the pause that followed they could hear the sound of timbers shattering as the breakers continued to hammer the ship how long are we likely to be here it was a foolish question a little girls question and he experienced a moment of irritation already he felt crushed by the weight of expectation unless they were very fortunate he would soon have to take decisions that would mean the difference between life and death for every stranded survivor decisions founded on the most basic of knowledge he didnt know how well equipped he was to do that but whatever happened in the coming hours or days it was vital to keep their spirits up perhaps a few days he kept his voice confident we will know better in the morning we may have landed on the judaean coast but we have no real idea we were driven far south and i think even poor aurelius would have struggled to place us if we are there it is a fertile area and we should be within walking distance of some sort of settlement in the meantime please rest it could be a long day tomorrow and if we are not then we must endure and survive until help comes my lady sailors have many useful skills and we are fortunate to have resourceful men with us i do not fear for our future it was surprising how easily the lie came he knew there were things he had to do but first he called tiberius across you were right to kill the lookout thank you i was only doing my duty tribune no tiberius it was more than your duty and i want you to know i appreciate it if i can ever return the service of course sir perhaps you might commend me to general corbulo tiberius said seriously this posting is a great opportunity for me and i would not want to waste it by being sent to some obscure outpost in the mountains valerius fought the urge to laugh here they were stranded only the gods knew where with barely enough food and water to last a week and tiberius was concerned about his career i think the general will find a better use for a man with your qualities julius fool that he was called you a fighting cock and he was right you could be a great soldier some day i have served with great soldiers and i recognize their qualities in you the young man was clearly embarrassed and valerius regretted being so forthright he sounded like a foolish old veteran polishing his armour by the fire for his retirement parade he opened his mouth to apologize but tiberius suddenly grinned shyly and reached for his belt i found this lying on the deck he handed valerius a legionary gladius the one suetonius paulinus had presented to him in the aftermath of the british rebellion i did not think you would want to lose it valerius had thought he would never see the sword again and hed resigned himself to its loss but now he had it in his hand he felt its power running through him still he held the blade out hilt first to the younger man it was given to me for what the general believed was an act of great bravery perhaps you deserve it more tiberius looked down at the sword but his hand didnt move towards the blade even if i were to win the gold crown of valour it would not equal the honour you have already done me you ask me if you can do me a service he hesitated and shook his head you will think me less of a soldier no tiberius ask what you will tiberius took a deep breath i have never known a man i respect more than gaius valerius verrens hero of rome and i can think of nothing finer than to call him my friend valerius laughed out loud and felt the stares from the sailors down by the shoreline who could laugh at a time like this but if anything could raise his morale in these dire circumstances it was this competent agreeable young man a tribute to his class believing that his friendship meant something he held out his right hand and tiberius took the walnut fist in his of course it will make no difference to our military relationship tiberius stuttered he was interrupted by a familiar snicker and a substantial form plodded out of the wind and the darkness to nuzzle valeriuss hand valerius grinned at the younger man we needed a gift from the gods and they have delivered one he patted the geldings shoulder come tiberius we have plans to make xii theatre of pompey rome a storm was coming he could feel it in the tension in the air and the oppressive heat that lay like a dirty blanket over the city and he prayed that rain would not spoil the entertainment all around him was a cacophony of noise how they roared the common people and how quickly they forgot afranius had written the fire as a tragedy but an emperor could not be confined by mere convention and he nero in his wisdom had reconfigured the play as a comedy of all the theatres in rome only that of pompey the great had a stage large enough to contain it capable of seating twenty thousand people the vast semicircular auditorium was filled to capacity with the front six rows packed with evilsmelling plebeians of the lowest rank lured by free entry and the promise of rich pickings for this was a play like no other he loved the theatre because it allowed him to escape for a few hours from the increasing cares of state sometimes alone in his great palaces he had the feeling that the walls were closing in on him he had lived with the scent of fear his entire life first his own the unloved child in a house full of enemies then the infinitely more preferable scent of other peoples fear as his power and yes he would not deny it his malevolence grew other mens fear gave him an almost godlike sense of omnipotence that he normally only felt on the stage or on the podium so why was it so different when he smelled the fear on tigellinus because tigellinus of all people had no reason to be frightened of him if tigellinus was frightened it meant that tigellinus felt vulnerable even threatened if tigellinus felt threatened it was because he believed his position was weak and if tigellinus was weak where did that leave the emperor who depended on him it was a question he would never ask the man standing next to him for fear of the answer he would receive he took a deep breath to still his growing panic and thrust the melancholy thought aside from his favoured place by the proscaenium wall he was able to look up to where the statues of the mere mortals who had dominated this very stage aesopus the tragedian and roscius who had made laughter into an art form stared blankly from their niches out towards the great pillared temple where venus victrix ruled surely they would have appreciated the genius of his production the fullsized fivestorey house a replica of the ubiquitous insula apartment blocks that lined romes streets was blazing cheerfully now each room visible to the audience because it had been built without a facade to ensure an uninterrupted view inside the professional actors were doing their bumbling best to ensure that the conflagration would be terminal it was almost time help help cried the actor playing the brothel owner help us save what we can the signal triggered a crazed rush from the front ranks of the audience as hundreds of excited plebs heeded the call when they reached the wooden structure the most fearful hesitated quelled by the searing heat of the inferno the fire had been skilfully set so that there was only one way into the building a narrow passage which was alternately filled with flame and clear each floor of the block was strewn with treasures which rose in value with succeeding storeys the lower floors contained furniture ornate tables chests full of who knew what valuables and sacks of grain the sale of which would keep a family in plenty for a month and more on the fourth floor a table had been set for a banquet with fine silverware that would provide a man with the wherewithal to buy a small farm tethered beside the table the comely talented and equally valuable slave girl who had played the prostitute was now screaming frantically in a manner that might convince you she actually feared for her life but it was the top floor the fifth which had drawn these people the dregs of rome the debtors and the dispossessed to the theatre of pompey the man who found his way through the flames to the top floor if he returned at all would return rich thanks to the chest that had been hidden there by the girl and contained vessels of gold glittering jewels and enough golden aurei to set someone up in style for the rest of their life see how they cower tigellinus burdened by the lack of courage ingrained in their breeding the praetorian nodded gravely and tried to look interested this was the fifth time he had seen the fire and he knew that only by taking immediate advantage would any of the men have the chance to reach the top floor before it was consumed he who hesitates loses all caesar he agreed in a bored voice one man a tall darkhaired fellow braver than the rest broke the spell timing his run to coincide with a gap in the flames his courage inspired or shamed another and then four or five as one they rushed for the stairs ignoring the inferior treasures on the ground floor which would be secured by those less brave but the stairway was only wide enough for one man the darkhaired pleb made it first with a stocky peasant a thief by trade with ugly misshapen features and a missing eye hard on his heels the others jammed the narrow space and fought for progress kicking and punching until one pulled a dagger and kept his snarling fellows at bay long enough to dart upwards the house was of particularly cunning manufacture the builders had used hard and soft woods and designed damp and dry areas so it burned in a particular way this left the upper floors clear of fire but difficult to access while those below burned quickly but still left enough of a way out for a man making his way to the top to believe he had a chance of escape already flames were consuming the third floor and those who risked their lives to reach that level had to dash through the narrowest of gaps to reach the next stair the tall man and the oneeyed thief both made it through but the man with the knife took one look and retreated one of his companions darted past and made a grab for a pot overflowing with bronze coin only to drop shrieking through a gap in the floor and into the maw of the flames on the level below a roar of applause and guffaws of raucous laughter from twenty thousand throats accompanied his demise by now the first man had reached the silver level he was clearly the crowds favourite and they cheered him on screaming at him to go for the gold the slave girl her stola already smoking in the intense heat howled at him for help but her voice was almost drowned out by the jeers of the audience remarkably he hesitated it was only for the merest fraction of a second but long enough for the thief to smash him aside and send him sprawling still he recovered quickly without another glance at the girl he bounded for the stairs taking them two at a time only to be met at the top by a flying boot that took him clean in the face he tumbled down the stairs and lay motionless at the foot the crowd howled in outrage but the thief put the chest to his shoulder and charged downstairs leaping over the prone figure who clawed weakly at his legs time was running out every floor but the uppermost pair was a mass of flame and it was clear these would soon be enveloped only the stairs provided a tantalizing narrow and fast closing avenue of escape the tall man rose groggily to his feet and the crowd could sense the calculations running through his mind he hadnt risked everything to leave emptyhanded and his eyes flickered between the silver and the girl they screamed at him to take the silver but he could see it was impossible to carry it all the girl was as valuable perhaps more so as anything he could take in his hands he ran across floorboards glowing with heat untied her hands and feet and pulled her upright at first she didnt understand what was happening but gradually a smile crossed her face she said something to the tall man no one would ever hear and gave him a hefty push that sent him staggering backwards until his feet met air and he plummeted through the flames of the lower floors to land with a sickening crack on the flagstones four storeys below as the crowd roared the girl grabbed what she could from the table and ran for the stairs two floors below the oneeyed thief exulted in the knowledge that he was a rich man clutching the casket to his chest he groped his way through the smoke to where the stairs to the ground floor smouldered as he reached them a faceless figure with the blackened remains of singed tunic protecting his face rose up and stabbed him deep in the guts the thief screamed at the whitehot agony in his vitals and watched helplessly as the knife man prised the chest from his unprotesting fingers and disappeared from view he tried to move but his legs wouldnt work the pain in his insides was like nothing he had ever experienced but when the flames reached out for him it paled into insignificance and his dying shrieks goaded the crowd to ever greater rapture as the peasant burned the knife man was making for safety through the flames of the ground floor and was already mentally spending his money when his foot hit some hidden pressure point before he could even scream a jet of burning liquid erupted between his feet and made him one with the inferno that surrounded him now the only living thing in the burning building was the slave girl when she reached the first floor she could tell the location of the stairs by the blue flame that consumed the thiefs fat she knew there was no escape by that route but she had lived by her wits for half her life and now it stood her in good stead still holding her loot she ran directly into the flames and leapt through what had been the open front of the room it was only a single storey but when she landed she felt her ankle snap and she realized her hair was on fire her only consolation was the cheers of the crowd and the silver scattered around her as she lay exhausted the applause grew louder and she looked up into the face of the emperor nero claudius caesar germanicus who regarded her with a benevolent smile get rid of her tigellinus shes no good to anyone now he turned away to accept the justified acclaim of the mob had there ever been a better entertainment just then the storm broke and great droplets of rain hammered down on the dry stones and hissed among the burning timbers he looked up to the heavens and allowed the cool water to pour over his face it was a sign he was still the favourite of the gods xiii when valerius opened his eyes the storm might never have happened after a night shivering in the open he luxuriated in the warmth of the first gentle rays of the dawn but instinct told him he would be cursing the sun by the days end it rose in the east as always creating a golden corridor across the darkened sands but east was not where he expected it to be it should have been behind him as he faced the sea instead it was directly to his right as he watched the sands glowed first a fiery orange red before mellowing to a deep pink and he gradually became aware of his surroundings the dangerous beauty of it assaulted his senses and the terrible reality turned his viscera to liquid ice the two small groups of survivors were the only living things on a flat sandy beach that ran as far as the eye could see to east and west worse when he looked inland the landscape consisted of fold after fold of rolling dunes stretching far into the distance not a tree or a blade of grass no hint of water or habitation not even a scrap of cover he tried to recall the details of the maps he had studied of the eastern mare nostrum unless the contours of the coastline were deceiving him it seemed clear they had been driven much further south than any of them had anticipated not to the shores of judaea but to egypt and not to the fertile area of egypt which flanked the nile delta but a much more forbidding shore a sixtyor seventymile strip of deserted barren coastline where even the nomads of the interior were reluctant to venture only when he turned back to the sea did he find any reason to hope the golden cygnet or at least part of her gilded hull had somehow survived thanks to her solid construction it rocked placidly in the waves of a wide shallow bay battered but more or less intact a hundred paces from the shore exhaustion weighed him down but he knew he had to stir himself already he could feel the strength of the sun growing they needed to act or die he called to serpentius to issue a ration of water two precious mouthfuls for every man and woman and while it was handed out he gave his orders twelve crewmen survived from a complement of twenty two of them with broken bones and another who was coughing blood and probably wouldnt last the day he tried not to give thanks for the five extra mouths who had perished in the surf as they escaped the shipwreck but he knew their deaths and those of aurelius capito cronos and julius might mean the difference between death and survival for the rest he called the sailors together but kept tiberiuss guards aside in a separate group we need to strip the ship of everything worthwhile his voice sounded hoarse from two days of shouting against the wind the first priority is water of which there may be more even if it is slightly tainted but we must also have shelter or the sun will roast us alive he pointed to four of the men you will concentrate on shelter if it has survived bring the covered awning that was on the deck for the women there must be a spare sail bring that also and rope the others he tasked to scour the ship for water food and any timber or tools that might be useful why tools if were here long enough to build something well already be dead valerius tried to keep the irritation out of his voice why must they waste precious time because with tools we can make fish hooks and spears youve all speared flatfish the sandy bottom is perfect for them we can eat the flesh and drink the blood if we move from here we can use the tools to fashion litters for the injured and to carry the food and water aye blood moaned another flatfish isnt the only thing in these waters theres sharks as well ive seen them long as a steering oar and with a mouthful of teeth that can tear a mans arm off begging your pardon sir valerius laughed with the rest and tossed the man his knife when it comes for you kill it and well have it for dinner now get on with it before the sun broils our brains when they set off fearfully through the shallow seas he had never met a sailor who was happy in water he summoned the two fit cavalrymen do it carefully he told the senior of the two men a batavian named civilis and without making it noticeable but i want every weapon on that ship brought to me every spear and sword tiberius had stood silent as valerius gave the orders and now he nodded his approval we keep the weapons the food and the water under our control and build two separate shelters far enough apart to give the lady domitia privacy he studied valerius seriously you realize that some of them saw her in her shift and liked what they saw i have seen them looking at her they are hungry and not just for food why do you think i made certain the weapons will be in our hands not theirs they are decent enough by their own lights but when a man thinks hes going to die he will resort to desperate measures to get what another man is keeping from him the second shelter will be split by a curtain to give the generals daughter a space of her own but allow one of us to always be with her tiberius bowed i will guard her with my life valerius shook his head i have another task for you tiberius they walked to where serpentius sat casually by the spot where theyd buried the pile of water skins to keep them out of the sun the spaniard was feeding the gelding with a mouthful of oats he had found among the foodstuffs theyd managed to rescue the horse tiberius had lost in the wreck had been one of the finest animals valerius had ever seen and he guessed that the young tribune was more at home in the saddle than any of them i want you to ride for help tiberius gave a little whistle he looked up at the sun and then took in the scorched barren landscape all around them he knew he was being asked to commit suicide of course tribune he produced a grave smile as he agreed to ride to almost certain death serpentius how many water skins the spaniard shrugged twenty at the last count but maybe theyll find more in the ship valerius drew a curve in the sand if im right here is judaea to the northeast to the west egypt proper where most of the settlements will be clustered along the valley of the nile sixty miles between them which puts the wreck somewhere around here he pointed to a patch of sand in the centre of the curve between the two areas hed circled so east or west tiberius studied the impromptu map frowning as he concentrated on the scrawls in the sand east or west he repeated thirty miles two days in the saddle if i rest at night thirty miles at most if we choose correctly but there is no guarantee that we are in the geographical centre so anything up to forty or fifty if we dont valerius nodded they both knew that if they chose wrongly they were probably all dead well split the water and pour as much into the horse as hell take you can carry whats left of your half with you tiberius shook his head that only leaves ten water skins among twenty he pointed out two pints to a person even if i reach help on the third day it will take us another two to get back here youll never survive on two pints of water a man in this heat serpentius snorted and the two men looked at him i know its a terrible plan valerius said but if you can think of anything better ill be happy to hear it he waited but it seemed no one could in this heat ride through the night when its coolest youll save the horse and save on water i say go west theres a rebellion in judaea and when theres blood in the gutter people dont take kindly to strangers even if you do reach a settlement theres a good chance theyll cut your throat just for being roman yes tiberius said slowly i agree west if i keep the sea always to my right and follow the beach i could make good time valerius nodded his approval relieved that the decision had been taken it was only later that the awful twisting in the guts of not knowing whether it had been the right one would come but this was no time for doubt he clapped the young man on the shoulder then lets get it done he said decisively you can make ten or fifteen miles then hole up in the nearest shade if you can find any until nightfall i want you out of here before the crew returns from stripping the ship if they find out we only have half the water they think we have ill have another mutiny on my hands serpentius was already digging for the water skins and tiberius took the horse aside to check his gait and hooves valerius knew by the way he vaulted on to the animals back that he had made the right choice does he have a name tiberius asked hes a soldiers horse he doesnt need one then ill call him hercules tiberius grinned we need a hero while they were waiting for the water domitia hobbled up with her arm round suki the african slave girl valerius explained tiberiuss mission i pray for fortunas good wishes and may you travel with the speed of mercury domitia said and valerius could have sworn tiberius glowed in the light of her favour i will not let you down lady he assured her with a shy smile while serpentius watered hercules valerius gave the younger man some last advice take it gently at first get used to each other when night comes make the best speed you can but dont push too hard dont kill yourself but more important dont kill the horse i want him back tiberius smiled at the poor jest and mounted hercules with the water skins draped around him before he rode off he leaned from the saddle and took valeriuss wooden fist in his hand i promise i will not fail you my friend valerius turned to find domitia staring at him for a moment he was lost in the dark eyes before he remembered that she was the generals daughter it was the first time in days hed thought about his original mission paulinuss appearance at the villa seemed a long time ago domitias fathers guilt or innocence insignificant even the thought of the threat to olivia produced nothing more than a dull ache these things were beyond his control now they could be left to the fates his immediate priority was to keep domitia longina corbulo alive at least until everyone else was dead he hoped it wouldnt come to that but you couldnt drink hope he picked up one of the water skins it would deprive someone of their share in thirtysix hours or fortyeight but it might mean she lived for the last hour it took for help to arrive and that made it right he held out the skin she licked her lips but shook her head i will drink when everyone else does valerius resisted the temptation to insist clearly keeping her alive was going to be more difficult than he had anticipated the first sailors returned carrying pieces of the curtained awning and it was the work of a few minutes to erect a tent on the sand domitia and her girls retired gratefully away from the worst glare of the sun he noticed that the sailors were very keen to return to the ship and also that those he had sent to fetch water still hadnt returned that made him wonder and the suspicion prompted him to order serpentius to disinter two of the water skins from the pit and conceal them somewhere else perhaps he was wrong to put so little faith in the mens honesty but he doubted it the spaniard laughed and valerius realized hed already taken the precaution of laying one or two aside the bulk of the men returned thirty minutes later suspiciously cheerful and a few of them carrying water skins that they dumped in the sand at valeriuss feet still not enough for five days but an improvement the haul of other goods was better than he had expected including a flint and iron from aureliuss belongings that would allow them to start a fire if they could find something to fuel it there were sacks of damp wheatmeal that would only be a little saltier than normal when they turned it into porridge and sufficient board and sailcloth to make a second shelter and provide a substantial enough partition for domitias pavilion to make it respectable for her guards to sleep there he waited until they had all returned and tiberiuss german cavalrymen had deposited their clanking sacks with serpentius before he gathered the sailors in an untidy mismatched rank to thank them for their efforts a few just stared at him but enough of them were hiding grins and shuffling their feet to make him sure he was right he smiled at them im only going to ask you once so lets be certain youve returned with a fine haul i can see that but im wondering to myself if you had enough time to make a proper job of searching the golden cygnet he looked along the line meeting the eyes of each man in turn in the legions if a man failed in his duty lets say by not quite finding all the water on the ship then it would be up to his tent mates his contubernium to punish him he saw them looking at him uncertainly as if they werent sure he was serious so if i were to send serpentius here out to the ship and he were to find more water it would mean youd have to choose one of your own he paused and now they were looking at one another and id have to watch eight of you beating him to death with those wooden staves youve so kindly brought back someone muttered defiantly but by now valerius knew the german guard was at his back and most were staring at him with fear in their eyes they werent soldiers but sailors rough men who liked to fight and if someone died too bad but they werent professional killers valerius was so he said im going to give you another chance to get back out to that ship and bring back every drop of fresh water they waited until he nodded and almost knocked each other over in the rush to reach what remained of the golden cygnet do you think i can trust them now he asked serpentius the spaniard shrugged id always trust a terrified man before one who tells me hes honest valerius went back to the makeshift pavilion and met domitia in the doorway he bowed and waited for her to move either forward or back but she stood there studying him seriously would you have done it there was curiosity in her voice but no hint of reproach without discipline there is only chaos and death im aware of that tribune but i ask you again would you have ordered those men to kill one of their own he hesitated truth or lie an officer should only ever give an order when he knows it will be obeyed he said you will not find that in any military manual but it is the unwritten code even with serpentius at my back i doubt i could have forced them to kill their comrade then they would have won without discipline there is only chaos and death she quoted the words back at him without irony youre right valerius conceded i could not let them win because then we would all die so what would you have done i would have chosen one of them myself and i would have cut his throat she tilted her head to look up at him and he became conscious of the intriguing shadows deep in her eyes you remind me of my father xiv valerius could feel their discontent it simmered in the broiling sun like a gently boiling pot but it was still only midmorning on the third day and by the time the sun reached its high point the pot would be ready to boil over the sailors lay beneath their inadequate shelter like haphazard lumps of black rock valerius sat in the paltry shade of domitias pavilion twenty paces away listening to the stricken cavalrymans harsh uneven breathing and waiting for him to die the other mortally injured man had died during the night and lay wrapped in a sailcloth shroud at the top of the beach but no one was going to dig two graves when one would do it was incredible how a mans strength could ebb away in such a short time he heard a hacking cough he knew what they were thinking because it was driving him mad too about water clean pure cool water not stinking bloodhot dregs thick with the saliva of ten other men who had already drunk from the same skin he had rationed them to a tiny amount each four times a day knowing even that would deplete their dwindling supply too quickly two swallows but he had discovered that two swallows was only enough to keep a man on the brink of death not alive in this sweltering furnace of a place that leached the fluid from the body like wine from a fractured amphora thirst was the enemy thirst was tightskinned pinched faces and narrow redrimmed eyes filled with hate thirst was when your tongue cleaved to the roof of your mouth and your throat felt as if it was scoured with pebbles thirst was cracked and bleeding lips so painful you wanted to cut them away with a knife and a head that felt as if your skull was being ripped off thirst was always wanting to piss but never being able to thirst was the agony of knowing the next two swallows were four hours away but they would only increase the torment until the next pointless sip of taunting nectar two swallows teased but didnt satisfy it lubricated cracked lips but barely reached the throat a momentary glimpse of paradise snatched away before it could be savoured like the glorious turquoise sea that lapped at the shore and formed small pools in the sand so cool and clear and wet but so deadly liquid that tempted and tormented but could never be drunk because it would multiply a mans thirst ten times and push him beyond the edge of sanity he suspected that more than one of the crew had already succumbed to the lure and as if the gods wished to confirm his suspicion a man staggered to his feet among the sailors and stepped into the fierce light of the sun valerius recognized him as one of the steersmen a man whose skill had saved all their lives in the encounter with the pirates the seaman croaked something unintelligible from a thirstscarified throat and wandered aimlessly between the two groups repeating the word over and over his face and hands raised to the merciless sun before falling to his knees and digging frantically in the sand the sailors knew valerius had ordered the goatskins to be buried but not where now the suncrazed steersman scraped and dug ever more desperately until he gave what might have been a howl of triumph and heads rose sharply among his shipmates valerius wondered what hed found it certainly wasnt water which was safe on the far side of the pavilion from the seamen a second later the sailor dipped his hands into the hole and raised them to his lips valerius gagged as he realized what was happening the demented sailors cupped hands were filled not with water but with sand and he poured it into his mouth repeating the gesture again and again until with a choked groan he collapsed on his face and lay still someone appeared in the doorway beside him he knew it was domitia before he stood up because she smelled different from everyone else after dark she bathed in the cool waters of the bay resisting the temptation to drink that would have destroyed valerius and it gave her a salty wholesome scent still she suffered as much as anyone in the heat and her face and eyes were puffy and distended as she swayed on her feet is he dead the words were slurred by her swollen tongue and saliva as thick as mud yes good he nodded one less mouth to drain their precious supply the trooper too valerius noticed for the first time that ferox the injured cavalryman was silent at last well bury them after dark she nodded and the movement seemed to use up the last of her strength because she would have fallen if valerius hadnt caught her she slumped in his arms slim and soft the curves of her body nestling against him something exploded in his head and he was filled with a terrible need he crushed his face into her dark hair inhaling a honeysuckle scent that acted like an elixir she felt it too because she squirmed against him and her head came up and he felt cracked lips against his her cloak dropped away and he could feel her skin through the soft material of her shift they held each other like that for a few moments before he realized what he was doing this was madness he was as crazed as the poor fool lying in the sand not five paces away had been no he tried to draw away but her arms held him close and his body wouldnt obey him anyway please her eyes opened and he saw tiny damp buds in the corners that might have been tears he shook his head and pulled away the emotions surged across her ravaged face like storm clouds over a field of wheat desolation and heartache pain and rejection and finally fury she stepped back and he wondered if she was going to hit him and what he would do if she did coward she hissed and turned and staggered away through the curtain that separated the two sides of the tent he closed his eyes and shook his head he had been awarded the gold crown of valour for defying fifty thousand of boudiccas bloodcrazed warriors yet he had failed every woman he had ever loved when he opened them again serpentius was standing watching him if tiberius doesnt get back soon were finished maybe we already are its time valerius nodded get the water two and a half water skins a day theyd started with fifteen by tonight they would have five left plus anything serpentius had kept in reserve three days at most if he cut the ration but it was barely enough to keep them alive now where was tiberius it had all seemed so simple keep the sea to your right ride during the night and try to find some precious shade during the heat of the day keep going until you win or you die for tiberius claudius crescens it was the ideal mission the kind of mission with no complications and no regrets win or die but he hadnt reckoned on being killed by his own stupidity the landscape he had ridden through was as forbidding as it was intimidatingly beautiful a landscape that could destroy you just by its very existence ahead the neverending surfwashed line of the beach flat as the freshly brushed surface of the circus maximus on a race day to his right the broad expanse of the ocean a marker no more than that to his left inland a treacherous dustbowl and salt flats which turned quickly into an anonymous sea of rolling sand dunes tiberius recognized without any sense of inadequacy that he was a man of little imagination it was after all a desirable quality in the type of soldier he had chosen to be but the thought of becoming lost in that great sandy waste made him feel like an ant on a roasting plate a tiny insignificant creature whose fate was beyond its power to change yet none of it was as great a threat as the challenge which faced him now someone more romantic might have said he appeared to be standing in the centre of a gigantic silver plate of the kind that graced a senators banqueting table on three sides moonlight glittered across waters as unruffled as the flat sand he had ridden over always keeping the sea to his right since he had left valerius three days earlier he was so close he knew he was close because he could see the flickering pinprick of light that identified a home in some egyptian settlement and smell the smoke of a dung fire in the still air he looked over his shoulder the first pale ochre hint of dawn was a ghostly betrayal on the eastern horizon an hour at most hercules whinnied behind him and nuzzled his back he had two more leather water skins left of the original was it six and of the four that had been drunk the horse had consumed three he put a skin to the geldings mouth and held it there until it was empty his mistake had been not to take a path a little further inland he realized that now too late by staying close to the shore he hadnt noticed when he strayed from the beach on to the milewide spit of sand that had finally narrowed to this thin streak which ended at a channel a few hundred paces wide but the gods only knew how deep how far had he come ten miles twenty he had been riding all night it was impossible to tell he had no choice turning the horse the way theyd come he kicked him into a trot then a canter and finally a full gallop speed was his only hope in the moonlight the evidence of his pride and his arrogance was clear in the single line of hoofprints that vanished into the distance he had no choice he had to make as much ground as he could before daylight his mind cleared he felt no fear it was all simple again he would die today or tomorrow but he would die trying the big horse carried him uncomplainingly mile after mile hour after hour through the dark and into the dawn but daylight mocked him with a flat expanse of blue lagoon to his right and no end in sight he had no choice the geldings sweat soaked his legs and he could already feel the sun roasting his neck soon it would be so hot it would be like breathing the flames of a furnace he dug his heels into the horses ribs and urged him on harder hercules had a huge heart but even huge hearts have a breaking point tiberius felt a surge of hope when he realized the lagoon was finally petering out but only for a moment seconds later the gelding collapsed under him as if hed been shot in the chest by a ballista bolt tiberius hit the ground shoulder first and rolled to a halt in a cloud of sand by the time hed rubbed the grit from his eyes hercules was bravely trying to get back to his feet but the power had gone from his legs pink foam frothed from the horses nostrils and mouth and sprayed across the sand as he shook his great head in frustration as tiberius watched the animals struggles grew weaker and he rolled on to his side his gleaming flanks heaving and slick with sweat to the young tribune the gelding was nothing more than a mode of transport to be used and discarded and his father would have said eaten if necessary he knew horses admired their strength and stamina but he felt no affection for them still he respected courage and he placed a hand on the geldings forehead and smiled into the trusting eye as he killed hercules with a single thrust of his sword behind the right ear there was no time to rest he stood up and felt the suns heat boring through his dark hair a few minutes and it would boil his brains and render him senseless he removed his tunic and fashioned a covering for his head and shoulders with a last reproachful glance at the sand spit that had killed him he allowed himself a single sip from the final water skin and set off westwards at first it was merely a trial the furnace temperatures made it difficult to breathe and he could feel the skin on his arms melting but he made reasonable progress very soon it became a torment the relentless heat seemed to suck the strength from his legs the sand shifted beneath his feet and he found himself fighting for every step his mouth and nose might as well have been filled with sand grit scraped his eyeballs and his vision blurred making it difficult to keep his course water he must have water but tiberius knew that when the water skin was empty he was finished so he denied himself until he could endure no longer then denied himself again what seemed like a mile later he scrabbled for the water skin and gulped down a single mouthful though it took all his resolve not to drink more he risked a look back the way hed come and let out a tormented groan a few hundred paces away the dark bulk of hercules lay in the sand he had been walking for what seemed like hours and he had travelled only a quarter of a mile a lesser man might have fallen on his sword in despair but tiberius claudius crescens was no lesser man his brutal upbringing had had but a single purpose to make him hard hard as the iron that forged his sword hard as the stones he had carried to build his strength his father had taught him to hate and to endure he slung the water skin over his shoulder by its leather strap and began walking again the makeshift hood suffocated him but when he removed it the superheated air burned his face and throat and the sun seared his scalp like a fish on a griddle the heat played tricks with his mind at one point he marched at the centre of a full cohort of legionaries fully equipped with sword shield and spear their helmets glistening and their centurions calling out the marching beat every one carried a full water skin that sloshed and gurgled with each step he took but the moment tiberius turned to ask for a drink the whole unit vanished a mile later his father rode past on a pale horse even though he was long dead but when tiberius picked up his pace to ask the questions hed always wanted to ask the horse turned into a dog and ran into the desert he would have kept the sea to his right but the sea was long gone that told him he was lost but it didnt matter because when he saw his tracks he realized he had been walking in circles when he saw the city moving towards him he started laughing through his delirium he knew that it was just another joke the gods were playing on him he only felt threatened when he saw the armoured giants they shimmered across the flat plain growing larger with every step and walking three feet above the ground well he would fight them he drew his sword and it felt good in his hand but the reality was that hed thrown the sword away with his empty water skin twenty minutes earlier when a hand touched his shoulder he believed he was fighting for his life he would have killed anyone who said he was pleading for it xv he is not coming back we all die if we stay here the sailors spokesman susco the nubian sailmaster was a big man but heat and thirst had shrivelled him like a piece of animal hide in a fire his words emerged as a choked belligerent challenge from a throat dry as dust behind him his shipmates stood in a tattered swaying line redrimmed eyes squinting from faces blackened by the sun valerius noted that they had waited until the water had been distributed to make their challenge it had given them renewed strength and fuelled their determination we should go tonight when the sun sets susco continued east if the tribune could not reach help in the west on a horse we must go east valerius nodded not in agreement but because he understood the logic of desperation susco mistook it for approval we will take all the water and travel light we can make sixteen miles before dawn aye a ragged growl of approval from the sailors no the nubian shook his head you are outvoted tribune and outnumbered valerius laughed at his naivety do you think you are in the senate susco do you believe that what you say carries some sort of authority then you are mistaken there is no vote i command here and as long as i command we stay it is you who are mistaken susco growled there are no patricians and no plebs here just desperate men looking for a chance of life and their fair share of what they are entitled to if you want to stay well take whats ours and go susco took a step forward his fists bunched and there was a growl as the men moved with him towards the tent valerius felt serpentius moving in behind him but he made a calming motion with his left hand this could still be settled without violence and what about them valerius pointed to the two injured sailors lying in the shade of the makeshift awning will they get their fair share too susco shrugged they would die soon enough and had not been part of his plan but he knew his supporters would never abandon their shipmates well carry them then you wont make sixteen miles more like six and what will you find exactly the same as you have here more sand more rocks and more sea only you wont have shelter and your water will run out by noon and youll be dead by nightfall valerius sensed confusion in the men behind susco the sailmaster had convinced them that anything was better than the hell they were suffering here but if valerius could persuade them they would be better off together they still had a chance and what if you do leave at nightfall and tiberius is just five miles down the beach with help those who stay will be drinking sweet water and on their way back to civilization while you are dying by inches in the sand susco glanced to his shipmates for support but one glance told him hed lost them his shoulders slumped and valerius sighed with relief we a roman officer does not negotiate with scum tribune domitias imperious voice rasped through the silence like a saw blade and valerius saw the men stiffen he turned she was standing just outside her tent tall and straight as a legionary centurion her small breasts rising and falling beneath the thin shift she glared at the sailors eyes filled with contempt and the utter conviction of a lineage that gave her dominion over men like these mutineers and deserters deserve no water and they will have none get back to your places or i will have you cut down by my guards my father will hear of this when we reach antioch the punishment for mutiny is death and you can be sure i will urge him to show no mercy the big sailor stared at domitia we wont take orders from a girl and we wont be treated like dogs he said well have the water now and well butcher you to get it if we have to when susco spoke there was a catch in his voice that betrayed his intentions and valerius knew in that moment that he would have to kill him with a growl the crew moved towards the tent and he felt the familiar glow of coming battle flare inside him he drew his sword and heard the distinctive hiss of another blade being unsheathed as serpentius stepped to his side are you willing to die for it susco or you or you valerius was smiling now the savage smile of a born killer a victors snarling mask to the men facing him he seemed to grow a warrior god come to earth the scarred face offering only one thing death a water skin is no good to a man with a cut throat or a hole in his guts get back to where you belong well issue the next ration at first light and tiberius will be back before noon obey my order and there will be no executions obey and we will all get out of this alive you have my word on it they backed away unwillingly but they went he knew they would return when they were a safe distance away he turned to domitia her eyes had lost none of their certainty i expected more of you tribune she snapped your duty is to protect me he took her by the arm and pulled her back to the tent she made no attempt to break away my duty is to get as many people out of this alive as i can lady and you have just made that more difficult in fact i think you may have killed us all she looked at him and he wondered if it was contempt in her eyes only later did he realize it was pity perhaps you are not like my father after all he left her and went to where serpentius was sharpening his long sword theyll be back the spaniard said and we should be ready for them valerius nodded absently i made a mistake i should have killed susco better that way serpentius spat dryly they only had a few sailors knives it would have been like killing rabbits might be different later four trained soldiers against a rabble of sailors armed with a few sticks maybe not just a few sticks and more likely two than four what do you mean serpentiuss eyes flickered towards the tent you were too busy to notice when the generals daughter was trying to get us killed you were watching the sailors i had my eye on our german mates theyd already pulled their swords when you went for yours and the only reason they didnt kill you was because i was watching them as darkness fell domitia trooped down to the beach with her servant girls to wash in the waves as had become her custom the two slaves held up a length of curtain to allow her privacy but valerius noticed something he should have seen before the way they were followed by the hungry eyes of the stranded sailors and more hungrily still by the two german cavalrymen who sat together on the far side of the tent he cursed himself for a fool he had been concentrating on keeping them alive when he should have been aware of the currents flowing between the two groups and between domitia and her guards of course men forced into close proximity with three young women for weeks on end would be affected he had discovered in colonia that imminent death was more likely to heighten lust than to suppress it but was serpentius overreacting he approached civilis the senior of the two guards and arranged that he should take the first watch the german nodded grimly and saluted if they come we will be ready for them he assured valerius but when domitia returned from her bathing his eyes never left the generals daughter valerius slept fitfully tormented by dreams of lakes and rivers and bubbling streams it could only have been an hour before he felt a looming human presence and realized serpentius had come to wake him for his watch but when he opened his eyes the first thing that drew his attention was the faint unmistakable gleam of edged metal the second was that the figure leaning over him was much bulkier than the whipthin spaniard his left hand groped for his sword but his mind told him he was already dead without warning his assassin stiffened and gave an agonized groan as six inches of pointed iron emerged from the centre of his body a point that violently twisted making the man jerk and shudder as his vitals were torn by the long doubleedged blade the groan becoming a scream that was instantly muffled by a leathery hand the iron point disappeared and the body slumped forward when the hand was removed valeriuss face and chest were drenched in a rush of warm liquid that fountained from the gaping mouth bastard he spat and wiped civiliss blood from his mouth and eyes did you have to make such a mess theyre coming serpentius ignored his masters complaint the other guard has gone to join them i think hes taken the weapons but i thought id keep an eye on this one as valerius strapped on his sword the curtain that split his sleeping area from that of domitia and her women twitched and a wideeyed brown face appeared when suki saw the goredrenched figure with the sword she opened her mouth to scream but serpentius clamped his hand over her mouth and shushed her a moment later domitia pulled back the curtain and gaped as she recognized valerius behind the bloody mask if it comes to it you might be advised to use this he tossed her the dagger at his belt and she caught it deftly studying it in her hand her chin came up and her eyes were steady only to kill those who come to take what is only mine to give she said and he believed her serpentius disappeared from the tent and with a last glance at domitia valerius followed him was it a rustle of feet through sand or the gentle swish of surf on shore they were only just in time movement a lighter darkness against the true night and less than ten paces away shadowy silhouettes moved across the beach but their stealth was illusory when faced with a hunter of the night a sharp scream rent the air as serpentius the veteran gladiator found his first victim valerius remained where he was between the attackers and the tent in another fight the two men would have stayed together each covering the others back but this was no time for elaborate tactics serpentius was like a fox among chickens moving silently through them his long sword seeking out his next prey a clash of iron on iron confirmed that the mutineers had been given weapons but that would not save them the darkness was serpentiuss element his speed their doom a second man shrieked then a third and now the rest nervously shouted encouragement to each other making them all the easier to identify and to kill valerius knew that those who stayed silent would be the most dangerous by now his senses were in that high state of readiness that comes only to a warrior in battle the first hint the man who came out of the darkness had of his presence was the sting of the gladius that sliced the tendons of his throat and severed his jugular so that he died silent and bewildered blood fountaining and feet scrabbling in the sand valerius registered without regret that he had just killed the surviving german guard and waited for his next victim out of the pitch dark a torch flared followed swiftly by another and a circle of light encompassed the sandy battleground like a golden arena before valerius could identify the foremost torch bearer as susco serpentius appeared by his side with the same bewildering fluidity with which he had gone four men down including the guard only five left but five men armed with swords whose eyes glinted like ravening wolves in the torchlight five men driven beyond fear by the scent of buried water and the delights susco had promised them with the women in the tent but to sample those delights they first had to kill the two men who stood in their way valerius waited as he had waited in the temple of claudius for boudiccas warriors to break through the door and slaughter the last surviving romans of colonia he had not felt fear then and he did not feel it now kill them kill them all he said softly to serpentius the gladiator who had never lost a fight but susco had other ideas the torches were wooden staves salvaged from the ship capped with torn cloth from the tunics of those already dead and soaked with pitch secreted away during the forays to the wreck of the golden cygnet susco held one a second crewman the other and it was he who tossed his flaming brand over valeriuss head and on to the roof of the pavilion where domitia and her women waited for the outcome of the fighting they could hear so clearly in the still desert night the cloth of the tent had spent four days in the burning sun at the first lick of flame the tinderdry fabric erupted with a soft whump the fire instantly running the length of the roof a terrified scream jolted valerius into action go he ordered serpentius i will hold them here another man might have hesitated for a vital heartbeat but the spaniard slipped away without a word and left valerius to face his enemy alone the odds of five to one seemed impossible susco thought so he wore a mocking smile that said his victory was already certain and the fruits of it his to take at his leisure theyll taste all the sweeter for a little roasting he sneered but delirium and thirst had impaired his judgement he had forgotten the kind of man he was facing valerius sprang forward over the sand angling his run so that suscos bulk shielded him from the remainder of his attackers he knew it had to be fast and it had to be certain susco drove his torch towards valeriuss face expecting him to meet it with his sword which would leave susco with a simple thrust into the roman tribunes exposed body but valerius didnt hold his sword in his right hand his right hand was buried in the burnedout ruins of colonia now the carved walnut fist which had replaced it came up and knocked the torch aside he ignored the heat and the stink of singed hair as it brushed his shoulder at the same time stepping inside suscos clumsy lunge it gave him the heartbeat he needed to rake the inside of the other mans arm flaying skin and muscle from the bone with the edge of the gladius while susco was still reeling in shock the sword came up in a scything backhand sweep that took him below the chin and severed his head from his shoulders the sailmasters trunk swayed for a moment as a thick dark spray spumed from the neck before it toppled slowly backwards into the sand the surviving attackers were sailors not fighters when he hacked the next down without even meeting a challenge the rest dropped their swords and fled into the darkness valerius turned to find domitias pavilion a raging inferno xvi he reached the burning tent as serpentius staggered from the doorway with a cloak over his head and a slave girl under each arm the spaniard collapsed in the sand his chest heaving and utterly spent valerius ran to him and dragged the group clear of the flames where was domitia she wouldnt come serpentius choked ordered me to take the girls first i he tried to get to his feet but his legs buckled beneath him ill go valerius picked up the cloak and rushed for the tent a wall of fire met him where the curtain had hung nothing could survive in that holocaust of flame then she screamed long and shrill the scream of a woman in mortal agony or mortal fear sweet minerva aid me valerius whispered he swung the cloak over his head and charged the flaming barrier domitias scream had used up the last of her strength her lungs seemed to be filled with something solid and she struggled for each breath dense smoke wreathed the upper part of the pavilion and above it the ceiling glowed red in front of her was nothing but flame she had thought the heat of the egyptian sun unbearable but the radiation from the fire felt as if it was melting her flesh she had used the little knife valerius had given her to try to cut through the fabric of the pavilion but it was thick cloth almost a rug woven tight to provide shelter even from winter gales and she barely scarred it all hope fading she slumped closer to the floor where the air was cleanest and waited for death when the wall in front of her exploded in a shower of sparks and flaming fabric she believed it was vesta goddess of fire come to carry her off valerius tore off the burning cloak and rushed to the generals daughter domitia lay face down on the sand with one arm thrown towards the doorway and the flesh of that hand bubbled like a boiling pot he picked her up and turned to make his escape the way hed come but one look told him it was impossible the cloak that had protected his flesh from the blistering heat was a smouldering mass on the floor they were trapped in seconds the smoke wrapped itself around him and before he knew it it was choking him to death he felt the moment his mind began to shut down act or die he had not come here to die he shook his head to clear it and again studied his surroundings the awning at the door collapsed in a cloud of flame and sparks and he knew it was only seconds before the ceiling followed it no chance of digging their way out in time theyd anchored the base of the tent with twofoot mounds of sand his eyes took in the heavy cloth walls and he saw where domitia had made her pathetic attempt to escape with the knife was there any hope he laid her at the base of the wall and drew his sword with the strength of the damned he hacked at the cloth but barely made an impression in desperation he stabbed with the point and little by little the iron blade disappeared into the closewoven material until it finally broke through using his left hand and his right arm he brought all his weight to bear on the hilt slowly the fabric began to tear and he increased the pressure sawing with the blade eventually he created a rip a swords length in height but it was still not enough he worked his way left and right hacking at the threads until it was wide enough to wriggle through sweet fresh air poured into his lungs and the temptation was to lie and glory in it but he stirred himself and reached back to pull domitia away to safety not a moment too soon the roof collapsed and the burning fabric engulfed the ground where she had lain a second before he dragged her unconscious body a safe distance and watched the entire structure burn like a funeral pyre sleep or exhaustion must have overcome him because when he woke it was to the sound of a diabolical ululating wail domitia lay by his side just outside the circle of light thrown by the glowing heap where the tent had been he feared he had lost her because the rise and fall of her breast was so shallow but gradually her eyes opened and looked into his they were puffy and redrimmed but something glowed in their depths that told him she was unscarred by her ordeal she gave a little ladylike sneeze and laughed you have no eyebrows and your hair is all patchy the statement made him smile if that was the only price of last nights mayhem he could count himself fortunate so is yours he pointed out she frowned and her lips formed a pout but i am still beautiful you will always be beautiful lady he said and she accepted it as her due what is that noise it sounds as if someone has died then perhaps we should resurrect them he hesitated caught between what he knew was right and what he knew she wanted knowing that he wanted it too just to stay here a little longer in each others company not gaius valerius verrens hero of rome and domitia longina daughter of general corbulo just a man and a woman but duty was duty he held out his hand to help her to her feet and she took it reluctantly wincing as they touched for the first time he saw the sacs of pusfilled flesh hanging like overripe grapes from her fingers and realized the agony she must be suffering he led her back into the light and round the fire to where her servant girls knelt with their heads covered producing the plaintive wailing they had heard serpentius stood behind them staring distractedly towards the glowing remains of the tent as the two figures emerged from the darkness his hand automatically went for his sword when he recognized valerius his eyes widened and he made the sign against evil mars save us he strode towards the roman and valerius thought the gruff spaniard was about to take him in his arms at the last moment serpentius stopped short grinning wryly youll have to show me that trick did hades spit you out he bowed to domitia my lady i am glad to see you safe domitia smiled and walked to the two slaves who stared at her with their mouths gaping before they ran shrieking into the darkness serpentius laughed by the gods ive never been so glad to see you valerius raised what had once been an eyebrow because you miss my company no because i thought that screeching would never stop i would have jumped into the fire myself to get away from it when the girls had been rounded up and convinced that domitia was no ghost they gathered by the fire valerius dug up one of the precious water skins and allowed everyone to drink their fill serpentius vanished for a time and when he returned he reported no sign of the surviving crewmen including the injured they will still want our water but i doubt theyll be back valerius said the men who escaped were those whose hearts werent with susco whether that makes them the best of them or the worst doesnt matter they know what awaits them here either well kill them or theyll be tried for mutiny and suffer a worse death better to keep walking until you drop at least theyve left their shelter we can salvage whats left and move across when the sun comes up once ive cleared away their filth valerius nodded and walked over to where domitia sat huddled between the two slave girls let me see your hand he said gently she held it out and he studied it he knew a lot about cuts and wounds but very little about burns apart from the remedies which had been used on the estate perhaps it was better to leave it alone if he wasnt certain what to do domitia saw his confusion i can suffer it tribune i am a soldiers daughter grease serpentius said decisively cover it with grease and leave it for a week and where will we get grease valerius demanded im not a magician always grease on a ship the spaniard pointed out ill swim out to the wreck tomorrow and see what i can find if you can wait that long lady of course domitia said gracefully i am glad that someone is looking after my welfare serpentius it was the first time valerius had seen the spaniard blush late in the night as he lay in the sand beneath his cloak valerius felt someone move in beside him warmth and softness and the scent of salt water and smoke you may put your arms around me tribune i am cold so he did xvii valerius dreamed of a river nymph with domitias face dancing naked beneath a cascade of cool clear water strangely for the first time in days thirst was not uppermost in his mind instead the vision stirred a feeling that had lain dormant for a long time accompanied by a reaction that would have made priapus proud he woke with something soft warm and round in his left hand and a thunderstorm building inside his skull as he realized that the thing squirming against his groin was a pair of firm female buttocks that were only just covered by the short tunic their owner wore he tried to release domitias left breast but her hand clamped over his and when he attempted to move away the buttocks squirmed all the harder making the sensations he was experiencing close to unbearable do not move valerius i beg you she whispered she wriggled round beneath the cloak to face him and her mouth came to his her breath still sweet despite the days without water he knew that the two slave girls were sleeping less than twenty paces away but it was the most natural thing in the world to kiss her and to feel her body moulded against his more natural still that when the tunic rode up above her hips his hardness should find her softness and with a wriggle of her hips it was as if he had been engulfed in oiled silk and the heat of it made him groan domitia crushed her lips against his so fiercely that he could feel the individual small white teeth behind them as she fought to suppress a moan of pure pleasure valerius wrapped both arms around the slight figure and held her to him the passion flowing between them the frustration of being unable to give it full rein making it all the more intense suddenly she stiffened her eyes opened wide and she shuddered against him and he could not prevent himself from following her slowly she relaxed and he felt her lips nuzzling his cheek i have prayed for this day ever since the morning i watched you exercising with your soldiers valerius smiled i thought you were looking at tiberius tiberius is nothing but a boy she said dismissively and i think that tiberius is only capable of loving himself you were different i looked at you and saw a man but not a whole man it was part of the burden he carried that if the hand was not mentioned he must point it out she wriggled closer your wooden hand is as much a trophy of war as the phalerae you wear or the gold crown of valour you hold even with a missing hand you are twice the man of any other i have met he shook his head it should never have happened i should not have let it happen a soft finger touched his lips do not say that my love it was meant to be it is possible that by tomorrow or the next day we will be dead why should i allow the gods to deny me any longer he had no answer but he still knew it was wrong and he had a feeling that her gods would demand a reckoning in their own time it must not happen again domitia your father is hundreds of miles away you are such a fool valerius for us there is no future only now she slipped away and woke the two girls and together they went to wash away the smoke and the ashes of the previous night in the surf serpentius was already up and checking the bodies from the battle for signs of life the skin on his shaved head was blistered and his face still black from his rescue of the slaves during the night valerius wondered just how much he had heard of what had happened earlier and received a cool look that confirmed his fears so we fight our way out of one trap to fall straight into another the spaniard grumbled as he hauled suscos headless corpse towards the sea where hed already sunk three of the dead mutineers by mars sacred arse hes beginning to stink already a slave should mind his own business valerius pointed out i believe it was you who told me that how could i mind my own business when you made enough noise to wake susco here the spaniard complained letting the body drop to the ground as he straightened to face the roman and even a slave knows that when an old tom cat plays with a leopard kitten hed better watch out for the leopard valerius noticed that serpentius didnt mention corbulo by name but the surge of guilt he felt was like a spear in his guts how could he have let it happen he was a man full grown he knew the boundary between sex and love and he had never allowed himself to cross it since his time with the british girl maeve at colonia there had been slave girls aplenty in the proconsuls palace at carthage where he had spent eighteen months as military aide to aulus vitellius yes domitia had come to him in the night but a sane man would have sent her away again instead he had allowed himself to be hypnotized by the heady brew of her youth and beauty and sensuality and betrayed himself and her father he saw domitia watching him from the shadow and he wondered what was going through her mind their coupling had been urgent and as unstoppable as the waves that had battered the golden cygnet to pieces while it was happening she had whispered words like love and for ever but how much of it had been driven by the intensity of the events of a few hours earlier he had experienced before how a combination of fear and the unlikelihood of survival could swamp the senses and warp the mind would she end up despising him for his weakness as much as she had praised him for his masculinity he looked up and found the spaniard still staring at him the leopard is far away and im more likely to die of thirst than on another mans sword serpentius nodded thoughtfully and changed the subject maybe susco had a point you think we should try to walk to judaea not judaea but i have been thinking there must be some kind of trade between egypt and the judaeans and the most likely route for that trade is surely along the coast perhaps if we strike inland we can find the road and if we cant valerius said what then will we be any worse off the roman nodded to where the three women now lay beneath the sailors awning the sun had barely risen but already they could feel the threat of its fierce glare by midday it would be unbearable even beneath the shelter of the canopy every drop of moisture leached from their bodies by a furnace heat reflected from the burning sand domitias slave girls had been affected more than any of them by the dehydration and their condition had not been helped by the terror of the previous night they moved with an almost pitiful lethargy and no longer responded readily to their mistresss commands how long do you think they would last out there he pointed inland where the red dunes marched away in relentless tightpacked ranks beneath the blistering sun at least here we have shade and were conserving our energy there may be a few things on the ship weve missed no we stay here and wait it out then were dead if tiberius hasnt got through tiberius is not the man to give up if he was coming back he should have been here by now valerius looked the other man in the eye if you want to try it alone i wont stop you serpentius shook his head you were right we have to stay together these poor fools didnt understand that and look where it got them he picked up susco by the arms and resumed dragging him away when were finished here ill go out and give the ship another search im certain theres no more water but i should be able to find some grease for the generals daughter in the galley or where they stored the horse harness valerius nodded absently and stared westwards across the desert as if he could conjure a rescue party by the force of his will hes out there im certain of it if we can only last another two or three days we will survive the dribble of water valerius poured into his mouth did nothing to relieve his thirst if anything it made the need sharper domitia saw that he was more generous to the others than he had been to himself and insisted he take more we all drink or none drink we all live or none she said they lay beneath the awning but the suns rays were so strong that the shelter of the thin canvas was largely illusory valerius did what he could to shade domitia and her women from the worst as they lay panting in the sand their flesh desiccated by the relentless heat but soon he could only collapse beside them suki the elder of the girls went mad as the noonday sun reached its highest point her mind consumed by the knowledge that the next drink or perhaps the one after would be their last she ran into the sea and no one had the strength to follow her the last valerius saw of her she was flailing her way towards the golden cygnet but the next time he looked up all he could see was the glare of the ocean her fellow slave did not even raise her head someone it must have been serpentius found the fortitude to dole out the last of the water just as darkness fell and none of them knew whether it would be sufficient to see them through to the next dawn valerius was beyond torment now and beyond guilt his last thought before he lapsed into unconsciousness was to cover domitias body with his own to fend off the chill of the night but he did not dream of domitia he dreamed of maeve the beautiful british girl who had captured his heart and then torn it in two when she had betrayed colonia and the temple of claudius he dreamed of lush pastures and soft rain rain that fell on his cheeks and moistened his lips the dream was so real that he could feel the water trickling down his throat but he had lost the ability to swallow and choked on it not too much or you will kill him xviii titus flavius vespasian at your service tribune through eyes swollen to narrow slits valerius saw he was being addressed by a fellow tribunus laticlavius but the name told him his saviour was a much more exotic member of the species titus was a freshfaced handsome man perhaps a year or two younger than valerius with strong thoughtful features and the kind of natural authority that so often comes with good breeding valerius tried to speak but the other man shook his head gently there will be time for explanations later i will send my physician to you once he has treated the lady domitia in the meantime i must make arrangements for her transport you should rest now titus left and valerius lay back and closed his eyes despite his physical condition he felt at peace they were safe domitia was safe after all that had happened pirate attacks shipwreck mutiny and thirst it was difficult to believe he was once more in a legionarys leather tent with water and food to spare he had a niggling feeling he had forgotten something important but every time he tried to pin it down it slipped deeper into the recesses of his mind whatever it was it could wait when he opened his eyes again he found himself staring into the face of something only half human the features were puffy and distended with alternating red blotches and patches of wrinkled skin covered in a revolting green salve and the top of the shaven head seemed to glow bright red further inspection showed that the arms legs and torso of the apparition were covered by loose bandages tiberius read the look in his eyes and a grin creased the grotesque features before you say anything tribune you dont look a great deal better yourself valerius laughed and felt as if his throat had been cut we have you to thank for our lives tiberius he whispered i will be for ever in your debt the young tribune said to him thank fortuna if it were not for her we would all be dead and general vespasians son of course he slumped in a corner of the tent and valerius insisted he tell the story of his long ride west tiberius recited the tale in a dispassionate voice that only changed when he reached the moment he realized hed strayed off course and would have to retrace his steps for twenty miles i came close to despair then though it is not my nature only my pledge to you kept me in the saddle when hercules foundered i knew i would not last the day the only thing that saved me was getting lost i must have become delirious because i had wandered into the desert and was walking in entirely the wrong direction numidian cavalry auxiliaries returning from a reconnaissance patrol saw me wandering in circles they thought they had found one of their own because i had been burned almost black and i could barely speak it was a whole morning before i was able to explain to their roman officers who i was of course i wanted to return immediately but the numidians were also short of water and there was no point in coming without it we took another day to reach the desert oasis where titus had his headquarters and he insisted on returning with me when i explained about the generals daughter apparently their fathers are friends we had to wait until they had loaded the camels with water skins but he drove the column until man and animal were on their knees to reach you in time still i thought we would be too late but they put me in a litter on the back of a camel and here we are valerius was curious just where is here tiberius pulled the knife from his belt you were wrong he drew the broad curve of the coastline in the sand this is where i met the numidians more or less he pointed to a spot at the western end of the curve we are here valeriuss heart sank as he realized his mistake twenty miles from the judaean border and i sent you to ride forty closer to sixty if you take in my diversion tiberius admitted without a hint of modesty but you were right the rebels are very active in the border villages they would have been more likely to cut our throats than feed us nevertheless a ride worthy of a hero and you can be sure i will report it to general corbulo i could ask no greater reward tribune the young man said earnestly of course you could not have done it without my horse no sir im sorry about that he was a fine horse a mischievous glint appeared in tiberiuss eye but i thought the horse was probably less valuable than the generals daughter it wasnt until the young soldier left that valerius realized what had been lost in the euphoria of his survival when he had believed death was certain he could ignore it but now the shadow of gnaeus domitius corbulo loomed like a hurricane cloud on the far horizon and every step he took carried him closer to the moment of decision you fought in britain i understand valerius noted the inevitable glance at his wooden hand and smiled titus vespasians splendid uniform his spotless armour and the quality of his horse all proclaimed his status he was the generals son and a young man with a glittering career ahead of him in the military and politics but he could still be seduced by the physical proof of another mans sacrifice i was with the twentieth during the rebellion he acknowledged but in the end i served as an aide to the governor suetonius paulinus the second augusta titus said but i only arrived after the rebel queen had been killed valerius was surprised he had known the father had served on the island during emperor claudiuss invasion two decades earlier but not that the son had fought there you must have been very young seventeen titus admitted cheerfully the most junior of the junior tribunes and with less authority than a legionary of the second rank it was not my most rewarding posting you will have heard the story valerius nodded every roman soldier who had been in britain knew the tale of the notorious second legion how the camp prefect poenius postumus who had been left in command had refused to march to paulinuss aid brought disgrace to his unit and been forced to fall on his sword while paulinus hunted down the last of the rebels the second was kept in the west garrisoning isca and far from any glory or plunder and the men resented it of course they took their frustration out on the tribespeople round about i have never witnessed such cruelty before or since valerius remembered the goreslick field after boudiccas last battle and the swords rising and falling on enemy warriors even after they had surrendered i saw enough cruelty and bloodshed in britain to last me a lifetime and yet you are still a soldier valerius felt the shrewd eyes on him and wondered if he was being mocked but he decided titus was just being curious my father wanted me to be a politician but i dont think ill ever be cut out for the senate i discovered in britain that i actually enjoyed soldiering even the worst parts of it the discomfort and the cold and the waiting the men are a bunch of devious thieving rogues but there is a real sense of achievement in sharing their lives and winning their respect to lead them in battle is to walk with the gods for a day titus laughed we are much alike then a junior tribunes life is what he makes it and my comrades preferred drinking and carousing to fighting or drilling but my fathers advice to me was to learn everything i could so i let them laugh at me as i dug trenches and stood in frozen rivers building bridges and when i rose in the dark to supervise drill while they were still in their beds perhaps soon i will be laughing at them valerius had seen the effortless way the younger tribune commanded his men and the respect the wild numidian auxiliaries accorded him and he had no doubt it was true titus explained that his father the general had just arrived in alexandria to gather his forces for the response to the unrest in judaea vespasian blamed the rebellion on the incompetence of the previous commanders who had embarked on a campaign of brutality and military ineptness which first enraged and then encouraged the citizens of the province they have a taste for roman blood now titus said between them florus the judaean procurator and gallus the propraetor managed to lose the best part of the third gallica when they became trapped in the palace at jerusalem they should have chopped off the head of the snake then and there but they waited too long when they did counterattack gallus was too timid and the twelfth fulminata lost their eagle in the retreat now my father is preparing to retake the province and i am to be his aide you were fortunate that i was exercising my numidians when they came across your young tribune it is remarkable that he survived so long valerius smiled he is a remarkable young man i have already dispatched a courier to alexandria with news that the lady domitia is safe and my father will send word direct to antioch general corbulo will be relieved to hear the news now i must escort you to my father he will be very interested to hear your story they rode on in silence and at a sedate pace suitable for domitias camelborne litter which was further down the column valerius had seen little of the generals daughter since the rescue other than an uninterested exchange of glances as they ate with titus on the evening before their departure from the beach the night they had shared seemed unreal now a true moment of madness that could never should never be repeated yet he still felt himself drawn to her in a way that went beyond the first shock of the physical a rider galloped up with a message for titus the generals son thanked the trooper and turned to valerius the lady domitia longina passes on her thanks for your efforts in keeping her alive and hopes to give them personally once she has recovered from her injuries she too is remarkable i have been impressed by her resilience she seems more upset by the loss of a slave than by anything she has suffered herself a rare combination of beauty courage virtue and devotion dont you think valerius started at the word virtue but there didnt seem to be any hidden meaning in the young soldiers words he almost missed what titus said next lucius is a very fortunate man titus noticed his incomprehension her betrothed lucius aelius lamia we served together in germania she tells me they are to be married when she returns from her visit to her father valerius felt as though someone had hit him with a hammer why hadnt she told him he should have been jealous or angry but the truth was his only emotions were relief and a sense of release would it have made any difference if he had known probably not but now he knew it would never happen again yes he is a very fortunate man xix the elder titus flavius vespasian had set up his headquarters in an annexe of one of the royal palaces close to alexandrias harbour staff officers and couriers came and went with the flurried regularity of ants from an anthill beneath giant fans which shifted the overheated air in the great marble hall but barely cooled it at the centre of a sweating mass of clerks the redfaced general barked his orders and demanded up to date information how many ships do we have to transport the two legions and their auxiliaries from alexandria to ptolemais the answer patently didnt please him not enough but it will have to do we had two thousand transports when claudius invaded britain but we were landing on a hostile shore unless the rebels decide to invade syria this will be different valerius stood with titus while an aide interrupted the general to announce their presence vespasian barely paused between sentences and waved titus towards a nearby doorway his private apartments the young soldier whispered valerius hesitated but titus ushered him forward he will want to hear what you have to say the generals offices were in a sumptuous corner room with a view of the harbour and they only had to wait a few minutes before vespasian bustled in he was in his late fifties with the substantial belly that came with success and middle age a fine nose and a grimset mouth in a face that had long forgotten how to smile only in the eyes and the youthful energy was there a hint of the man he had once been and titus now was the two young men saluted valerius rapping his wooden fist against the leather breastplate of his borrowed uniform but the general ignored them as he took his seat behind a desk of pale marble wine he shouted seconds later the servant who had been hovering behind a nearby screen appeared with a jug and three embossed silver cups titus waved him away and poured the wine which was white and surprisingly cool valeriuss lips barely touched the rim of his cup but the general took a deep draught and sighed with pleasure annius has been recalled to rome so i want you to take temporary command of the fifth macedonica until corbulo can send us marcus bolanus vespasian told his son valerius saw tituss face harden an unusual reaction for a soldier who had just been given an appointment for which other men might wait a lifetime that means the young man recognized his fathers warning glance and kept the rest of his thoughts to himself but valerius could guess what they were annius vinicianus was not only the legate of the fifth macedonica but domitias brotherinlaw the husband of general gnaeus domitius corbulos eldest daughter his recall might have some innocent purpose but at a time when the empires very foundations were still shaking from the effects of pisos conspiracy it could just as easily result in arrest torture and death whatever it means is between annius and the emperor vespasian said firmly we have a war to prepare for i cant ignore politics but i will not let them divert me from my main purpose we must be ready to move as soon as possible he paused and stared at his desk when he looked up it was as if he was seeing valerius for the first time and you are the young man who saved corbulos daughter valerius straightened sir then i must commend you although im not certain what her father will make of shipwreck and pirates he shook his head at the thought his notions of discipline are somewhat different from mine the tone changed and vespasians eyes narrowed verrens you are to be his second in command valerius nodded vespasian glanced at his son leave us titus hesitated with a look of puzzlement at valerius before he walked from the room when they were alone the general rubbed his hand across his forehead and let out a long breath first you should be aware that i know of your secondary commission from the palatium valeriuss head came up with a snap but vespasian raised a hand before he could speak do not deny it let it be sufficient that i know and that if i know general corbulo also knows second let me say that i need corbulo no let me go further the empire needs corbulo in command of the armies of the east vespasian walked to a large table over which was laid a map of the eastern mare nostrum from cappadocia in the north to egypt and africa in the south here judaea he pointed to an area in the centre of the map lost to rome for the moment thanks to those fools florus and gallus better that the pair of them had fallen on their swords but they do not have the wit even to do that a rats nest of rebels from galilee in the north to jerusalem and masada in the south fortress cities on the coast at caesarea jotapata and ashkelon now in jewish hands and roman bones bleaching in the streets of all of them i will restore judaea to rome with corbulos help but what rome will not currently recognize valerius listened with ice water in his veins if vespasian knew of his mission why was he being told this the general read his expression and the thin lips came as close as valerius guessed they ever would to a smile and what i cannot change is that general corbulo has problems of his own in parthia where he believes king vologases is ready to take advantage of his brother tiridates absence to return armenia to parthian rule corbulo knows how much a parthians word is worth when he was given command in the east it was clear that if parthia controlled armenia she would quickly become a threat to both cappadocia and syria vologases ambitions have remained unchanged for ten years corbulo recognized that when he crossed the euphrates and took three legions into the very heart of armenia stormed three of tiridates fortresses in a single day and went on to burn his capital at artaxata armenia remained under roman rule for four years before parthian treachery obliged him to intervene again corbulo forced the parthians out of armenia not once but twice vologases sued for peace and agreed that tiridates should rule as romes subject but now with tiridates in rome and judaea alight he sees yet another opportunity he paused and took another drink from his cup and the grey eyes scoured valeriuss you understand that i am taking you into my confidence tribune i do it for a purpose it is my instinct that gaius valerius verrens serves rome and my certainty that romes best interests are served by stability in her eastern commands let me be frank what i will say next i do not say in criticism of a fellow general but as one officer giving another proper notice of what awaits him at his next posting general corbulo has been in the east for twelve years long enough to form friendships and alliances which may be of benefit to the region but might be misconstrued elsewhere am i making myself plain valerius kept his face expressionless the legate seemed to be confirming everything that suetonius paulinus had implied but vespasians next words surprised him yet for all this caesar has no more loyal general than gnaeus domitius corbulo you will form your own opinions when you reach antioch but i ask you to bear this simple fact in mind in all your dealings with the general he paused and stared out to the ships waiting beyond the breakwater choosing his next words with particular care of course if your own inquiries should conclude otherwise you must act as you see fit nevertheless you have a unique opportunity to influence the outcome of your own investigation and for the good of the empire i see you doubt me let me explain one of the most important functions of a good officer is to say what needs to be said whatever the consequences and even if his commander does not want to hear it it will not make him a popular officer but it will make him a valued one general corbulos staff have been with him for a long time perhaps too long and i fear they have forgotten this lesson his inclination will be to attack vologases and his inclination may well be militarily correct but it will not be right it would be seen in certain quarters as impertinent a sign of independence at a time when independence has deeper meaning a good officer the grey eyes burrowed deep into valeriuss skull would be doing his commander a service if he pointed out this simple fact valeriuss first thought was that he was being drawn into a trap if nero had personally ordered the inquiry into the workings of corbulos headquarters as paulinus had insinuated every word he had just heard and every suggestion implied was an act of treason and an invitation to bow his head before the executioners sword he had known the moment of decision must come well this was it a sensible man would stand up and point out that he had no choice in the matter that he was the emperors agent and would do his duty yet he hesitated a small voice in his head told him there were undercurrents here he could not see and did not understand titus flavius vespasian was the direct appointee of the emperor a trusted adviser with intimate knowledge of neros court where was the profit in entrapping a lowly tribune on his way to do the emperors bidding a conspirator and valerius had ample experience of conspirators would never have been so direct there would have been subtle hints and cryptic asides certainly an offer of advancement or reward and perhaps even the threat of extreme consequences if that offer was not accepted vespasian had spoken with the eloquence and passion of a man who believed everything he said and with each unguarded word he heightened the odds of condemning himself the message behind the words was that if corbulo invaded armenia without the emperors direct order he would be exceeding the authority granted by nero and in the present political climate that course of action was likely to have serious consequences which would in turn weaken the eastern armies yet if that were the case why had vespasian himself not already taken steps to stop corbulo the general read valeriuss look as if he could see into his mind i have known gnaeus domitius corbulo for many years as a colleague in the senate as a military commander sometimes as a friend and sometimes as a rival our careers have had certain parallels we shared our first legionary commands on the rhenus frontier and he was of great help to me when i was preparing the second augusta for the invasion later i was able to help him in certain difficulties he had with divine claudius circumstances dictated that while his military career flourished i was never able to repeat the successes of britain these are troubled times for the empire vespasians voice took on a doleful tone and valerius knew he wasnt talking only of the judaean revolt the unrest in germania and the whispers from gaul neros revenge on the pisonian conspirators had torn the heart out of the senate and this man would have lost friends and even though close to the emperor would undoubtedly have come under suspicion himself if i offered this advice as a friend it might be dismissed as a provocation if i offered it as a fellow officer it would be interpreted as an insult his successes and the let us not be coy about it reverence in which he is held by those he leads make him a difficult man to persuade no he might listen to a member of his staff if that man were courageous enough to speak out but i doubt anyone else could divert him from his path no signal had been given but the light clink of armour told valerius that titus had returned vespasian took another draught from his cup and stared at the map titus went to stand by his side valerius knew he was being dismissed he also knew when he was outmatched in that case it would be better if i left as soon as possible he said vespasian nodded absently there is one more thing he approached so close that even his son couldnt hear what he whispered tell general corbulo that whatever he decides i will support him valerius didnt know what to make of this cryptic message but he nodded titus affected not to notice the exchange and accompanied him to the door a courier will be leaving for antioch by fast galley in two days escorting the generals daughter and you will be welcome to join him in the meantime i will see that all the equipment you lost in the shipwreck is replaced valerius thanked him but perhaps the lady domitia would like to take a few days more to recover and travel in a little more comfort he suggested tentatively no titus smiled she is eager to be reunited with her father her passage has already been agreed valerius returned the smile but his heart sank at the thought of sharing a cramped ship with domitia for another three days tituss expression changed and his handsome face turned serious you may be surprised by what you find in antioch sometimes men who serve for long periods in the east can become set in their ways be very careful my friend and do not expect a warm welcome only later did he realize that there had been a moment of decision a hesitation during his interview with vespasian and that if the decision had gone against him he would never have left alexandria alive xx rome everything was on fire everywhere he looked the flames crackled and roared and consumed apartments of wood and wattle warehouses filled with oil and wool and timber even the great marble temples which had seemed so solid and safe and invulnerable had burned and flesh so much flesh the smell of roasting meat filled his nostrils in the same way the screams of the doomed filled his ears he tried to shut it out but it was as if the screams were inside his head he saw a gap and ran for it but before he could reach safety a wall of fire blocked the street he could feel himself burning mother make it stop but mother couldnt stop the flames even if she had wanted to because mother was dead at his hand or if not at his hand by his will like so many they came to him now all those he had called friend and lover and yes even brother one by one they pierced him with their accusing eyes and he did not know which was greater the pain of their contempt or the agony of the fire that was melting his flesh from his bones like wax dripping from a candle he remembered a pillar of writhing flame a blackened skull with burning eyes and a name cornelius sulla so this is what it had been like he opened his mouth to scream and flames filled his mouth and his nose and he felt them flash down his throat incinerating his lungs and exploding his heart he raised his arms to the heavens in a last despairing gesture and before his eyes shrivelled in his head he looked out over the rome he had created the sea of fire that was his gift to his people and saw a fiery orb arc across the sky leaving a trail of sparks in its wake a falling star no a fallen god tigellinus he shot bolt upright with the sweat dripping from his face as if hed just emerged from the baths tigellinus the waking scream echoed the unanswered one from the dream the dream which had seemed so real that he could still feel the raw agony of the flame shooting down his throat running feet not tigellinus but the slaves who served his bedchamber for a moment he wondered why poppaea wasnt at his side then he remembered that she was dead dead more than a year along with the child send for my praetorian prefect by the time tigellinus arrived nero was curled in a ball on top of his bed his whole body shaking as if he was suffering from a fever the emperors personal physician stood by the doorway with a look of perplexed anxiety on his face is he sick tigellinus asked the greek the physician shook his head and the praetorian sighed he had grown accustomed to late night summonses to heal crises of the body or the mind to interpret dreams which promised triumph or disaster to praise ideas of such genius no mortal man could turn them into reality or simply to hear a song which had fixed itself in his masters head and must be heard before it disappeared for ever just lately it had been the dreams caesar he approached the bed it is finished the three whispered words sent a stream of ice water down tigellinuss spine in the past there had always been doubt here there was only certainty no caesar i watched a burning god fall from the sky falling to smite your enemies no i was on fire the whole city was on fire a memory remember how you fought the flames and saved your people i saved them you were everywhere tigellinus assured him directing the rescue organizing the water supply without nero there would be no rome nero opened his eyes it had been almost three years earlier he remembered a burning glow on the horizon the smell of smoke ashes perhaps it was true but the certainty was clouded by the fact that he had wanted it and when he wanted things they tended to happen the followers of christus caesar tigellinus preempted the next question vile creatures who sought to destroy rome and through rome you fanatics and purveyors of lies yes the christus followers they admitted their guilt under question each one bore the mark of the fire the praetorian commander remembered the careful selection the refinements necessary to ensure that each confession should be exact in every detail yet still one had duped him but the man paulus claimed it was a portent of the end he said rome was the great whore the young emperor reached out and gripped tigellinuss hand with surprising strength it must not happen you will not allow it to happen no caesar tigellinuss voice was soft and reassuring your agents are in place with the german frontier legions and in hispania and lusitania the traitor vinicianus will soon be in our hands thus far he has not implicated his fatherinlaw corbulo and there has been a delay in my agents reaching antioch but if he is guilty i will know it within the month find them for me find my enemies hunt them down show them no mercy at your command caesar for rome for rome xxi valerius stared out beyond the bow of the twinbanked bireme galley hypnotized by the glint of sun on sea he was so spellbound that he didnt notice domitia emerging from the flimsy wooden cabin that had been built for her until she came to stand at his side for more than a minute they stood a few decorous feet apart as aware of each others presence as if they were touching hands he was searching for the word or the gesture that would breach the barrier that had separated them since the night on the beach when a pair of blue dolphins lithe swift and fearless appeared from nowhere to carve their way effortlessly through the waters below the lovers feet domitia studied them for a while her eyes never leaving the dark shapes as they rose and fell triangular fins chopping the surface to leave a trail of silver bubbles and even occasionally departing their natural element entirely one was larger and seemed to take the lead but the other mirrored its partners every move never more than a few inches from its side sometimes they were so close that their bodies touched when she spoke her voice was soft as the kiss of the sea on the galleys hull dont you ever wish you were free valerius free of duty and of obligation free to go where you want with whom you want what if poseidon were to grant you the ability to choose this very moment to turn into a dolphin and swim away with me to spend our lives roaming the oceans together would you accept or would you stand here and watch me swim away alone just for a moment he was swayed and the mesmeric rhythm of the sleek streamlined figures cutting through the water drew him to them he remembered desire and softness and strength beneath the knowing stars of an egyptian night a night of magic when he had been with her anything had seemed possible but but he was gaius valerius verrens hero of rome he had never known anything but duty and obligation duty to his father and the estate duty to the cursus honorum which had shaped his path through life duty to the men he had served with and served under duty to rome and its emperor and his duty to the emperor had made him a spy what would she think of him if she ever discovered that he had been sent from rome to spy on her father he knew the answer well enough she would despise a man so weak and disloyal he did not tell her that he could have been free that the marble deposits beneath his estate at fidenae would have bought a hundred freedoms or a thousand he knew that when she said free to go where you want with whom you want she actually meant free to love whom you want but that was as much a dream as the dream of turning into a dolphin the reality was that domitia was betrothed to a man already spoken of as a future consul and valerius would always be bound to the master within when he looked again the dolphins were gone he felt her eyes on him but he dared not turn to see what was written in them he feared her next words but when she spoke it was lightly though her voice was touched by a lost wistful sadness so we will not wander the oceans together tribune it is of no matter it was a silly girls whim better that we both forget that this ever happened it was a momentary thing and in any case one which we will never be in a position to repeat i am a respectable roman lady valerius and i rely on your discretion and your honour to ensure that my honour remains untarnished when she said the last few words he heard a smile in her voice as she left him her hand brushed lightly against his two days later they docked at the port of seleucia pieria the magnificent harbour at the mouth of the river orontes created by antiochs founder seleucus one of alexander the greats generals when they disembarked a closed carriage awaited domitia and she insisted on hurrying ahead up the paved road by the river to meet her father valerius tiberius and serpentius waited until their equipment was unloaded and packed on a pair of mules before joining their escort for the tenmile ride inland to antioch and corbulo they entered the city by an enormous twintowered gate and along a broad avenue flanked by marble pillars alexandria with its towering palaces secluded gardens and great trading port might be romes gateway to the east but antioch was the crossroads between east and west a sprawling city of more than half a million people its streets teeming with merchants and traders of every nationality valerius was struck by the scale of the walls which challenged even those of rome this was where his hero germanicus caesar father of the emperor caligula had finally succumbed either to some awful disease contracted in egypt or to poison administered on the orders of his rival another treacherous piso he wondered in which of these buildings the great man had died on closer inspection many showed the filled cracks and wall repairs that were clear signs of earthquake damage although not from a recent event the river was always to their left and when they turned off the main road towards it they were welcomed by a paradise on earth even the normally undemonstrative tiberius gaped when he saw it the governors palace proved to be a place of cool waters and shaded cypress and laurel groves where waterfalls tumbled from the surrounding hills to create sparkling pools filled with small darting fish and purple herons stood frozen among the reedbeds further upstream the enormously rich syrian merchants of antioch had built villas in the roman style but nothing could match the magnificence of governor gnaeus domitius corbulos official residence two storeys high with a roof of red tile pale cream bricks and milk white marble it dominated everything around it stretching for close to a quarter of a mile along the bank of the orontes led by their escort an exotic mix of syrian mounted archers in potshaped helmets and green cloaks and bearded scythian spearmen in fishscale armour they crossed the river by a stone bridge and turned upstream along an avenue of cypress trees in the shade of the branches still as statues the soldiers of a full cohort stood at rest the design on their curveedged scuta was unfamiliar to valerius at the top of the shield against a red background a proud bull in silhouette dared any comer to challenge him while below the metal boss a galley in full sail cut its way across the painted ash on either side of the boss he was a little unnerved to see a pair of dolphins the tenth fretensis tiberius said in a low voice general corbulos elite they provide his personal bodyguard there had been times in the last two weeks when valerius believed he would never reach this point and others when he had prayed he wouldnt all he could think of was vespasians warning if i know general corbulo also knows he had revealed the true purpose of their mission to serpentius during the voyage from alexandria and the spaniard had accepted the information with a bitter laugh now he surveyed their surroundings with the wariness of a stalking panther they passed through a pillared gateway to be met by an honour guard and serpentius draped valeriuss senior tribunes white cloak a gift from titus over his shoulders as they approached the palace his heart stopped when he noticed the coach that had carried domitia and her servant from seleucia that was the thing about guilt it didnt matter where you went it would always be waiting for you he checked in his sword at the door and an aide ushered him through a maze of corridors to a large receiving room with a colonnaded balcony overlooking the river vine stems writhed like snakes up the pillars and entwined to form a ceiling of emerald green through which the sun sparkled like so many polished jewels it was early evening but this was midsummer in the orient and even in the depths of the orontes gorge the force of the days heat still lingered in the stones and the grass six men waited for him there six men who surveyed him with looks that ranged from naked animosity to open contempt and in at least one case pure hatred from their uniforms and insignia he guessed they were corbulos senior commanders at least three of them legionary legates there was no greeting only the merest acknowledgement of his existence valerius felt hot blood rise inside him but he kept his expression blank so that was the way it was to be gaius valerius verrens reporting for duty to general corbulo i was told he would be here since you have not lost your eyes as well as your arm tribune it should be clear to you that he has been detained elsewhere the insult was deliberate and accompanied by a humourless smile it came from the oldest of the six a handsome narrowfaced patrician with cropped grey hair you are interrupting an important conference surely your time would be better spent making yourself look like an officer for your interview and not some grubby recruit returning from his first patrol valerius bit back the retort that came to his tongue the mans age and the scarlet band at his waist marked him as a legionary commander even if it hadnt been already evident in the arrogant dismissal of a mere equestrian he studied the grim faces and cursed paulinus for his poor security then it came to him paulinus had made sure word of his mission preceded him the consul knew that even with olivia as a hostage valerius might be tempted to ignore his orders now he had little choice because he was a pariah whether he carried them out or not yet something was not quite right with that theory what the legates sneer cut across his thoughts perhaps you left your tongue where you left your hand a gentleman would apologize and leave enough the word snapped through the air like a cracking whip valeriuss tormentor stiffened before acknowledging the order with the slightest nod of the head the figure who filled the doorway was tall with a slim muscular build that belied his age and grey challenging eyes that dared you to disagree with him deep lines scored his face and he had a long hooked nose that reminded valerius of one of the desert eagles the nomad tribes of the east used to hunt foxes and jackals he wore a long tunic of raw silk secured by a belt of gold links that gave him the appearance of an eastern potentate many generals valerius had served under were more administrators than soldiers aulus vitellius had been one but gnaeus domitius corbulo was a truly great commander because he could fight as well as he led valerius had heard the stories if corbulo negotiated it was from a position of strength with a legion at his back if he retreated it was only to find a better way to attack he was no longer young but he knew how to wage war and he knew how to win this was a hard man body and mind forged in combat into a weapon as potent as the swords his legionaries carried his enemies feared him his officers respected him and his soldiers loved him as they would a strict father or a stern unforgiving god so you are my new second in command valerius rapped the wooden fist against his leather breastplate the unblinking eyes never left his face and the younger man swore he could sense the quiver of trapped energy and an air of deadly intent bordering on menace corbulos scrutiny continued for more than a minute while the sweat ran down valeriuss back in a warm stream eventually the ordeal ended or perhaps it was only beginning come with me the governor said curtly he led the way through the palace to another smaller room on the floor above and sat down behind a large desk with scrolls stacked neatly to one side and a stylus and a pile of wax tablets in front of him a legionary of his personal guard stood on either side of the entrance and valerius took his place in front of the desk he caught the sweet scent of perfumed water and noticed a darkhaired figure reclining on a couch on the far side of the room playing with a small ball of fur your orders valerius reached inside the pouch at his waist and handed over the scroll ambiguous the general said after hed studied the contents sir your orders are ambiguous you are to be my second in command but i am to use you in any way i see fit in the service of the empire in effect i could make you part of the foundations of the new basilica i am having built and no one could question it do you agree it was a dangerous question to which there seemed no safe answer but it demanded one valerius decided that attack was his best policy i do not but judging by the welcome i received a few moments ago some of your senior officers do a sniff from the corner seemed to signify that domitia held a different opinion valerius felt the dark eyes on him and wondered why she was here had her father arranged it to keep him off balance and increase his humiliation or was he simply indulging his daughter the latter seemed unlikely and perhaps it was neither but valerius still felt he was caught in a trap corbulo glared in the direction of his daughter they seek to protect me would you have them do otherwise they look at gaius valerius verrens and see a traitor in their midst so it was out corbulo was aware of his mission and didnt care if he knew it in some ways that made it simpler i am no traitor i was asked to prepare a report nothing more a spy then the hackles rose on valeriuss neck but corbulo raised a hand before he could reply from my daughter and from certain other sources i have been given some notion of the manner of man i am dealing with unless i am mistaken or misinformed he is a man of honour the fact that you have undoubtedly been proved in battle is of little significance i have known brave men of little judgement and some of no judgement at all on the other hand when faced with pirates shipwreck and mutiny you conducted yourself with intelligence and imagination i sense that you are not a man to be swayed by either blandishment or threat and that is what has brought me to my decision the grey eyes brightened was there a mocking challenge in them you will investigate where you will with my sanction and when you have done so you will make your report gnaeus domitius corbulo has nothing to hide and nothing to fear of course while you are spying on my staff my spies will be spying on you you would expect nothing else im sure valerius tried to hide his surprise at best he had expected to be banished to some remote outpost and there had always been the possibility that he might conveniently disappear in a desert ambush again there was that surprising sense of support from the silent presence behind him corbulo continued the one stipulation i make is that in the meantime you serve under my command in any way i see fit do not thank me i assure you it will be arduous difficult duty and the manner of it may not suit you i grant that you have fought and by all accounts fought well he glanced at valeriuss wooden fist but you have no experience of campaigning in the east you will find that having one hand is a greater handicap against the parthians than against your celtic queen a man who has faced barbarian chariots and spearmen is of little use against mounted archers who sting like hornets and then fly off to fight another day they have a habit of eating the young inexperienced officers they capture for breakfast corbulo continued to regard him with an unblinking stare but a soft miaow broke the silence and the governor failed to suppress a rueful smile clearly his notorious attitude to discipline didnt extend to his youngest daughter or her cat the general picked up his stylus and rubbed it thoughtfully between his fingers very well domitia i believe the kitchen servants require your supervision there was no hint of argument against the obvious dismissal only a soft rustle of silk and the scent of perfumed oils before valerius felt her presence beside him i am glad to see you well tribune her voice was lower and huskier than he remembered valerius turned and felt the familiar flutter as he looked into eyes the colour of polished walnuts my lady he bowed i thank you for your kind words and your good opinion oh i think i am in a better position to judge my saviours character than a few wrinkled old generals she said ignoring her fathers growl of disapproval come puss puss she walked out followed by the fluffy white kitten the generals expression softened my daughter tells me that you saved her life and her virtue once more and from an entirely unexpected angle valerius felt the point of a dagger tickling his spine the generals daughter is a lady of great character and fortitude and a credit to her father he said carefully she withstood pirate attack shipwreck mutiny thirst and fire without a single word of complaint if anything she was strongest of us all corbulo nodded absently and you were together for how long how long a lifetime valerius understood that the general felt the conversation had to take place and the questions had to be asked but the room suddenly felt more dangerous than the slippery bloodsoaked boards of the pirate galley i believe it was six days between the wreck and the morning general vespasians son came to our rescue we had run out of water and i doubt we would have been alive an hour later she speaks very highly of you i did my duty and nothing more valerius kept his voice steady and tried to think of anything but the night beneath the cloak he had a moment of inspiration i would commend the name of tiberius claudius crescens to the general tribune crescens is a remarkably resourceful young man he rode close to sixty miles through the desert for help the general nodded again very well i will interview him later in the meantime i plan to convene a strategy conference with the officers you met below you are aware of our situation general vespasian was kind enough to brief me good that will save time you will take up your position immediately your predecessor tiberius alexander was a good man he will have left everything in order he must have been popular valerius risked the rueful suggestion his comrades do not appreciate the arrival of his replacement corbulo laughed its not your arrival they do not appreciate tribune or even the fact that they think you are a spy it is because they think you are here to kill me xxii general gaius licinius mucianus legate of sixth ferrata corbulo introduced the handsome aristocrat who had insulted valerius on the balcony the sneer remained in place and the long nose twitched as if it had smelled something distasteful marcus ulpius traianus tenth fretensis traianus was younger than his fellow commander fineboned and heavylipped with piercing blue eyes aurelius fulvus commanding third gallica and gaius pompeius collega fifteenth apollinaris the two men nodded and collega who had not been at the earlier conference gave valerius an uneasy smile of welcome only one other man remained in the room after corbulos aides had set out an enormous table with a series of overlapping maps and the general presented him warmly as his camp prefect and quartermaster casperius niger niger had dark hair shot with grey and the swarthy complexion and uncompromising features of a native easterner but he was clearly one of corbulos most trusted members of staff tension filled the room like a fog mixed with that peculiar suppressed excitement and anticipation valerius remembered from the conference where the colonia militia had received their orders for the defence against boudicca corbulo stood hunched over the table his eyes taking in every detail of the maps this was ground he had covered many times but he understood the traps and pitfalls that awaited him among the treacherous river valleys and the barren mountains the dusty plains and featureless deserts his commanders knew the situation well enough but general gnaeus domitius corbulo was romes greatest general because he considered every detail and his watchword was preparation the first few minutes were a mirror of the summary valerius had received from vespasian the situation in judaea was worsening the rebel strength and confidence increasing with every day the romans failed to avenge the defeats suffered by vespasians predecessors general vespasian has almost completed his preparations in egypt and he will begin shipping his main force to ptolemais here on the judaean border north of galilee where the largest concentration of rebel forces is believed to be while his cavalry carries out diversionary operations in the area between ashkelon and the dead sea valerius nodded that explained tituss mission into the desert corbulos voice changed and valerius caught a hint of irritation i have orders to consolidate my position in syria while giving as much support as can be spared to vespasian to this end sixth ferrata third gallica and their associated auxiliary units will march south from their positions at zeugma and cyrrhus to prepare defensive positions and stockpile supplies for sixty thousand men mucianus frowned it will take all our reserves and i will have to strip every town and village between antioch and damascus corbulo fixed him with that steady gaze nevertheless it must be done i have already sent to sergiopolis and palmyra to have their stores of grain oil and wine moved to damascus i see no reason why it should not be waiting for you when you arrive there any shortfall will be made up by a special requisition from cappadocia and egypt if we withdraw entirely from zeugma and cyrrhus it will leave the main crossing of the euphrates undefended and the road to antioch open collega pointed out if you are wrong the parthians will be able to outflank our eastern defence line and syria will be at their mercy the other three legates looked at him and valerius realized this was what they had been discussing during the afternoon corbulo ushered his commanders closer around the map and motioned to valerius to join them i have recently received word from our spies in parthia that king vologases has sent out a call to raise a force of seventy thousand men heavy cavalry slingers spearmen and mounted archers and is preparing to march north from his capital on the tigris he said solemnly there can be only one reason for this he means to take advantage of the rebellion in judaea and the fact of his brothers absence from armenia to retake control of that country i cannot allow that again the four turned to their general three of them nodding but collegas broad face showed consternation without two of your four legions and with explicit orders from the palatium in rome to consolidate your position i do not understand how you intend to stop him corbulo gave him a look teachers reserve for their slowest pupils but collega stood his ground and returned the stare it is late in the season and he must move quickly if he is to force the mountain passes before the first snows the governor explained patiently he cannot delay because he knows that tiridates will return in the spring carrying romes blessing the armenian council will unite behind their king and the opportunity will be gone the last report from our agents shows him still in ctesiphon corbulo used a centurions vine rod to indicate a position in the centre of the map table close to a winding blue line valerius calculated must be the tigris river which means that even if he has already marched he cannot be any further than this position today the tip of the vine rod moved north i think there is no doubt that he intends to reconquer the land his brother has negotiated away by first taking tigranocerta the fortress city which guards the only road north and then turning northeast by the sea of van to reach the capital artaxata this is how i will stop him he used the vine rod as a measure to indicate the distance between antioch and tigranocerta then between vologases army and the city when it was done his face broke into a savage grin that revealed corbulo the warrior we will have at least six days march on him i intend to consolidate my position by garrisoning the fort at zeugma and the euphrates crossing with a vexillation of three cohorts from the fifteenth apollinaris and a mixed cavalry and infantry force of cappadocian auxiliaries then i will march the tenth fretensis and the bulk of the fifteenth to here north of gazarta where i will intercept my enemy and defeat him he looked around the room the pale eyes daring any man to contradict him valerius was stunned by the audacity of the plan and more so by the fact that corbulo was offering his head on a plate to his enemies he remembered vespasians warning did he want to be liked or valued he opened his mouth to speak with the greatest of respect general collegas voice shook slightly as he interrupted to take such a course of action would be at best risking your command at worst he faded away as if his tongue was unwilling to speak the word they were all thinking you intend to meet a force of seventy thousand parthians with a roman one of not much more than twenty thousand this is a campaign which warrants months of preparation yet you give us only days victory is far from certain defeat would leave syria open to king vologases army and risk the loss of the entire roman east vespasian would be trapped between a victorious parthian army and the judaean rebels who have already proved they can be a match for a roman legion i beg you to reconsider valerius came to attention bringing a glare from corbulo and a look of hatred from mucianus that almost stopped his tongue i must agree with general collega in my opinion you would be risking too much for too little even meeting such a formidable army on favourable terms would be dangerous to meet them with such a weak force seems madness corbulos arid voice completed the sentence for him mucianus pushed his way round the table to face valerius so the palatines spy shows his true colours and becomes an expert in eastern warfare in the same instant what does a mere tribune know of grand strategy we have been fighting these barbarians since you were issued your first caligae soldier and thanks to this man whose reputation you have the audacity to demean we have defeated them every time we have met them i am not let us not fight among ourselves when the enemy may already be on the march corbulo stepped in front of mucianus and turned to valerius and collega everything you say is true no one knows better than i what we risk by this strategy yet i believe there is no other way may i explain collega bowed and stepped back from the table my good friend general mucianus is correct that we have been facing the parthians and their armenian allies for more years than i care to remember no matter how many times we defeated them no matter how strong the defences we put in place along the euphrates they were always a threat to syria and by extension to asia and the east until now i know tiridates he is not his brother he would rather hold what he has than risk everything again with tiridates on the throne there is an opportunity for lasting peace but he must be allowed to take that throne and rule with romes blessing if we stand back and allow vologases to invade armenia we will be in danger of throwing away everything we have won everything roman soldiers have fought and died for in those godscursed mountains for twelve long years armenia will become a parthian state and our weakened condition ensures that vologases will have the leisure to consolidate his rule i will not let that happen corbulo straightened and his voice took on a power that mesmerized every man in the room once before i stood on the banks of a river and obeyed a command not to cross that river was the rhenus and the command came from my emperor divine claudius the german tribes were in disarray and at each others throats they were ripe for defeat we had an opportunity to smash their power for a dozen generations to emasculate them and enslave their warriors to extend romes rule as far as germanicus who died in this very city dreamed but i turned back and what has happened we have had to fight each and every day since to keep what is ours thousands of brave men have died and worse our timidity has encouraged the tribes of the east to test themselves against us not just on the rhenus but also on the danuvius none of this would have happened if i had had the courage to do what was right but the emperor collega said the emperor and his advisers must do as they see fit just as gnaeus domitius corbulo will corbulo slapped the table indicating that the time for argument was over now to the details we will march in two days general mucianus will rule syria while i am beyond the frontier you gaius collega will hold the bridge at zeugma as the next hour unfolded valerius was astonished at corbulos grasp of every aspect of warfare he outlined the timings routes of march and even rations per man for each of the legions involved to casperius niger who took notes as corbulo rapped out a string of commands and finally to the mounted element of the main force as we know from long experience our cavalry is the key element in any combat with parthian forces parthian mounted archers are among the best in the world we have been relearning that lesson ever since crassus was taught it so painfully at carrhae the other generals murmured agreement and valerius understood that the threat must be very real once we are in the hills they will attempt to divide us using hit and run attacks from ambush and weakening us in a thousand pointless skirmishes anything but meet us in a fullscale battle but time is my enemys enemy parthia is a fractious state and the bulk of its army is drawn from those of a hundred different warlords vologases knows that he cannot stray from home for long or he will return to find another man on his throne if we can convince his soldiers that they only have death to look forward to and not plunder they will start thinking about home hearth and wife the legions which march to meet vologases will be accompanied by three regiments of mixed cavalry six alae of numidian light cavalry and eight of mounted archers from syria thracia cappadocia and phrygia a force of close to ten thousand men gaius valerius verrens will command that force for a moment the room went very still and valerius would swear the birds stopped singing in the trees outside the window mucianus predictably was the first to find his voice you would place your fate in the hands of this untested puppy he spluttered hardly untested and the puppy has teeth corbulo smiled valerius verrens is a hero of rome holder of the gold crown of valour last survivor of the temple of claudius in colonia and scourge of the rebel queen boudicca you have commanded mounted troops in africa valerius was as taken aback by his appointment as mucianus but only as part of legionary punitive expeditions what is this but a large scale punitive expedition corbulo demanded of the room in any case it must be enough the coordination between cavalry and the heavy infantry of the legions will be vital i need a soldier with a proven record as a fighting officer and experience of combined operations he turned to valerius your light cavalry will be issued with double the standard number of javelins and the archers will take as many arrows as they can carry i know it will create weight issues but we will conserve their energy as much as we can on the march do you have any questions at least a hundred were running through valeriuss mind but they were questions he had to ask himself not the governor they would have to wait the conference broke up with mucianus still eyeing valerius suspiciously but as the other legates left collega approached to shake the wooden hand and wish him luck until i saw the hand i had not realized you were the same verrens you served with my brother marcus in the twentieth and he spoke highly of you valerius thanked him you were right to speak out and you though i doubt you made yourself popular among the governors inner circle they are very protective of his reputation which is a fine one perhaps yes i may have done him an injustice i have not served with him as long as some but i have seen him on campaign and i respect his reputation he is a man who knows his own mind and once it is made up he is unlikely to change it but if corbulo believes he can win it would take a brave man to think otherwise as collega left the general called valerius back to the table the first lesson a military commander learns is always to expect the unexpected i must be seen to send vespasian my most experienced cavalry leaders therefore i must make do with what i have you need not concern yourself with tactical considerations the prefects of the cavalry units are veterans who know their business your job is to provide leadership and coordinate their actions with those of the infantry do not let me down he tapped the map rock and dust chasm and cliff it looks formidable but we have been there before we know the ground and we know the risks water for the men and fodder for the horses will be of vital importance but i trust niger to take care of that he chewed his lip and his eye fixed on a single portion of the map the key is that we know the ground valerius waited for more than a minute in silence sir corbulos grey eyes speared him one thing you must learn tribune is that i do not care to be plagued with details valerius cleared his throat i carry a personal message from general vespasian to be delivered in private corbulo went very still then deliver it he said tell general corbulo that whatever he decides i will support him the governor frowned the lines on his cheeks and brow creating dark fissures clearly the message troubled him those were his exact words valerius nodded corbulo gave a sour smile more politics valerius turned to go but a word from the general stopped him i have spoken to young crescens you were correct an impressive soldier and of good family you may tell him that he is to join the staff of the tenth for the campaign ahead valerius left the room with his head spinning he suddenly realized how far out of his depth he was taking a legion and its cavalry contingent on a fourday expedition into the atlas mountains was entirely different from leading ten thousand men into one of the most inhospitable places on earth he had an incredible amount to do in the few short hours before they marched not only did he have to organize his own depleted equipment for a campaign that could take as long as two months he had to find out what he could about the units which would be serving under him and the officers who commanded them but where to start he had a vision of a swarthy face niger would know niger seemed to know everything suddenly something occurred to him and he couldnt help smiling at the brilliance of it at a stroke corbulo had thwarted any plans he might have made to carry out paulinuss investigation the army of the easts overworked cavalry commander would be fortunate to have a spare minute for weeks to come on his way to consult niger he called at the slave quarters for serpentius how are they treating you ive been in worse billets the spaniard grunted they wanted me to clean out the stables but after i told the overseer i only answered to you and id cut off his balls if he thought otherwise they seemed to see reason valerius laughed youll have the chance to shovel dung another time for the moment i need you to put together the essentials for a twomonth campaign in the mountains well be fried during the day frozen during the night and the chances are some bearded parthian will want our balls to take home as a present for his wife he handed over the small wooden tablet which bore his seal of office from now on you are my freedman not my slave that means i can conscript you into the army and no ones going to kill you for it except the enemy take this to the beneficiarius and get yourself a uniform weapons and armour then check with the cavalry out by the gate those veterans have been fighting parthians for years and theyll certainly have added a few modifications that will help stop an arrow oh and remember to sign up to the funeral fund serpentius reached for the bronze plaque at his neck and untied it it was the manumission valerius had granted him after their nearfatal mission for nero almost three years earlier not that the emperor knew anything about it his late wife poppaea had been grateful enough to grease the wheels that would allow a gladiator his freedom the spaniard was as hard as the mountains that bred him and valerius had never seen him show emotion but there was a catch in his throat when he spoke i suppose no man is ever truly free but i havent felt like a slave since that day on the danuvius when the dacians were chasing us with their skinning knives i always knew there would be a time though and i suppose this is as good as any when i was waiting to fight in the arena i used to dream of this day but i never really thought it would happen i suppose no valerius stopped him with a smile theres no point in thanking someone whos probably going to get you killed serpentius sniffed and brusquely changed the subject what about horses those spavined bowlegged nags they gave us at the port wont last a day where were going im supposed to be in charge of a cavalry wing valerius shrugged well be in trouble if they cant provide their new commander with a decent horse by now it was clear that the sense of suppressed excitement from the conference had infused the entire palace as word spread that the legions were on the move he found tiberius outside in the grounds the young man was talking to a senior officer in the shadow of a grove of carob trees but by the time valerius reached him the other man had disappeared my apologies tiberius the general wanted me to tell you myself but i see you already know tiberius looked up sharply but relaxed when he recognized valerius i would not have this posting if it hadnt been for you tribune they tell me that the tenth will soon be on the move judaea i expect with general vespasian and titus serpentius gave him a wry smile of congratulation and valerius drew the young man aside you are not going to judaea tiberius he said quietly the tenth will be moving northeast into armenia we have information that a parthian army is on the march and general corbulo intends to intercept it there will be a battle tiberius looked puzzled and his eyes went cold was it possible that the young man was frightened it seemed unlikely but it was conceivable no matter how proficient a soldier was with his weapons the thought of his first real battle was enough to turn the veins to ice water but the expression only lasted a heartbeat before the young tribune recovered and his face broke into a grin so i am to be blooded at last i have waited for so long it could only be better if you were able to fight by my side valerius heard a whisper in his head he had a momentary vision of the younger tribune with blood on his face but he kept his smile steady i will ask the general tiberius he exchanged glances with serpentius who knows what can be arranged xxiii valerius awoke in darkness his head buzzing with the information hed had to absorb and the details he would have to deal with in the coming twentyfour hours of the seventeen auxiliary cavalry regiments which were now his responsibility apart from escort detachments only one the thracian third augusta was camped nearby and that at cyrrhus a good fifty miles to the east the rest were scattered across northern syria or on the cappadocian frontier with armenia and were already making their way to zeugma where the army would converge to make the crossing of the euphrates it meant he had to decide whether to ride out immediately after corbulos morning briefing or wait until the tenth had assembled and march with them he washed and shaved in the baked clay basin the servant had brought before oiling the stump of his arm and fitting the carved walnut hand on its leather stock he had decided not to wake serpentius the spaniards ingenuity and patience had been tested to the limit the previous day begging stealing and borrowing but mostly stealing the equipment they would need for the campaign and the mules to carry it when every unit and every officer was frantically seeking the same thing no legion or auxiliary cohort would go on campaign underequipped if it could find a way to avoid it valerius had spent his time with casperius niger attempting to solve the problem of the extra javelins and arrows his cavalrymen would have to carry the syrian armouries in antioch palmyra damascus and tyrus had been working night and day since the beginning of the judaean insurrection a year earlier but it wasnt just a question of sourcing the weapons valerius had to know how many extra spears a cavalryman and his mount were capable of carrying on the march how many mules and camels would be needed to transport the numbers required to make up the shortfall in the generals order how much fodder would be needed for the mules and how many mules and camels would be needed for the extra fodder for the transport animals was it any wonder his head ached as if it was the morning after the last day of saturnalia he was struggling into his sculpted leather breastplate when serpentius appeared yawning in the doorway to help him i told you to sleep until dawn valerius admonished him this could be the last time you have the opportunity ill have plenty of time to sleep when im dead the spaniard grunted how could i lie there and listen to you cursing over those straps you remind me of a turtle thats ended up on its back valerius didnt bother to reply he was proud of his ability to get in and out of the armour despite his missing hand and he didnt care to be reminded that it sometimes took him longer than he liked when youve eaten get the horses and the mules ready we may have to leave when ive finished with the general and hunt up some bread and olives and some wine for the journey i doubt well be stopping before nightfall he pretended not to hear serpentiuss mutter that it was only the mad and foolish who rode through the midday sun and killed themselves and their horses gnaeus domitius corbulo looked fresh and relaxed when valerius was ushered into his room the young roman was again surprised that the only other person present was domitia who sat a little to one side of the desk and more surprised still by what he witnessed as he waited in front of the general instead of the usual tidy pile of scrolls sat a wooden gaming board and as corbulo reeled off a string of military roles letters and numbers domitia would take a carved wooden replica of the soldier he referred to and place it on a given square marked on the board when they had placed ten or twelve of the figures she smiled at her father and removed the pieces from the board again corbulo then closed his eyes while she mixed up the pieces and placed them on different squares now he opened his eyes and domitia counted to ten before sweeping the pieces off the board and into a basket at her feet cavalryman c c d legionary d d d cataphract f f f mounted archer f the game was repeated three times more as valerius watched and as far as he could see the general did not get a single figure out of place he found himself astonished by the mental dexterity corbulo had cultivated and wondered at its purpose for if there was one thing he now realized syrias governor never did anything without a purpose domitia whispered something to her father and the general glanced up my apologies tribune he said gruffly one becomes engrossed it is a game but a useful one since i believe it aids the memory which in my case is not what it once was would you care to try the offer was made lightly but the tone contained a hint of challenge that was mirrored in domitias dark eyes valerius had never shirked a challenge he took his place in front of the desk and studied the board which was split lengthwise into twelve sections eight deep a through to h corbulo indicated the depth and one to twelve ninetysix squares on which my daughter will place twelve figures all you have to do is memorize which figure is on which square it seemed almost childish valerius had studied under seneca committing vast tracts of dull stoic philosophy to memory his time in the law courts and as chief of staff to the proconsul of africa had given him a mind as sharp as one of the jewelled ceremonial swords the governor displayed on his wall close your eyes domitia said softly and her voice transported him back to the shipwreck beach smoke still heavy in the air soft sand and a lithe sinuous body twisting against his now he opened them again but his brain seemed to be frozen solid he felt the first thrill of panic as domitia began her relentless count ten a slim arm swept the pieces from the board how you dont have time to think on the battlefield corbulo barked come on man valerius licked his lips cavalryman d d f he shook his head legionary a a corbulo drew an impatient breath and valerius rapped out the rest of the names and numbers by pure guesswork when he was finished the generals face was grim valerius had managed a pathetic five out of twelve correct perhaps we should move on but valerius had looked into domitias eyes and seen the flare of victory there and in that instant it came to him this wasnt a game it was a battle he remembered how it had been in the field before colonia with the howls of fifty thousand celtic champions in his ears and the scents of blood death and fear that had filled the air like a fog the flash of swords and constant threat of spear and arrow that had dulled the mind and cloaked the rest of the battlefield from him he had found himself operating on two levels the here where blade sank into cringing flesh and shield beat off one screaming tattooed attacker after the other and the above in that place of calm where the mind took in every subtle change in the pulse of the battle and he could feel its rise and fall like the breast of a sleeping woman one more time corbulo snorted and shook his head but domitia reached for the first figure the battle calm absorbed valerius now when the silken voice whispered that he should shut his eyes and he heard the pieces falling into place on the partitioned maplewood it was as if he could see where each was placed and when he opened them again it was as if they had never been closed the figures and their locations seared themselves on the surface of his eyes and when it came time to place them he reeled off the locations without pausing for breath the general grunted approval fortuna favoured you this time valerius shrugged why dont we find out but this time double the number of figures domitias face lit up at this impertinence and she gave a delighted laugh impossible the general sniffed i have only eighteen his daughter said innocently perhaps father should try first corbulo glared at the girl but the impish look on her face overcame his irritation and when he turned to valerius he was smiling i think we have had enough games for the moment you have made your point tribune now to business i have arranged for the prefect of the thracian third augusta to join us here with as many of his senior officers as he can spare from the preparations that will allow you to take the measure of your new command while we are on the march to cyrrhus i was a cavalry prefect myself and we are arrogant creatures but if you can win his respect he will be able to teach you much that will be of use before you are called on to put it into practice you will find that cavalrymen are as fickle as their horses but guide them with a firm hand and they will never let you down report back to me when you have seen him valerius thanked him on the subject of horses sir ive been having trouble finding suitable mounts for myself and my freedman i have conscripted him to the ranks as an auxiliary acting and unpaid of course corbulo gave a thin smile naturally i have already heard tales of his bargaining skills and certain mysterious losses mucianus was most put out he is oldfashioned in his way and the thought of a slave wearing the emperors uniform had him calling for the lictors but i have seen your man exercising and i can understand why you would want him close and with a sword in his hand he looks quite impressive a spaniard i would guess from his looks and his tongue valerius nodded a spaniard and a gladiator a formidable combination would that more of my army had his bloodline and his temper in any case there will be no further obstructions a cavalrytrained horse is at a premium in these troubled times but i will issue orders that your needs be met as he was leaving valeriuss eye was drawn to what looked like a model of a siege tower on a cabinet by the doorway corbulo noticed his interest another diversion of mine and one of my own invention it is based on caesar i call it caesars tower valerius saw now that the tower consisted of four of the boards they had played the memory game on set eight inches apart one on top of the other caesar was a game contested on a single level by legionaries in their short hours of leisure time the two players each had twelve identical markers white for one side and blue for the opponent in addition each had a thirteenth smaller counter about the size of a rabbit dropping the large markers could only move a single square at a time in any direction but caesar the small token ruled the board and could move anywhere as long as it was in a straight line the aim of the game was to capture the opponents stones by ambushing them between two of your own and it ended when one side captured the others caesar it was a game of strategy that could be fiendishly complex when played by two skilled players but this was different i have developed it so that it is played in three dimensions corbulo continued i have never been defeated he smiled at his daughter though domitia has come close perhaps when we are on campaign you would care to try valerius could think of no worse field punishment than spending his nights being made to look a fool by his commanding officer but he was a soldier and sometimes a soldier had to make sacrifices of course i would be delighted domitia picked up the kitten which had been rubbing itself against her feet and stroked it if the tribune could spare an hour this afternoon perhaps i could teach him the basics of the game corbulo blinked and valerius thought he saw a flare of suspicion in the grey eyes he struck before it could develop into something worse i fear i will be too busy with our preparations lady he said quickly perhaps when we return such a pity the darkhaired girl pouted my father takes so much delight in beating his enemies into submission that it would have done him good to face someone who might show him the meaning of humility while corbulo glowered valerius bowed his farewell and made his escape it occurred to him that domitia was more dangerous than boudicca xxiv valeriuss thracian cavalry escort set up camp outside antioch close to the temporary mudbrick fort that was currently home to the legio tenth fretensis when they were settled valerius rode out to greet its commander a solemn bearded young man who introduced himself as claudius hanno a roman citizen but born and brought up by his syrian parents in the oasis city of palmyra the main thracian force remained at cyrrhus halfway to the crossing point of the euphrates hanno reported their readiness was high although he produced the usual list of complaints about the quality of the replacement horses and equipment they had been given it will be good for once to have a friend at headquarters anything you can get for us in the way of harness and saddlery would help boots too the desert air is not kind to leather professional eyes ran over valeriuss horse though i see from your mare that it is not worth begging for a new batch of remounts hannos mood brightened when valerius revealed corbulos order for the cavalry to carry extra javelins he has something special in mind for us then the syrian grinned the general always thinks two moves ahead of any other commander he is a great man he said almost reverentially when he led us to artaxata he cut through the enemy like a sword piercing a beating heart the booty we collected there made me a rich man may the gods give me time to spend it on the rhenus or in britain an auxiliary ala milliara would be a flexible mixed unit equally split between cavalry and infantry in syria since the threat from the parthians was mainly horseborne and because of the vast distances they had to patrol the third thracians were a thousandstrong wing of mounted archers and spearmen valerius watched as hanno put the fifty men of his escort detachment through a series of exercises designed to show off their skills the roman had worked with cavalry often enough but he was impressed by the horsemanship speed and agility of the thracians the spearmen would ride full pelt at a manshaped target launch a pair of spears and turn almost in the same instant and they never missed the mark they rode in twos and swapped mounts in midstride they leapt from the saddle and raced round behind their horses before remounting at the run the archers could turn backwards in the saddle fire three unerringly accurate arrows over their mounts tail and return to a normal riding position in less time than it takes to tell it afterwards hanno showed him the bow his men used an exotic recurved weapon made of wood bone and sinew that was half the length of the hunting bow valerius had once owned but shot arrows twice as far valerius commented that the auxiliaries whether carrying bow or spear seldom touched the reins to control their mounts hanno nodded gravely all of our horses are trained to respond to heel and knee as well as to harness it is a skill you will be familiar with the syrian suggested nodding in the direction of valeriuss wooden hand valerius smiled remembering the long hours of practice and the number of times he and hercules had parted company as they decided to go in different directions the horse he had been given at seleucia was only trained to the rein that didnt matter too much on the road but it would be different in battle when he would need his left hand for a sword i will require such a horse when we cross the euphrates he said of course hanno bowed but if you are prepared to wait i will choose him personally from our herd at cyrrhus you will have plenty of time to get to know him on the march by the time we reach tigranocerta you will have a proper cavalrymans swagger and a proper cavalrymans backside made of leather valerius joined in the laughter and decided he was fortunate to have this man under his command dusk had fallen by the time he returned to the palace but he decided it would be unwise to ignore corbulos instruction to report on his progress he walked quickly through tiled corridors lit by oil lamps that created shadows on the painted walls and the statues of great men which lined them two guards checked him before he entered the generals private quarters but there were none outside the study where he had met corbulo that morning which presumably meant he must be elsewhere in the palace valerius turned to go and froze it was the rhythm his mind detected first not his ears because the sound was barely even a sound his mind as if he could feel someones heartbeat in the air slowly he turned back to the doorway and moved the curtain a handspan aside now the sound was clearer a gentle rhythmic hiss as if a hunted deer had stopped to listen with the breath blowing softly through its nostrils everything seemed peaceful yet he could feel the danger as if someone had doused him with a bucket of ice water his eyes ranged over the small area of the room he could see through the gap and his heart stopped as they fell on the kitten puss puss she lay on her side in the centre of the marble floor with her front legs stretched out straight and two tiny spots of red halfway along the pale fur of her side he froze as he noticed the animals face her eyes were wide and her lips drawn back in a rictus of agony showing every tiny fang puss puss was dead but what had killed her what was making the noise his hand crept to his belt and he cursed as he remembered he had handed his sword in at the palace entrance still he couldnt ignore the threat an inch at a time he squeezed through the doorway careful not to move the curtain and alert whatever or whoever was waiting for him inside gradually more of the room came into view on the far side partially obscured by a highbacked couch domitia crouched in a corner at first she seemed to be frozen in place then he noticed that her head was rocking from side to side the movement so slight that it was barely noticeable he could see her face clearly but domitias wide eyes were fixed on something in front of her hidden by the bulk of the couch he edged his way carefully to the right towards corbulos work desk still he could see nothing he dropped lightly to the floor so he could look between the legs of the couch at first whatever was there was lost in the gloom but slowly a heap of sinuous dark coils came into focus and his blood turned to ice he must have made a sound because domitia seemed to see him for the first time and her mouth opened he raised a hand for her to be still but too late because from behind the couch came a sibilant drawnout hiss and domitia drew her head back so it was touching the wall her body started to shake and he willed her to stop because he knew that any sharp movement would provoke whatever kind of snake had her trapped he looked again at the coils beneath the couch and a memory came to him of africa a hooded swaying column of pure copperscaled spite cobra think she had backed into a recess beside a statue of the emperor and she had no way of getting out without passing the snake which must be close enough to strike he had to draw it away from her draw it away and kill it but with what the only furniture in the room was the generals desk and chair a pair of couches for his guests and the cabinet on which the gaming tower sat all of them too cumbersome to use as a weapon the statue of nero was one of a number in the room including a painted bust of corbulo himself they might be used as missiles but they were heavy and unwieldy and the chances of hitting such a difficult target slim all he would do was provoke the snake into attack which might be only seconds away in any case domitia gave a convulsive sob and he knew time was running out she was as courageous as any woman he had ever met but courage had its limits and she was close to that limit now he had to do something quickly could he face it unarmed the idea filled him with panic but he must not panic find it find the calm that allowed him to win the memory game with that thought his mind cleared and everything in the room came to him the wax tablet and stylus the rolledup scrolls in their leather pouches the ceremonial swords on the wall without taking his eyes from domitia he reached behind him and groped across the painted plaster until his hand closed on a jewelled grip some decorative swords were just that an empty scabbard with a decorative pommel but this one wasnt empty and he breathed a silent prayer of thanks the blade drew easily from the elaborate sheath with only the barest imitation of the snakes hiss the gemstudded hilt made it a little awkward in his hand but the weight and balance were perfect the sword was a locally made replica of a cavalry spatha forged from the bluesheened iron that made for the strongest blades it was longer and heavier than the gladius valerius normally carried but he was as proficient with the one as the other with three strides he crossed the room and pushed the couch aside the sight of the huge snake almost paralysed him with fear it was so big that its flared head with its glinting bronzed scales and pale throat was on a level with his chest the raised body pulsed with energy and was the width of his arm at its thickest point it turned to face him in a single smooth movement and its fanged head drew back ready to strike the unblinking eyes like obsidian beads as they fixed him in their deadly glare domitia made an involuntary movement and the monsters awful gaze was drawn back to the crouching figure valerius raised his right hand to still her instantly the black beads fixed on him he feinted with the sword staying just out of range and the giant head threatened once more he found that each move he made was replicated by the flared hood so it became almost a dance as the snake followed his sword hand there was his solution to save domitia he must become the snakes only target but how to do it without sacrificing himself and leaving her to its mercy he could see the wicked hooked fangs in the creamy white mouth and he imagined the glistening drop of poison in each tip one scratch from those needle points and the venom would condemn him to a terrible agonizing death the snake let out a long hiss and he sensed that its patience was at an end as he edged closer it became visibly more agitated he held the sword high and ready to swing he must draw the strike and draw it so that in the same instant the blue blade swept down to bite into that scaled body he stepped towards the snake reaching out with his right hand and immediately the great serpents head whipped forward with an astonishing speed and power valerius flailed with the sword but the cobra was already inside his swing and he felt a shocking blow that numbed his right arm and made him cry out in horror from somewhere close he heard a scream that echoed his own fear he had gambled that the snake would be drawn to the walnut fist but the gamble had failed the whiplash strike had taken the flared head beyond the wooden lure to the thick muscled part of valeriuss forearm yet even in the instant his mind told him he was dead he realized that fortuna had favoured him instead of plunging into unguarded flesh the terrible fangs were hooked into the thick leather stock that held the walnut hand in place jets of pale venom already darkening the tanned cowhide panicking he swung the sword again but the cobras writhing coils made an almost impossible target as they whipped forward against his legs horrible clinging and sinuous he only managed to inflict a cut which enraged the beast further he felt the moment when it tried to withdraw and come erect for a second lethal strike the wide head shaking his arm with incredible force as it tried to free itself but the fangs were sunk deep in the tough leather like a pair of barbed hooks valerius knew he had only moments with a last convulsive heave the snake broke clear but even as its head swayed back and the power flowed into its neck the young romans brain had calculated speed and distance and angle and the long blue sword flashed out to meet the snakes strike and this time the edge cut deep into the body just below the flared hood the cobra thrashed back and forth in its agony and the fanged head whipped by a hairs breadth from his face it was dying but not dead and valerius placed himself for another cut as it fell back to writhe on the marble floor the long sword rose and fell the bright iron cleaving the sinuous body in two and clanging against the stone breathing hard valerius took a step back and stood head bowed over the still twitching body of the giant serpent he heard a slight noise behind him and turned with the blade raised to strike that is no way to treat a fine sword tribune see the marble has nicked the edge gnaeus domitius corbulos voice was controlled but his face had the sheen of polished ivory and his hand shook as he held it out to take the ceremonial spatha which he wiped and replaced in its scabbard he raised domitia to her feet on trembling legs come my dear you are safe now you were not touched nevertheless you should see my physician before they reached the door she dropped her fathers hand and walked slowly back to where valerius still stood halfparalysed and as spent as he had ever been after a battle he saw the dark eyes flinch as they looked again on the cobra lying in two pieces its blood staining the white marble for a moment it was as if they were the only two people in the world and he wanted more than anything to take her into his arms and comfort her he knew that a single movement from him would make it happen but he also understood that to make the movement would bring disaster he could feel corbulos stare and hear his hoarse breathing domitia saw it and took strength from the decision he made for them both she drew herself up to her full height it seems that once again i must thank you for saving me tribune you should know that i came to my fathers quarters to continue the game of caesar we had begun i had pondered a move that would confound him and thought to astonish him with it on his return it was only when the snake killed my kitten that i became aware of its presence you must have heard my cry there had been no cry but it was a convenient explanation and avoided further questions it wasnt only in politics that innocence was sometimes no defence valerius bowed his head it was fortunate that i came to deliver my report at just the right moment i am only glad i was able to help he turned to her father what i dont understand is how such a large snake should be able to make its way so far into the palace unseen corbulos eyes went cold stranger still that it is a species i have never heard of being found so close to the coast this was no accident tribune you have many duties but i must ask you to carry out an investigation question my guards find out who was in a position to deliver the snake and find out who gave the order we have an assassin among us xxv they found him early the next morning valerius had spent the rest of the evening questioning the legionaries of the headquarters guard the centurion of the detachment all men of the tenth fretensis who had proved themselves unfailingly loyal to the governor explained what valerius already knew guards patrolled the exterior of the palace day and night with pairs alternating at each of the entrances including the one leading to the palace from the slave quarters within the palace itself only a few corridors connecting the working rooms and the governors personal quarters were continuously under guard and corbulos private offices were only secured when he was there by the team of men tasked with his close protection from the answers he received valerius put together a list of people who had used the corridors in the hours before domitia encountered the cobra he placed domitia at the top of the list and himself in second place they were followed by the senior officers who had visited corbulo during the day finally there were a dozen or so slaves who had access to the governors rooms to bring him food clean and carry out all the normal domestic tasks of a slave in a roman household when the list was complete he took it to corbulo to update him on his progress im sure theres nothing youd enjoy more than interrogating legate mucianus the general said but he and his camp prefect tribune niger and legate traianus all came to see me while i was there and left immediately for the moment concentrate on the slaves valerius sought out serpentius who despite his new freedmans status preferred to live in the slave quarters if i question them alone he explained theyll tell me what they think i want to hear your presence always ensures a little more objectivity well make these four our priority according to the guards they were all carrying some kind of container the spaniard looked over the list i think you can forget perellia from what i hear she does a lot more than give the governor his massage at bath time big girl dark hair and well set up if she wanted to murder him she wouldnt need a snake she could kill him with kindness if you get my meaning but she was carrying a basket which still makes her a suspect youre probably right but the governor isnt going to thank us for taking his concubine off the list well question her first but when they ordered the overseer a syrian freedman to fetch the four slaves they discovered they had more pressing problems than perellias basket im sorry sir the terrified man was visibly quaking as he confessed turpio is missing turpio is the slave who was to replace the governors linen yes sir is there any reason why he should leave the slave quarters at night the overseer shook his head he should have been locked in with the rest they said he went to the latrina and didnt return who are his friends valerius demanded come on man he must have had friends how long has he been gone three hours the man confirmed they thought nothing of it sometimes sometimes he sold himself to the guards serpentius gave a grunt that might have been a laugh now they understood why the syrian was so frightened if turpio was regularly allowed to slink out of the slave quarters it meant that the overseer or his deputy was getting a cut of whatever he was earning three hours valerius calculated he could be five or six miles away by now serpentius get me the guard commander the centurion arrived blearyeyed and belligerent but valerius had no time for niceties it seems you may have allowed the man who tried to kill the governor to escape the soldiers face went pale and it was clear valerius now had his attention i want patrols on the main road to seleucia and daphne and on the roads north and west every other man will search the palace and the surrounding area when the centurion had rushed out shouting orders to his men valerius turned to serpentius let me know if they find him though i doubt if they will hed have to be a fool to stay near the palace hell either be hiding in the city with his accomplices or somewhere on the road where he feels safe where will you be valerius yawned in bed one way or the other its going to be a busy day it was easy to see why they hadnt found turpio in the night who would have thought to look in the river the body lay face up and trapped between a fallen branch and a large rock turpios young features were the bloodless fishbelly white of unpainted marble and his mouth hung open showing yellow teeth and a stump of tongue at first valerius thought it had been cut out which seemed overly cautious if you were going to kill the man anyway on closer investigation however it seemed that it like his eyes had become a delicacy for the pair of ravens that had perched on his chest until he was discovered by a legionary making his discreet morning libation to the orontes the rock lay less than four paces from the bank and valerius could clearly see the vivid scar of the second smile that had been opened below turpios chin well never know who he was working with now serpentius said cheerfully he must have been meeting someone who had promised to pay him or help him escape maybe both whoever it was decided they couldnt rely on him to keep his mouth shut they waited while two legionaries dragged the body to the bank turpios threadbare tunic was ripped probably where it had caught on the branch that had kept him from floating downriver towards seleucia pieria the chest from the throat down had been sheeted with blood but was now a washedout pink valerius bent over the body and examined the wound it ran horizontally from one side of the neck to the other obscene and pinklipped and deep enough to have cut almost to the spine the spaniard crouched beside him a nice piece of work valerius was happy for serpentius to take the lead the gladiator knew more about creating wounds like these than was good for a man sword work see too deep and clean for a knife if the killer was standing in front of him and too straight if he came from behind one quick professional stroke that took out the big veins on either side and the windpipe too turpio the snake charmer would have bled out in about a minute and he wouldnt have made a sound your man probably used a spatha or something similar because if it had been a gladius he would have been covered with blood gladiator work he rose to his feet and pirouetted at the same time drawing his long sword and carving the air in a single whispering sweep that had the men standing closest stepping back maybe he would have got a few spots on his clothes or his boots but it would only be noticeable if you really looked dump the body in the river and then go back to wherever he came from he couldnt know that turpio would hang around long enough to be found and tell us were looking for not one assassin but two whats that the spaniard pointed at turpios clenched fist where a scrap of green was just visible valerius forced back the dead fingers and pulled out a ragged fragment of bright green cloth the same green cloth that the tunics and cloaks of the auxiliary escort were manufactured from cavalry serpentius suggested valerius looked across the river to where antioch was beginning to shimmer in the heat of the morning it would make sense when you combine it with the heavy sword the parthians then this king vologases must have spies in antioch even amongst the governors servants and the syrian auxiliaries who to my thinking would as well be parthian as roman if he believes general corbulo is planning to move against him it would make a kind of sense to kill him a knife direct to the heart of the enemy and a snake is a very eastern method of murder thats true but there is another possibility who supplied the escort valerius nodded the syrian auxiliaries are attached to the sixth ferrata the scythians to the fifteenth apollinaris so mucianus and collega gaius pompeius collega is not one of the favoured inner circle and its plain he disagrees with corbulos plan what if he decided that the best way to gain the emperors favour was to remove a man who is not only exceeding his orders but is also for all his protestations of loyalty a potential rival but but i have only met him once but collega seems too honourable your friend mucianus then the roman grinned much as i would like it to be mucianus has more to lose than to gain from corbulos death he is the governors man linked to him through years of service and patronage a commotion behind them heralded the arrival of the governor amidst a cloud of bodyguards corbulo was accompanied by his legionary commanders and valerius found himself once more the target of mucianuss unforgiving stare the guards opened warily to allow corbulo forward and serpentius stepped back with a bow to give him room to join valerius by the body so my assassin is dead it appears so valerius kept his voice neutral he had the opportunity to place the snake in your quarters and he ran when the crime was discovered unfortunately we had no opportunity to question him his fellow slaves say they know nothing of his movements outside the palace but he had arrangements which allowed him to come and go more or less as he pleased he mentioned the slaves sideline and corbulo grunted in a way that said that someone would pay for the lapse he undoubtedly had the opportunity to meet contacts in the city or among the men of the four syrian legions who spend their furloughs here he explained serpentiuss theory about the way the man had died it seems certain that he met his killer in the gardens last night but we had more than two hundred men searching the palace grounds including a century from the tenth fretensis surely you dont believe one of them killed him corbulo rapped the men of my personal guard all have years of service under my command and the tenth is the most loyal of all my legions valerius could have pointed out that the more trusted a man became the more dangerous he could be in any case loyalty could be bought and sold like any other commodity all that mattered was the price he stood his ground there is no guarantee that he was murdered before the hunt began the only way to be certain is to question the searchers individually and crosscheck their movements against each other which would take days and have little hope of success valerius admitted he showed the governor the scrap of green cloth this was found in the dead mans hand corbulo frowned and rubbed the rough fabric between his fingers someone from an auxiliary cavalry unit it is possible valerius told him we cant be sure there is one thing yes judging by the type of wound the murderers uniform may have been spotted with turpios blood the governor shook his head we do not have time to search every tent no but if you order every second man to check his tentmates clothing and vice versa its possible we will find our killer in less than an hour corbulo studied valerius with increased respect then do it valerius issued the order and corbulo went back to the palace only to return twenty minutes later when the reports began to come in as the units concluded their searches nothing no general i sir you should see this the centurion of the guard addressed his words to corbulo he carried something in his right hand and refused to meet valeriuss eyes what is it the man held up a pair of the nailed sandals every legionary wore corbulos eyes hardened as he recognized the familiar stains on the leather strapping blood he demanded where were they found in the slave quarters and who do they belong to him every eye followed the pointing finger to serpentius the guards took time to react a long moment of dangerous silence that was broken by serpentiuss bitter laugh corbulo flinched as if hed been struck and his bodyguard moved forward with a low growl their swords ready to cut down the murderer at the generals command the spaniards hand hovered over his sword hilt and valerius knew that the moment he touched it he was a dead man wait corbulos head snapped round and the look in his eyes told valerius that serpentiuss wasnt the only life on the line you dare to interfere with justice you who brought this assassin to my home valerius kept his voice calm justice is only justice if you have the killer general you say he is innocent i say that a pair of bloody sandals isnt enough to condemn a man they were less than an hour ago when the man in question was not your servant did you not tell me the wound was made by a spatha in expert hands who is more expert than a former gladiator take him serpentius was standing in the centre of the four armed legionaries of the guard and valerius saw him tense another second and there would be blood on the ground and men would be screaming ask him if the sandals are his he said quietly corbulo raised his hand and serpentius relaxed as the guard backed away well the spaniard stared at him with eyes so full of menace that for a moment even valerius wondered if he had misplaced his trust no you can prove this serpentius shrugged even a fool can see that these are not a slaves corbulos nostrils flared at the implied insult but the spaniard appeared not to notice my sandals are standard issue the leather is hard as mahogany wood and i have to replace the studs every two weeks he bent and unwound the leather ties holding his left shoe here he handed it to the general my spares are the same those belong to a rich man an officer corbulo weighed the sandal in his hand he motioned for one of the bloodspattered pair and compared the two it was immediately clear that the second was of a much superior construction and the leather softer and more expensive he studied serpentius like an undertaker measuring a client for a shroud but the spaniard met his gaze without flinching you will vouch for your man he demanded turning to valerius you are certain this is not his sandal valerius nodded i would trust this man with my life that is not what i asked it is not his sandal i would swear it on the altar of the temple of mars the eagles eyes darted from one to the other and valerius could feel his heart thundering in his ears eventually the general tossed the sandal back to the spaniard and valerius dared to breathe once more corbulo nodded and valerius knew that the incident would never be spoken of again he had made his decision and it was as final as any court of law i do not have time for these distractions we have a war to fight and it seems i will be safer in my campaign tent than in my own palace he turned to casperius niger who stood at his shoulder are the preparations in place the camp prefect nodded then we will march at dawn verrens valerius straightened and corbulo handed back the scrap of green neither of the two auxiliary units which supplied the escort will cross the euphrates they will help screen the sixth ferrata and the third gallica on the march south to join vespasian i will leave it to you to organize their replacements with casperius you will suspend your investigations for the moment valerius saluted and corbulo and his aides marched off the governor spraying commands like slingshot pellets and the gods help the man who didnt catch his words the first time only mucianus lingered crouched over turpio studying the dead face and the awful red gash in the pale throat i see no murderer he said carefully all i see is a slave sacrificed for expediency he looked up and stared into valeriuss eyes i know where your loyalties lie tribune i warned general corbulo against keeping you too close it would not be the first time a killer has played rescuer to reach his victim you failed with the snake and used the generals daughter to redeem yourself i have no doubt you will try again his unrelenting gaze moved to serpentius the wiry spaniard tensed and valerius willed him to keep his hand away from his sword mucianuss face twisted into a glacial smile he has the look of a killer even without a blade in his hand but the general has been warned he will be watching you and the next time there will be no escape he turned abruptly and walked off after the governor what did he mean by knowing where your loyalties lie serpentius asked letting out a long slow breath he thinks we have been sent here by the emperor to kill corbulo the spaniard spat in the direction of the retreating legate i know who id rather kill we have enough problems without worrying about mucianus serpentius nodded like who spattered blood on those sandals general vespasians son gave you when did you steal them the spaniard feigned shock not steal my lord borrow only until my spares are mended thanks for that valerius turned to him you didnt kill him did you no but whoever did it is very good as good as you serpentius grinned i hope well find out valerius looked again at the green cloth that had been in turpios hand theres one thing i dont understand if this was planted on turpio to point us in the direction of the auxiliaries why bother implicating you bluff and double bluff it just seems too complicated theres a simpler explanation serpentius bent to tie the straps of his sandal someone in the palace hears that turpios been found with his throat cut and decides therell never be a better opportunity to get rid of us which means that we dont have just one enemy to find but two and the chances are that theyre both about to accompany us five hundred miles into armenia xxvi my cavalry commander must have a horse worthy of him if beauty is the perfection of form she was the most beautiful thing valerius had ever seen a groom held the reins to steady her noble head and gnaeus domitius corbulo proconsul of the east and governor of syria stood by her shining flank the sword that hung from the fourpommelled cavalry saddle was the ceremonial blade valerius had pulled from corbulos wall but it had been modified for war with a flourish the governor drew it free and the bluesheened blade glinted menacingly in the morning sun it has a great history and it is not right that it should spend its life as a decoration corbulos voice contained that unsettling mix of steel certainty and charm that made him who he was i have had the jewels removed and the hilt bound with leather strips to improve the grip it is a soldiers weapon now the balance is a little unusual you will notice that it is weighted towards the point but that can be an advantage when you are using a sword from horseback here take it corbulo spun the weapon with a soldiers practised hands so that the hilt was towards valerius the young roman took it remembering the weight and the feel from his encounter with the snake the swords energy ran through him like heat from a blazing fire he tried two or three cuts and it was as if the blade had a life of its own still he only had eyes for the horse and when corbulo spoke again it was with an old cavalrymans pride and a glint in his eye i owe you my daughters life tribune gaius valerius verrens not once but many times i hope you will accept this gift in part payment she is an akhalteke from my own stables the horse of kings valerius stared at the astonishing animal whose forefathers had carried alexander the great from athens to the shores of the indus freshly groomed she was a work of art in polished bronze her coat of fine hairs gleaming in the sunlight he approached the horses head and allowed her to take in his scent through wide nostrils which flared and snorted as he stroked her silken ears with his good hand only when he was sure she knew him did he look into the glistening dark eyes behind curling lashes and knew she was his for ever and he hers they are by nature a desert breed corbulo continued but she has a touch of karabakh in her not enough to affect her speed or her stamina but enough to accustom her to the mountains they are hardy stock and need little water she was long and lean with an elegantly curving neck and a proud head her breast was narrow shaped like a ships prow and made for cutting through the desert air when she was given her head to run free on the long slim legs i will call you khamsin after the hot desert wind hanno warned me about valerius thought only he must have spoken aloud because corbulo nodded yes khamsin a great name for a great horse why dont you try her the familiar soft voice was betrayed by an edge of suppressed emotion how had he not noticed she was there he turned and realized that khamsin was not the most beautiful thing in the world today that honour belonged to domitia longina corbulo she wore a long dress of virgin white belted with gold that left her shoulders bare beneath the walnut tresses that flowed left and right of her wide forehead and framed the oval of her face with your permission lady he handed over his helmet bringing a gasp of surprise from one of the watchers domitia accepted the burden and nodded imperiously as she watched valerius whispered encouragingly in the horses ear before using his left hand to help him vault into the saddle the groom handed him the reins and oblivious of all but domitias gaze he walked the mare slowly to the gate beyond the trees lining the road lay the sandy ring of the governors personal circus and it took all valeriuss patience to keep khamsin to a walk he was not the only impatient one he could sense the controlled power surging below his loins and imagined the great heart thundering in her chest she had a fine highstepping walk as befitted a mare whose sire a hundred generations earlier may have been brother to bucephalus his left hand was free to control the rein but he wrapped the leather around the walnut fist of his right and used his thighs knees and heels to command her when he reached the circus he kicked her gently into a trot feeling the freemoving muscles working sweetly beneath him as she danced across the packed sands the warm breeze kissed his face and he laughed for the joy of it khamsin felt it too pricking up her ears and shaking her head from side to side very well valerius grinned he reached to pat her neck and nudged her into a canter the change was immediate and effortless a surge in pace and now she wasnt just moving but flowing over the ground too soon they reached the far end of the arena and he shifted in the saddle left knee forward right knee back and she pirouetted like a leaf falling from a tree not falling dancing a single fluid movement that left them facing the way they had come khamsin must have sensed his exhilaration because she whinnied with pleasure there was no stopping it now he dug his heels into her flanks but truly she needed no encouragement she moved straight to the gallop and suddenly they were speeding arrowstraight down the length of the arena valerius crouched low over her shoulders and saw the ground flying past in a blur below he had never travelled at such a speed but he felt no fear only the astonishing sensation of the blood bubbling in his veins and thundering in his ears she seemed to shift beneath him to ensure that he stayed fixed in the saddle and her movement was so smooth that he might have been in a carriage he wanted it never to end but here were corbulo and his staff at the entrance watching in astonished wonder he saw domitias face flash past her eyes wide with delight and her mouth gaping decorum forgotten as she clutched the fair girl who had replaced suki a ragged cheer broke out and for the first time he used the reins to gently coax her to a halt he slipped from the saddle and stood by the horses head whispering his thanks for her efforts her chest rose and fell as she breathed but he could tell it was with excitement not exertion and she gave off the satisfied feeling of a job well done he wished he had something to reward her for her efforts he turned at the sound of running feet to find domitia approaching with his polished iron helmet in her hands for the first time he truly saw her for what she was a girl not a woman a girl on the verge of womanhood perhaps but one still with the ability to become lost in childish glee after the exhilaration of the race he was overwhelmed by his own emotions and if she had come three paces further he would have swung her into his arms but she stopped took a deep breath and with a mischievous smile handed him first the helmet and then a shining red apple her fingers brushing the leathery palm of his left hand as she placed it there i must congratulate you on your horsemanship tribune and my father on his choice of gift truly she is a wonderful horse he returned her smile feeling like a boy again for the first time since he had left rome for britain to join the twentieth the finest i have ever ridden lady and unless i am mistaken the choice of gift was not only your fathers he accepted the fruit and khamsin scented the apple and nuzzled his fingers until he handed it over a horse like khamsin never forgets generosity he added chivalrously and more quietly and like khamsin i will never forget this gift she heard the catch in his voice and a shadow fell over her eyes is it always like this when a woman sends her man away to war his heart tripped at the phrase her man seneca called it this magnificent melancholy at the time i dismissed him as unduly sentimental because he was a fat old man who had never gone to war but that wasnt true he had served on the rhine frontier as a tribune this magnificent melancholy she ran the words over her tongue and liked them yes i can understand that a mixture of feelings pride and sadness loss and she couldnt finish but her eyes filled and again he felt that surge of need tribune there could be no doubt that corbulo had seen what had passed between valerius and his daughter but the tone was almost kindly your command awaits you work them hard and use them well when you have fixed your defensive positions come to my headquarters tonight and we will see whether you can master caesars tower as well as you can master a horse he nodded and offered domitia his hand as they walked away serpentius ran up grinning now that he said with enormous understatement is a horse xxvii for a frontier town zeugma a sprawling community of mud brick and marble built across a low hill which sloped gently down to the euphrates was a surprisingly sophisticated place or perhaps not so surprisingly hanno who had proved a wellspring of knowledge and experience during the sixday march from antioch informed valerius that the city was another creation of alexanders general seleucus it had been built more than three centuries earlier and until it had been conquered by pompey the great it had been known like antiochs port by his name now it is zeugma the place of the bridge the syrian gestured towards the crossing which was of a construction the roman had never seen before a bridge of perhaps twenty stonebuilt arches stretched two thirds of the way across the river and ended a hundred paces from the near bank the gap between was filled by ten or twelve sturdy boats which carried a jointed wooden platform to complete the link to the bank hanno noticed his interest for two reasons he said holding up scarred fingers first when the river floods the prefect in charge of the bridge will order the pontoons to be detached if he is fortunate they will swing back to the bank and he will recover them if he is unfortunate the river will wash them away but he will only have lost part of the bridge and they are easily replaced whereas if it was entirely of stone he would lose much more and it would be a major project to rebuild second in time of war the pontoons can be removed and any invasion force from the east must find another place to cross but we are at war now valerius pointed out yes hanno grinned his white teeth shining in the dark face but we are the invading force the pontoons will remain in place until we return either in triumph or may mars preserve us pursued as the lion sees off the jackal by king vologases cataphracts his armoured cavalry valerius felt a shiver of unease as he looked down at the narrow structure and imagined a defeated army packed on to the narrow crossing with the parthian army pressing it on every side arrows sheeting the sky carnage and chaos men fighting and dying bodies in the river and the sparkling greygreen waters running red with roman blood he shrugged off the unhappy thought im sure that will not happen prefect everyone has complete confidence in the general you said so yourself of course the syrian said but they will be many and we are so few thousands of cataphracts armoured lords on great horses swathed in iron so our arrows cannot kill them swarms of mounted archers who live eat and sleep in the saddle horses are their currency and their passion a parthian would sacrifice his wife before he would sacrifice his horse his eyes ranged over the legionary camps on the near and far banks their scale almost equalled by the tented towns which had grown up since corbulo had closed the busy crossing to civilian traffic much will depend on the enemys mood sometimes he is like the jackal he prefers to bark rather than fight but then he can be like the leopards which once roamed here he will come fast and silent and he will come for the throat beware of vologases the leopard tribune on corbulos instructions valerius had divided his cavalry between the east and west banks of the great river hannos thracian third augusta was camped with two other thousandstrong alae and two of the smaller fivehundredstrong wings alongside the permanent fortress now occupied by the fifteenth legion apollinaris the rest of the units had orders to range the eastern bank of the euphrates and harry or destroy any enemy forces they found there the tenth fretensis had already crossed and the fifteenth minus the three cohorts who would have to hold the bridge in their absence would cross tomorrow along with the rest of the auxiliaries cavalry and infantry all around them the tent lines buzzed with activity as units and individual soldiers frantically made their lastminute preparations for the advance into enemy territory the air was heavy with the scent of burning charcoal as the armourers of the fifteenth sweated to repair swords and plate armour the ceaseless clatter of hammer on anvil punctuating their efforts hundreds of carts had been requisitioned to carry the supplies essential to feed more than twenty thousand men and as many horses mules and camels in a land that would yield barely a tenth of what was needed to keep them alive now those carts must be checked to ensure their wheels were sound and the base and walls undamaged a single axle break could mean a century going hungry valerius was surprised to see the legions carpenters dismantling the units siege weapons ready for transportation it seemed an extravagance for an expedition that was otherwise designed to travel light and had no plans to invade town or city when hanno left to join his men for the evening meal valerius stood for a while at the edge of the camp and contemplated the distant mountains on the other side of the river just a dusty line on the far horizon that shimmered in the dry heat of the late afternoon he found that the very land oppressed him once they had left the fertile strip by the sea they had marched fifteen miles a day over a bleak patchwork of dirty brown and scorched ochre the monotony only broken by the occasional barren height where eagles and vultures soared or some blessed river valley where they were able to water themselves and their horses in the cool of the stream the experience had left him longing for the lush green plains swampy moors and damp valleys of britain where he had once cursed the mud and the rain or even the shady ordered olive groves of the estate at fidenae after six days they had found relief at zeugma where the euphrates ran like a broad ribbon of grey and emerald through the sunblasted rocks spreading its bounty a mile and more to each side of the fastflowing waters beyond the river lay a true wilderness where the midday sun burned hot enough to crack rocks and a man could ride for days on end before finding water yet corbulo had not only taken his army all the way to tigranocerta and artaxata but fought there and won won against incredible odds now he was going back and valerius would journey every last step with him he flinched at the old familiar pain in the bones of a hand that lay among the burnedout ruins of a town two thousand miles away a pain he knew would never leave him and walked towards the walls of the city and his nightly lesson from the general surprisingly what had begun as a trial had quickly become a pleasure valerius amazed himself by becoming proficient at the governors version of caesar though the game was mindnumbingly complex and he was certain he would never become as skilled as his tutor his proximity to corbulo inspired jealousy and he was forced to ignore the stares of his fellow officers of the generals staff who believed him a spy or worse in time he understood that suspicion of an outsider was too entrenched to break if they didnt quite hate him they resented and feared his presence in equal measure corbulo had set up his headquarters in a villa overlooking the river owned by the leader of the ordo zeugmas council of a hundred leading citizens the man had been only too happy to give up his home one of the finest in the city to his old friend the governor valerius found him hunched over the mass of reports his officers and their agents brought him every day from here he dictated the orders for tomorrows movements miles to be covered rations to be replenished waterholes positions and the forces that would be needed to secure them his voice rose in irritation at the news of a shortage of mules this in a land where every second animal was a mule when it was too late to requisition more from damascus or antioch he ordered that every transport animal in zeugma and for ten miles around be rounded up but it still meant the legionaries would have to carry an extra two days rations on their backs valerius passed the time studying the mosaic floor which depicted a marine scene featuring a heavily bearded man with lobster claws for horns looking soulfully at a woman with long dark hair and wings growing from her forehead enough leave us and order some food and drink he looked up as corbulo dismissed his clerks and rubbed his hands across his eyes despite his concentration on military problems the general had observed valeriuss interest in his surroundings it is a depiction of oceanus the greek god of the rivers and his wife tethys nikolos who owns this house is very proud of it a little rustic and not quite the quality you would find in a villa at home but pleasing enough in its own way valerius nodded his agreement it wasnt the standard of the mosaic or even the subject that caught his attention it was the glowing pink figure of eros the god of love who sat cheerfully in the top corner riding a dolphin across a sea of aegean blue and reminded him of the day on the galley when he had stood with domitia with the dolphins playing beneath their feet a servant entered with a jug of wine and food on two individual platters valerius watched as the syrian broke off a piece of bread on one of the plates and dipped it into the spiced goat stew then stood back before swallowing it corbulo nodded when the man left the room the governor noticed valeriuss puzzlement my aides insist that my food is tasted he smiled after the incident with the snake it seems they fear i might suffer the same fate as germanicus he who might have partaken of the wrong type of mushroom valerius picked up the wine jug and poured two cups very deliberately he lifted one of the cups and put it to his lips corbulo laughed your sacrifice does you credit but the wine was tested earlier he beckoned valerius across the room to where caesars tower had been set up with the pieces exactly as theyd left them on the previous evening you see where you went wrong valerius nodded i allowed you to dominate my flanks and i did not have the strength to hold you back the vertical movements weakened me at the moment i needed to be strong i think i should have reinforced from the centre but even then i suspect you would have prevented me i still do not think in the third dimension good you have made another step forward corbulo began moving the pieces back to their starting positions i think this game is beyond recovery but we will begin another he settled down on a chair on one side of the board and waved valerius to the other the evenings always started this way with the game taking up the commanders attention but valerius had noticed a subtle change as they had gradually become more relaxed in each others company the breakthrough had come on the third night when they had played in the governors pavilion beneath a stony outcrop midway between the orontes and the euphrates do you understand why my officers resent you corbulo had asked pinning the younger man with his uncompromising gaze valerius held his stare because they think i am here to kill you no because they think you are here to replace me are you valerius laughed at the thought the truth is that i have no idea why i was sent here apart from to prepare a report i wanted nothing to do with he didnt reveal that he had already decided what the report would say the eastern command of gnaeus domitius corbulo was as efficient well trained and disciplined as any in the empire its soldiers and officers were loyal to its general and its general loyal to rome he would have done his duty olivia would be safe and paulinus could do with it what he would i have some experience of command but not enough to justify appointing me your deputy you of course already know that which is why you have given me command of the auxiliary cavalry a position which is largely meaningless because of the experience of my subordinates it also conveniently keeps me away from your headquarters until i am summoned unarmed and always watched by the two guards who are never more than ten paces from your side if i am not qualified for the job i have been sent to do what makes you believe i would want to take on a command which will always be beyond my capability and my rank corbulo sat back and gradually a smile broke the harsh lines of his face i have been asking myself the same question perhaps together we can come up with an answer but the question was never raised again and gradually valerius felt he was being taken into corbulos trust now he would be asked his thoughts on the days dispositions his opinions on the qualities of the commanders of his cavalry alae the tactics he would use in this situation or that one night the subject of khamsin came up it was against my better judgement to give you such a horse but he didnt finish the sentence and valerius now knew for certain that the akhalteke mare had been domitias gift not her fathers i might as well have tied a millstone round your neck and ordered you to swim the river out there valerius opened his mouth to protest but corbulo insisted on finishing his argument let me explain on the one hand a cavalryman without his horse is nothing and your khamsin makes you a formidable warrior against any enemy even the parthians who ride as if they have sucked a mares tit since birth yet there is a paradox because a cavalry troopers horse should mean nothing to him it is his transport into the fight a platform for his weapons even his last meal if need be he must be prepared to ride it to death or ride it on to the very spear points of his foe as long as it advances his commanders strategy i have seen you look at her and unless you are a man without a soul you will hesitate when the time comes and when you hesitate you may cost a mans life perhaps cost your commander a battle at first valerius was uncertain how to reply but then it came to him he said there will be a day when your soldiers are mere coins to be spent what will you do then when you know you must order them into the abyss corbulo raised an imperious eyebrow marcus livius drusus legate of the twentieth legion asked me that in the september of the consulship of titus sextius africanus valerius explained by the following july britain was in flames and as boudicca of the iceni turned her warriors on colonia i had to ask myself the same question and i did not hesitate to sacrifice my friends i will not hesitate to sacrifice my horse or myself if the need arises corbulo had nodded and valerius understood that their relationship had altered once more no not altered developed xxviii every man in gnaeus domitius corbulos army suffered the trial of heat and dust that was the endless trek from zeugma the tenth fretensis were in the van the place of honour behind the general they had served so well and they suffered least because they did not have to eat the fine dust of those who had travelled before them those behind the seven full cohorts of the fifteenth apollinaris and their attached auxiliary light infantry marched in a thick brown fog for hour upon hour never knowing how far they had tramped only aware that every step was recorded in the pains in their aching legs and another mouthful of dirt at first they had moved with their heads high singing their obscene marching songs but by the fifth day they had been worn down by the relentless sterility of their surroundings their eyes stared out of dustbrown faces like those of men peering into a blizzard and they walked with their shoulders hunched and their heads thrust forward as if they were trekking through a storm but they were roman soldiers legionaries hard as the stones that formed the grey hills which surrounded them for twelve long years they had marched behind this man what was another mile or another ten or another hundred they hefted their sixtypound loads on shoulders forged of iron and baked in their armour and never complained they would endure and he would give them victory behind each unit came their pack animals mules and camels with the extra spears and the water that sustained man and beast next in line the baggage carts that carried their eightman tents with their rations and the other equipment they would need for camp each night to right and left ahead and in the rear ranged valeriuss cavalry patrols alert for any sign of parthian attack each night the individual units created a defensive perimeter using what materials they could no easily cut sods for the men of the syrian legions just dry stone and the earth they could chop from the ironhard ground with their picks and mattocks every man knew his place and his duty whether it was pitching tents setting up kitchens or digging latrines every man who didnt have sentry watch ate his meal gulped down his ration of water and collapsed in his bedroll trying not to dream of the next days ordeal valerius spent his days in the saddle and his evenings with his commander only one man knew their eventual destination and with every mile they came closer his stature and his energy seemed to grow in antioch corbulo had been a tireless administrator and accomplished diplomat a hounder of the incompetent and the criminal a respected judge who tempered justice with compassion if not mercy a proconsul with the power though men could only whisper it of an emperor in the field valerius saw a different corbulo here was a leader the legionaries of rome would follow to the very ends of the earth on the march he suffered their every privation roaming the columns with his aides encouraging and cajoling he never seemed to tire just one more mile and then another ten he would shout and they cheered him through cracked lips from throats choked with armenian dirt he seemed to know every soldier in an army of twenty thousand men if he recognized a legionary he had decorated he would dismount and walk with the man and discuss their old campaigns if he saw a man whose hobnailed sandals were falling apart he would reprimand his centurion for failing to have them replaced before the campaign began he even supervised the placement and the provisioning of the supply depots set at threeday intervals which would provide rations fodder and water for the army on its return but there was another corbulo still a corbulo honed to an edge that valerius doubted even his daughter would recognize it happened early one evening on the fourth day after they had crossed the euphrates as the tenth fretensis prepared their defensive rampart for the night the previous day corbulo had noticed the men discarding their weapons before they began work with increasing signs of parthian activity he had issued an order that all legionaries should wear their swords while digging the commander as always inspected the defences while they were being dug making recommendations for improvement and giving praise where it was due when he reached the foundations of the northern perimeter he came across a soldier working naked apart from a sword belt valerius heard later what followed you are improperly dressed soldier no sir the legionary a veteran of twenty years who had spent half his life in the legion and half of that fighting for the man addressing him grinned the general specified that we should wear our swords while digging and im wearing my sword sir his companions laughed and corbulo had returned the mans smile that night the soldier was charged with disobeying a direct order found guilty and sentenced to death you think i am being overly harsh the governor asked when valerius made his evening visit to the command pavilion corbulo the man can be mocked but not corbulo the commander corbulo the commander must be obeyed valerius could have argued that the legionary might have misinterpreted the order but he knew that wasnt the point discipline is what makes us what we are the finest fighting soldiers in the world discipline is what allows me to lead a force of twenty thousand against an army of fifty sixty or seventy and still know i can win indiscipline is a sign of weakness when that man challenged my authority he weakened his legion in the same way a coward weakens it when he runs from the battle line i would be shirking my duty if i did not serve him in the same way i serve the coward no i am not harsh by now valerius had realized that the governor was not trying to justify his actions to the tribune who shared his wine and his battles in caesars tower but to himself by our code i would have been justified in having him beaten to death by his tentmates a long painful and degrading end instead he will die by the sword as he has lived by it and men will say corbulo has been not only just but merciful discipline it was only later that valerius understood that when the general had uttered that final fatal word he was thinking not about the man who was about to die but about the man who had stretched his caesars authority to the limit and beyond and the price he might one day have to pay corbulo ordered constant cavalry patrols to see off any parthian scouts who threatened to approach the column the general made it clear he thought valerius a fool for sharing these duties with his troops for his part valerius knew the only way he would learn to think like a cavalryman was to live most of his waking hours in the saddle sharing their hardships and dangers he spent much of his time with hannos thracian auxiliaries riding until every bone in his body ached but he had yet to lay eyes on a parthian warrior in the last few days he had eaten more grit than army rations and hanno had been right his tender backside was well on the way to being saddleshaped and the texture of tanned leather no cities barred their way in this wilderness but sometimes they would come across a huddle of mudbrick huts where they would be greeted by some bearded ancient expendable enough to the village to be sacrificed to dangerous roman whim as long as they posed no threat corbulo ordered these communities to be left unharmed and his quartermasters bought up every spare piece of armenian clothing they could lay their hands on most cooperated but occasionally one did not eventually corbulo lost patience valerius was walking khamsin when he found tiberius at his shoulder brighteyed with excitement the young man had spent the past few days complaining that he didnt have enough responsibility i am the most junior of junior tribunes the boy lamented of course i would never criticize my senior officers legate traianus is a fine soldier and knows his business but but it can be irksome to be told always to stand and be silent to listen and learn i do not have the slightest authority even over the meanest new recruit i try to do my duty and tell myself that i will be accepted for my diligence and commitment but i long to be accepted i have volunteered to take charge of those on guard duty but i am refused even that if there is anything valerius had spoken to the legate and tiberiuss face told him the situation had changed the boys blurted announcement confirmed it i am to have my first independent command he boasted valerius waited well tiberius admitted i am to be nominally in command but i must heed the words of the centurion valerius smiled and what is this epic mission oh it is nothing important a few villagers drove off some of our horses and their enemies in the next hamlet claim they were sold to a parthian patrol im to lead four centuries of the fifth cohort we are to teach them a lesson the smile froze on valeriuss face and do you know what form this lesson is to take tiberius shrugged burn a few huts i suppose i know its not much but valerius had been on patrols where barbarian villages had been taught a lesson and he feared that tiberius might be about to learn a harsh lesson of his own look tiberius it may be more than that you may be asked to do things that seem distasteful to you the younger man looked mystified but valerius knew it was something he must discover for himself just remember that you have your orders and let the centurion take the lead do what you have to do but always remember you do it for your legion and for rome he abandoned the next days patrol so that he could be with the main column when tiberius returned from the punitive expedition the young tribune led his three hundred legionaries into the fort but this was no triumphal entry he rode straightbacked as always never looking right or left but even from a distance valerius could see the unnatural set of his mouth and the blood that stained his face and armour later he found tiberius sitting alone in his tent staring at his hands the boy didnt look up when valerius entered when he spoke his voice was as cold as an empty grave they were women and children mostly and a few old men but you knew that it was what you tried to warn me about yesterday the centurion took charge and told me to stay close we surrounded the village so not as much as a mouse could escape and then we advanced there had been no orders but i realized later that the men had done this so often that they didnt need them they herded the villagers into the centre there must have been a hundred of them and the centurion read out a decree from traianus that the people could not understand women were weeping no screaming not then there were children too young to know what was going on playing and laughing a pretty little girl looked up at me and smiled i didnt understand what was happening at first but then the centurion told me to draw my sword it was orders he said no man could stand back from the dirty work the legate wanted me blooded and i would be blooded then we killed them no we butchered them it didnt take long three hundred swords against a hundred unarmed women and children it wouldnt would it the little girl was still smiling when i killed her then i killed her sister and mother when we finished they were just a big pile of corpses in a spreading lake of blood the centurion was pleased quick and clean he said and no opposition he shook his head i can kill valerius believe me when i say i am a very good killer but i did not come here to slaughter women and children because their menfolk might have stolen a few horses you didnt kill them because they stole a few horses valerius kept his voice harsh he knew sympathy was the last thing tiberius needed you killed them because it was your duty that was the lesson traianus wanted you to learn duty is everything a legionary must not only be disciplined he must be hard remember what you said when i told you my plan on the ship youre as hard as the iron in that gladius you wear well this is the world we inhabit tiberius traianus decided an example must be made and if an example is to be made there is no place for pity or mercy what would happen if every village on our line of march believed they could steal our horses with impunity that would only be the beginning theyd start raiding the supply lines killing our sentries and because we werent strong enough or hard enough to make a proper example the whole country would band together and believe they could defeat us then how many would we be forced to kill not a hundred not even a thousand ten thousand and the rest would be taken as slaves hundreds of your comrades would be dead by doing your duty and killing those armenian villagers you saved roman lives occasionally you will be given an order you do not agree with like today but always remember there is a greater purpose he clapped the younger man on the shoulder this is the army tiberius if your commander tells you to march off a cliff all you can do is ask which spot would give him the most pleasure i will try to remember that i wish valerius made a decision tomorrow i am taking out a patrol for the first time tiberius looked up and met his eyes i doubt we will encounter any parthians but at least it will give you the chance to carry your sword against a proper enemy xxix rome september ad an almighty crash filled the room as the golden table and its contents smashed to the marble floor the palace slaves froze in position careful not to let their eyes stray to where the emperor nero claudius germanicus caesar stood chest heaving his entire body shaking even tigellinus stepped back from the white heat of his masters rage you mean he is still alive we have yet to identify how many gauls of senatorial rank can there be a dozen a hundred put them all to the question find this upstart how can i rule if i do not have authority how can i have authority when some rustic pig farmer undermines me at every turn i have seen the reports secret meetings attended by hundreds in the very heart of lugdunum i know what he calls me mmmm foam flecked neros lips and tigellinus thought he might have a seizure mmmurddderer the spawn of hhhades says i debauched mmy own mmmother neros voice rose to a scream i want him found i want him dead the wild eyes flickered and in an instant the shaking subsided a small boys voice emerged from his mouth i want him dead tigellinus and the rest the rest caesar tigellinuss voice sounded as if the noose was already tightening on his neck i know you have been keeping it from me the praetorian prefects heart seemed to stop how much did he know caesar now the eyes were cold as a german winter and that was even more frightening than what had gone before you thought it was for the best tigellinus struggled to keep control of his bladder you wanted to protect me of course caesar they are all in it the german legions otho in lusitania galba in hispana maximus in britannia we cannot be sure caesar the german governors certainly but between them they hold sway over four legions we must not act until they have been neutralized you have a plan tigellinus of course you have a plan we must make them think they are safe believe they are being considered for high honour summon them to some place far from their strength seize their families while they are on the road then strike strike yes the small porcine eyes were unnaturally bright but where tigellinus pondered the question as if he had never considered it greece he said finally neros plump features broke into a dreamy smile as they always did when they talked about the home of the gods the visit had been arranged for months in exchange for an announcement of perpetual freedom from tribute the greeks had agreed to hold the olympic games two years in advance so that he could take part of course greece but can we wait so long their treason is in its infancy caesar tigellinus assured him your hold on the army is strong they dare not act without the collusion of the others and the others are fearful i would not have agreed to your absence if i had doubts your popularity with the people has never been greater telesinus and paulinus who will share the consulship are among your most loyal supporters in the senate and in any case their every word and deed will be monitored at the first sign of treasonous behaviour my agents have orders to act vespasian is still our loyal servant none more so caesar tigellinus was no longer so sure of that certain facts had come to his attention which cast doubt on the senator from falacrinae but the conversation had reached a point he had willed it to reach and vespasian could wait he had other prey in mind for all neros fears about his german legates and the governors of lusitania hispania and britannia tigellinus knew that only one man posed the ultimate threat the others might send their little notes and hold their little meetings but they would never act on their own only gnaeus domitius corbulo had the stature the determination and the military strength to supplant his emperor but did he have the will offonius tigellinus was not certain but he had long ago decided that for the sake of the empire corbulo must die little by little he had undermined neros steadfast faith in his most successful general now he heard the words he had hoped for and corbulo tigellinus reached into the document case he always carried and retrieved a dispatch which had arrived by fast courier earlier in the day he watched with satisfaction as nero absorbed the details his face growing paler and his hands beginning to shake i was keeping it for a more appropriate time when i hoped to verify the detail however the broad outline seems indisputable he is acting against my specific orders i am sure he has his reasons caesar but no the word emerged as a groan his imperium gives him power within the boundaries of the empire this is an invasion of a sovereign state a direct violation of my command to act defensively and in concert with the governor of judaea he has exceeded his authority and usurped his emperors no he is acting as if he is emperor you say you have an agent in place tigellinus nodded the broad nostrils flared and the pale eyes took on a reptilian look that sent a shiver through tigellinus then something strange happened the face seemed to collapse in upon itself and tears streamed down the pink cheeks not corbulo yes tigellinus found he could barely breathe he has deceived and betrayed his emperor nero looked up not betrayed not yet i must have more before i condemn romes greatest general i must have evidence of treason tigellinus bit back a scream of frustration the final piece had been in place only for the game to be snatched away from him but nero would have his evidence no matter what it cost xxx each night now was colder than the one which had preceded it and valerius shivered in the familiar predawn gloom as he waited for the men of his patrol to form up for the mission he wore the uniform of a lowly auxiliary cavalry prefect there was no point in advertising himself as a senior roman officer and inviting capture by some eagleeyed parthian scout along with whatever horrors would inevitably follow he had convinced the tenths legate that it would be good experience for tiberius to accompany a patrol and he watched as the young roman swapped his plate armour for a coat of linked iron rings sewn on to a supple leather tunic and his ornate polished helmet for the crude potshaped headgear favoured by the thracians like all his comrades over the ringmail he wore a hooded cloak of fine linen which had once been white the cloth would stop the iron mail becoming so hot during the long day in the sun that it would blister the skin of anyone who touched it tiberius couldnt shoot the short bow with any accuracy so he and valerius carried the long spatha swords and the light oval shield of the auxiliary cavalry as ranking officer valerius was theoretically in charge of the thirtyman patrol in reality he was happy to cede authority to caladus a wiry decurion with a greying beard and twenty years service in the saddle his sleepdulled mind sharpened with the passing minutes and he felt the tension grow as the men checked their equipment to the accompaniment of the usual murmur of subdued voices the snicker of horses and the faint jingle of metal harness decorations they had yet to meet any parthian scouts but other patrols had picked up traces of their presence the unburied remains of a campfire in a narrow defile horse tracks in the dust and scattered manure from more than one animal carelessly left in the lee of a hilltop where a man might watch for signs of the roman column it was only a matter of time as the men formed pairs caladus rode the line making a last inspection of their equipment he drew up when he came to valerius shes a pretty little thing he indicated khamsin but she stands out like a signifer in a parade of vestal virgins better to take one of these ugly bastards he pointed to the stocky longhaired ponies the thracian troopers rode they might not make as good eating but you can ride them to hades and back and they never complain ill stay with what i have valerius slapped the horses shoulder shes never let me down yet suit yourself the decurion grinned wickedly but dont come crying to me when youre running for your life holding on to somebody elses tail with a hairy arse spouting shit into your face and the parthians taking odds on whos going to have your balls for a wedding present you should have that man whipped for insubordination tiberius scowled at caladuss back as they left the security of the temporary camp he had the usual highborn romans contempt for the lowly paid auxiliaries who made up half the army he also had the resilience of the young the events of the previous day had not been mentioned again it would teach him to respect a roman officer and make him less willing to fight for me valerius pointed out half of these men are thracians tiberius and half are syrians they understand that no roman general even domitius corbulo values an auxiliarys life at one tenth that of a roman citizen if they werent cavalry they would spend their entire service in some flyblown desert fort where no legionary would ever set foot they know the parthians and they know this land out there we will depend on them because in a crisis we dont have the skills or the experience to survive if anything happens you could do much worse than stick closer to caladus than a tick on a sheeps back they rode northeast at an angle to the rising sun so they would not be blinded as it climbed over the far horizon for the past two days the column had marched across a great undulating plain of dry red earth and black rocks the ground was cut by the occasional narrow riverbed where thin streams of filthy water crept sluggishly through shallow pools over porous rock and evillooking rainbowhued mud caladus knew from experience that no matter how slowly they rode the patrol would inevitably kick up a cloud of dust that would alert every parthian within five miles his solution when they were far enough from the column was to take the bulk of the patrol into any likely watercourse that appeared to lead approximately east but to leave a single rider to spot for dust on the plain above the tactic slowed their progress but made them invisible to the enemy while ensuring that no parthian could cross the plain undetected within a radius of ten miles it was dull work but it had allowed valerius the opportunity to get to know after a fashion the men who served under him the bulk were thracians horse warriors seduced from their native plains to serve the empire on the promise of citizenship and a grant of land if they survived twentyfive years of brutal service tiberius draco the soldier riding at his side was a veteran with three wooden teeth and a scar running diagonally across his lower face from the left side of his top lip to the right side of his jaw in mumbled dog latin draco recited how he had been given the choice of enlistment or slavery when a patrol arrived at his farm on the black sea coast demanding payment of taxes the young auxiliary on valeriuss left was more forthcoming like hanno the third thracian commander hassan was syrianborn white teeth shining like pearls through his black beard the son of a damascus trading family cheerfully told valerius he had travelled to rome and marvelled at the wonders he saw there all he had desired since was to win roman citizenship and return to make his fortune he laughed off the dangers of his profession if i had stayed in damascus counting my fathers profits i would have died of boredom by now here at least i am honoured for my skills and my loyalty valerius remembered the young auxiliaries who had fought and died for him in britain bela the cavalry commander who had taken a spear point in the belly defending the fleeing refugees of colonia but who had stayed in the saddle and fought to the last as the city burned and matykas who had sacrificed himself and his troop to give the last remnant of valeriuss defeated force time to retreat to the temple of claudius warriors soldiers men who had died for a rome he had once believed in and would gladly have died for himself a rome worthy of the men who fought for it but did that rome still exist he was no republican but in the years since he had returned scarred and changed from britain he had experienced a different rome neros rome and been repelled by the perfumed stink of degeneracy degradation and corruption he had come to realize that in the new rome the emperor did not rule for his people or for the empire but for himself and the small circle of selfserving acolytes who surrounded him when he thought of nero he was reminded of a wriggling maggot growing fat on the putrefying flesh of a decomposing corpse the pursuit of power and profit and advancement drove the new rome fear and doubt and envy ruled it tiberius rode up beside him and he put the treasonous notion back where it belonged right or wrong nero had been born to rule i thought it would be more exciting the young tribune complained this country is less appealing than the desert which almost killed me all weve done is skulk like criminals along these open sewers as if we feared the parthians you may be a warrior tiberius valerius smiled but you have a great deal to learn about war war is five parts waiting three parts marching one part watching and the final part equally divided between fighting and dying a soldier learns not to be in too much of a hurry to reach that final part and you would be right to fear the parthians have you read herodotus the young man shook his head my father believed that books weakened a mans will to fight that they made him spend too much time thinking when he should be exercising in arms valerius bit back the automatic response this folly deserved and said instead herodotus writes that when xerxes the great passed this way to fight the greeks he brought with him an army of persians medes assyrians cissians arians caspians indians utians arabians babylonians mycans and ethiopians this xerxes was a parthian a persian but of the parthian line my point is that his army was so great that it covered the land like a great black stain and wherever it went it left behind only devastation and grief so great that no one not even the king knew how great at a place called doriscus xerxes decided to count the warriors under his command he ordered ten thousand men to form tight together and a circle was drawn around them which was then fenced the circle was filled again and again until none was left uncounted its said they filled the circle one hundred and seventy times they swept everything before them yet the greeks defeated the persians yes but the greeks had alexander and we have general corbulo valerius nodded does the general fear the parthians no but he respects them then i will respect them too ahead of them caladus called a halt this is far enough if were to return before dark no excitement today he led them up the bank of the gully and back on to the featureless plain xxxi the patrol had ridden less than a mile after they emerged from the gully when they discovered that caladus didnt have a monopoly on invisibility a desperate shout from the flank guard was choked off instantly by the arrow that skewered his throat parthian cavalry swarmed from a stream bed two hundred paces away and broke left and right in a movement that threatened to encircle the auxiliaries caladus roared at his men to form up and without looking to see who followed kicked his horse into a charge valerius was slower to react and as the thracian decurion passed to his front caladus shouted a warning get out of here i havent enough men to protect you ride for it for answer valerius nudged khamsin so she spun on her hooves after the auxiliary commander within four strides they were flank to flank and caladus turned to check who was with him fool he said but his face split into a savage grin and the wild light of battle shone bright in his eyes valerius matched his grin we fight together and we die together fuck dying caladus broke off to shout orders to his men theyll be a mix of archers and spearmen you and the boy take the spearmen that way youll have a chance valerius looked up and for the first time was able to study the enemy horsemen he saw immediately that caladus was right they might be outnumbered but at least half of the force opposing them carried tenfootlong narrowpointed spears which were only of use at close range their archers will want to take as many of us with the first volley as they can and then trade us shot for shot we have to make it difficult for them theyre here for information and plunder they dont like dying for nothing the answer is to kill them kill them the thracian screamed kill every last one of the gutless bastards in a confusion of dust raised by thundering hooves valerius hauled his sword clear of its scabbard and called out to tiberius a voice answered from his right and together they swerved towards a group of parthians streaming across the flank who had been surprised by the speed of the roman counterattack an arrow flicked off his pothelmet with a metallic clatter and he instinctively hunched over khamsins neck to make himself a smaller target the next pair of shafts lodged in the ash shield fixed to his walnut fist he glanced to his left and there was hassan grinning through his beard with the short recurved bow strung and an arrow nocked and ready to fly more blows on the shield before something slammed him high in the chest with enough force to knock him backwards he almost fell but the little mare adjusted her stride beneath him and he managed to stay in the saddle he waited for the pain to come the shock of the blow had numbed his body but the arrow must have bitten deep the needle point buried in the flesh of his breast but when he dared to look down he saw the wooden shaft dangling from the ringed mail beneath his cloak the point had penetrated the iron but the heavy leather tunic beneath had saved him from serious injury a man cried out to his god and khamsin swerved to avoid the fallen body beneath her hooves but valerius concentrated on the halfdozen galloping figures ahead of him picking out a spearman in a bright green tunic he heard the ziiipp of an arrow as hassan fired from his side and a horse in the centre of the parthian line reared up screaming with a shaft buried to the feathers in its chest why werent the parthian archers aiming for the horses he remembered hannos words at the bridge a parthian would sacrifice his wife before he would sacrifice his horse caladus had said they were here for plunder of course they would want to capture the roman mounts if they could valerius felt the battle madness fill him he had no thought of victory or defeat all he wanted to do was kill if the spearmen charged they might blunt the roman attack but they seemed reluctant to move preferring to allow the archers to do the work for them in a few strides it would be too late now at last they were moving a sharp cry from his left and he glanced aside in time to see tiberiuss look of astonishment as he was thrown clean over his mounts shoulder as the beast went down in a welter of dust and flailing hooves his mind registered the fact but they were gone in an instant and his focus stayed fixed on the rider he had picked out in that odd symmetry of battle the parthian also seemed to have chosen valerius as his prey he was accompanied by a second horseman and together their spears came down so that they were lined up on the romans chest wicked needle points gleaming in the dying light of the sun small details dark glaring eyes and snarling mouths a flash of gold on the righthand riders wrist the decorative scarlet plume on a horses forehead without conscious thought valeriuss mind calculated speed and distance the angle of attack which had forced them slightly to their left less than twenty strides now he saw the second man drop back a little two spears one to valeriuss right flank the other to his left the first to draw his shield and open up his defences the second to skewer him no amount of mail and leather would stop a point with the weight of man and horse behind it he knew he was dead but pride would not let him turn away he was a soldier this was how soldiers died he screamed out loud anticipating the moment counted the heartbeats the second horse faltering its rider catapulted from the saddle by an arrow that pierced his screaming mouth with such power that only the feathers were left visible the merciless eyes of the first unaware he was now alone the spear held twohanded and angled across his body valerius took the point on his shield and forced it past his head feeling the breath of the iron across his cheek safe inside the point the long blade of corbulos sword was already slashing upwards in a backhand cut that raked the spearmans ironclad chest before taking him below the chin in a terrible blow that split his face from bearded jaw to the rim of his iron helm carving through bone and teeth and gristle and splitting his eye socket in two valerius had a momentary vision of horror and felt the splash of hot blood and then he was past seeking out the archers who hadnt joined the charge but the archers were no longer there he hauled khamsin round and had a moment of breathless clarity hassan and the thracians who had accompanied him were circling seeking targets but never staying still long enough to be targets themselves within the dust cloud of the battle riders of both sides darted in and out of the fray valerius noticed a horse standing over a still figure with its head bowed and he remembered tiberiuss sickening fall he started towards the little tableau but the horse was a roan and tiberius had been riding a grey desperately he searched the dust for his friend a gust of dry wind cleared the murk for a second and at last he found him tiberius crouched behind his dead mount with a shield in one hand and the jagged remnant of a sword in the other the shield had been pierced by a dozen arrows the points three inches through the layers of ash and the body of the grey was thick with others parthians hovered like vultures to his front and flanks looking for the killer shot even as valerius watched tiberius staggered and almost fell with an arrow through his right leg but he was alive for the moment hassan the syrian turned at the shout and followed valeriuss pointing finger taking in the situation with a glance he nodded and galloped towards tiberius calling his comrades with him the enemy archers saw the danger and prudently retired to seek easier prey tiberius looked up as valerius rode towards him and raised a weary hand in salute valerius was still fifty feet away when he sensed movement at the outer edge of his vision in the next second the image crystallized into a charging parthian spearman with his lance couched and the point aimed at the centre of tiberiuss back he screamed a warning but the young roman either didnt hear him or was too shocked to react valerius kicked khamsin into a gallop he knew he had no chance of reaching tiberius in time but he had to try in desperation he altered course to intercept the enemy spear the parthian only had eyes for his victim and he could already taste the joy of an easy kill his first indication of danger was a flash of iron to his left but as he dragged his tenfoot ash spear round to meet it he was already too late khamsin smashed into the parthians flank a thousand pounds of solid muscle at full gallop sending horse and man tumbling with a crash fit to wake the gods the impact threw valerius from the saddle the breath knocked out of him and his sword sent flying he felt the skin of his right cheek tear as he skidded across the unyielding earth desperately he struggled to his knees to find the parthian staggering towards him the mans spear had snapped in the collision but he had recovered the final four feet with its gleaming spiked tip and now he held it in front of him like a sword a big man with a heavy beard his nose had been smashed almost flat when he landed but he was determined and he was dangerous and he only had one aim as he advanced towards the unarmed roman valerius let him come his eyes flickered between those of his opponent and the point of the spear searching for the moment of decision in many ways it was easier to face a man with a spear a sword could come at you from any angle but a spear had only one focus of attack the question was high or low the throat or the guts which would he choose a gutter fighter might feint with his eyes or the spear point but the parthians tentative approach suggested that he was more accustomed to fighting on horseback than man to man on foot high or low the eyes said low and the spear followed them valerius twisted in a desperate sidestep that allowed the point to crease his right side then spun along the shaft to smash the spearman in front of the ear with a fist of solid walnut that had all his weight behind it the impact should have crushed the weak point of his enemys skull but the blow was high and the rim of the parthians helmet sapped the force of it the big man roared like a bull elephant and his arms enveloped valerius who realized when a leg wrapped round his that he had underestimated his opponent the parthian might not be a gutter fighter but someone had taught him to wrestle sensing his advantage the spearman used his weight to unbalance valerius and they fell the parthians bulk pinning the roman to the ground valerius bucked and wriggled for all he was worth lashing out with both hands and kicking with his ironshod feet but he could make no headway against the implacable solidity of the man whose only aim was to kill him the parthian had recovered his spear and now he stabbed the point down at valeriuss face somehow valerius managed to get his left hand to the other mans wrist in time to check the plunging iron at the same time he smashed at his enemys face with the wooden fist but the parthian ignored the blows as if they came from a child slowly a hairs breadth at a time the needle tip drew closer aimed unerringly for valeriuss right eyeball screaming with frustration and fear the roman used every desperate ounce of his strength to arrest the progress of that wicked iron spike the parthians lips curled back from his yellowing teeth and his hand shook as he maintained the pressure but the movement was unrelenting and valerius let out an involuntary cry as he felt the point touch his eyelid the cry was echoed by the parthian but it was no yell of victory his eyes bulged and the pressure on valeriuss left hand eased at the same time as he heard an obscene crunching sound with a last shuddering intake of breath the spearman fell to one side to reveal tiberius swaying on his feet and with the jagged stump of the sword bloody in his hand i think we are level now the young tribune said before his eyes rolled up in his head and he collapsed in a dead faint xxxii sweat ran in rivulets from tiberiuss forehead and he bit so hard into the strip of toughened leather that valerius wondered his teeth didnt break his eyes were screwed tight shut in a face set in a grimace of pure agony that twitched with every movement of the iron forceps gaius spurinna corbulos personal physician and a man with a wit as dry as the old bones he transported with him everywhere kept up a cheerful running commentary as he worked the bones had been collected for scientific study from the battlefield at carrhae just south of their route and he speculated that a particularly fine backbone might have belonged to crassus himself if you had been more fortunate the arrowhead would have continued through to pierce the other side of the leg and i would have been able to saw it off and withdraw the shaft as sweet as a prick from a silky virgin crack of course you wouldnt have enjoyed the sawing then again you could have bled out before your comrade here got you back to me so we must be thankful for what we have tiberius didnt appear thankful despite the tincture of poppy spurinna had administered his face had taken on the colour of grey parchment as the physician worked his head began to thrash from side to side in his delirium and valerius was forced to push down hard on his shoulders to keep him still the trick is to manoeuvre the grip of the forceps around the head of the arrow and therefore nullify the effect of the barb whilst doing so without disturbing any of the major tubes which facilitate blood flow and killing the patient as you can appreciate it requires a combination of delicacy and strength which only a physician of my exceptional attributes has at his disposal hold still damn you a sip of wine please valerius placed the cup to his lips in your case the operation is made more problematic by the fact that the arrowhead appears to be lodged in the complex group of bones which make up the knee fortunately you are in the hands of no ordinary physician but a man who knows his bones in the hands of an ordinary physician you might be reduced to crawling on all fours like a dog yes tiberius gave a low howl not unlike a dog gaius spurinna grunted with effort and his muscles bulged as he worked the forceps free with an obscene sucking sound slowly bringing the shaft of the arrow with them when it was clear he gave a huge sigh drained his wine and refilled the cup before washing the point of the arrow clean in it with a little good fortune it wont have been poisoned for barbarians the parthians are relatively civilized and it carried no cloth into the wound so if my theory is correct the chances of mortification are reduced you may thank me my boy it is possible you may yet live to die on the battlefield he looked down at tiberius who was drifting in and out of consciousness muttering to himself like a child in a dream ungrateful wretch spurinna smiled benevolently come he said to valerius we will report to the general he favours the boy you know valerius was about to follow but tiberiuss next words fetched him up short of the door i cannot do it i cannot there was something desperate in the way he spoke as if he was pleading with someone only he could see honour duty discipline honour duty the mantra faded as valerius took the young mans hand in his yes tiberiuss eyes opened but they were looking at something beyond the tent and valerius made the sign against evil yes i see it is clear now i have no choice the eyes closed again and his harsh breathing subsided relieved valerius stood up to go but a last whispered word froze him in place treason the army of the corbulo travelled steadily northeast skirting a range of low featureless hills and alert for darting raids by the now everpresent parthian scouts valerius stayed with the column regularly checking on tiberiuss progress in the twowheeled cart that had been cleared for him tiberius was still weary and talked of nothing but getting back into the saddle but gradually valerius steered the conversation round to what was concerning him when you were under the poppy you still seemed troubled by what happened at the village jammed into the corner among sacks of grain to reduce the effect of ironshod wheels jolting across the rocks tiberius shook his head i can remember very little apart from spurinnas gentle ministrations he smiled besides i know you were right a roman soldiers job is to obey and let others concern themselves with things like morality and justice there was something else an unguarded word a word that can never be spoken lightly treason for a few moments tiberius might have been made of stone then his expression changed its just a word i didnt know what i was saying valerius said steadily if there is something you know tiberius you must tell me it is much more dangerous to keep the knowledge to yourself tiberius hesitated there is talk talk of what there is always talk have you ever met a soldier who didnt have something to complain about if theyre not complaining about the food its the quality of their boots or the weight of their shields a thousand years from now soldiers will still be grumbling about the same things this is different tiberius insisted this is the officers not the men they wonder why we are here in judaea a roman province is being torn apart and roman soldiers are dying an eagle has been lost and romes honour dragged through the dirt yet we are marching in the opposite direction we are here because corbulo has led us here valerius interrupted and where the general leads we follow somewhere out there the parthian army is marching north to invade armenia with their king in rome the armenians will stay in their fortresses and try to wait out the storm but the storm will inevitably overwhelm them the only way to stop the parthians is to intercept and destroy them tiberius answered do not mistake me tribune the tenth worships the general they do not fear what awaits them if they fail only the consequences if they succeed valerius gave a sigh this was exactly what vespasian had feared and paulinus had hinted at but the die was cast general corbulo is proconsul of the east the emperor has granted him imperium he sees the greater longterm threat from the parthians and he has the authority to make his own decisions do not concern yourself with strategy tiberius he said more gently we are soldiers you and i and it is a soldiers duty to obey our loyalty is to rome and to the emperor just as the generals is but that is why i spoke out tiberius lowered his voice to a whisper if the general succeeds there is talk of proclaiming him emperor in neros place on the fourth day after the ambush they entered a broad flat plain a days march across and tiberius aided by the healing powers of youth was back in the saddle though he winced with every step his horse took valerius knew he would have to report the young tribunes revelation at some point but the time never seemed right corbulos army had been on the march for thirteen consecutive days and valerius sensed his generals confidence growing with every passing hour his suspicions were confirmed when the roman commander summoned a conference of his senior officers an elaborate sand table was set up in the headquarters tent and corbulo stood over it with the tenths legate marcus ulpius traianus to his left and aulus marius celsus who commanded the contingent of the fifteenth apollinaris to his right valerius waited with the commanders of the auxiliary detachments in addition to valeriuss cavalry wings corbulos legions were accompanied by ten cohorts of syrian and numidian infantry equally split between spearand bowmen two cohorts of cretan slingers who could take a mans eye out at fifty paces and a cohort of mountain troops the specialized skills of these wiry highlanders recruited from distant noricum would be invaluable if vologases decided to make directly for artaxata through the mountain country east of the great inland sea which was marked on corbulos sand map by a large silver bowl the generals aides had placed small banners on the table to show the relative positions of the roman and parthian armies between the column and the sea lay a great flat plain bounded by mountains to north and south corbulo leaned over the sand table and valerius had an image of a great eagle sweeping over the landscape and taking in everything below at last he raised his head and the grey eyes surveyed the men in the room as if he was seeking out some buried fear or weakness tigranocerta he pointed to a banner on the edge of the hills at the eastern end of the plain three days march away the strongest fortress in the kingdom and the key to southern armenia i believe king vologases must take it if he is to advance on artaxata with any prospect of success the governor is a client of romes ally king tiridates and he has sent word that while he cannot help us neither will he hinder our passage by now vologases scouts will have informed him of our strength our progress and our line of march given the disparity in our forces he will expect us to march directly for tigranocerta either to bolster its defences or to bring him to battle outside its walls where we will have the support he gave a thin smile for what it is worth of our armenian allies either event will give him pause but neither will stop him if we fight from within tigranocerta he will be confident that he can bottle us up and starve us out in open battle he outnumbers us three to one and if we give him the opportunity he will destroy us winning eternal fame as the man who defeated gnaeus domitius corbulo i will not let that happen the final six words were rapped out with the unrelenting certainty of an executioners axe the main parthian army is here he pointed to a group of flags positioned beyond the hills to the south of the plain and grouped by the side of a snaking line that must be the tigris they will follow the traditional invasion route along the river which provides them with a guaranteed source of water for men and horses he frowned as his finger traced the winding route through the mountains his is a mobile army but they cannot travel faster than their supplies the route is narrow it will take time more important it will give us time gentlemen i mean to meet vologases and i mean to stop him here north of cepha every eye homed in on the pointing finger the tigris wound its way through the mountains and eventually entered a broad steepsided valley so narrow it was barely visible a second valley cut northwards through the hills which were the last natural barrier between the parthians and tigranocerta creating an avenue to the plain valerius pictured it in his mind the valley was a dagger in the heart of corbulos plans through here vologases mighty army would stream in their regiments and their divisions to deploy on the flatlands ready for the final march on the fortress but we cannot afford to meet him in the open crassus made that mistake when he faced surenas at carrhae and the parthians destroyed his army one piece at a time when paetus campaigned here not five years ago tiridates served him the same way a hundred archers charging to fire then retreating before our own could reply a thousand minor engagements each one causing more casualties more confusion and more uncertainty no it will not be that way he picked up the banner representing his army and placed it at the north end of the valley we will draw vologases deep into the valley and there we will hold him like a stopper in the mouth of a wineskin with respect general corbulo nodded to traianus to continue how are we to do that with less than two legions and a few auxiliaries the king of kings is no fool is it not possible you are leading us into a trap of our own making you are inviting the parthians to do to us what they did to crassus attack and retreat kill and kill again with impunity their archers will bleed us dry and when at last we are forced to withdraw their armoured heavy cavalry will cut us to pieces on the open plain surely it is better to fight beneath the walls of tigranocerta where we at least have a line of retreat corbulo smiled but it was a smile that contained a warning traianus who had served with his commander in the armenian campaigns of three years earlier saw the look and seemed to shrink inside his uniform brave words traianus and prudent ones it is a fortunate commander who has officers willing to risk all if they believe he is wrong corbulo allowed his words to hang in the air until the tension was almost unbearable but i do not believe i am wrong vologases is indeed no fool but like every parthian ruler before him he leads an army not of regiments but of war bands each with its own warlord and each with its own strengths and weaknesses not all of those leaders are as enthusiastic about this enterprise as the king of kings they have been forced to strip their lands bare before the final harvest is in and now their women must do the work of men and slaves they believe the eyes of rome are fixed upon judaea and they have a free hand here he has convinced them that they will meet little opposition and the armenians will welcome them the last thing they expect is to meet a roman army unless he achieves a quick victory and the plunder he has promised them they will soon pine for the warmth of their own hearths time is my enemys enemy traianus if we can stop them and hurt them vologases will retreat back to ctesiphon tiridates will return to his throne and armenia will be a roman province for generations to come the pale intractable eyes fixed the other man put your faith in me traianus traianus hesitated studying the sand table in front of him and frowning over the narrow cleft as if he was seeing the armys doom eventually he looked up very well we can stop them but how do we hurt them badly enough to force vologases to retire valerius had been as intent on the sand map as the tenths commander and it was only gradually that he realized that every eye in the room was now fixed on him he raised his head and found himself meeting corbulos implacable gaze that will be the mission of my loyal commander of cavalry gaius valerius verrens xxxiii valerius knew his general well enough by now to recognize the moment of drama on which the whole performance hinged corbulo had drawn them in played on their fears now he was about to reveal his genius but that genius depended on the fighting powers of valerius verrens and his cavalry and valerius wondered how he was expected to live up to his commanders hopes while corbulo had outlined his strategy to traianus valerius had been concentrating on the map trying to understand how his cavalry would fit into the generals battle plans no matter how hard he looked he could not see it he could visualize the valley a mere slice in a ridge of sand on the map table but in reality perhaps a mile wide with steep weathered sides if he guessed correctly corbulo would anchor the flanks of his army against the valley walls using his auxiliaries and line his heavy infantry three cohorts deep in the centre where they would face vologases elite mounted archers and spearmen the valley would contain the attacking potential of both armies within a narrow front which would reduce the mobility of the parthian cavalry and favour corbulos defensive strategy but traianus was right it would still allow the enemy to use their archers to inflict a steady stream of casualties on the romans it would be a battle of attrition and in a battle of attrition the side with the greater numbers would always win vologases wouldnt just give up and turn back romans would stand and they would die and eventually the parthian king must have his victory and while they were dying the ten thousand auxiliary cavalry which gnaeus domitius corbulo had insisted were his greatest strength against the parthian horse would be stranded useless behind the roman line it was the strategy of madness until corbulo revealed his master stroke valerius listened to the generals plans with growing dismay but his eyes were drawn back to the map and the narrow valley he studied every particle of sand as if it would reveal the true detail of the terrain it had never been done before not in his lifetime it was unorthodox no it was beyond unorthodox stranded somewhere in that fog between genius and madness could it be done can you do it if it can be done we will do it you understand the importance of the timing i must strike at the rising of the sun on the second day it will be difficult you must curb your impatience and that of your men they will not gladly suffer hiding in the shadows while their comrades are dying but it must be done it will be done then we are in agreement traianus you are satisfied the tenths legate nodded agreement with a tight smile but valerius knew he was imagining the hours his men would have to spend being flayed by the parthian arrows very well return to your units if the gods are willing we will reach our destination in four days tribune verrens stay please the general called for an aide to bring wine and ushered valerius through to his private quarters at the rear of the tent when they were seated he gave the younger man a long look i sense you are not convinced valerius drew a deep breath again he remembered vespasians words a good officer must say what needs to be said i think it is a good plan provided everything goes well but there are a thousand reasons why everything may not go well traianus was right to speak out for my own life it does not matter but you are risking the lives of more than twenty thousand men and the reputation you have won over thirty years all war is risk corbulo glanced at the wooden hand and studied valeriuss scarred face how many men did you lead against boudicca at colonia three thousand veterans and a handful of legionaries valerius felt the familiar mix of pride and sorrow that always accompanied mention of colonia he saw again the faces of falco and lunaris messor and corvinus smelled the smoke and the saltsweet scent of roasting flesh three thousand against fifty thousand yes three thousand against fifty thousand but i did not gamble their lives i spent them in the knowledge that boudicca had to be stopped or at least slowed and was she slowed this rebel queen valerius shook his head she waited a day to burn colonia and then marched on londinium she would have done that whether we fought her or not yet you still fought her why the younger man hesitated i have asked myself a thousand times i could have fallen back on the londinium road and used the militia to slow her progress with one ambush after another we could have withdrawn to the woods and harassed her flanks and rear cut off her supply lines no one would have blamed me i repeat my question then why did you fight her pride valerius met corbulos unyielding stare and duty catus decianus had tasked me to hold colonia i fulfilled my orders to the last man the general gave a grunt of satisfaction to the last man yes i can understand how a man like you would do that valerius he poured another drink for each of them and picked up his cup i also understand duty it is my duty to stop king vologases from restoring armenia to parthian rule not my duty to the emperor who would rather i was back in antioch shuffling my forces against an enemy who will never come do not mistake me i understand that i am placing my career and perhaps my life in the emperors hands he is my emperor and i trust him as he must trust me to do as i think right but my first duty is to rome and to my soldiers the soldiers i have spent to ensure that armenia remains loyal to rome and acts as a counterbalance against parthian ambition there will be a further cost no man knows that better than i the tenth though traianus commands it is my creation and i know that i will have to watch the men of the tenth die but we will win gaius valerius verrens do not ever doubt that valerius nodded if he had ever doubted it he did not doubt it now and then then i will return to antioch and support vespasian as well as i am able the only sound in the tent was the gentle rustle of cloth moving in the breeze and the flutter of insects flirting with the flames of the oil lamps valerius wondered if corbulos servants could hear their conversation nero would have his spies in the generals camp that was certain yet corbulo had spoken openly and without fear and that gave valerius the courage to do likewise men speak of you as the next emperor corbulo went very still and valerius wondered if he had misread his man then give me the names of those men and i will have them executed in front of the whole camp tomorrow i have no names have i misjudged you gaius valerius verrens have you been sent here to incriminate me could silence truly have an edge like a sword blade corbulo waited for his answer but valerius knew that if the general needed one he might as well go back to his tent and cut his wrists eventually the other man rose and walked to the tower of caesar he studied the tokens which had been placed in exactly the same positions they had occupied when the two men had finished their game the previous evening with a nod he picked up the blue stone representing the emperor rome is not perfect valerius nero is not perfect but rome is rome and nero is our emperor no man can usurp the emperor without disturbing the delicate balance that is the empire rome is full of ambitious politicians who would not stand idly by as another stole their power the city would have to be fought for fought over and we both understand exactly what that means fire and sword blood and sorrow think of this stone thrown into a still pond watch the rings expand until they reach every corner of the surface that is how it would be every man woman and child in the provinces we rule even those we merely dominate would have their lives thrown into turmoil he replaced the counter you are correct other men would urge me to act i hear the whispers the message you brought from general vespasian was one whatever he decides i will support him i honour vespasian as a man a soldier and a friend but he mistakes me if i march he will march with me but what happens in syria and judaea and cappadocia when we are gone will vologases politely stand by as the legions leave the frontiers open would the balkan legions support me or oppose me or those of upper and lower germania would you ask me to risk roman fighting roman no if vespasian marched i would have to stop him we talked about duty my first duty is to rome and to my province which it is my sacred purpose to protect another man might act in his own selfinterest valerius but that man is not gnaeus domitius corbulo we will speak of this no more valerius nodded and the general returned to the game you have improved remarkably over the past week i fear you have me at bay valerius was surprised when he began to remove the pieces and place them in their starting positions corbulo saw his look we will not be finishing this game traianus was right vologases is no fool he knows that time is his enemy as well as i do soon he will realize that we have turned away from tigranocerta and he will wonder why at some point he will send his light cavalry ahead to secure the cepha gap i intend that you will be there first i want you to take four cavalry wings of archers and spearmen and enough fodder rations and water for five days you will ride ahead of the main column and avoid all combat until you reach the gap your orders are simple once there you will defeat any enemy forces who confront you form a defensive line and hold the position until you are annihilated relieved or the main column arrives have you any questions none sir valerius risked a smile as you say my orders are simple corbulo came close and grasped the younger man by the arm his grip firm win it for me and hold it for me valerius and together we will inflict a defeat on the parthians they will remember for a thousand years xxxiv athens greece his world seemed to be closing in on him until it had been reduced to this tiny dungeon in the palace he had commandeered on the slopes below the acropolis it had all seemed so different this past week for a few days during the games on mount olympus he had felt as if he was soaring with the gods themselves the wonder of his songs and oratory had beguiled the greatest artists in greece the cradle of culture and civilization and they had hailed him as an olympian on the very mount that had given the games their name in those few glorious moments he had left behind the troubles and consternation of the empire and been able to bask in the glory of his own genius to bathe in the cheers of the multitude and to drink the ambrosia of zeus artemis and apollo he sighed and now tigellinus had dragged him back to an earth which even at its best was tawdry by comparison the smell of burning flesh reminded him of the great fire the two men hanging from the sevenfoot iron triangles were brothers and until recently they had been the governors of the two germanias superior and inferior tigellinus had brought rufus and proculus sulpicius scribonius to meet their emperor on the pretext that they were to receive the triumphal regalia for their victories over the chatti and the cherusci germanic tribes who had plagued romes frontiers for centuries but instead of honours all they had received was pain nero walked past the torturers and lifted the chin of the elder scribonius proculus so he could see into his eyes he had been very brave had offered himself for the glowing iron and the knives and the pincers if it would only spare his brother the trial instead tigellinus had used his courage against him and had the younger brother trussed up first nero had watched proculus throw himself against his bonds as they had placed the redhot barbs in rufuss flesh torn his nipples out and removed his nose all to the accompaniment of the torturers chorus of shrieks and howls and agonized groans then he had ordered the older brothers legs broken so he had to crawl to the triangle where he could bring an end to his brothers suffering by replacing him of course that could not happen each was the others weakness they must witness the others pain and mutilation while tigellinus and his clerks recorded the names that must eventually be uttered through broken teeth and torn lips you were my friend proculus why must all my friends betray me it was astonishing the change that fire and iron could accomplish in such a short time the brothers had been young men in the prime of life when they walked into the receiving room in their senatorial robes they had carried themselves like the patricians they were dark leonine heads held high proud of their achievements and proud of each other with their long noses and eyes that disdained all but their own kind men like this had opposed him at every turn since the day he had donned the purple they had blocked his improvements refused him the money he needed to emulate his illustrious ancestors laughed behind their hands at his performances and sneered at his pleasures yet he had taken the brothers scribonius into his trust not for them the tender mercies of tigellinus the threat of the arena the sequestration of their estates and property not even the seduction of their wives he had rewarded them with advancement not because they were worthy but because they were too indolent to do harm in the hands of an able governor either of the two germanias could swiftly become a threat on romes doorstep the legions of the rhine frontier were elite battlehardened soldiers who protected the empire from the eastern hordes they complained constantly of poor pay and poor rations and poor accommodation it made them fractious and difficult to control and dangerous no corbulo would ever command in germania while he was emperor it would be like handing a condemned man a sword instead he had given command to wastrels like these in the sure knowledge that they would spend their time gossiping and entertaining but they had proved him wrong for the brothers scribonius had plotted names proculus he said softly give us names and places and dates and your brother will be spared through the lightning bolts of agony that tore his body proculus sulpicius scribonius heard the voice he had called on all the courage of his ancestors to be able to bear his torment and he would have borne it until death but his baby brothers shrieks had eroded his resolve until he could take no more his delirious mind screamed at him to save rufus whatever the cost he sobbed like a child and the names began as a trickle grew into a stream and finally became a torrent nero turned to tigellinus when you are certain you have it all they go to the fire he hesitated no they were once friends i will be merciful have them take their own lives if they are capable for the next two hours tigellinus checked and doublechecked the names and the dates taking the brothers to new levels of pain to ensure not a single conspirator or conspirators wife or friend or acquaintance had been missed by the end there was no need for either brother to go to the trouble of killing himself left to his own devices tigellinus would have added another name to the list whether it came from the vomitstained lips or not but the roll call of betrayal was recorded if corbulos name was on the list the emperor would call in the clerks to confirm it and if he bribed them they might even reveal that tigellinus had placed it there he couldnt risk that he would find another way the man now shivering in terror in the dungeons below the palatine would provide it willing or not annius vinicianus would condemn his fatherinlaw and if not there was always the egyptian xxxv valerius struggled to stay awake as the mare picked her way over dry rolling pastureland that stretched into the distance no shortage of fodder now the land would provide but water for man and horse continued to be strictly rationed they had been in the saddle for two full days riding by the light of the moon after the sun went down with only a few short rest periods corbulo had said that time was his enemys enemy but valerius knew that it was also his he had spent the hours after the generals conference organizing cajoling and chivvying to ensure that the four cavalry regiments he had chosen for the mission were ready to march at dawn hanno rode at his side the syrians third thracians led the column which contained a second wing of mounted archers the augusta syriaca plus two wings of light cavalry the first ulpia dacorum which corbulo had drafted in from cappadocia and the numidians of the first praetoria one of the generals veteran regiments they were still a long days ride from the cepha gap but valerius was determined to reach his destination before nightfall away to his left rippling in the heat from the fierce sun lay the endless line of hills he recognized from corbulos sand table somewhere to the northeast stood tigranocerta and he prayed that the general was right and the armenian fortresss commander would stay where he was if the armenian broke his word and decided to change his allegiance from tiridates to his brother valeriuss little force would be crushed between two armies like a grape in a wine press even now vologases could already be crossing his front and corbulos plans would be smashed to dust along with the thousands of men he led do you think they are out there hanno turned wearily in the saddle his eyes were just visible in the folds of the dustcaked cloth that covered his helmeted head and his shoulders but valerius sensed he was smiling the syrian shook his head we would have seen signs more activity ahead cavalry patrols seeking out our spearhead he waved a hand behind them to where the other cavalry units were hidden in a plume of yellow dust of course an army as large as that of the parthian king of kings would perpetually carry with it a cloud that cloaked it like a readymade shroud hanno removed the cloth from his face and spat he had a feel for this land that no man who wasnt born here would ever match every sign of movement we have seen has come from the south and nothing since we moved into this valley valerius had never thought of the grasslands they were crossing as a valley but he supposed it was true the hills to the north were matched by mountains to the south which had started as low foothills the previous morning but now created the formidable barrier that stretched eastwards to the far horizon unbroken yet somewhere out there was corbulos gap if it existed he dashed the thought from his mind remembering the specific instructions he had been given riding behind them beside serpentius was an engineer who had been with corbulo from the start the man had created corbulos sand table and he brought with him a leather scroll case containing detailed maps maps he had drawn during the generals expedition during the consulship of petronius lurco the gap was there all valerius needed to do was reach it before the parthians and were sure we packed the special equipment hanno laughed it was the third time valerius had asked the question for answer he adjusted the unfamiliar heavy shield that hung behind him and cursed its awkward unwieldiness valerius tested the sword slung on his back in a harness designed by serpentius so he could draw it over his right shoulder the cavalry spatha corbulo had given him was a fine weapon but the medusapommelled gladius he had carried since boudiccas death was a talisman that had accompanied him this far and he would have felt naked without it when the sun dropped close to the western horizon he began to fear that theyd missed the valley entrance the chances of finding it in darkness would be slim for the sharpeyed thracian scouts even with a threequarter moon to aid them fortunately one of the patrols stumbled upon a shepherd and his two herder sons and valerius set off with hanno to their camp to question them the man and the younger boy sat by the fire that had alerted the thracians to their presence the elder son stood belligerently by the flock of about thirty skinny ragged sheep daring any of hannos men to come near them the shepherd waved valerius to the place of honour on the upwind side of the fire and hanno crouched beside him and made the traditional salutations in his own language valeriuss nostrils twitched at the rank animal smell emanating from his host but he nodded as the man answered hannos questions revealing a mouthful of blackened teeth he says he has seen no parthian patrols the syrian translated or he would have driven his flock to the higher pastures on the hills yonder the parthians would take his sheep unworthy though they are and cheat him he knows the roma are honest men who would never deprive him of his livelihood and would be happy to negotiate a price ask him if he knows of the cepha gap the shepherd shook his head but valerius saw a flash of understanding in the dark liquid eyes of the boy probably less than ten years old sitting opposite him ask him again but more forcefully hanno grinned but when he spoke his voice contained a hard edge and the shepherd glanced nervously at valerius before he replied he says yes now he understands what you mean but he knows it by a different name the road of sorrow for this is the way the kings of parthia and seleucia have ever ridden to milk the lands of armenia tell him he will be well rewarded if he takes us there the smile didnt reach the shepherds eyes and he gestured regretfully to his sheep alas hanno translated he says he and his family must stay with their sheep without them they will starve when winter comes as the north wind says it soon must and there are wolves from the mountains you have doubtless seen their tracks he honours you but he must decline though he will gladly provide you with directions the shepherd nodded and smiled ingratiatingly then the boy will take us valerius pointed to the younger son and two of hannos escort lifted him to his feet the father began to wail but hanno snarled at him and he lapsed into silence now he is willing the syrian grinned at valerius no the boy will take us i do not trust the father he would find some means of slipping away in the night bring him they remounted leaving the shepherd standing beside the fire with the older son who had abandoned his charges what will we do with them valerius understood it was not a question but a reminder if we leave them behind and a parthian patrol stumbles on them as we have i know prefect the romans voice was harsher than he intended but hannos expression didnt alter make sure they are fed first the syrian issued the order and as they galloped off valerius could hear him laughing aye a full belly will make a cut throat all the easier to bear they are here valerius cursed as he heard the scouts whisper to the third thracian commander the column had reined in a few hundred paces from the northern entrance of the cepha gap in the shadow of the hills while a patrol checked for the enemy how many hanno demanded perhaps seventy a reinforced patrol only now did valerius recognize the voice of hassan the damascus traders son the usual mix of archers and spearmen if their mounts are to be believed seventy you are certain and you werent seen does a vole see the hunting owl on the first pass does the hare see the eagle white teeth grinned in the darkness they are camped in the centre of the valley but their sentries are weary and have grown careless janos slipped past them and checked as far as the great river is that not so janos seventy my life on it agreed another voice aye so be it hanno said when we charge them you will be the first to meet their spears wait hassan turned at the sound of valeriuss voice if you slipped past them once can you do it again this time with twenty men if i may choose them the valley is broad enough for it to be done is it worth the risk of discovery hanno sounded doubtful if so much as a man escapes vologases will send every sword spear and bow he can get into the saddle and they will be on us before daybreak can we take that risk for answer the syrian made his dispositions janos pick out your men archers eh hassan position your scouts and be ready to take out the guards at the first sign of an alert tribune i would beg the honour of allowing the third thracians to make the attack very well valerius nodded but i want you here by my side you are too valuable to lose to a stray arrow we will deploy twelve squadrons he saw hannos grin of acceptance but he knew the syrian would be disappointed to miss the battle if it could be called a battle with a numerical superiority of six to one and the element of surprise in favour of the attackers but he could take no chances not a man could be allowed to escape we need to know the position of vologases and his forces so i want prisoners hanno nodded and went to issue his orders leaving valerius alone in the darkness or so he thought how long do you think well have to hold them vologases will march at first light serpentius and i doubt if hes more than two or three hours away even if he orders a forced march its unlikely the general will reach us by the eighth hour six hours maybe more then lets hope the king of kings enjoys a long breakfast valerius imagined the might of the parthian army marching against his puny lightly armoured force lets hope he chokes on it but first there was a valley to win cloaked in their white shrouds the twelve squadrons of the third thracian cavalry ala appeared as ephemeral as ghosts in the silver moonlight they approached at a walk spread in formation across the valley with their prefect and general corbulos cavalry commander on their right flank valerius knew the cloaks provided camouflage of a sort against the moonlit rocks and grass but it couldnt be long now if the guards didnt react the attackers would break into the trot at two hundred paces and sweep through the camp peppering anything that moved with their arrows when hassans scouts had dealt with the sentries they would move into the parthian horse lines hamstringing and cutting throats any parthian who escaped from the camp would be cut down by janos and his screen of archers valerius reined in and watched the troopers ride by and he heard hannos whispered curse as his gelding twitched and fidgeted demanding to be with its brethren his nerves stretched like lyre strings as the silent minutes passed hassan must have done well because there was no alarm cry or trumpet call as the first squadrons reached the trot and it wasnt until they could feel the quake of the ground beneath them that the parthians began to react he heard shouted orders and panicked cries a scream that was cut off the instant it began then the silver horde was on the little circle of parthian tents it was done congratulations prefect hanno grinned at him now the real work begins this is the narrowest and most defensible point of the valley it is sir corbulos engineer petronius an intense balding man assured valerius it narrows a little more to the north but the valley walls are less steep this is where we have the best chance of holding them very well valerius marched forty paces ahead and called his cavalry commanders to form a circle around him they crouched together as troopers enclosed them in a ring of cloaks and serpentius lit an oil lamp in the centre with his dagger valerius sketched out a rough drawing in a sandy patch hed chosen the narrowest part of the valley is here he pointed to the position the engineer had indicated but we will make our defensive line at this point he laid the dagger across the valley approximately where they now stood if he expected a protest or at least a question he was disappointed but he realized it was a measure of the respect he had won from these hard men in the weeks hed ridden with them he felt a pulse of pride that he immediately suppressed it was all very well to issue orders but if he made a miscalculation every one of these soldiers would be dead before tomorrows sunset marcus the augusta syriaca will form a covering line here first ulpia and first praetoria i want staggered lines of camouflaged twobytwo pits dug across the neck of the valley behind the defence line we dont have stakes to make them proper horse killers but he produced a fourpronged iron spike from beneath his cloak caltrops every man in the column carried four of these thats ten thousand of them to be scattered between the pits a killing field fifty paces deep youll be working in the dark but this has to be done properly the pits and caltrops must be set to create diagonal lanes which will allow the withdrawal or reinforcement of all units thats the job of our engineer petronius nodded gravely he will supervise your work finally prefect hanno the third thracians have done their work for the day and done it well they will form a reserve ready to support syriaca and provide patrols to locate and track the army of king vologases i need to know exactly where they are and in what numbers from first light at the latest do you have any questions why dont we fight from behind the pit line from the start the syriacas commander asked softly by fighting in front of it we accept greater casualties and deny ourselves the ability to hurt the parthians valerius nodded thats true marcus in the flickering yellow light of the oil lamp he looked each of them in the eye we fight in front of the pit line because the pit line has been dug for the main force we will fight and we will die in front of the pit line and only if we are on the point of annihilation will we withdraw behind it that decision will be taken either by myself or if i am dead by prefect hanno is that understood this is our ground and we will hold them here or die in the attempt xxxvi the last scouts rode in at the gallop as the first light of dawn coated the eastern mountains pink and gold the cepha gap was a threeandahalfmilelong gorge that slashed through an otherwise unbroken range of sawtoothed peaks the valleys thousandfoot sheer flanks of fractured red sandstone were divided by a mile of dry grassland at its widest point but in places it was much narrower valerius watched as a fastmoving squall of parthian cavalry appeared from the dust behind his patrol howling and yipping and loosing arrows from the saddle with every eye on their prey it was a moment before the pursuers realized what they were seeing and drew their horses to a disbelieving halt in a shower of flying earth from valley wall to valley wall a long line of roman shields blocked their passage an undernourished patchy line its ranks lacking the solidity that would be expected from the cream of roman infantry but the message carried by the big curved shields was clear the legions were here and if king vologases army wanted to reach tigranocerta it must first destroy them valerius had always known that the only way to hold the gap against a serious assault was on foot that was why he had insisted the lightly armed cavalry exchange their regular round shields for proper legionary scuta begged and borrowed from the tenth and the fifteenth with corbulos assistance now the emblems of the two elite eastern legions filled the valley with dismounted cavalry troopers behind them at this point the gap measured a thousand paces wide as the engineer calculated it valerius had formed his men into five weakened cohorts in line abreast each one hundred men wide and five deep with a tenpace division between each unit to the riders watching from a few hundred paces away it must have appeared that an unbroken wall of shields had sprouted across the width of the valley yet it was a pitifully weak poorly armed and unsupported line he did not have enough men to both hold the ground and form a reserve in time of danger each cohort must support its neighbour two figures broke away from the group of riders and rode south couriers carrying the unwelcome news to vologases king of kings that a force of phantoms had materialized to bar his way the remaining parthian horse perhaps a hundred strong burst into movement first circling so that valerius guessed they must be retreating to gather reinforcements before advancing to ride across the face of the roman line at a hundred paces distant unlike the earlier patrol valerius had encountered this was composed entirely of archers small men unarmoured on light horses and ideal for the hit and run tactics that corbulo had warned him were the parthian speciality he waited for the inevitable flurry of arrows but the patrols commander must have sensed something in the line of shields that smelled of weakness without warning he wheeled his horse and led his men directly for the gap between the two left hand formations if he could breach the roman defences it would give him a deadly advantage when the main parthian force arrived valerius knew that if the parthians found their way to the auxiliary horse lines in a gully two hundred paces behind the lines disadvantage could turn to disaster a hail of arrows fired at short range from the gallop smacked into the shields of the front ranks of the two cohorts with the sound of a hundred branches snapping valerius heard the auxiliaries draw a collective breath but thankfully there was no cry for the medical orderlies within two strides the parthians reached the marker stones that identified optimum javelin range the defending cohorts were a mix of bowmen and javelin throwers and with a single shouted order a hundred javelins sailed out from the spearmen flanking the gap and converged on the galloping parthians like a deadly summer shower men grunted screamed and gasped as the light spears tore muscle and sinew scraped bone and found heart or lung a dozen horses crumpled in a single choreographed movement impeding those not agile enough to avoid them two more strides and the survivors absorbed another perfectly timed cast this time those left unscathed reeled away from the killing zone and turned back accompanied by the jeers of the untouched roman line quiet valerius roared a single rider breached the gap an archer in the final rank of the left hand cohort turned and loosed his arrow took the parthian in the base of the skull and the horse rode on with the rider dead in the saddle until it reached the pit line and went down in a cloud of dust screaming with the agony of a snapped foreleg satisfied valerius waited until the surviving parthians had gathered in a sullen group well out of bow range before he ordered the cleanup men from the second rank of the roman line ran to where the parthian injured lay stunned and groaning among the dead the auxiliaries roamed among the carnage with brutal efficiency cutting throats and providing the mercy stroke as they stripped men and horses of weapons and arrows and recovered bundles of javelins i want their coats and helmets too valerius reminded them all through the long morning the men of valeriuss little command stood in the burning heat and watched with growing dread the buildup of king vologases forces the parthians were preceded by the sound of distant thunder that echoed from the valley walls a deep menacing throb that seemed to slowly work its way into a mans soul gradually the defeated survivors of the parthian charge were absorbed into the mass of the armys vanguard the countless horde of light horse which swirled and flowed like the surface of a great river across valeriuss front seeking some way to break the roman dam at first it was insubstantial a veil of individual squadrons and regiments that lightly dotted the land but gradually the veil became a blanket and the blanket thickened to become a great multicoloured swathe of humanity that blocked out the coarse grassland the feeling of enormous pressure building up behind the vanguard grew but they never ventured closer than four hundred paces why dont they come hanno demanded it would be the work of a moment to sweep us aside valerius nodded silently such a horde could turn the sky black with arrows and force the romans into the tortoise formation the testudo that made them invulnerable to missile attack but conversely would leave them open to a charge by the heavy armoured cavalry that were somewhere out there in that great mass the answer came to him his ruse had worked better than he had believed possible it is because they think we are a full roman legion through his spies vologases will know that corbulo has marched if not exactly where perhaps he has informed his generals perhaps not but the tribal chiefs who lead those warrior bands have been told that armenia is already won and they are but an escort to see vologases to his throne this was to be a progression they might expect some opposition from roving bands of armenian rebels but not this whoever commands the vanguard will look at our shields and see the prospect of allout war with rome he dare not make his move without consulting vologases himself and vologases dare not move without gauging the strength which opposes him then we have won if corbulo comes but the sun reached its zenith and still corbulo did not come valerius ordered the last of the water distributed amongst the men behind the curved red shields and it was like nectar in their dustcaked throats by now the cavalrymen were reeling on their feet and he wondered if they were even capable of meeting a parthian charge never mind repelling it yet when he marched along the ranks to inspect their dispositions they cheered him as if they had won a victory he remembered paulinus the man he had to thank for better or worse for being here and the stirring speech the then governor of britain had made before boudiccas last battle valerius fervently wished he had the same words to say to his soldiers but somehow they would not come not that it mattered they knew the situation as well as he did if corbulo didnt come they were all dead still corbulo didnt come but the king of kings did an ominous ripple ran through the ranks of the great army facing the roman line and every man tensed to meet the attack valerius mounted khamsin and took his place in the rear with hanno and serpentius at his side from the centre of the parthian horde a single figure emerged holding not a lance or a bow but a branch of green leaves it seems the king of kings wishes to talk hanno murmured then let us not disappoint him valerius nudged his horse between the ranks and on to the plain where he waited until hanno joined him with an escort of mounted spearmen together they rode to greet the parthian emissary they met midway between the two mismatched forces and hanno spoke to the parthian in his own tongue he says that sasan spear carrier to vologases king of kings overlord of armenia conqueror of elam protector of the medes and lord of babylon sagartia and margiania wishes to discuss the terms of your surrender tell him that we came here to fight not to talk but if this sasan speaks with the authority of the king of kings we are willing to hear what he has to say hanno spat out the translation and the warrior nodded at a hidden signal the parthian ranks opened and a dozen mounted men emerged at the trot led by an astonishing figure who glittered with gold from the top of his helmeted head to the fringe of the chain mail trapper that covered his mounts head back and chest and extended to its knees the rider was an enormous man wearing a long tunic of fishscale armour complemented by metal armlets and leggings his gleaming helmet was topped by a plume of red horsehair and a mail curtain hung from the rear to protect his neck this parthian warlord had a face the gods had designed to project hatred dark eyes glared out from beneath beetle brows and the narrow bitter mouth was topped by an enormous hooked nose and twisted in what might have been a smile or a sneer sasan wore his beard clubbed and plaited with brightly coloured ribbons and his broad moustaches fell below his cheeks his escort carried spears twice the height of a man but their commanders only arms were a long sword hanging from a loop at his wrist and the curved dagger in his belt beside him rode a figure in an ornately embroidered tunic with a large drum hanging from either side of his saddle valerius remembered what he thought had been thunder earlier in the day and realized that the drums were the equivalent of the roman trumpets which could carry signals across the noisiest battlefield vologases would know the outcome of the discussions before he and hanno returned to the roman lines if they lived that long the leaders horse stood a head taller than khamsin and valerius studied his enemy carefully as sasan brought the beasts nose to nose making the akhalteke quiver and shift tall savage and as pitiless as the harsh landscape that surrounded them the parthian returned his stare with contempt for myself i would cut off the arms and legs of every roman who insults my people with their presence and impale them alive as examples of what awaits the next invader who passes this way but the king of kings graciously accepts your surrender the words were in precise greekaccented latin and uttered in a tone of bored irritation he will allow you to leave this place unharmed and unmolested with your arms and your standards on condition that you go immediately and do not stop until you are beyond the euphrates valerius frowned as if he was considering the offer did i hear an ass bray or was it the sound of an elephant farting he directed the question at hanno but he noticed a glint of mild amusement in the parthians eye we have travelled a long way and this legion is only one of many they are weary and need rest it would take several hours perhaps days to organize the march so i must decline your kings generous offer besides the only invaders i see are the ones before me sasan sniffed and spat in valeriuss general direction do not think your pathetic little army frightens me roman when i destroyed the legions of general paetus at rhandea i learned to read their strength by their standards i see beyond your tricks a wall of legionary shields with auxiliaries shitting themselves behind them but it does not matter the king of kings could destroy you with a snap of his fingers the only thing that prevents him is a desire for peaceful progress what you see is but a fraction of the multitude which escorts the king of kings to inspect his brothers dominions do you deny him that right you are like a mouse beneath a buffalos hooves if you will not go then move aside lest it squash you into the dust his eyes noticed the walnut fist you have been careless it seems it would be unfortunate were you to lose any further extremities will they replace thy head with a wooden one when i take it for a trophy my head will remain on my shoulders while your bones moulder in the dust parthian valerius matched the other mans tone we are here at king tiridates invitation and here we stay tell your king of kings to go back the way he came and no harm will come to him tell him that if he attacks me he attacks general gnaeus domitius corbulo and if he attacks corbulo he attacks rome rome does not forget her enemies but she remembers her friends if your king is wise he will remain romes friend so the mouse squeaks defiance sasan laughed good it has been many a month since my spear tasted blood i told vologases he should have unleashed his hounds the moment our scouts reported you were blocking the valley the next time you look at the sun you will not see it for arrows the next time you look at my face you will be screaming for mercy those who fight will be slaughtered those who yield will become beasts of burden carrying shit to my farmers fields i will take your skull for a drinking bowl your wooden hand for my dogs to chew and the fingers of the other to make a necklace for my wife he turned his horse away you talk well roman now let us see how you fight as they rode back to the roman position valerius exchanged glances with hanno that went better than i expected aye the syrian said i suppose they might have cut our throats then and there instead of making us wait how do you kill a man like sasan first you kill his horse all i saw of his horse was its eyes and its hooves hanno nodded fortunately sasan is one in ten thousand the kings spear carrier holds a high position in his court almost a king in his own right no ordinary man could afford such armour for warrior and horse most of the parthian cataphracts wear body armour but their horses are unprotected it means the man is hard to kill but the horse is not but it is not the cataphracts we must fear it is their archers who will kill us how long an hour perhaps less then pray that corbulo comes soon xxxvii the attack would be in overwhelming strength vologases would mass his archers and savage the roman ranks with endless showers of arrows that would turn the sky black shields or no shields valerius knew his men would suffer casualties in an hour perhaps less a thousand of these men would be dead or injured perhaps he would be dead himself and when the roman line was holed and leaking blood the king of kings would send in his invincibles the armoured cavalry led by mighty warriors like sasan it was a battle which could have only one ending but it takes time to position tens of thousands of archers and time to organize the metalclad spearmen who would follow them too much time because a blast of horns announced that corbulo had come legate traianus sends his compliments and where would you like us sir valerius turned to find a breathless tiberius at his shoulder grinning like a boy presented with his first toga he clapped the younger man on the shoulder your ugly face has never been more welcome tribune tell traianus i suggest he places the tenth fretensis in front of the auxiliary line cohort formation with his flanks anchored against the valley walls the cohorts of the fifteenth and the auxiliary infantry will form the second line the young man ran off and valerius watched with serpentius as to the sound of the familiar trumpet calls the legionary heavy infantry streamed through the gaps in the pit line and along the front of the relieved auxiliaries effortlessly moving from column to cohort the legion was formed of ten cohorts the tactical fighting unit of the roman army nine of them made up of four hundred and eighty men organized into six centuries of eighty legionaries each plus the elite first cohort almost double that strength with eight hundred men the first included the legions aquilifer who carried the eagle standard and took his place behind the line beside his legate the cavalrymen began cheering and hanno opened his mouth to stop them but valerius interrupted him leave them be ten minutes ago they thought they were dead let them celebrate if they had any sense theyd attack us now serpentius pointed to where the enemy archers wheeled and circled in apparent confusion valerius nodded even with reinforcements pouring into the valley the roman position would never be more vulnerable than now with the defensive line half formed and the men weary from the long march but half a mile away vologases waited and did nothing thats the trouble with having an enormous army the clatter of hooves announced corbulos arrival along with his aides and signallers it takes a long time for commands to be distributed any of vologases generals who acted without orders would face the strangling rope even if his actions resulted in victory valerius studied him for any sign of irony but clearly corbulo didnt equate his own position with that of a parthian general what is your estimate of enemy numbers anything between sixty and seventy thousand plus the usual slaves stockmen and baggage carriers and king vologases harem corbulo frowned at hannos intervention and valerius could swear the syrian blushed under his dark skin he is said to have three hundred wives hanno stumbled on and will certainly have brought at least half with him then you must be sure not to inconvenience them valerius hanno looked mystified and corbulo continued seventy thousand similar odds to those faced by my old friend suetonius against your rebel queen similar odds and a similar position valerius confirmed suetonius paulinus had lured boudicca to the field of his choice a long shallow slope bounded by trees and hills to left and right to ensure he wouldnt be outflanked and on that slope the flower of boudiccas army died but not a similar enemy boudiccas warriors were brave but they werent organized they knew how to fight as individuals and they died as individuals vologases army knows how to kill romans and they enjoy doing it he thought he might have gone too far but corbulo only nodded distractedly then we must ensure the same outcome despite that uncomfortable fact valerius didnt mention the other similarity in the position of the two armies suetonius had left himself nowhere to retreat if the roman line had been broken the legionaries would have been slaughtered to the last man withdraw your troops when the tenth is in position the general said make sure they are rested fed and watered youve done well valerius you have given us a chance but there is more work to do ill give you two hours and then you must be in the saddle leave me one cohort of light cavalry to keep king vologases amused valerius saluted and left hanno to organize his men on the way back to the horses he and serpentius met tiberius as the tribune hurried back to his general valerius hailed the young soldier fortuna be with you tiberius i said you would have your chance to become a hero well this is it tiberiuss eyes darkened i had hoped to fight at your side valerius smiled there will be other times tiberius what you know better than to ask a good soldier obeys orders and keeps his mouth shut for rome the younger man looked incredibly vulnerable as he returned the salute for rome serpentius commented the parthians will eat him alive no valerius studied the retreating back i dont think they will his unit commanders were waiting at the mouth of the valley and he quizzed them on the readiness of each cohort until hanno arrived when he finally revealed their mission a few of them shook their heads in disbelief but no one questioned the plan and they dispersed to alert their troops two hours later valerius rode north at the head of corbulos cavalry leaving to their fate the two legions who would soon be facing the combined might of vologases archers and cataphracts he could feel the confusion and disappointment in his men they were soldiers and conditioned to obey orders without question but that didnt stop them wondering why they were riding away from a battle well they would find out soon enough in an hour he would turn east towards the mountains of ancient mazandaran and the great sea a land that had defeated even alexander auxiliary units arriving with the rearguard of corbulos force stared unhappily as their cavalry deserted them there were a few shouts of derision but valerius and his men ignored them the squeak of wheels alerted him to the arrival of a line of heavily laden carts he remembered his puzzlement when he had noticed them in the baggage train at zeugma now he saw again the massed ranks of parthian warriors packed into the valley and thought he understood so that was what the old fox intended with a last look back to where corbulo awaited the first parthian attack he urged khamsin forward to whatever fate would bring at first the going was easy on the dry flatlands north of the mountains valerius was able to deploy his regiments three abreast across the plain and minimize the dust cloud by keeping them to a walk only when they were well away from the valley did he have his signaller sound the trot at first the entire force was contained within a square mile of grassland but gradually the country became more broken and the troopers were forced back into column even riding eight abreast valerius was dismayed to realize his force stretched back almost five miles petronius the engineer who had accompanied corbulos expeditions rode at valeriuss side occasionally consulting one of his scrolls and studying his surroundings with fierce concentration this is it he said when they reached a path leading up a valley identical to a dozen others they had passed valerius thought he sensed doubt are you certain certain how many times have you been this way once eight years ago once petronius nodded once he saw the look in valeriuss eye but im certain the ground rose gradually and the path became less distinct to their front lay what appeared to be an impenetrable mountain range but for now valerius kept his concerns to himself he and petronius rode ahead of the column until they reached a small plateau when valerius looked back he felt his spirits quail by now it was almost dusk in the golden haze the dust raised by the line of cavalrymen stretched far into the distance snaking along a track that was now only wide enough to accommodate two horses at a time the men at the tail would still be far out on the plain it was impossible can it be done he cursed the fear in his own voice not fear for his life but fear that he would fail i believe so the engineer said with the gods aid valerius heard the unspoken and if the commander can hold his nerve then it will be done the words emerged as a snarl and petronius flinched at the violence in them it was the numbers valerius thought the numbers made it impossible perhaps if he sent half of his regiments back it could be done but that would leave him with too few men to achieve what corbulo demanded is there any reason why vologases shouldnt do what we are doing petronius hesitated before answering no but it is unlikely he already has the alternative of continuing along the tigris to outflank us in the west it would cost him a week and general corbulo has placed a token force there to block him but it could be done valerius looked at the sky as the first riders began to pass him it will be dark in an hour the engineer nodded order them to dismount and wrap their horses hooves to deaden any sound he was still on the plateau when hanno rode up twenty minutes later the syrians exhausted eyes mirrored valeriuss thoughts it is impossible he said quietly yes it was impossible but it had to be done because if valerius failed corbulos army was doomed xxxviii rome they came for annius vinicianus in the ghost hour before dawn when the spirit is at its lowest and the mind dulled he had been proud of the way hed held out against their repeated questioning and threats there had been no violence so far and though he was a roman citizen who would soon take his seat in the senate that had surprised him he was no fool he knew of the horrors nero had visited on his enemies that he had been treated so gently he put down to the fact that he had commanded a legion before he was thirty and more so to being the soninlaw of the illustrious corbulo how he wished he had listened to his fatherinlaw who could have predicted a little drunken tittletattle among old friends would lead to a damp cell and an uncertain future without warning the door smashed back and he huddled against the wall as six jailers burst in wielding clubs and screaming at him to get to his feet helpless and bewildered he was dragged bodily through a series of tunnels but his legs told him that he was descending with every step the deeper they went the darker his thoughts he had imagined this moment had steeled himself for it in his imagination he had conducted himself with dignity now he felt only a hopeless terror that manifested itself in a weakness in his bladder and a head bursting with panic his nostrils filled with the thick stink of decay and putrefaction until it blocked his throat like something solid far above him the palaces were filled with light and perfume down here the slime and filth of ages coated the walls glinting green in the eerie glow of the torchlight somewhere ahead a man screamed a shriek of mortal agony that froze his blood and anchored his feet to the ground it was as if a signal had been given his guards turned on him and he went down screaming under a hail of punches and kicks a blow from a nailed sandal dazed him and he felt himself picked up and carried until they reached some kind of wooden door that creaked when they opened it inside stairs descended ever more steeply into the hill like the passage to the underworld his stunned mind registered the rattle of chains and he felt his tunic being ripped away when he opened his eyes he was fettered to a wall by the arms in a wide room lit only by the low red glow of a brazier in front of the brazier a table was arrayed with a butchers selection of blades hooks and irons that turned his bowels to liquid the guards left him without a word and his mind fought the horror of what was to come it was a few moments before he noticed the eyes they glowed an unearthly red like the eyes of a rat reflected in the light of a street torch and they belonged to someone some thing hiding in the darkness on the far side of the brazier as he watched the eyes came closer and he saw that they belonged to a hairless fleshcovered skeleton that rattled something across the bars that held it captive the creature stared at him with the intensity of an executioner and for the first time annius vinicianus knew the true meaning of fear without taking its eyes from him the filthcovered beast began to rub the human thigh bone it held on the stone floor of its cage sharpening the end to a fine point annius felt each unhurried scrape of the bone like a nail across the inside of his skull you have met our egyptian i see he flinched at the unexpected voice from the doorway offonius tigellinus a short sword naked in his hand walked unhurriedly into the centre of the room and took his place by the hot coals annius sensed someone else in the stair but the praetorian prefect waved a languid hand and they were left alone with the baleful creature in the cage tigellinus allowed the silence to stretch until the thin membrane inside the younger mans head that is the dividing line between insanity and madness was near breaking point they caught him in alexandria the praetorian said presently some sort of merchant children and young girls had been disappearing and they eventually traced them to his door it must have been quite distressing all that meat hanging on hooks dried and salted as if it was in some butchers storehouse he had a special liking for fresh liver i believe astonishing that they didnt kill him there and then the emperor was visiting egypt at the time and decided to keep him as a pet and an entertainment anniuss eyes were locked on the red craters that held him as a snake holds a mouse he choked back the bile that filled his throat at the thought of the horrors that had occurred inside these walls the screams of the victims unheard beneath thousands of tons of rock and marble i am innocent of any crime he despised himself for the fear that was so apparent in his voice tigellinus shook his head sadly not because it was not true but because the young man chained before him could be so naive everyone who comes here is innocent at first as he spoke he stepped closer and his voice seemed to caress anniuss flesh one name can spare you this annius stared at him one name what name he drew himself up as well as he could in his chains i am a roman citizen he cried i am innocent of any crime i demand to be tried by a court of my peers very well tigellinus sighed wearily two men appeared from the doorway annius vinicianus had never seen eyes so empty begin after three hours annius had delivered up to tigellinus every name his painswamped brain could think of as well as those with whom hed discussed the possibility of removing nero he had implicated most of his family and friends his fathers acquaintances in the senate many of the officers in his legion and all the slaves on the family estate it seemed even the honoured dead were among his coconspirators he lapsed in and out of consciousness but whatever horrors were inflicted upon him he never spoke the name tigellinus prayed to hear tigellinus was an experienced inquisitor but more so a seasoned survivor the clerks were here to record the list of the newly guilty he knew he could not utter the name himself because nero would hear of it and that would weaken his position but if he could only get this young fool to say the name once of his own volition the last stone would be in place the danger to the empire would be nullified the emperor would be saved from his own weakness it was time take him down the torturers lifted annius vinicianus from the hook that held his chains and laid him on the filthcovered floor is he alive tigellinus already knew the answer to his question but he stooped gripping the point on the young mans arm where the shattered ends of two bones protruded from the flesh and forced them together annius let out a shriek of mortal agony and his eyes flickered open tigellinus waited until they had focused on him before kneeling and putting his mouth to what remained of an ear one name annius and it will all be over one name he frowned with annoyance at the incomprehension he read in the haggard face one name annius he repeated the name that is dearest to you every minute of anniuss torment had been accompanied by the rattle of the naked thigh bone across the bars of the egyptians cage the inhuman red eyes had taken in every cut and every touch of the iron the ears every scream and howl saliva drooled from his thin lips and the flat nose twitched at the scent of cooking meat as the victim had been lowered from the wall the cannibals excitement had grown beyond containment and he began to howl like a dog for the egyptian knew what was coming very well have done with him tigellinus said annius felt himself being lifted as his head lolled towards the cage the bright red eyes entered his vision and he remembered no from somewhere he found his voice the cannibal had not been fed for a week and the howl was replaced by an animal shriek as he saw the living flesh being brought to him no somewhere in his incomprehensible terror part of annius vinicianuss brain fought for survival a name his torturer wanted a name what had tigellinus said the name that is dearest to you the name that is dearest to you he couldnt think for fear he had already soiled himself and now he did so again as he heard the rattle of the barred door being opened and saw the thigh bone pushed out to touch his flesh the name that is dearest to you the name that is dearest to you the name that is dearest to you corbulo his scream was so piercing that even the cannibal recoiled from it corbulo corbulo corbulo the litany only ended when tigellinus put a finger to his smashed lips the praetorian commander beckoned the clerks closer his voice was almost gentle what was the name corbulo annius sobbed the awfulness of his betrayal only just dawning gnaeus domitius corbulo general of the east tigellinus kept his face solemn very well keep him safe for the emperor and remember annius vinicianus the egyptian will always be waiting for you here left alone with only the whimpering cannibal for a companion tigellinus allowed himself a smile of pure triumph the game was won xxxix tiberius winced as another parthian arrow thudded into his shield with the sound of an axe biting into a tree trunk it could only be a matter of time before one found a gap in his defences and he would join the growing number who crawled to the rear groaning in agony and coughing up blood two hours and already the legion was bleeding to death corbulo had deployed the tenth fretensis in a double line of cohorts each eight men deep and with a front of sixty which stretched across the valley behind them ready to be rotated into the line waited the seven full cohorts of the fifteenth plus the auxiliary spearmen slingers and archers who had marched alongside them he had spaced his forces at intervals to allow room between them for his cavalry to launch counterattacks it was a tactic that had worked since the time of caesar and pompey and he had used it to hurt the parthians at tigranocerta he was gambling that vologases would be wary of those cavalry who now raised a constant dust cloud in the valley at the rear of the roman line what the parthian king of kings did not know was that the dust was being created by a single ala of five hundred men barely enough to provide patrols scouts and couriers for corbulos force tiberius had watched the auxiliary mountain troops from noricum scale the precipitous valley walls to take their positions on the heights above with them went a unit of signallers and the hillmens job was to protect them and ensure corbulos dispositions stayed secret from vologases while the parthian movements would be communicated to the roman general by flag it would give him a small advantage but advantages were few and far between bastards bastards bastards the man crouched behind the next shield muttered his profane mantra to the rhythm of arrows which fell like hailstones on a drum just come a dozen yards closer and ill stick this pilum so far up your arse but tiberius knew they wouldnt come close because they didnt have to instead massed ranks of mounted archers charged to within bowshot of the roman line to loose their arrows before withdrawing like surf from a beach and disappearing into their own dust only to be replaced by the next wave of howling barbarians again and again they came flaying corbulos snarling impotent legionaries with clouds of missiles from a seemingly neverending supply in the front rank of the lefthand cohort tiberiuss suffocating world was reduced to the rear panels of his curved shield the only thing that was keeping him alive and the sweating contorted face of his neighbour packed close enough to share the stink of their combined fear that vied with the reek of voided bowels from someone nearby behind him tiberius could feel the presence of the man in the next rank whose aching arm held aloft the shield that covered them both from the aerial threat his belly ached and his throat was filled with dust heat thirst and hunger were his constant companions all around above the constant rattle of falling arrows he could hear the cries of the wounded and the dying to the accompaniment of the continuous thunder of the parthian drummers urging the next wave forward cocooned within the claustrophobic protection of the shields he fought a rising tide of anger the composite bows of wood bone and sinew outranged any javelin and the general had ordered his auxiliary archers to hoard their precious arrows until they were needed most it meant the parthian bowmen could do their work unhindered and unthreatened he imagined he could hear them laughing and prayed for the moment corbulo would let loose his spearmen a quick dash and a single volley of the heavily weighted pila would teach them to laugh at rome but tiberius had seen what happened when a man broke ranks through a gap between the shields he had watched as a legionary tormented beyond reason had dropped his shield and run into the arrowflayed nomansland screaming for a proper fight in the time it had taken to draw his sword a hundred parthian arrows had transformed him into a human porcupine no he must listen for the trumpet call that would signal corbulos next order and endure shit tiberius winced at the sting of splinters on his cheek as the barbed point of an arrow punched through three layers of seasoned ash to stop less than an inch from his nose he struggled to control an involuntary loosening in his guts and exchanged a shamefaced grin with the legionary at his side his neighbour grinned back but in the same instant the grin became a teethbaring grimace and an animal groan escaped from his throat tiberius looked down and saw that the legionarys sandalled foot had been pinned to the ground by an arrow with only the flight and a few inches of shaft showing above the shattered bone and spurting scarlet careful to keep the shield level he reached across with his right hand to try to pull the foot free and allow the soldier to stagger or crawl back to where the medical orderlies struggled to deal with a steady stream of casualties the barbed parthian arrows were almost impossible to remove without proper surgical tools and any attempt was likely to leave a gaping hole that would condemn the man to a slow death no the legionary rasped through gritted teeth here i am and here ill stay just let the bastards come but the bastards would not come not until the roman line was a shattered reeling shadow of what it was now only when corbulos proud legions had been humbled would vologases loose his champions the armoured cataphracts led by men like sasan invulnerable to arrow sling and spear and wielding the twelvefoot lance that could smash through a shield to pin a legionary like a cockroach they would scythe through the thinned ranks the way he had once seen a runaway cart smash through a market crowd leaving broken bodies in their wake for the parthian infantry the poorly armed dregs of vologases army to finish off then the way would be open to tigranocerta and artaxata and the king of kings would sit upon his brothers throne and dare rome to evict him but corbulo had not come here to lose just as tiberius had not come here only to fight and die night must arrive soon and with it respite and somewhere out there in the darkness was valerius with the roman cavalry thoughts of valerius made him ponder the nature of friendship for a few blessed moments he allowed his mind to wander tiberius claudius crescens was a young man whose upbringing had made friendship difficult if not impossible discipline had been beaten into him from the beginning and with discipline came responsibility he was a personable child and people warmed to him but whenever he became close to the men of his fathers command or the bastard children who swarmed the village outside the fort something always seemed to happen he would see a rusty sword which must be reported a boys mother might have stolen an egg or another womans ragged blanket he called it honesty they called it betrayal gradually they had learned not to trust him and eventually to avoid him entirely even his brother had not been his friend for he had been engineered to exhibit the same qualities eventually he had doubted that he would ever know the true meaning of friendship yet when he had met valerius he had felt an unexpected warmth for another human being that surprised him it was not only admiration for the scarred tribunes fighting qualities and the battle honours he had won from the first valerius had treated him with respect and an affection that was almost brotherly he remembered the epic fight on the ship and the contest of minds that was as intense as that of the swords somehow there was a bond between them that transcended mere acquaintance he knew he didnt lack courage far from it but sometimes the battlefield could be a lonely place and he wished more than anything that valerius could be here by his side a weary sigh escaped him what would tomorrow bring for the moment he was beyond caring all he knew as the great drums thundered the arrows fell and the men died was that he must endure and survive from his position behind the roman line gnaeus domitius corbulo watched his soldiers suffer and die this was his plan his decision and there was no place in his mind for uncertainty yes he could feel pride even compassion for the men under his command who were bleeding out on the plain but wars could not be fought without casualties these men were legionaries and sometimes it was a legionarys duty to suffer and die just as it was a commanders duty to stand and watch them do so he studied the ebb and flow of the attacks with intense concentration somewhere in the centre of that immense throng the king of kings wrestled with his own version of corbulos caesar he could almost feel the other mans frustration more than ever he was certain time was the enemy of vologases the parthian army was composed of a volatile mix of the followers of powerhungry warlords and petty kings from all over his empire they were impatient men with estates to work and harvests to gather flattery and bribery were the only diplomacy they understood the king of kings had promised them swift success and all the plunder they could carry he could not afford to be blocked for long vologases dispositions opened up his mind to corbulo as if he was reading a map the parthian needed a quick victory but was wary of the heavy casualties it might require so far there was nothing new and despite the losses corbulo was suffering he found that reassuring vologases horsearchers came in their thousands all along the roman line and with each wave a hail of arrows poured down on the wall of shields many of those shields must now be twice as heavy as when the day started because of the sheer weight of arrows embedded in them but some of the arrows found gaps men bled or died in their ranks or crawled away between their comrades feet to be replaced by those to the rear behind the archers waited the heavy cavalry so central to the parthian war machine magnificently armoured warriors the cream of the parthian nobility mounted on big horses bred to take their enormous weight they would not be used until vologases was certain of victory behind them and forming the great mass of the army were the infantry peasant conscripts dragged reluctantly from their homes and farms by their overlords poorly equipped and poorly led they were of use only once the enemy was broken and on the run against a determined legion they were little more than fodder for his mens swords but their sheer numbers made them a threat and corbulo knew he could not discount them from his plans furthest back out of corbulos sight would be the parthian baggage train from where the long lines of camels ambled forward to resupply the archers there far beyond his reach lay the vast supplies required to keep an army of this size in the field he looked to the sky another hour before darkness he doubted that vologases would send his cataphracts now darkness was romes ally it would give the soldiers of the tenth fretensis respite from the storm of arrows they had endured for most of the long afternoon but respite did not mean rest it was not the parthian way to attack at night but that might not always be so if he were vologases he might risk a massed attack of heavy cavalry riding shoulder to shoulder beneath a sky filled with fire arrows a guard must be set and a line maintained he studied his battered cohorts they had borne their torment well perhaps too well tomorrow timing would be everything vologases must be tempted by his enemys weakness he called the commander of the tenth fretensis to him the greyhaired legates face was lined with exhaustion but his salute was brisk are the screens ready traianus another hour i believe sir it would have to do i want them in place as soon as darkness falls once its done remove every second century behind the pit line at first light they are to lie down behind the auxiliaries where the parthians cant see their shields the fifteenth will also withdraw behind the pits and form a new defensive line there vologases must be enticed by our weakness but we cannot be so weak that he thinks he is being drawn into a trap then may i make a suggestion corbulo nodded of course place the remaining cavalry ala in the front line in two wings protecting the flanks vologases will believe you have been forced to use every man to hold it it was a sensible idea and corbulo pondered it for a few moments before deciding against either we lose too many horses when we withdraw through the pits or they take the diagonal paths and risk the enemy identifying them and using them as well no the shields will hold the line so tomorrow the legionaries would again suffer and die beneath the arrow showers until they were reduced enough to invite the twelvefoot spears of vologases cataphracts to annihilate them and unless gaius valerius verrens and his cavalry could do the impossible the army of corbulo would die with them xl under the dull light of an ochre moon valerius allowed himself to be pulled up the track holding tight to the tail of the horse in front while he led khamsin by her harness the path was so narrow and hemmed in by rocks that they had been forced into single file but the engineer assured him that when they reached the top of the steep slope the column would be able to disperse valerius prayed that was true because the last thing he needed was a fighting force scattered across ten miles of mountains for the hundredth time he told himself that this was no place for horses and that corbulos plan was madness he was grateful for the moon because no man liked darkness and a soldiers superstitions were multiplied by the night before the march his cavalrymen had hurriedly made their sacrifices to mars or mithras but the gods roman or syrian could only placate the dead not banish them and their ghosts undoubtedly inhabited these fearsome hills valerius had learned not to fear the dead in britain where he had once spent the night surrounded by three thousand gutted corpses from the ninth legion the memory was with him still but it was a memory of courage and sacrifice and a fight to the death with no thought of surrender he tried to focus on domitia but her face was distorted as if he was seeing it through shattered green glass and only her eyes were distinct eyes that did not carry the message he expected or hoped for a stumble forced him to concentrate on the path it followed the contours of the hills which loomed above like broadshouldered giants and the men allowed the horses to pick their own way on clothwrapped hooves through gullies and across precipitous slopes where the track had been gouged from the earth often valerius found himself walking in dense blackness with a sense of an immense void a few feet to his right but he had trusted in khamsin and she never let him down he walked behind the engineer near the head of the snaking endless line of men and horses and petronius told him how he came to know this inaccessible wilderness it was at the end of the second campaign while corbulo was negotiating the peace he had heard of the cepha gap and immediately recognized its strategic importance he is like that no detail is too unimportant to be ignored and asked me to survey it and the surrounding area i was here for two months dressed in armenian rags in the dead of winter i marked out the site for a fort if ever one were needed but i wanted to know if the fort could be outflanked to the east and if truth be told these mountains have a certain fascination men have lived here for thousands of years there are cave cities close to our route that i would like to have visited again but i fear we will have other priorities a ragged scream cut the darkness from somewhere behind followed by the muted thunder of crashing rocks horse or man or both petronius hesitated then shrugged his shoulders there was nothing anyone could do the gods only knew how many more had been lost among the forces behind for a few oppressive moments they waited for the sound of violent reaction that would signal the columns discovery but valerius knew he could depend on the scouts who ranged ahead seeking any sign of a parthian presence the two men carried on until they reached a broad basin almost a huge natural amphitheatre and valerius ordered the lead elements to halt and allow the tail of the column to catch up make the most of the next two or three miles petronius advised the worst comes when we leave the road and begin our descent towards the tigris road serpentius laughed even in asturia this wouldnt be called a road well the engineer said offended you will see just how good a road this is before dawn it was past midnight now they had been in the hills for four hours and petronius reckoned they had only covered half the distance they needed before dawn the route had taken them in a great flanking arc from the cepha gap first to the east and then south on a perilous littleused smugglers track there is a driedup watercourse to the west below the road the engineer explained i will know it when i see it but that is difficult enough in daylight it leads to a broad gully that will bring us to the river downstream of the tigris crossing point if we can gather there undetected and form up on the open plain north of the river we have a chance he didnt have to say it was only a slim chance and that at the first shout of warning valerius and his ten thousand would be facing the bulk of the king of kings seventythousandstrong army but that was for the future what mattered now was that they reach the gully before dawn despite their slow progress petronius insisted it could be done and done in time but that was before the patrol returned and reported the lights the scout was a wiry darkskinned numidian and he made his report in the slangridden dog latin that was the common tongue of auxiliary units across the empire we saw fires in the ground lord he must mean the caves petronius interrupted we obeyed your order not to attack only look they were hid in the ground so i had to go closer to count their numbers lord how many were they valerius asked the man raised his open hands twice in answer then showed four fingers and where he gave a long complicated explanation and petronius groaned aloud i know this place a mile ahead caves set into the base of a cliff wall in the next valley his face gave valerius his answer before he asked the question can we bypass them petronius shook his head we need to go through the valley to reach the riverbed we could never slip past unnoticed with this many men valerius could feel the weight of the cavalry units backing up behind there could only be one decision he called for hanno a hundred of your best this man will guide you make it quick but be sure none escapes ill go serpentius volunteered valerius opened his mouth to refuse but serpentius was like a ghost in the dark and as good a man with a knife as hed ever known the spaniard had also acquired a pair of sarmatian throwing axes with which he was now as proficient as their previous owner valerius nodded and serpentius grinned in the darkness and started removing his armour and anything else that might make a noise that would alert the enemy hanno clapped him on the shoulder caladus will lead but he will be happy to have you with him he called his men together and gave them their instructions caladus and serpentius stared down the valley at the almost imperceptible orange glow the numidian had pointed out at the base of the cliff it was so faint that only someone passing close by or one with eyes that could see like the desert falcon of his berber homelands would have noticed it they have been here all night and seen nothing caladus guessed perhaps they have been here several nights their commander has allowed them a fire in an inner room where he believes it is well enough hidden careless serpentius said so careless it will cost him his life caladus agreed but not so careless that they have not set guards the numidian whispered do you see them the thracian and the spaniard peered into the darkness but they could see nothing but shadows and rocks to the left of the entrance a tall man who stinks like a houri and then across the valley where he thinks he is hidden a second fat as a pig though he moves lightly and the third hardly more than a boy but more alert than the others stands by the horses in a hollow beyond the next bend the others are all in the caves sleeping or talking caladus pondered his options the boy with the horses is the greatest danger one shout and he will be gone serpentius do you think you can get past the guards to the horses without being seen keep to the centre of the valley the numidian advised there is the shadow of an ancient stream bed stay low and silent as the hunting leopard and you will do it easily i will take the guard on the far side serpentius nodded ill give you to the count of two hundred a single arrow will deal with the third sentry then well surround the caves and kill the rest almost before caladus had finished speaking serpentius was gone disappearing into the darkness with the numidian at his heels the spaniard slithered down the valley on his belly like the snake he was named for ignoring the dry stalks and sharp stones that stabbed his flesh and tore his tunic he kept his face low to the ground and trusted to the numidians instinct that the slight fold in the sweetsmelling earth would cover his movements from the watchers on either side of the valley despite the dangers his breathing was slow and easy this was nothing new for serpentius it reminded him of the night raids of his youth against neighbouring villages but that was before the romans came with their lust for gold their lists and their order before they took him for a slave and turned him into an animal in a cage to be exhibited before the scum and the degenerates in the arena for a moment his mind was consumed with a familiar hatred and it was not hatred for the parthian warrior he stalked this was not his fight and the romans were not his people but he had pledged his life to valerius and valerius was the closest thing to a friend he had so he would kill he would kill with regret but the parthian was already in his grave he made swift progress along the shallow depression and he neither saw nor heard the guards as he passed the pale light among the rocks a minute later he smelled the horses a mile away to the north valerius willed himself to stay calm every minute was precious every minute they wasted here was another minute when the men of corbulos army must suffer the agony of the parthian arrows it would take time to get the column in motion again time to negotiate the gully that would bring them to the river and time to form up his men for the attack too much time all around him men and horses waited impatiently for the order to move a gentle whisper reached serpentius as he lay face down in the rough grass ten paces from the tethered parthian mounts the count of two hundred had long come and gone but he could not afford to hurry he would have the chance for one strike and one only the knife or the axe the knife quicker cleaner and surer the unwary parthian sentry was talking quietly to his horses as they snickered nervously in their halters they were upwind if the gentle movement of the air could be called a wind of the roman column but some instinct had alerted them to the presence of others of their kind their nervousness should have alerted the guard but serpentius guessed there would have been many such false alarms in hills roamed by the lion the leopard and the wolf if anything it increased his chances of success even if the animals became aware of him the sentry was unlikely to react swiftly enough drawing his long knife he crawled through the grass until he was on the edge of the group of horses small lightlimbed beasts favoured by the parthian archers he raised his hand so the closest would catch his scent and the animal snickered gently wary but not frightened of this new human presence shielded by the herd serpentius rose smoothly to his feet and reassessed his situation the parthian had stopped whispering and it was impossible to see because the cliff above shielded the moon but serpentius searched the darkness until he found what he was looking for not a man shape just something that might have been a rock but wasnt when the rock moved he was certain no man could approach an armed warrior in the dark without feeling fear but serpentius had long since learned how to channel his fear and turn it into ice cold iron hard resolution another man would have rushed the sentry depending on the element of surprise but all it would take was the glint of the knife or the sound of footsteps to turn surprise into disaster instead serpentius dropped to his stomach again and slid through the jungle of moving legs and fresh horseshit until he was within touching distance of his target still shielded by the shifting horses he waited for his moment the sentry was little more than a boy unblooded and on his first campaign and he was angry that he had to spend another night with the horses part of his mind was on the older men who had laughed at him when he had warned against lighting the fire the other chewed on the battle he was missing and the brothers who were gaining all the glory the last thing he saw was a slim shadow that stepped from among the horses the last thing he felt was the sting of the knife that sliced across his throat severing tendon and windpipe to leave him drowning in his own blood but he managed to cry out and that one cry was enough the second guard had been sitting to his left and now he launched himself not at serpentius but at the nearest horse loosing the knot that held it as he went he was in the saddle and moving before serpentius could stop him the spaniard reached for the axe at his belt valerius waited impatiently as caladus led the patrol back he had to be certain before he made his next move one by one the thracians came to him and laid a round object at his feet he counted the bearded snarling heads until he reached twentythree your numidian said twentyfour caladus shrugged the spaniard never came back we dont have time for this he was interrupted as a silent figure stepped from the dark serpentius dropped the two heads he carried with the others twentyfive he turned to caladus i would have word with the numidian the thracian laughed you could count yourself fortunate indeed for then you would be in elysium he was always too cocky for his own good you can never underestimate a parthian three men dead an hour lost but the way was clear the sun was well up when they reached the river and valerius despaired of discovery by some wandering patrol or foraging party corbulo had said time was his enemys enemy but now it was valeriuss he had promised the general he would be in position at dawn on the second day instead his ten thousand cavalry were still straggling across two miles of path and he didnt dare move out on to the narrow strip of floodplain that separated the mountains from the river until he was ready petronius explained their position yonder you see the river he pointed to a deep gorge half a mile distant it is only crossable at one place in this area and that is at cepha a mile upstream from cepha it is another four miles to the gap vologases will undoubtedly have left a guard on the crossing place but beyond it all that will be between you and his army is the baggage train the plain below us is hidden from the bridge by rising ground but it is possible we will be seen forming up from the far bank so there is no time to lose pass the word to put on the tunics every man had carried a rolledup bundle behind his saddle as well as his weapons and rations now they unwrapped them to reveal the armenian tunics corbulo had ordered his quartermaster to requisition on the long march from zeugma short and woven of light cloth they had intricately embroidered facings of gold and blue and red similar to those of the parthians the tunics were loose enough to be worn over mail and valerius gambled that any observer who saw them from a distance would be lulled into thinking it was one of his own formations it may seem unnecessary even foolish corbulo had told him you may not convince them but even if you confuse them for only a second that could be the second that makes the difference between victory and defeat a courier forced his way past the riders behind valerius and announced that the rearguard was ready with his heart pounding valerius gave the order to advance out on to the plain after the long hours in the mountains it felt very open and vulnerable there was no turning back now in truth for all his doubts and fears on the long night march there had never been any turning back corbulo had chosen his man well they had outflanked the parthians yet the mountain crossing had merely been the first hurdle now he must attack vologases army of seventy thousand men with barely a tenth that number his cavalry troopers were exhausted and hungry there was no hope of support if the attack faltered and no place to retreat if the parthians prevailed if he failed every man here would die along with the thousands of romans fighting for their lives a bare five miles away they were late to the fight but they were here the only thing in their favour was surprise but as the cavalry wings began to form up behind him with hanno and his third thracians in the centre valerius felt the first rising of that glorious sense of invulnerability that preceded battle and he sent a silent prayer to fortuna the goddess of good fortune at the walk advance xli tiberius knew this was his day to die in the first light of dawn he had snatched a mouthful of bread from his pouch and a hurried drink from one of the carriers who traversed the depleted roman line with a dozen skins of brackish water hanging from his shoulder it was clear he would not complete his mission now but that did not matter he had done his duty even his father would be proud the initial parthian sorties had come not long after daylight and the hail of arrows rattling against the curved roman shields had resumed that had been two hours ago and already the man on his right had changed twice first the fool who replaced the legionary with the wounded foot inched his shield to the side to take a look at the enemy and received a shaft through the brain for his trouble an hour later an arrow had found a weak spot in a scutum and burst through as if it was made of parchment to pierce the shields owner through the heart yet now there was an unlikely respite when the arrows stopped for a few moments he wondered if the roman gods he had been invoking all morning had prevailed over the parthian deities but not for long because the thunder of the parthian drums heralded a new terror the king of kings had summoned his invincibles from his position to the right of the roman defences gnaeus domitius corbulo proconsul of syria and cappadocia commander of the armies of the east and three times holder of the triumphal regalia watched the valley fill with a long line of gleaming metal and glittering spear points and fought the unfamiliar gutwrenching ache of despair he stared out beyond the gaily coloured pavilions at the centre of that vast army to the horizon beyond but the sky was empty and the signs he was looking for existed only in his mind valerius had failed him he understood he was being too harsh that he had expected too much his great plan had depended on a combination of exact timing and good fortune that no sane man could have expected he had taken the cooperation of the gods for granted and now they would have their revenge for his hubris and down there in the shattered cohorts of the roman front line were the brave men who would pay the price for a moment his heart told him to take his staff and share their fate but he was general gnaeus domitius corbulo and gnaeus domitius corbulo did not shirk his duty even if his duty meant watching his men die and feeling every spear arrow and sword as if it was entering his own body a quarter of a mile separated the mismatched armies but he saw movement as the long strip of armour shimmered and snaked like a viper shedding its skin and he knew they were straightening the line for the advance the drums went quiet and an awful silence settled over the field the parthian host lumbered into motion prepare for the signal the young cornicen at corbulos side licked his lips and put his mouth to the curved bronze trumpet for the first hundred paces the parthian cataphracts advanced at the walk only a thousand men out of an army of seventy thousand would make the attack because less than one in a hundred could afford the prohibitively expensive armour of bronze and iron that could take a craftsman a year to make a nobleman like sasan might arm and horse ten retainers and arm them well but many were protected by helms and mail handed down through generations which showed the marks of repair and long service precious few could fully armour their horses and that made the horses vulnerable those without trappers made up the rear ranks of the five divisions bearing down on the hated roman enemy the van of the charge consisted of the most heavily armoured and therefore the richest and most powerful of vologases retainers by the time they reached halfway they had broken into a trot and corbulo knew from experience that they would go no faster their sheer weight and the length of the twelvefoot lances they carried meant they did not need to he tensed ready to give the order courage was something tiberius claudius crescens took for granted fear was bewildering fear meant a mouth dry as any desert legs you knew could not run fast enough and the feeling that ants were crawling all over you as he stood behind his arrowscarred shield in the front line tiberius watched the great horses come and felt the ground shaking beneath his feet one part of him wanted to applaud the magnificence of that armoured host in their polished mail and their gleaming plate armour the horsehair plumes streaming out behind their helmets the other watched the spears drop so that every leafshaped iron point as long as a legionarys gladius was directed at a roman shield and knew that his body was about to be ground to dust beneath the giant hooves now corbulo said quietly sound the withdrawal the harsh call of the trumpet rang out across the valley withdraw tiberiuss shout was echoed in every cohort across the roman line the rear ranks were already on the move cutting diagonals through the escape corridors the roman engineer had marked the front rank jogged directly towards the rear shielding the route of their comrades from curious eyes watching the ground below their feet and praying that the parthians were far enough away to allow them to make their escape a shriek from tiberiuss left was testament that one legionary had been too slow or a parthian too fast the young tribune turned just in time to see the swordlike point of the long spear punch through iron flesh and bone as if they were silk spitting the screaming man like a roasting duck and carrying him off the ground another stride and the parthian chargers front leg snapped like a rotten branch and her shoulder dropped to throw her helpless rider in the air the heavily armoured nobleman sailed a dozen paces and landed helmet first in the earth with a metallic crash while the horse somersaulted in a cloud of dust to lie screaming with a broken back and its ruined leg flapping at last tiberius was through to safety and into the first ranks of the new defence line his senses reeling he turned to witness a scene of utter carnage the parthian warlords were so fixed on their targets and so certain of their invincibility that they entirely failed to see the cunningly disguised traps each pit had been covered with a woven lid of dried grass that exactly matched its surroundings between them were scattered hundreds of the hellish fourpronged caltrops which would force four inches of iron into the tender flesh of a charging horses hoof the front ranks of the parthian charge disintegrated into a chaos of tumbling horses and riders all along the roman line the flower of the parthian horse herds the sires and dams of generations of champions to come went down in a welter of shattered bone and sudden death the bodies of smashed horses and men created a barrier for those behind and the second line of cataphracts had the choice of leaping over their dead and dying predecessors or crashing into the fallen in front of them those who chose to leap found more pits and spikes and the screams of the horses seemed neverending only a few survived to take the fight to the romans and they were quickly engulfed by legionaries and auxiliaries who swarmed over the armoured horses like ants to bring them down tiberius watched as a parthian nobleman his bearded face a snarl of hatred speared one legionary while a second hacked the legs of his horse from under him with a sword once he was down his heavy armour pinned him like an upturned tortoise the metal saved him from the frenzy of hacking blades that smashed into his torso but not from the dagger that first took out his eyes before slitting his throat as he screamed defiance in a tongue his killers could not understand the democracy of the dead had no respect for rank mighty sasan spear carrier to the king of kings was among the fallen a yard from the roman line he had been tossed from his mounts back like a sack of grain and the impact of his landing had broken half the bones in his body and smashed his internal organs to so much pulp now he lay paralysed and helpless cursing the ambitions of kings with the taste of blood in his mouth and praying for the killing stroke he knew could not be long in coming prisoners tiberius belatedly remembered the order that had been given what seemed a lifetime ago we need prisoners two hundred of the parthian elite were down but hundreds more riders milled uncertainly in the dust storm beyond the barrier of dead and injured horses and men a growl went up from the legionary line and they surged forward with sword shield and spear the memories of their hours of trial by arrow still fresh hold your station a senior centurion of tiberiuss cohort lashed out with the vine stick of his office you dont kill until i fucking say so spears now spears any who are down are already as good as dead its those bastards still in the saddle we want aim for the horses each legionary of the tenth and the fifteenth had been supplied with four of the heavily weighted pila javelins and in the gaps between the cohorts now appeared hundreds of auxiliary slingers and archers they advanced until they were among the pits and the caltrops and the screaming horses and dying men and forty paces from the survivors of the parthian attack ready the cry went up all along the line and five thousand arms drew back the cornicines trumpets blared throw to penetrate plate or mail a pilum must strike at the perfect angle but the five thousand javelins which flew through the air with a prolonged sigh were not aimed at the armoured cataphracts of the parthian third rank but at their mounts the pilum consisted of a length of ash tipped by a shaft of iron the length of a mans arm and a weighted pyramidal point designed to pierce shield and armour now those shafts tore through the flesh and muscle and bone of the parthian warhorses and thickened the bloody barricade of dead and dying which separated the two forces animal screams of agony and terror rent the air while the victims of the first throw were still falling a second volley of javelins descended killing and maiming still more it was enough a parthian drummer sounded a frantic unfamiliar beat and the survivors of the javelin storm turned their horses and fled leaving their dismounted companions to stagger after them as best they could in their heavy armour a cheer rippled along the roman line and but for the commands of their centurions the legionaries would have bounded forward in their thirst for more blood instead they were hustled back into their defensive cohorts and the dying began again because the parthian bowmen were back xlii valerius rode in the centre of the front rank with the reassuring presence of serpentius at his shoulder at first the land sloped steeply from the mountains to the river making it awkward for the cavalry wings to keep formation on the dry stony ground but gradually it flattened out and the going became easier for man and beast they were in loose formation as befitted their thin disguise as enemy cavalry and kept tight to the hill side of the plain valerius gambled that the parthian baggage train and the camp followers of vologases army would stay close to the river and a guaranteed supply of water the baggage train of a roman army was a disciplined tightly structured unit run by experienced quartermasters and designed to ensure the ready provision of food or weapons where they were needed at any given time corbulo had explained that what he would find in the parthian rear would be very different the king of kings has his personal baggage train perhaps a thousand wagons and several hundred pack camels from which he will feed and supply himself and the royal forces and which will lead the march after the fighting troops it also carries vologases concubines and his war chest so it will be protected by the elite of his palace guard each warlord or petty king will also have his own train and they will haggle for priority making their own time there will be few guards on the rearmost trains because the parthians believe they have nothing to fear scattered groups of camp followers were the first sign they were reaching the rear of the main force and these had grown thicker by the time they came level with the cepha bridge which was a seething mass of frustrated humanity and nose to tail ox carts upstream of the bridge on the heights overlooking the tigris an entire city of wagons and tents sprawled into the distance beneath a haze of smoke from hundreds of dung fires the sun was high now and although they drew complacent glances from the parthians on the fringe of the temporary settlement no one challenged them it was clear that corbulos ruse was working a cavalry formation in the rear of the parthian lines wearing recognizably parthian clothing must be a friendly force that was about to change valerius called forward the commanders of the cavalry wings of the left flank hanno with his thousandstrong third thracians was the most senior and valerius had given him command of the attack on the parthian supply lines with the support of two further regiments of five hundred spearmen you have your orders when you hear my signal burn the wagons and the supplies and scatter the horse herds leave them nothing if you meet opposition in one camp move on to the next then the next remember your job is not to kill but to destroy what about the bridge do we burn that too hanno asked valerius shook his head it was a tempting target but corbulos orders had been clear youve seen the size of this army we can hurt vologases and we can make his men go hungry but we cant destroy him if this turns into a battle of attrition there can be only one winner we have to leave him an escape route while the three cavalry units moved into position valerius led the remaining horsemen up the valley he knew their luck couldnt hold much longer the shelf between the river and the hills was beginning to narrow now and it was only a matter of time before they were challenged to his left a circle of brightly coloured cloth pavilions dominated the most substantial of the parthian camps and he guessed it must be home to members of vologases closest retinue even as he watched a group of redplumed riders broke from the camp wait until they hail us before you kill them serpentius nodded and passed on the whispered order valerius ignored the approaching riders and concentrated on what lay ahead a rumble which seemed to vibrate the air was now recognizable as the pounding of the parthian signal drums yet it was almost drowned by an even more pervasive sound a sound which made the hair stand up on the back of valeriuss neck it was as if someone had disturbed a giant beehive with a stick the low drone of a million beating wings but he knew what he was hearing was no sound heard in nature it was the sound of a multitude certainly but a multitude of men the last time he had heard that sound was when boudiccas mighty horde had breasted the ridge before colonia filling the slope like an incoming tide signaller sir the man readied the lituus the ornate trumpet used by the cavalry for relaying commands the sharp cry of a warning shout was answered by the thrum of bowstrings and followed by the screams of at least two men and the thud of falling bodies cries of consternation rang out from the camp to his left sound the charge the two distinct notes from the brass horn were echoed among the advancing squadrons and from behind where valerius knew hanno would be launching his attack on the lightly defended baggage camps beneath him khamsin responded to the call without the urging of his heels surging into the trot and snorting through her nostrils he could feel her excitement and that of the men around him as he reached for the long cavalry spatha and felt its familiar weight in his left hand his ears echoed with the thunder of hooves across the packed earth to his right serpentius snarled a litany of what sounded like curses but valerius knew would be prayers to the spaniards native gods a dozen more strides and the air was thick with the stench of human excrement as they passed over ground where vologases tens of thousands of infantry had camped the previous night in the far distance still a mile away a dark stain covered the gold of the fields of dried grass in the southern neck of the cepha gap his heart almost failed him at the sight of that huge mass of men it had always been a gamble but now that gamble was exposed as suicidal the first rule of war was that a commander should not attack unless he was aware of his enemys dispositions valerius could only be guided by gnaeus domitius corbulos advice and his own intuition that advice and intuition said that vologases would mass his cavalry against the roman line and continue to use it in successive waves until corbulos army was destroyed or so weakened as to be helpless before a final parthian charge if the king of kings held even a few hundred of his armoured cataphracts in reserve they were capable of blunting valeriuss charge and destroying its momentum he chanced a look over his shoulder and was rewarded with a sky filled with towering clouds of smoke the funeral pyre for king vologases baggage train hanno had done his job well if nothing else the roman soldiers holding back this huge army would see it and know hope half a mile now to the mouth of the valley the first auxiliary cavalry were already sweeping through the gaping stunned stragglers hurrying to join the parthian army swords slashed down and blood stained the golden grassland hold the line valerius roared the order and the signaller echoed it with his trumpet a parthian war drum answered the call with a frantic beat and valerius saw movement in the ranks ahead as what commanders there were frantically attempted to form a defensive line but these were conscripts who had been waiting for two days while their cavalry fought to breach the roman defences they were farmers and peasants townsmen and shopkeepers who had no option but to march behind their lord and no inclination for battle if they expected to fight it was against a defeated enemy fleeing from the cataphracts spears yet even that expectation had been blunted by the endless hours of waiting they were listless and bored lying in groups wondering how long it was until the next meal now their leaders screamed confused orders and the sky to the east was black with the smoke of their burning rations and thousands of strange cavalrymen were bearing down on them at a terrifying rate a few managed to form the semblance of a defence but they were small groups of widely spaced spearmen most froze in confusion and terror a cantering horse takes less than a minute to cover half a mile by the time the parthians had worked out whether they were facing friend or foe that distance had halved then halved again eight of valeriuss auxiliary wings were made up of mounted archers and he had placed them in the front ranks they loosed their first arrows at a hundred and fifty paces darkening the sky with feathered shafts that arched gracefully before plummeting into the massed ranks of the parthians before the first had landed a second volley was on its way instantly followed by a third twelve thousand arrows rained down on the parthian spearmen in the space of twenty seconds none of the defenders wore armour few had helmets and the wickedly barbed points pierced skull shoulder and back as men crouched to avoid the rain of deadly missiles instinctively they sought shelter pushing back into the unharmed mass behind them but there was no shelter the archers turned away using the same tactics which had tormented the romans for the past two days but they were immediately replaced by numidian spearmen who added their light javelins to the horror hurling them one after the other into the cringing mass of parthians by now the killed and wounded lay ten and fifteen deep along the length of the parthian line carpeting the valley in a twitching mantle of death still it was not enough for the bowmen returned giving the enemy no respite and firing again and again until their supply of arrows was spent then turning away once more valerius steeled himself against pity the killing must go on for when the parthians stopped dying the agony of the romans would begin he waved the light cavalry forward once more their javelins were spent but they were far from harmless it was time for the swords there was little cohesion to the roman line but there did not need to be fear was as great a weapon as any blade the parthian foot soldiers on the fringes of the great mass that made up vologases rearguard were already demoralized by the carnage caused by the roman spears and arrows now their only thought was to escape these phantoms who had appeared where no enemy had a right to appear many had already thrown away their spears in blind panic and as valeriuss mounted cohorts urged their horses over the corpses of those already fallen they scrabbled to bury themselves deeper in the illusory safety of the crowd but there was no escape from the swords this was not war it was slaughter the spathae rose and fell with the relentless rhythm of a farmers scythe and with similar effect valerius cut left and right carving through terrified shrieking faces and balding skulls chopping torsos from shoulder to rib and removing hands and arms raised in desperate attempts to protect their owners and all along the roman line men did the same though he didnt realize it he snarled and grunted and cursed with every blow he struck he tried not to see the grey porridge of an opened skull the splintered bone of shattered arms or the pink mess of a swordslashed lung but he knew the images would remain with him for ever within minutes his left arm was slick with other mens blood it coated his armour and he could feel it on his face and taste it on his lips the sheer scale of vologases army allied to the narrowness of the valley protected valeriuss men from counterattack because the parthian war bands which had retained their cohesion and fighting spirit had to battle their way through the men trying to flee the butchery even so amongst the dead the dying and the defeated there were still men prepared to fight to your left serpentiuss snarled warning gave valerius the heartbeat he needed to duck away from the spear point that would have taken out his throat he slashed frantically at the shaft and kicked khamsin through the cowering bodies towards his attacker a bearded parthian with dark eyes and a mouth that snarled hatred inside the point he knew he had little to fear from the spearman but this easterner was no shopkeeper the long ash shaft came round in a hammer blow to the cheekplate of valeriuss helmet almost knocking him from the saddle as he clung to khamsins side the men he had been killing saw their opportunity and with a collective howl rose up to haul him from her back hands tearing at him and gouging at his face pinned by four or five bodies he felt a sting in his ribs as a dagger point managed to pierce his mail and the leather tunic beneath it was only a matter of time before its owner sought out his throat or his eyes roaring with fury and with the violence of despair he lashed out at the men holding him but they were too many a man pinned his sword hand and the bearded spearman sat on his chest and spat in his face before drawing the knife that would kill him a glint of metal flashed in front of valeriuss face swift as any lightning strike and the spearmans head spun from his shoulders leaving his still upright body fountaining blood from the neck another man shrieked as a blade split him from throat to crotch spilling intestines in long coils from his torn body valerius hauled the dead weight of the headless man from his chest as his attackers scattered from the ferocious assault of a whipthin madman with a face that was a gory mask of horror here serpentius reached down and with another troopers help hauled valerius to his feet miraculously khamsin still stood over him and he pulled himself back into the saddle he had lost corbulos spatha but when he reached over his shoulder the familiar grip of the gladius moulded itself into his hand and he was armed again his ears rang from the blow to his head and he could feel blood running down his ribs from where the dagger had struck but he had no time to rest he forced himself to concentrate on the cacophony of sounds around him and tried to sense the battle from somewhere he found a moment of calm though the breath rasped in his throat and his heart hammered as if it was trying to break free from his ribs oddly it was the soft hiss of disturbed air that registered first confirming that the mounted archers had returned with their quivers replenished from captured parthian supply camels that told him hanno was in control of his operation and for the moment he could disregard his rear the slaughter of the spearmen continued there was no letup in the butchersblock smack of edged metal cutting into flesh and bone but he knew the situation could not continue indefinitely more and more parthians were fighting back and roman blood now mingled with that of the enemy eventually the arms of his auxiliary cavalrymen would tire the arrows would run out and the attack would lose its momentum when the killing stopped the parthians would be able to draw breath and when they did they would see how relatively few the roman horsemen were panicked or not someone would organize a counterattack and that counterattack could only have one outcome but valerius had made his pledge to corbulo and that pledge was to fight to his last breath and that of every man with him the question was what was happening on the far side of that great army where the roman line had endured all this long day it endured still valerius was certain of that or the parthian foot would have been able to withdraw and reorganize vologases was still trapped between two forces even if those forces were vastly inferior to his own but this was not caesar being trapped did not bring automatic victory somehow the kings confidence must be destroyed and his vast army demoralized that could only be achieved by one man valerius raised his sword and urged khamsin back into the carnage praying not to any god but to gnaeus domitius corbulo xliii corbulos face betrayed no emotion as another shower of arrows fell on his bloodied cohorts but inwardly he shuddered with revulsion the parthians had become braver and more confident advancing to the very edge of the line of dead horses and dead men which were the only things now keeping the enemy at bay unlike the romans below the mountain troops on the crags were winning their battle and the signallers kept up a constant stream of information on parthian movements which were otherwise invisible to their general it seemed to corbulo that vologases growing frustration was written clearly in the steady buildup of troops just behind the front ranks of cavalry vast numbers now waited for the final order to advance less than two hundred paces from the fragile line of legionaries corbulo could imagine or believed he could imagine the scene in the imperial pavilion vologases still had his tens of thousands of mounted archers and eventually those archers could win him victory but archers were ten to the as it was the cataphracts which were the symbol of parthian power the armoured might of the nation the warrior elite who kept the king of kings upon his gilded throne now he had lost three hundred and fifty of those petty kings warlords and clan chieftains and their most trusted retainers in a single afternoon drawn in by a trick any basilica conjuror would have seen through not only had he lost his armoured spearhead he had lost his key military and political advisers and the confidence of those who remained the hierarchy which kept him in power had been fatally disturbed there would be no talk of quick bloodless victories now yet he still had a mighty army and given the right leadership that mighty army could smash its way through the thin roman line already corbulo could see infantry among the leading horsemen and he knew what would happen next the archers would keep the embattled legionaries at bay while the foot soldiers manhandled the dead men and horses which barred the parthian advance clear and filled in the pits what would stop them then tiberius watched the general as he deliberated marvelling at the calm of the man the parthians had launched a second armoured attack midway through the morning but it had been a halfhearted affair with few of the horses even attempting to charge the roman cohorts directly the arrow storm had been the worst torment and he knew he had been fortunate to survive after so long in the front rank now he was at corbulos side the most junior of aides courtesy of an arrow fired with particular venom which had soared over the lines to impale his predecessor through the right eye the sweetly sick scent of death was thick in his nostrils and nothing he had witnessed since daybreak had changed his opinion that his own decaying flesh would soon be adding to the stink of corruption until now he had to look twice before he realized what he was seeing general every eye turned to the far horizon smoke a great dark swirling pall hanging in the still air behind and to the east of vologases army corbulos stern features were split by a grim smile and he sent up a prayer of thanks asking the gods to aid the endeavours of gaius valerius verrens he had stopped vologases in his tracks he had bloodied him and now he had confused him but that was nothing to the horror corbulo was about to unleash on the hemmedin parthian army gentlemen take your positions a ragged cheer went up from the roman line tiberius could hear the shouts of the centurions demanding silence and he imagined the gnarled vine sticks cracking on backs but the cheer had unsettled the parthians and it was as if a collective shudder ran through that packed mass of humanity corbulo saw it too now now was the time loose the screens and deploy the artillery on both sides of the valley invisible to the parthians because of their cunning construction woven screens made from the long golden stems of dried grass that carpeted the valley had hidden corbulos secret weapon the siege artillery carried at such great cost in time and manpower from zeugma behind the screens roman engineers had constructed two pairs of great catapults that now dominated the valley others had assembled the legions light artillery of stonethrowing ballistae and their cousins the smaller but horribly effective scorpios which fired giant arrows with the enormous power that gave them their wellearned nickname shieldsplitters each of the seventeen cohorts was equipped with a single ballista and ten scorpios and now the cohorts moved into open formation to allow the deadly machines to be positioned across the valley almost two hundred artillery pieces over a width of less than a mile one every six or seven paces but it was the big siege catapults that corbulo trusted would shatter the already cracking parthian resolve designed to smash wood and stone and cow the inhabitants of great cities the massive constructions of wood and iron could throw a stone weighing as much as a small ox for up to half a mile it had taken patience and fortitude not to use them to watch his soldiers die without fighting back but now the destructive power that could destroy a city wall would be turned against flesh and bone the eighteenfoot throwing arm had been hauled back on its thick rope of twisted oxhide in preparation for the first throw the projectile a roughly carved rock the size and shape of a large cauldron was in its sling loose tiberius heard the order and his eye turned automatically to witness the launch released from the incredible tension that held it in place the oak throwing arm lashed forward with a force that kicked through the wooden frame of the huge siege engine and would have thrown it into the air if the engineers hadnt pegged it to the ground with a gigantic whuuuup of released energy the arm collided with the padded buffer of hayfilled cloth sacks and sent its enormous projectile towards the parthians unlike many of his peers tiberius had taken time to study the intricacies of his profession and he knew that the catapult was notoriously inaccurate but with a target almost a mile wide and three miles deep accuracy didnt matter a tremendous whooshing surge accompanied the low arcing flight of the stone and for a moment the whole battlefield seemed to fall silent tiberius followed the dark blur until it was absorbed into the mass of humanity below the ground seemed to explode and men exploded with it he imagined he could see the pink haze as vologases soldiers were pulverized when the giant missile ploughed through them robbing men of limbs and heads and swatting the big parthian horses aside as if they were house flies the power and the speed of the rock was so tremendous that men outwith the epicentre of the landing would be pierced by flying shards of bone and bludgeoned with lumps of still warm flesh and that was just the first impact six times the stone skipped through the massed ranks and each time it struck it caused carnage and consternation until at last it rolled to a halt in front of a pale and trembling parthian princeling who looked down at the fleshsmeared lump of rock and fainted dead away the first missile was followed in quick succession by a second a third and a fourth and each missile killed fifty men and maimed a hundred more but each of corbulos giant death bringers took at least thirty minutes to reload and in the interval the parthian warlords urged their men forward in a desperate bid to break the roman line before the next cast there was no thought of strategy now only of survival and revenge vologases had lost control of his army however before they could reach corbulos defences the parthians had to get past the hundreds of dead horses and men from the earlier attacks in the aftermath of the first parthian charge the legionaries had used the lull to drag the big armoured horses together to create an almost unbroken barrier of dead flesh the respite had also given the romans time to collect the remaining caltrops and scatter them beyond the new line and to recover the spent pila from the flesh of the dead and the battleground to their immediate front vologases infantry had they been brave well led and disciplined could have crossed the barricade of dead horses and men but no horse would and so for the moment it was the war bands of parthian bowmen who were left to charge and countercharge peppering the roman line but the hail of arrows had begun to thin as supplies from the camel trains dried up and more and more parthians looked fearfully to the rear where the smoke from their precious supplies wreathed the sky and as they wavered the ballistae and the shieldsplitters opened fire twenty at a time in steady evenly spaced volleys a hail of tenpound stones and fivefoot arrows raked the parthian front line the ballistae could fire a missile a quarter of a mile but here they were being used at forty paces and the destruction they caused was terrible to behold archers were smashed from the saddle with their chests and skulls stove in horses shrieked in mortal agony as the heavy arrows of the scorpio s tore great gaping holes in ribs and chest the devastating power was such that if the bolt missed the cavalry it would streak through to take the infantry behind spearing not just one man but two three and even four lack of arrows and the carnage they were suffering at the hands of corbulos artillery persuaded the mounted bowmen to retire through the infantry at last romes greatest general saw the opportunity he had been waiting for signal the advance corbulo ordered as the trumpet blared he turned to tiberius you may join your cohort young man it is swords which will bring victory now not strategy tonight we will drink a toast to victory lead them on for rome tiberius saluted with tears of joy in his eyes he had never felt so proud to be a roman he had fought and he had endured and now he had no doubt at all that he would win he sprinted the hundred yards to where his unit was forming line along with the men of the fifteenth and the auxiliary cohorts who had made up the reserve advance they had begun the battle twelve thousand strong now they were closer to ten but they started off down the valley at the relentless measured tread that had made the legions feared from the windswept moors of northern britain to the sunscorched deserts of arabia and from africa to the danuvius still in their ranks they clambered across the stinking barricade of horse flesh that had kept the enemy at bay since morning and reformed on the parthian side tiberius dressed his mens ranks and the long line of big shields straightened all along the line other officers did the same behind the shields the sweatstained dustcaked faces were fixed and unyielding they had suffered and endured and watched their friends die they were still outnumbered seven or eight to one but now they were doing what they were trained to do not standing around as helpless targets attacking their enemy for hour upon hour they had stood and died without complaint and now it was all they could do to stay in their ranks they had made their sacrifice now they demanded the blood price forward at the trot instantly they moved into that steadypaced jog that they practised day in and day out tiberius drew his sword but his mens remained in their scabbards each of them carried a single pilum in his right hand a rush through the air above them heralded a new volley of boulders and arrows that tore gaps in the parthian line ahead at the same time a great crash shook the earth and a terrible screaming to the front left announced the arrival of the latest missile from the catapults a hundred paces away the parthian infantry waited in a great bustling crowd uncertain which was the greatest danger they faced some looked fearfully to the skies wondering when the next terrible bombardment would arrive their stomachs tightened at the thought of the missiles which were now relentlessly flailing their line gutting dismembering and smashing yet the most ominous sight was the implacable line of brightly painted shields that now rushed towards them an hour earlier they had sat comfortably at the centre of a great army listening to the clash of arms awaiting victory and grumbling about being so far from home now they were in the front line and death was on every side fifty paces ready a legionary learned to throw the pilum at the run almost as soon as he learned to march a running man could throw further than a stationary one the staggered ranks of cohorts and centuries stretched the width of the valley and each centurion would choose his moment to order the cast when the enemy was close enough for the javelins to cause maximum casualties and far enough away to allow his men time to draw their swords before the two lines met forty tiberius glanced nervously to his left searching for the threat of a flanking movement by the now underemployed parthian archers even if they had no arrows they still had their swords and a legion was never more threatened than when it was attacked from the flank while forming up for an assault but there would be no flank attack because the front line of parthian infantry jammed the valley from cliff to cliff and blocked off any opportunity for the cavalry to advance thirty throw a hail of javelins slanted out from the roman line and fresh screams rang out across the battlefield as the lethal iron spikes found throat and face and chest the order was followed by the musical hiss of a thousand swords being drawn and the sequence was repeated again and again by the ranks behind tiberius watched the pila arc through the warm air and plunge into the massed ranks ahead of him he heard himself growling like a dog and his ears told him the sound was being repeated all along the line ahead howls and screams white terrified eyes a feral combination of fear determination and hate a wall of spears but spears that shook in their owners hands his eyes focused on a group of five or six bearded men but as he closed with the parthian line every ounce of his concentration was bent on keeping his shield locked with the man on his right just as the man on his left did with him a mans instinct was to either surge ahead and be a hero or hang back and survive but in a roman charge neither was possible only discipline hold the line stay in rank shield to shield swords ready a glistening spear point clattered against the rim of his helmet but he kept his head down and it glanced off and he knew he had won the big wooden shield with its solid iron boss smashed into something yielding at first he was surprised at the gentleness of the contact shield line meeting shield line meant a crash like thunder a rippling and grinding of unstoppable force meeting unstoppable force but the poorly armed parthian foot soldiers deserted by their cavalry had no scutum he punched the shield forward and heard a grunt of agony from beyond now at the command every legionary angled his big scutum to his left creating a narrow gap between his shield and his neighbours and rammed his gladius into the gap tiberius felt the familiar thrill as the swords point pierced first cloth then flesh the muscle sucking on the blade as it dared to violate deeper and deeper into the body he heard a man scream but his mind was already on the withdrawal the pull the simultaneous twist of the wrist the grip on the blade weakening and the stink of blood and torn bowels he slammed the shield forward again the rhythm of the battlefield taking over his mind now the parthians smelled of blood and death and sweat and fear and strange spices he had never encountered before from somewhere a shower of arrows hailed down on the rear ranks of the roman attack it was not only the parthians who were dying now a felled enemy clawed at his legs but the legionary behind hacked at the clutching hand and it fell free with the fingers still twitching for the first time tiberius wondered about valerius on his fine horse was he alive or dead perhaps they would cut their way through to each other and meet on the threshold of vologases pavilion now his sandal slipped on something slimy and he glanced down below his feet was a red smear and a shattered skull with half a face and he remembered the pink haze as the great boulder from the catapult made its first impact a certain cadence in the screaming told him that the boulders and the rocks and the great barbed arrows were still doing their work among the ranks ahead but otherwise his whole being was concentrated on the weight behind the shield the thrust of his arm and the threat from above and below now with every word of command each man in the roman line took a step forward as he pushed with his shield and with every step the men in front of them howled and died a roman legion was a killing machine and this was the killing machine at its most efficient against the unarmoured and the unled warriors who individually might be champions but in the claustrophobic crush beyond the shields were reduced to mere cattle to be slaughtered a tortured bearded face appeared below tiberiuss shield and he smashed his ironshod caliga down on it smashing the teeth turning the nose to pulp and crossing the eyes yet the force beyond the shield was becoming stronger each step more difficult to take even with the weight of the men behind him tiberius guessed that somewhere beyond the parthian infantry cavalry were being used to stiffen the line the weight of the horses and the threat of death if a man took another step back bolstering the resistance of men who did not want to fight if that continued the roman line would stall and logic and experience said that eventually when strength failed a stalled line became a retreating line and then men died in their hundreds and their thousands corbulos face came into his head the features drooping with exhaustion but the eyes hard and unyielding the face created conflicting emotions inside him he had come to the east with a very definite opinion of this man and a singleminded determination to do what needed to be done yet proximity to greatness had eroded his certainty until he was confused and disorientated he knew that somehow he must rediscover that certainty if he was to do what he had to do the thought gave him a new surge of energy and he thrust forward and killed another man how many it did not matter because corbulo could not fail and suddenly it happened a drum beat a frantic rhythm the weight behind the shield faded away a horn sounded a familiar but unlikely call and the roman line stopped dazed and uncertain whether to hold their line or to charge after an enemy who had retreated a dozen steps and thrown down their spears an armoured warlord in a green cloak urged his horse through the centre of the gaping parthians holding a green branch high corbulo had won xliv from his position by the largest of the three grave mounds raised over the parthian dead valerius marvelled again at the size of the force gnaeus domitius corbulo had defeated they were the last stragglers of vologases great army but they streamed past in their thousands and tens of thousands spears on their shoulders heads down and shoulders drooping sharing the king of kings ignominy ignominy but not humiliation corbulo had been insistent on pain of death that the contents of vologases personal baggage train his wardrobe his library his vast treasures of gold silver and precious stones and his travelling harem of two hundred concubines must be left untouched while the stink of death still hung heavy over the battlefield the king of kings had sat upon his lion throne of pure gold and his painted face had remained impassive as corbulo dictated his terms but those terms had been surprisingly lenient the parthian army could withdraw with its arms and its banners and its honour intact there was no shame in having been defeated by a force with superior firepower and territorial advantage the general stressed this had been an unfortunate misunderstanding and they must give thanks to the gods that the casualties had been so light vologases scorpion eyebrows had twitched at this description of a battle which had cost him the flower of the parthian aristocracy including some of his most important political allies the ten thousand peasant levies who died were of less consequence corbulo would exact no tribute beyond the expenses of the campaign but he would take hostages from the great parthian families gev suren and karin his only demand was that vologases withdraw immediately beyond the tigris and take his army back to ctesiphon the roman forces would remain in place until the withdrawal was complete there would be no repercussions from rome corbulo assured him and the hostages would be released the moment king tiridates returned to artaxata the armenian capital valerius had listened to his general with increasing admiration corbulo had explained his strategy when they had met in the shocked aftermath of the truce better a wounded enemy who walks away than a trapped one with nothing to lose if you cannot destroy your enemy valerius you must leave him with a way out his generals did not want this fight in the first place now all they want to do is return to their estates and their wives beds but vologases is a king and a proud man if i humiliate him or push him too hard he may feel that the only way to regain his honour is to continue the fight the king of kings interpreter had whispered the terms in vologases ear and after a moments hesitation the parthian ruler had accepted with the slightest incline of his broad head only the dark eyes betrayed the loathing he felt for the man who had thwarted him three times in his bid to extend his empire to the north after a mostly sleepless night when it had felt as if he was camped beneath a giant boulder in a thunderstorm valerius had woken to find the parthians already breaking camp and vologases armoured vanguard crossing the bridge of boats across the tigris which had brought them here the romans waited another week while hanno and his scouts shadowed the retreating forces when he was certain they were gone for good corbulo paraded the remnants of his army around him in a great hollow square they had started the campaign twenty thousand strong now with the battle fought the dead buried and the wounded already on the way back to zeugma they counted fewer than sixteen thousand they were bloodied and bruised but they knew they had made history and they held their standards high soon we will be going home corbulos shouted words were greeted with a ragged cheer you have fought and you have fought well as i knew you would you have never let me down i hope that in turn i have never failed you behind us we will leave the graves of the men who will not be returning with us you have all heard the stories of men like claudius hassan newly promoted decurion of the third thracian ala valerius had a vision of the dark smiling face telling of his ambition to carve a life in rome who gave his life rescuing his comrade from the parthian host hassan had taken a spear point in the armpit but stayed in the saddle long enough to get woodentoothed draco to safety if he had lived he would have had the silver spear of valour instead all he has is our thanks and the knowledge that his deed will never be forgotten as long as there is a tenth fretensis or a fifteenth apollinaris none of their deeds will ever be forgotten they are the honoured dead i honour you as the valorous living and i promise that you too will be honoured i have sent couriers to antioch with word of your deeds to be forwarded to rome he read out a long list of names and valerius suppressed a grin as he saw tiberius in the front rank of the tenth straighten to his full height at the news that he had been recommended for a gold torc i know that phalerae and gold crowns mean much to you but i also understand that the lack of plunder from our expedition will disappoint you a groan went up from the assembly and corbulo smiled you would not be human if it did not however forgoing vologases gold was as crucial a part of our victory as the sacrifice of our friends he allowed a long silence as the legionaries contemplated the personal cost of defeating the parthians yet i have decided you cannot go unrewarded every man who fought will receive from my own funds a payment amounting to one tenth of his annual wage the roar that greeted the announcement split the hills and sundered the skies and valerius knew that if corbulo had asked these men to follow him through the gates of hades and over the styx they would have fought their way into the otherworld with their bare hands for him he held his breath because it would have taken just one cry of corbulo for emperor to unleash a wave of popular support that would carry him all the way to the threshold of rome but these were corbulos soldiers and the iron discipline of their commander had been bred and beaten into them there was no shout on the return march with the parthian threat reduced valerius spent less time in the saddle and often walked with tiberius and the men of corbulos personal guard who were now under the young tribunes command it amazed him how quickly the common soldiers were able to put the terrors of the battle behind them when they werent talking about women and wine and what they would spend corbulos bonus on they sang traditional marching songs like the obscene march of marius which had more than twenty verses and chronicled the sexual exploits of a legionary from one end of the empire to the other tiberius was more subdued the childlike exuberance overwhelmed by what he had seen and endured during the long hours of the parthian arrow storm the boy had become a man valerius knew only too well the horrors that visited in the night after a battle the halfremembered glimpses of a human slaughterhouse splinters of white bone against raw red meat the obscene pink blue sheen of spilled entrails or the fools grin on the face of a severed head the hairsbreadth escapes from death that hinged on the glint of a sword blade or an enemy spear point the dead men who demanded why he had lived and they had not these as much as his wounds were a soldiers baggage of war as they marched together he tried to lighten the mood by talking of anything but the campaign but tiberius seemed obsessed by the notion of duty i felt sorry for the parthian horses he said in a voice that was flat and emotionless but i knew i had to kill them some of them were beautiful and reminded me of khamsin but they died just the same because it was my duty if you hadnt killed their horses the parthians would have killed you valerius pointed out war is about finding the enemys weakness and using it against them the foot soldiers serpentius and i faced didnt want to fight us but they had to be made to fear us or we would still be fighting yet or more likely scattered across the plain with our guts hanging out so you did your duty as you did yours tiberius and i will lose no sleep over it he covered the lie with a smile but what if you were given an order you knew was wrong i thought we had already discussed that there is no right or wrong only discipline discipline is what makes us what we are tiberius roman soldiers that was what your father taught you was it not he might have been harsh but he was right only discipline and your example kept your men in line as they died under the parthian arrows without discipline we would all be dead and vologases would be on his way to artaxata and armenia would be lost to rome for a hundred years the young man still looked pensive but what if there was a conflict between duty and loyalty valerius was bone weary and the question made even less sense than what had gone before no order is given without a purpose tiberius the words came out more harshly than he intended hesitation only kills the men you fight beside disobedience means your own death if you are given an order dont think about it only obey tiberius darted an agonized glance at him but valeriuss gaze was fixed on the horizon if he had looked he would have seen the firm jaw set and the young tribune nod so be it he was a soldier he would do his duty no matter how wrong it felt or how distasteful that duty would be xlv the next day the army of corbulo reached one of the great supply dumps their general had prepared for the return march for the first time in two weeks food and water were plentiful and the men not on guard duty were given an unprecedented two days without drill or training the grateful satrap of tigranocerta had sent two thousand amphorae of fine wine in thanks for his deliverance corbulo ordered a ration to be served to every man but the legionaries and auxiliaries found the sweet armenian brew less to their taste than the leaded tavern vinegar they were more accustomed to valerius spent the evening with the general but corbulo was a disappointing companion compared to the man who had approached the battle with such mercurial energy it was as if victory had stolen something from him or diminished him in some way even the diabolical challenge of caesars tower couldnt energize him and eventually he shook his head and with a tired smile suggested that valerius should seek some better company valerius returned to his tent but he found sleep difficult to come by a chill wind from the north cut through the worn leather and made his missing hand ache for a while he lay and endured the ghosts of the past but when domitias face reminded him that there were some things even courage and resolve could not make attainable he rose and wrapped himself in a thick woollen cloak the moment he left the tent serpentius fell into step by his side valerius looked at him a certain way but the spaniard only shrugged just because youve covered yourself in glory doesnt mean your enemies will suddenly disappear everythings too relaxed for my liking he cocked an ear and valerius made out the shouts of laughter from around the camp nearby a legionary fashioned a melancholy tune on a whistle and someone crooned a love song an argument flared and faded away in a few seconds normally the centurions and decurions would be moving among the men demanding silence but clearly they had been lulled by the same postbattle euphoria as their troops ive seen it often enough in the arena a fighter is celebrating victory over one opponent and forgets the man behind whos about to put a spear through his backbone it isnt pretty they walked through the lines of tents to where khamsin was tethered among the officers mounts and the mare snickered with pleasure when she caught their scent serpentius scratched her forehead and grinned the spaniard was the least tender of men but like everyone else he had been captivated by khamsins moist dark eyes her ready intelligence and her courage valerius untied her and led her by the rope taking comfort in her presence and the bittersweet scent she gave off he marvelled at the good fortune that had brought her through the battle unscathed when so many other horses had died four or five times she might have been hurt or killed and he suspected it was only the parthian love of good horseflesh that had saved her from harm their way took them round the camp perimeter in the cleared space between the lines of eightman tents and the walls of piled stone despite the darkness valeriuss footsteps never wavered a legionary marching camp was as familiar to him as the forum in rome every one as identical as the contours of the landscape would allow and built in the few hours between finishing the march for the day and darkness every eightman tent ten of them to a century occupied the same space its section the contubernium would inhabit in their permanent barracks the fiftyacre area within the walls was cut widthways by the via principalis which they were now approaching and which ran between gates set into the longer sides of the rectangle another road the via praetoria divided the southern portion of the camp running north to south and forming a junction with the principalis near corbulos living quarters in the praetorium as they turned into the wide street valerius could see the flames of the twin torches which burned throughout the night at the entrance of the generals quarters everything seemed normal but as they got closer he felt a warning tickle at the base of his neck and serpentius stiffened at his side they stopped thirty paces short of the cloth pavilion and the spaniard sniffed the air as if it carried the scent of trouble valerius kept his eyes on the entrance waiting for a return to normality what was missing was the reassuring twinkle of torchlight on polished armour a member of corbulos personal guard should have stood alert at each the side of the doorway but there was none six more would usually be positioned in pairs on each side of the tent guarding against illicit entry he searched the darkness for any sign of them buggers must be pissed somewhere serpentius muttered but he had his hand on his sword check out the rear of the pavilion if theyre not there find them and fetch tiberius slowly a terrible realization began to take shape in valeriuss mind one at a time the pieces dropped into place tiberius was commander of corbulos personal guard at valeriuss bidding he remembered the ready smile the interest in every detail of his past the almost desperate desire to impress perhaps you might commend me to general corbulo and i have volunteered to take charge of those on guard duty the odd reaction when he discovered they were marching not to judaeas aid but into armenia just before the attempt to kill corbulo and that last anguished interrogation about duty and loyalty he dropped khamsins halter and started running he slowed as he approached the pool of dancing torchlight outside the tent logic told him there must be a harmless explanation for the missing guard but the instinct that had kept him alive so often on the battlefield screamed at him to act he kept his hand on his sword hilt he wouldnt draw it yet to walk into the generals quarters with a naked blade might invite the same accusations his racing mind was levelling at tiberius the earlier laughter had died away to be replaced by the low mutter that was the normal background noise of the camp at night as five thousand men talked softly in the darkness before sleep but corbulos tent was utterly silent apart from the soft flutter of the torches in the light breeze with infinite care he reached for the tent flap and drew it back an inch corbulos command tent was divided into four compartments by internal cloth partitions and the first was the generals office a dull orange glow painted the sparsely furnished space here was corbulos campaign desk light and portable where he issued his orders and read the constant flow of status reports from the two legions and their attached auxiliary units behind it a collapsible chair to one side a couch where the great man could ease the aching bones which were so obvious to valerius but he would mention to no one not even his physician satisfied he moved softly across the carpeted floor and checked the second room where the remains of a meal of bread and olives and a flask of wine lay on a table and caesars tower stood as theyd left it two hours earlier he became aware of a sort of grunting snore like a pig shuffling in mud and his heart slowed as he smiled to himself fool that he was to start at shadows he would give those guards such a roasting tomorrow that they would think their arses were on fire and tiberius how could the little bastard have let this happen valerius turned to leave hed wait outside until the guard reappeared but something made him hesitate no point in being here if he wasnt going to check he only hoped that corbulo wouldnt wake from his noisy slumbers to find him sneaking about his sleeping quarters very gently he pulled back the curtain that divided the two rooms the snuffling sound was louder now but the room was so dark it took time for his eyes to adjust this was a small sleeping space with the generals personal latrine curtained off at one end and his bed in the centre gradually valerius made out a dark hump where corbulos head should be and his tired mind worked out that the hump appeared to be squirming his sword was out of the scabbard before he had taken his first step but the hooded man crouched over corbulo had been alerted by the song of the blade and was already turning valerius went in low and fast determined to drive his enemy away from the general for all he knew corbulo was already dead or dying his throat cut or a dagger through his heart but he couldnt take that chance yet nothing could have prepared him for his enemys astonishing speed of reaction from nowhere a heavy flourfilled sack slammed into his chest and slowed his attack tiberius only tiberius was that quick even as his racing mind confirmed the assassins identity the sack was followed by the generals goldembossed helmet the world went black and his skull seemed to explode as the heavy iron helm took him directly in the face he was vaguely aware that his nose was broken as his legs gave way beneath him blinded by tears and with his head reeling he swung aimlessly with his sword until someone kicked it from his hand leaving him helpless he was dead tiberius would kill him and then finish what he had started but if he was going to die he would die trying with a snarl valerius shook his head and attempted to struggle back to his feet only to feel the sting of a sword point against the notch at the base of his throat one push was all it would take one push and the iron blade would pierce his windpipe and he would choke on his own blood until the moment the point was forced down to cut through his still beating heart he raised his head to look into the face of his killer tiberius wideeyed and twitching one hand on the grip and the other on the pommel and both of them shaking bastard valerius spat traitor he sensed the moment of decision the slightest shift in weight that preceded the thrust it didnt come tiberius opened his mouth to speak but before he could say anything corbulo staggered to his feet with a roar guards call out the guard tiberius brought his knee into valeriuss face and smashed him backwards to be engulfed by the cloth of the tent wall by the time he struggled free the young assassin was gone and corbulo was on his knees retching valerius left the general and staggered through the tent and into the open when he reached the doorway tiberius was already halfway along the via principalis running towards the east gate no escape there the gate would be guarded and he couldnt leave the fort without a pass but valerius knew his man tiberius would not have made his attempt without planning his escape route that meant a bolt hole and he was far enough ahead to lose himself among the tents and wait for his chance but he had reckoned without khamsin somehow valerius made the leap on to the mares back at the first attempt and kicked her into motion belatedly he realized his sword was still lying in corbulos tent but he had no choice if he didnt catch tiberius now he would be gone for good for a moment he almost checked what was he thinking he knew what would happen to the young tribune if he was taken but he was gaius valerius verrens and he was as trapped in the twin coils of duty and discipline as tiberius himself he had given his loyalty to corbulo and that meant that if his killer could be taken he would be taken tiberius heard the sound of hooves behind him and swerved between two lines of tents for a few vital moments valerius thought hed lost him but khamsin made the turn in a single smooth movement and he picked out the dark figure a hundred paces ahead sleepy astonished soldiers appeared in the tent doorways demanding to know what was going on but valerius didnt check as he closed with his target he understood how dangerous tiberius was on foot or not the boy was quick enough and good enough to kill him would khamsin run him down or would she baulk he couldnt take the chance he would have to take him from the saddle thirty paces twenty valerius poised to make the leap then the cloak whirled and his quarry was gone darting into the space between two tents too late to follow but there was a junction ahead and he urged khamsin on until the mare could turn and run parallel with the fleeing assassin a set of pilum targets stored between the tents loomed out of the darkness like a legionary shield wall another horse might have hesitated but khamsin made the jump without altering her stride her hind legs smashed into the wood and she landed awkwardly but she never missed a step desperately valerius scanned the tent lines for tiberius almost missing the telltale movement as the darkclad figure ran across their front he shouted a challenge and tiberius hesitated stumbled to a halt now he had him the young tribune stood head bowed and chest heaving valerius slowed khamsin to a walk alert for any movement beneath the hood he sensed a prolonged sigh an acceptance of the gods will he was wrong when it came it was faster than anything he had ever witnessed faster even than serpentius tiberiuss hand reached out and the arm drew back with the fist gripped round the javelin from a rack that had been hidden by one of the tents it whipped forward and the weighted spear sailed unerringly towards valeriuss heart his mind watched the spear come but the invisible strings that controlled his reactions couldnt keep pace with the gleaming metal point he braced himself for the strike and khamsin must have felt his unease because she reared up on her hind legs he heard the wet slap of forged iron entering flesh but surprisingly he felt no pain it was only when khamsin collapsed on her forelegs with a terrible scream throwing him forward over her shoulder that he realized what had happened a rage as terrible as any he had ever experienced consumed him then and he rolled to his feet and charged screaming at his enemy stop or ill have to kill you the familiar voice touched the outer surface of his mind but couldnt penetrate the killing fury valerius had no thought that he was unarmed and tiberius had a sword that could chop him down in an instant no concern that he might not survive he crashed into tiberiuss chest and knocked him backwards drawing back his wooden fist to smash it into the defenceless face then the mist that clouded his vision cleared and he found himself looking down into the steady grey eyes he knew so well his hand dropped tiberius what have you done my duty the boy said why did you not do yours better that you would have killed me the sound of running footsteps forestalled any answer shit serpentius whispered take him away a centurions voice cut the silence the general will wish to question him as the young tribune was hauled to his feet and dragged off valerius walked slowly to where khamsin lay on her side the wooden shaft of the pilum protruding from her pale breast and the metal point buried deep in her heart she still lived the breath snorting gently in her nostrils but the dark intelligent eyes were already growing dull and as he watched she gave one last shudder and was still tiberius claudius crescens you are found guilty of conspiracy to murder attempted murder neglecting your duty and failing to maintain a proper watch the senior tribune of the tenth announced the tribunals verdict in a voice devoid of emotion have you anything to say before sentence is passed valerius forced himself to look at the man who had been his friend they had not been gentle with tiberius he stood between two guards still in the torn bloodstained tunic he had worn the night before and barely recognizable as the boyish tribune from the golden cygnet he looked at his tormentors through eyes that were mere slits in a face swollen like an overripe melon and bruised to the point where there was barely an inch of unmarked skin a mumble escaped his cracked lips speak up man the young tribune spat in the dust on the floor of the tent duty i was doing my duty he slurred this court has no authority over me i am in the personal service of the emperor and what service would that be the speaker was traianus legate of the tenth who headed the tribunal while corbulo looked on with cold eyes from a seat to the side i am his agent in matters of imperial security and you have proof of this position some letter a seal perhaps traianus didnt hide the mockery in his voice and valerius knew that if a letter had ever existed it no longer did in my tent sewn into the lining of my cloak the legate shook his head sadly your tent was searched most thoroughly and no such letter was found tiberius began you have no right silence in the hush that followed valerius could hear the buzz of insects trapped under the tent roof you are sentenced to death by fustuarium tiberiuss face twisted as if a knife had been plunged into his back fustuarium was the most terrible of legionary punishments when a man would be beaten to death by his tentmates the sentence to be carried out by the men of the governors personal guard whose careers you have destroyed by your disloyalty you are a disgrace to your legion your uniform and your family you have betrayed your legate your comrades your friends and your emperor never my emperor traianus flinched at the savagery of the words that escaped the condemned mans lips only one man here has betrayed his emperor the whole room gasped as tiberius pointed an accusing finger at the man whose evidence had condemned him gnaeus domitius corbulo overstepped his imperium gnaeus domitius corbulo disobeyed a direct order from his caesar and set himself up as emperor of the east it is our duty valerius felt the wild eyes on him but he could not meet them to execute the traitor gnaeus domitius corbulo traianus glanced fearfully at corbulo but the general only shook his head the ramblings of a madman let the sentence be carried out the eight guards tiberius had tricked into deserting corbulo lined up naked and shamefaced at the centre of an enormous open square made up of the massed ranks of the two legions that formed corbulos army wiry and lean their white torsos were a startling contrast to the dark brown of their faces arms and legs each mans eyes flicked nervously to where a horizontal bar had been fixed between two eightfoot wooden posts like a miniature gallows tiberius had convinced his men that corbulo had sent them wine gifted by the armenians and relieved them from duty for the night they were hungover terrified and shivering and they knew a single word from their general could condemn them now they watched fearfully as tiberius was stripped and dragged in chains to the bar where his hands were manacled so that he hung with his toes just touching the ground valerius had pleaded for the leniency of a quick death for the man who had been his friend reminding corbulo of tiberiuss heroics in the battle the general had stared at him with eyes as merciless as a hunting leopards only now did valerius discover just how merciless corbulo marched out into the square and stood before the shivering naked men the sun glittering on the polished metal of his sculpted breastplate and the golden decoration of his plumed helmet valerius took his place at the generals side with traianus and the other senior officers when corbulo spoke it was to the eight men facing him and the one hanging by the wrists from the makeshift gallows you have failed me the question i ask myself is have you betrayed me the naked men shuffled and squirmed but they had the sense to stay quiet as corbulos diamond eyes roamed across them if i believed the answer was yes you would be hanging beside the traitor i am no ugh tiberius cried out as the centurion standing to his right smashed a vine stick across his chest leaving a bright red welt corbulo continued now you will have your opportunity to show your loyalty and make amends for your lapse this man he pointed to the hanging figure attempted to kill your commander this man betrayed his legion he betrayed me and he betrayed rome but most of all he betrayed you he deserves no mercy and he will have none he stooped to pick up the wooden stave that lay at the first mans feet and hefted it in his hand it was a stout piece of ash the handle of a dolabra pickaxe such as every second legionary carried two inches thick the length of a mans arm and worn smooth by constant use you know what you have to do valerius studied the faces and saw a mixture of fury determination and in one case thinly disguised horror at what was about to happen these men were veterans of corbulos wars their features harshened by years of hardship and campaigning lines etched deep in skin weathered to the texture of leather horror or not there would be no holding back from a blow but corbulo was not finished with them you will strike to break bone a shiver of revulsion ran through valerius at the simple recital of fact you will strike to inflict pain but you will not strike to kill he paused to allow this truth to filter into minds which had been steeling themselves to do just that if tiberius claudius crescens dies before nightfall whoever delivers the final blow will take his place there he pointed again at tiberius an already diminished tiberius the bruised face not the face of a temporarily damaged young man but of a dayold corpse a tiberius who had clearly heard every word judging from the yellow stream on his inner thigh and the damp patch in the dust below his scrabbling toes and that will not be the end of it corbulo continued you will die one after the other unless that man lives until night the sourness in valeriuss belly like a shoal of tiny fish eating something dead in there had expanded into a living bubbling thing that made him fear for his bowels hero of rome the thought was a snarl a rallying cry you are a hero of rome you will not vomit you will not shit you will not weep for a moment he wasnt certain who the thoughts the inner shouts were directed towards himself or poor doomed tiberius you know death you have seen death in every form you understand that death can be a friend but that was the awfulness of it there would be no friend to escort tiberius claudius crescens into the darkness at last corbulo raised his voice so that it echoed round the square of staring armourclad men sweating in the latemorning sun this man would have murdered your general this man would have brought dishonour to your legions but worse this man claimed that gnaeus domitius corbulo proconsul of syria wished to set himself up as emperor he waited daring any man to cheer but there was only silence a dull blanket of fear that weighed down on the entire assembly man and beast this man lied i swear to you the legions of rome upon my own life that i am loyal to nero claudius caesar germanicus and if any among you believes otherwise you may step forward and plunge your spear into my breast gnaeus domitius corbulo wishes only to serve to serve his empire to serve his caesar and to serve you he paused again allowing his gaze to roam across the long lines of silent men sometimes serving can be harsh difficult as it is today a lesson must be given and a lesson learned we march in step or we march not at all let the sentence be carried out xlvi tiberius had been mumbling incoherently to himself but now as his executioners picked up their axe handles he began to shout the strength in his voice growing with every word i name gnaeus domitius corbulo a traitor to rome and his emperor i name marcus ulpius traianus a traitor to rome and his emperor i name gaius valerius valerius winced as the first wooden baton smashed into tiberiuss face pulverizing his already broken nose and smashing teeth and bone in a spray of bright blood it was a tentative prelude to what was to come a halfstruck panicked swipe that sought corbulos approval and was intended to silence rather than maim the decurion of the guard a tall wiry cantabrian with wolfs eyes in a feral childs face was a decurion no more and he more than any of them was determined to exact his revenge he snarled at the man who had struck first to step back and organized the former guards into a circle in the pause that followed a soft throaty murmur of anticipation or dread emerged from the surrounding soldiers but it was swiftly stifled by the growls of the centurions the cantabrian brought his axe handle round in a sweeping arc that landed across tiberiuss left shin with the sharp crack of a branch snapping in the wind the agony as the bone snapped made tiberius give out a fullblooded shriek he had resolved to be brave to die with honour but the coldness of corbulos words and the knowledge that whatever torment he suffered would have no end had unmanned him his leg felt as if someone had pushed a red hot poker into an arrow wound in his mind he cried out for his father but he knew he would find no comfort there when the next blow came and then the next his whole body dissolved into a mass of pain his mind retreated from the horror that was being done to his flesh but there was no escape even there he felt himself broken one piece at a time and cried out for the stray blow that would end his agony but the batons rose and fell never landing a hit that might give him the oblivion he pleaded for a hundred swords stabbed his chest as his ribs snapped one by one his legs were smashed until they hung loose like sacks of blood and bone he noted from somewhere above the brutalized body that was his own a sharpedged sliver of white which appeared from an arm already broken in four or five places still the executioners kept up their terrible relentless rhythm a childs voice cried out no more please no more from a dozen paces away valerius bit his lip until he could taste blood it is easy to beat a man to death but to beat a man to within an inch of death when your own life depends on it is more difficult the guards swung until the sweat ran off them in rivers and they could barely hold the slippery axe handles gradually it became obvious they were cushioning their blows and avoiding areas of the dying mans body where a slightly overzealous swing could result in his and their early demise stop corbulo called a halt as tiberiuss head slumped forward the executioners stepped back breathing hard and casting fearful eyes towards their commander accompanied by his physician corbulo walked forward to stand before the dying man he took tiberiuss chin in his fingers and lifted it to look into the smashed unrecognizable face a thick streamer of clotted blood fell on to his hand and he flicked it away in disgust revive him gaius spurinna had served corbulo for ten years and had seen enough horror to last him a lifetime but he hesitated to touch the obscenely hanging sack of battered flesh and broken bone that twenty minutes earlier had been a young man revive him corbulo snapped again reluctantly the physician reached towards tiberiuss shattered pelvis where two broken bones could be made to grind together and as the condemned man gave a little shriek of agony followed by an animal howl the general addressed his former guards you may think me cruel you may think he has suffered enough but the sentence must be carried out exactly as i ordered now continue and the first man to hold back a blow will join him so the pick handles rose and fell and the screams resumed until tiberius claudius crescens tribune of rome hovered somewhere between the living and the dead and even gaius spurinnas reluctant ministrations could not revive him another man would have long since succumbed to his injuries but there was a core of molten iron at the heart of the young tribune which would not be extinguished enough corbulo marched from the square and the legions were dismissed the dust from their marching feet wreathing the execution frame until only valerius was left staring at the man who had been his friend he heard someone come to his side poor bastard you should have killed him when you had the chance valerius didnt take his eyes from the broken horror that was now tiberius but he shook his head it would have been cleaner serpentius but then you or i might have been hanging there instead he heard the spaniards grunt of surprise that was the plan all along tiberius has always been neros man nero or tigellinus all this the command and the investigation i was supposed to carry out into corbulos headquarters was nothing but a cover my job was to bring tiberius here and place him in a position where he could get within a sword swing of corbulo you and i were decoys to divert attention from him as he did his work and to be sacrificed when we were no longer needed if he had succeeded in smothering the general last night no one would have been looking for tiberius claudius crescens the lowly tribune they would have come for us he was a good soldier he was a professional assassin so he should be growing up with that bastard of a father would have been the perfect training his whole life was lived as a lie the only thing i dont understand is why he didnt kill me serpentius turned to him surprised that he didnt know because you were his friend it was still three hours until sundown valerius stayed another hour he was about to leave when tiberius began calling out to his father in a tortured almost indiscernible whimper he listened to the young man appeal for love beg not to be beaten and promise not to fail again then it changed mother he winced he had never before heard tiberius mention his mother mother please dont leave me why dont you die valerius whispered mother im thirsty water he came to a decision get me some water and a cloth when serpentius returned valerius was still staring at the hanging figure between the two guards corbulo had set he took the cloth and with his left hand stuffed it into the fist of his right then he picked up the pitcher and approached the frame no one is allowed near him tribune generals orders warned the senior of the guards a veteran centurion of the tenth valerius shrugged rather you than me when you try to explain to the general how you let him die of thirst before the deadline he turned to walk away but he knew he had planted a seed of indecision wait he stopped all right give him some water valerius had the pitcher in his left hand and he poured it over the cloth in the walnut fist saturating it with water when he was satisfied he used the damp cloth to moisten tiberiuss lips through his pain tiberius somehow sensed the human contact the feel of the liquid on his smashed lips took him back to the desert where he had suffered and almost died for his friends for a moment he was back there and out of the glare walked the long dead woman who had provided the only warmth of his childhood she had come to take him home thank you mother valerius brought his left hand to the younger mans cheek in what appeared to be a caress neither of the guards saw the narrow needlepointed knife that he pushed up into the hollow below the younger mans right ear and into his brain valerius felt tiberius stiffen and blood flowed warm over his hand to drip on to the already gorestained sand below at last the life force left tiberius claudius crescens tribune of the tenth and freed of his pain his body sagged into the arms of the man who had been his friend xlvii mmmmhh valeriuss eyes snapped open as a callused hand clamped over his mouth others pinned his arms and hauled him to his knees as he grew accustomed to the darkness he realized that the tent was filled with legionaries in full armour including the centurion who had been guarding tiberius who now stood over him with his sword drawn and a look of unfettered savagery on his face there was a moment when he knew the man wanted to kill him but it passed and he was hauled into the open and dragged through the camp towards the praetorium the slim figure of serpentius appeared from between two tents by the side of the roadway their eyes met and valerius knew that all it needed was a signal but that would mean death death for at least some of these men and certain death for the two men who opposed them when the centurion called up the reinforcements he undoubtedly had close by valerius had seen enough death for one night he gave an almost imperceptible shake of his head and the spaniard stepped back into the shadows the legionaries hustled him through the flaps and into the big tent where corbulo sat behind his campaign desk with traianus to his right and celsus to his left the three generals were in full uniform and valerius suppressed a shiver as he stood before them naked apart from a loincloth this was the same tribunal which had sentenced tiberius to his terrible end corbulos narrowed eyes were the colour of the leaden seas which lapped britain in winter and just as cold the room felt too small to contain the power of his anger when he spoke the words emerged through clenched teeth you gave the traitor a merciful death against my express orders valerius saw no point in denying the obvious the manner of his death shamed you he was a soldier who fought for you and fought well an assassin a roman officer doing his duty as he saw it a betrayer of his general his legion and his comrades a betrayer of his friends valerius bit his tongue at this incontestable truth hadnt it been he who had unleashed tiberius at corbulo like a launched pilum with his pompous exhortations to mindless duty if you are given an order dont think about it only obey if he had listened more closely perhaps he could have persuaded the boy from his fateful path perhaps tiberius would still have been alive but he knew it wasnt true even if tiberius had turned his back on nero and pledged his loyalty to corbulo how could the emperors most faithful general leave him alive without himself being guilty of disloyalty and now we have a new betrayer corbulo continued i took gaius valerius verrens into my trust i gave him command and gave him my hand in friendship yet he has deliberately flouted my authority prolonging his agony achieved nothing valerius met the cold stare without flinching except to sully your reputation it was not discipline you displayed it was wanton cruelty tiberius saved your daughter when she was dying of thirst you owed him a life just as you owed me a life with a snarl the general rose from his seat almost overturning the desk you dare preach at me gnaeus domitius corbulo is proconsul of asia conqueror of armenia and three times holder of the triumphal regalia more important he is your general i said once you were too soft i was wrong you are weak a general cannot afford to have weakness at the heart of his command a general cannot be seen to condone indiscipline just as he cannot afford to ignore disloyalty you leave me no choice you say i owe you a life then i give you the life of your friend tiberius crescens to whom you granted an undeserved mercy but by disobeying my direct order you forfeit your own traianus gasped and valerius felt as if hed been doused in ice water he had known what he was risking when he helped tiberius into the afterlife but in his mind it had never come to this he listened to corbulo continue you will be taken from here at dawn to be beheaded before the assembled army i give you a soldiers death be grateful i am a roman citizen corbulo flinched as if he had been struck i am a roman citizen valerius repeated i demand the rights accorded by my status and my class you are a roman soldier and subject to military justice the general said with finality my orders came direct from the emperor only the emperor can pass judgement on me corbulos face reddened and valerius waited for the order for his immediate execution but traianus whispered something in the generals ear and he subsided into his seat very well but you would have been wiser to accept my mercy because when the emperor confirms my sentence there will be none gaius valerius verrens you are hereby declared incorrigible you will be fed and watered but no man will speak to you on pain of death you will lose all privileges and be held in chains until confirmation arrives from rome the trek back to antioch was a monthlong torment of pain filth and numbing boredom for valerius each day his guards placed him in chains in one of the supply carts at the rear of the column and for hour upon hour he would shift from one painful position to another until his entire body became a mass of bruised flesh at the halt he would be lifted from the cart barely able to move and placed in an unfurnished tent at the centre of the tenth fretensiss marching camp the centurion followed corbulos orders to feed him a bowl of rough porridge and a goatskin of water were thrust through the tent flaps each night but whether through neglect or purpose he was not allowed to wash or shave after the first week he was ashamed of his stink by the end of the second he no longer noticed apart from the sweet scent of decay from the leather socket covering the stump of his amputated right hand the worst of it was the silence his guard well warned of the consequences never exchanged a word with him conveying their orders with rough pushes and thumps of the wooden staves they carried at first the slaves of the baggage train treated the highborn prisoner with curiosity but after the first man to get too close had his jaw broken they kept their distance only once on the eighteenth day did valerius have the comfort of conversing with another human being how he distracted the guards valerius would never know but somehow serpentius was able to reach the tent wall and whisper a greeting your friends have not forgotten you tell my friends i thank them valerius smiled for the first time in weeks but that is precisely what they must do but serpentius would not be deterred tomorrow at noon caladus and twenty men of his squadron will approach the baggage train for supplies i will be with them it will be the work of a moment to disable the guards and put you on a horse we would be gone before anyone could react and then armenia or cappadocia to be outlaws you would be alive valerius sighed i brought this upon myself serpentius and i knew what the consequences could be tell caladus and his men that i honour them but i will not let them sacrifice themselves for me as for my friend serpentius though he has the disposition of a badtempered hyena he should know that i will never forget his companionship and that buried in the corner of my quarters in antioch he will find a leather bag containing fifty gold aurei which should be some compensation for all the misery i have brought him serpentius gave a low whistle at the size of the amount which was equal to a legionarys retirement bonus for twenty years service he should use it to toast my memory and then return to the wretched mountains he came from there to live as a king or a bandit as he pleases i will use it to toast your freedom no serpentius i dont believe it will come to that gaius valerius verrens is a hero of rome and he will meet his fate as a soldier then i will use it to finish what tiberius started you would kill my friend he heard the spaniards snort of disbelief general corbulo has just sentenced you to death how can he be your friend corbulo is only doing what he sees as his duty as a commander valerius explained patiently just as tiberius was doing his and just as i was doing mine when i led three thousand men to their deaths at colonia he is a strong leader and a strong leader does not flinch from hard decisions his anger is as much because i have forced him to this as it is about giving tiberius a quick death he thinks i am a fool and i believe he would rather i didnt die but so you wont come no serpentius i have walked in the shadows for so long that i do not fear what is to come sometimes i am tired of life and tired of living then at least take this the tent rustled as something was pushed under the leather remember what they did to tiberius and do not let it come to that valerius reached down with his left hand and fumbled for the object his fingers closed over a small knife such as a lady might use to peel her fruit or a man to open his own veins he loosened the ties on the leather socket over his right arm and pushed the knife down until it was completely hidden before tightening them again thank you he whispered but he might as well have been talking to the wind they placed him in a damp windowless cell beneath the proconsuls palace at antioch and he counted the days by the food his jailers provided stoicism had been ingrained since his days on corsica studying under seneca and he searched the many texts he had learned by heart to find some positives in his predicament but gradually captivity and solitude took their toll and wore away at his defences the rattle of the plate heralding each new day was a constant reminder that each might be his last like a drowning man clinging to a branch he took to using every moment to go over his life and asking himself what he might have changed not his time with maeve or the cost each of them paid for it because some things are as inevitable as the next days dawn and their fate had been to meet at a time and a place that invited tragedy could he have been more of a son to his father who had estranged himself from the family for so long only by sacrificing the respect that had finally brought them together at the very end so again no his life it seemed had been a series of perpetual dilemmas and he had followed the only path open to the man who was gaius valerius verrens perhaps every mans life was the same it meant he could die without regret if die he must he worked the little knife free from the leather socket he had told serpentius that corbulo was his friend but was that completely true could a man so ironwilled ever be said to have friends yet there had been nights as they contemplated the tokens on caesars tower in comfortable silence when he had felt an innocent pleasure in another mans company he had never known before the mists cleared and finally he realized what it was this thing that had been gnawing at him no he couldnt have altered the relationship with his father but he could regret that he had never been able to share the same companionable bond that came so naturally with corbulo strange that he should have more in common with tiberius the man he had befriended and killed than anyone alive the sound of the bolt snapping back brought him back to the present was this the time he had the little knife in his hand and now he resolved to use it not to kill himself but to force his captors to kill him better that than being led docilely to the block like a white bull to slaughter on the temple steps he gripped it in his fist ready to take the first man who entered the door swung back and a hooded figure entered gasping as he rose up in front of her with the knife in his hand what have they done to you domitia longina corbulo drew back the hood and stared at the matted beard and straggling hair the stench in the tiny room made her gag i came as soon as i could they discharged serpentius on the first day i think some would have had him killed but my father refused he took lodgings in the town and found a way to reach me you shouldnt be here its not safe did no one tell you that to speak to me was to die domitia bristled of course they told me do you really believe that domitia longina corbulo would be dictated to by fools it was your fathers order then he is a fool and i will tell him so to think that my own father would kill his bravest and best for something as simple as an act of mercy but you should not have provoked him valerius he means to execute you valerius nodded yes there will be no pardon from the emperor if i could no he said solemnly reaching out to touch her face not even if the outcome was certain a tear ran down the velvet of her cheek then i will do what i can even if it is with little hope of success sometimes i think he is a monster not a monster only a soldier xlviii every head turned as valerius was escorted into the room where corbulo had issued his orders for the parthian expedition he struggled to maintain his bearing despite his filthy dishevelled condition and the chains that weighed down his arms and feet one by one he met their eyes the general himself pale as ever valerius had seen him his skin mottled like unset plaster the familiar features of marcus ulpius traianus almost uninterested as if his mind was on other things a look of outrage from gaius pompeius collega of the fifteenth apollinaris aurelius fulvus commanding third gallica one surprising absence he would have expected mucianus to be here to see him condemned and two unlikely additions what had made corbulo invite his daughter and serpentius to the tribunal did no one think to clean him up he felt his guards stiffen at the generals demand the one on the left opened and closed his mouth like a dying flounder corbulo shook his head no matter unchain him and bring him a seat valerius tried to hide his surprise as the guards removed his fetters and a padded bench was brought for him he looked for some message in the faces of serpentius and domitia but all he could read was suspicion on one and puzzlement on the other gaius valerius verrens hero of rome all rights and privileges of your rank and position are hereby restored the words spun in his head like a whirlpool and his mind struggled to grasp their true meaning he hadnt expected to leave this room alive now it was as if the past weeks had never happened corbulo continued do not expect an apology you deserved death be happy that you have my pardon he stopped abruptly as if he was out of breath when he spoke again valerius saw a new corbulo hesitant even fearful i offer no apology but i do ask for your loyalty and your help valerius studied the man who would have had him killed a long moment passed before he answered you have it corbulo nodded slowly and turned away staring down at an open scroll on his desk his shoulders sagged and he seemed to shrink into himself before taking a deep breath and straightening again when he faced his audience his voice had regained its composure i have brought you here because you are all affected by what is written in the message i have just received it is written in a code known only to myself and the emperor you are all aware of the reasons for my campaign against vologases i weighed the risks political and military and i made my decision that decision i do not deny was partly influenced by pride the pride of the empire pride in my legions and their achievements in the last ten years and of course my own pride i would not countenance a repeat of what happened on the rhenus i have no regrets i believe our victory has assured peace on this frontier for generations to come but i knew there could be consequences he turned to face traianus and collega there will be no battle honours for the tenth fretensis or the fifteenth no gold crowns of valour no phalerae no torcs no silver standards traianus opened his mouth to interrupt but corbulo raised a weary hand i know marcus none better how your men stood and suffered and died and how in those last vital moments they took the fight to the parthians though defeat was more likely than victory and no general could have asked for more faithful troops than the fifteenth gaius the reason he faltered and licked his lips and valerius was looking at an old man the reason there will be no honours is because in the emperors opinion there was no battle traianus growled and collegas nostrils flared like an attack dogs but corbulo waved for silence the battle for the cepha gap will be erased from history no yes because it was never fought there was no campaign there was no victory there were no heroes and there were no casualties general gnaeus domitius corbulo did not stir from antioch his soldiers stayed in their barracks valerius shook his head how was this possible he looked to domitia but all he saw was his own shock mirrored on her face but there are no buts tribune i have been relieved from my command immediately to be replaced by general mucianus his face darkened at the personal betrayal the appointment hinted at i am to attend the emperor in greece he produced a bitter smile it seems i have other charges to answer than that of overenthusiasm the revelation and the consequences it implied were followed by a moment of silence before the room erupted domitia let out a sharp cry all three generals were shouting at once valerius found his head filled with a vision of the future that had never previously seemed possible he rose from his seat and went down on one knee in front of his general command us and we will follow you to the gates of rome and beyond to the senate and the palatine itself traianus corbulos longserving and faithful general looked to his fellow legates for affirmation they had discussed this individually when they were certain they would not be heard but had never expected the day to come collega nodded at once but fulvus whose troops were far away on the judaean border hesitated before giving his agreement a single word from you and there would be a new emperor valerius continued mucianus poses no threat as long as we act together we know vespasians views you have already blunted the parthian threat a single legion each to contain judaea and maintain order in syria and you could march east with an army you already have asia the danuvius legions would not stand in your way those on the rhenus are in disarray already on the brink of mutiny galba in spain is too timid and the british legions too far away to react the door is open to rome nero has betrayed his people he no longer deserves to be emperor perhaps he never did act now and the empire will have the emperor it has always deserved it is true father domitia buried her head in corbulos chest you must or corbulo laid his hand upon her head and ran his fingers through her dark hair for the first time valerius saw him as a father loving compassionate and caring when he looked around at the men in the room his eyes were filled with an infinite sadness and valerius knew immediately that they were defeated before they had even begun have you forgotten daughter what i always taught you that a corbulo does not have the luxury of choice only duty accompanied by the sound of domitias sobbing he addressed valerius directly i need give you no reason for keeping faith with my emperor but your loyalty to me as a commander and a soldier deserves that i should on the day of the tribune tiberius crescenss execution the grey eyes met valeriuss and he would always believe he saw regret there i swore on my life in front of my soldiers that i would serve the emperor but even if it were not so i would never use what power i have to start a civil war that would ravage this empire and bring its people nothing but sorrow no man will ever be able to say that gnaeus domitius corbulo was responsible for pitching roman against roman all it would take is for a single commander to stand against me and the flames of war would be lit nero is no fool if we reached the gates of rome without conflict he would bar them against us he still has the support of the guard and the mob perhaps they would throw down their swords and their cudgels and shout corbulo for the purple but even if i knew it to be so i would not march he pressed his lips against domitias dark tresses because a corbulo does not have the luxury of choice only duty he turned to his generals return to your legions and continue as normal this conversation is forgotten i pray you give general mucianus the same loyalty you have always given me leave us now traianus would have argued but collega took him by the arm fulvus walked out with his head bowed valerius rose to follow them stay valerius spaniard arrange fresh clothes food and a bath for your master on my authority while i still have it take my daughter with you domitia reluctantly prised herself from her father and with a tearstained glance at valerius obediently left the room corbulo sighed and slumped into his chair i have failed her if only she had been a son he gestured pour us some wine valerius went to the table and poured from a jug into two cups he handed one to the general but before the other man could drink he took a sip from his own corbulo laughed still loyal after all you have suffered valerius perhaps it would be better for us both if it was poisoned caesars tower stood on the table beside the jug and he picked up the small blue token rubbing it thoughtfully between his fingers as he did so he studied the younger man despite the filthy stained tunic matted beard and hair that looked as if it had been cut with a blunt sword he still somehow managed to retain his nobility and his authority the carved wooden hand which defined him an enhancement rather than a diminution he has me between two stones he set the blue token between a pair of the larger whites on the one hand he knows despite everything that he has my loyalty he fears me yet he still trusts me to do his bidding on the other he holds my family my estates and the future of the name corbulo in his grasp he understands that i will not jeopardize them he calls me to athens because he cannot afford to have me in rome for fear of a popular uprising which neither he nor i would have the power to stop he shook his head and his voice filled with exasperation and anger can he not understand that by ridding himself of me he risks starting the very thing he is trying to avoid as long as he had my loyalty and my legions no man dared act against him because they knew that wherever they struck from corbulo would act and act decisively they knew that the very name corbulo would dismay their soldiers and that one legion of corbulos was a match for any two others he may rejoice when he hears of my passing though i doubt it for i feel tigellinuss hand in this but he will be wrong for with my downfall the sands of time begin to run out for nero augustus germanicus caesar what general is safe if corbulo is not what advantage in staying loyal when the next courier may carry your death warrant already there are stirrings in gaul the rhenus legions will stay loyal to whoever pays them but what will they do when they discover a denarius is barely worth three sestertii because of his excesses even a doddering fool like galba in hispana thinks it is safe to talk of the need for change while the degenerate otho whispers encouragement in his ear while i live vespasian will heed my advice when i am gone his ambitions may overcome his judgement the fleet he prepares for the subjugation of judaea could as well land on the beaches at ostia nero is no soldier he is barely a man poorly advised and easily led i pity him when he looks from his window and sees rome burning and cries where is my corbulo then act valerius pleaded it is still not too late recall traianus and gather the legions corbulo smiled sadly would you have me break my promise to the soldiers who put their faith in me would you have me betray the memory of young crescens over whose dying body i made it what kind of man would that make me not the man i wish to be remembered as he held valeriuss gaze there is another message in the letter a suggestion that if i take a certain course of action i need not fear for my family or my reputation the room seemed steeped in shadow with the two men at its centre and the darkness closing in valerius said nothing they both knew what the suggestion was his mind filled with an image of seneca hed heard that the old man had slowly bled to death in his bath still dictating modifications to his books you should know that is the course i intend to take valerius opened his mouth to protest but corbulo raised a hand i will not go to greece to grovel before that man and that is why i need your aid valerius nero gives assurances that no harm will come to domitia i believe he is in earnest for with all his faults he is not cruel but i do not trust mucianus i fear that in his zeal the commander of the sixth might wish to rid his province of a potential irritant a focus for discontent you must carry domitia to safety before you decide you should know that the dispatch from rome contained a second command one which fatally affects the future of gaius valerius verrens i have served rome all my life and have never deviated from a direct order but i choose not to see this one it does not matter what it says i will escort the lady domitia wherever you wish and keep her safe if it costs me my life the general nodded i am glad i have not mistaken you mucianus would have had you dead on that first day for reasons which are clear now but a man does not become a hero of rome by playing the spy and there was another reason why you were spared i recognized the regard in which my daughter held you his words were followed by a momentary silence while valerius weighed their true implications you pledged yourself to me then now i must ask another promise domitia is betrothed to a young man of good prospects and good character promise me you will do nothing to jeopardize that betrothal so he had known of course he had known this is not a generals orders but a fathers entreaty i must know that not only her life but her future is safe i promise it did the words really emerge as a choked snarl corbulo lowered his head so valerius couldnt read his eyes you may leave me now i have work to complete but return in one hour the guards have orders to allow you entry i have arranged passage under false names on a galley for alexandria and drafted a letter to general vespasian outlining the situation he will know what to do now send domitia to me valerius spent the next hour with serpentius explaining the generals arrangements while he bathed dressed in a fresh tunic and shaved he and domitia would travel as man and wife with serpentius as their servant well be merchants reasonably well off but not rich enough to attract attention and we travel light the lady may be accompanied by her slave girl but she can take enough baggage only for a single pack horse tell her i suggest money and jewels anything that is small portable and valuable she can replace her wardrobe in alexandria the spaniard winced tell her all right ill tell her myself mucianus will track us down and its possible that even vespasian wont be able to protect us we have to be prepared for that we may have to run again he sent serpentius into the city to buy appropriate clothes and food for the sea voyage then he went back to corbulo domitia was leaving the generals room when he reached it she was clutching a piece of parchment but as he held out a hand to her she looked at him with a mixture of anguish and disbelief and he was forced to watch her retreating back as she fled to her quarters he found corbulo at his desk dressed in a senators toga with its broad purple stripe the generals eyes were fixed on the gladius that lay on the worn desktop as if the gleaming iron had hypnotized him at first valerius thought it was a simple soldiers sword with a leatherwrapped wooden grip and an iron blade the length of a mans forearm then he noticed the familiar silver pommel with the medusa head the triangular point was bright from recent sharpening still for all its pedigree it was the weapon that had won rome control of the world a killing weapon corbulo saw his look yes a sword that has never been dishonoured is it not fitting he closed his eyes i can remember the first man i killed a tribesman on the rhenus who objected to my cohort burning his village it seems a long time ago a lifetime his voice was flat and arid like the desert wind hissing across a billion grains of sand you understand why i have brought you here the atmosphere in the room was suffocating the last moments before a thunderstorm the very air crackled with energy valerius found he had lost the capacity for speech but the choked sound that emerged from his throat was confirmation enough i will not die like some geriatric in a warm bath but i do not wish to die alone corbulo looked up sharply it is not fear i have come to value your companionship a soldiers companionship he moved to pick up the sword but it was as if it had just emerged from a furnace and his hands recoiled from the heat valerius noticed them shaking and looked away but a whispered word brought him back to the man at the desk failure romes greatest general raised his eyes to meet his gaze and the bleakness there tore valeriuss heart i have been a failure a dozen battles a thousand skirmishes ten thousand dead and for what a general has his day in the sun an emperor bathes in his glory nothing the same terms we had been offered by the armenians and the parthians ten years ago the only true victory was the last battle against vologases and nero intends to wipe it from history no honours for the brave living or dead just a sandy grave and a secret order that no man who fought at cepha should ever be allowed to return to rome his features contorted as if he could already feel the iron in his heart a failure and a coward i was too afraid to lose my honour to do what was right a corbulo does not have the luxury of choice a corbulo is only a man and every man has a choice it is not too late valerius was never sure whether he spoke the words but in any case corbulo ignored them they would have followed me but i failed them i should have stood before my legions and accepted their acclamation and marched on rome you were right vespasian would have covered my rear the eagles would have flocked to my standard and i would have been emperor before nero ended his final performance in greece it is not too late corbulo looked up and said it is time now the hand that picked up the gladius was steady he moved to a padded couch by the window where he lay back his eyes fixed on the ornate ceiling valerius could hear birds singing he wanted to scream at them to stop strange how the world has never seemed so bright the general laid the sword aside and pulled back the folds of the toga to reveal a pale expanse of skin here no valerius said gently pulling the folds lower here corbulo picked up the sword again and placed the point against his stomach just below the breastbone and angled it up towards his heart valerius turned his head not wanting to see he waited but nothing happened for a few moments until the silence was broken by a whisper i am not sure whether i have the strength valerius took a deep breath and turned to find corbulos eyes on him he shook his head do not ask it would you deny me the mercy you showed my assassin he didnt answer because there was no answer place your hand over mine in a dream he sat on the edge of the couch and wrapped his fingers around the shaking hands that held the sword hilt they were bony and cold an old mans hands instinctively valerius adjusted the angle of the sword a little and corbulo muttered a quiet thank you on the count of three valerius looked into his generals face and saw a mixture of gratitude and apprehension sweat dimpled his brow but there was no fear he had followed this man to the very heart of war and he would have followed him to the grave if he had only asked one he closed his eyes and took a breath two the hands beneath his fingers tightened their grip three with all their combined strength they forced the sword into corbulos resisting body valerius felt the moment the point sliced through the outer layers of flesh and into the sucking grip of the muscles just below the surface then the moment of freedom before it found the beating heart corbulo gasped and let out a long agonized groan as the iron entered the very centre of his being his whole body shuddered but still the hands beneath valeriuss fingers forced the sword ever deeper into the pulsing muscle that held his soul the shuddering intensified and then with a final sigh he was free it happened so quickly that irreversible journey from life to death that valerius barely registered it a towering beacon extinguished for ever in a single moment romes greatest general her greatest hope was gone sacrificed on the altar of her emperors paranoia he tried to stand but his shaking legs wouldnt hold him so he sat motionless filled with a terrible emptiness his mind screamed at him that time was running out he must get to the galley with domitia before mucianus or one of his agents learned of corbulos death still his body would not obey he was conscious of the still figure at his side but he couldnt accept it for what it was the mighty intellect the indomitable character gnaeus domitius corbulo had seemed indestructible it didnt seem possible that he was dead in that moment he made a promise to himself that was more binding than any oath if he had to travel to the ends of the earth or walk through fire if it made him a traitor to rome or an outcast of the empire he would avenge this man somehow nero would die when the room eventually stilled and he was able to rise he discovered that his fingers were still locked around the dead hands on the sword hilt he used the wooden fist of his right to prise them free and walked towards the door knowing what it was to be old as he reached it a thought occurred to him and he turned to the cabinet holding caesars tower he studied the pieces for a few moments his mind automatically memorizing their positions when he was satisfied he picked up the small blue token corbulo had favoured and tucked it into the pouch at his belt
