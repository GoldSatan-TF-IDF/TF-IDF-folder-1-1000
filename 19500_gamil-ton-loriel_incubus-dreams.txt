more i despair of ever getting it just right on paper my writing group the alternate historians tom drennen rhett macpherson deborah millitello marella sands sharon shinn and mark sumner fine writers good friends and champions of esoteric trivia to mary my motherinlaw who did grandma day camp with trinity so that jon and i could get this rewrite done if jon hadnt sat with me and made me do it you might never have seen this book to trinity who gets more amazing every year and who i hope someday understands what the heck i was doing all those days and nights up in that room at the top of the house it was an october wedding the bride was a witch who solved preternatural crimes the groom raised the dead and slew vampires for a living it sounded like a halloween joke but it wasnt the grooms side wore traditional black tuxedos with orange bow ties and white shirts the brides side wore orange formals you dont see halloween orange prom dresses all that often id been terrified that i was going to have to shell out three hundred dollars for one of the monstrosities but since i was on the grooms side i got to wear a tux larry kirkland groom coworker and friend had stuck to his guns he refused to make me wear a dress unless i wanted to wear one hmm let me see three hundred dollars or more for a very orange formal that id burn before id wear again or less than a hundred dollars to rent a tux that i could return wait let me think i got the tux i did have to buy a pair of black tieup shoes the tux shop didnt have any size seven in womens oh well even with the seventydollar shoes that i would probably never wear again i still counted myself very lucky as i watched the four bridesmaids in their poofy orange dresses walk down the isle of the packed church their hair done up on their heads in ringlets and more makeup than id ever seen any of them wear i was feeling very very lucky they had little round bouquets of orange and white flowers with black lace and orange and black ribbons trailing down from the flowers i just had to stand up at the front of the church with my one hand holding the wrist of the other arm the wedding coordinator had seemed to believe that all the groomsmen would pick their noses or something equally embarrassing if they didnt keep their hands busy so shed informed them that they were to stand with their hands clasped on opposite wrists no hands in pockets no crossed arms no hands clasped in front of their groins id arrived late to the rehearsalbig surpriseand the wedding coordinator had seemed to believe that i would be a civilizing influence on the men just because i happened to be a girl it didnt take her long to figure out that i was as uncouth as the men frankly i thought we all behaved ourselves really well she just didnt seem very comfortable around men or around me maybe it was the gun i was wearing but none of the groomsmen myself included had done anything for her to complain about this was larrys day and none of us wanted to screw it up oh and tammys day the bride entered the church on her fathers arm her mother was already in the front pew dressed in a pale melon orange that actually looked good on her she was beaming and crying and seemed to be both miserable and deliriously happy all at the same time mrs reynolds was the reason for the big church wedding both larry and tammy would have been happy with something smaller but tammy didnt seem to be able to say no to her mother and larry was just trying to get along with his future inlaw detective tammy reynolds was a vision in white complete with a veil that covered her face like a misty dream she too was wearing more makeup than id ever seen her in but the drama of it suited the beaded neckline and full belllike skirt the dress looked like it could have walked down the isle on its own or at least stood on its own theyd done something with her hair so that it was smooth and completely back from her face so that you could see just how striking she was id never really noticed that detective tammy was beautiful i was standing at the end of the groomsmen me and larrys three brothers so i had to crane a little to see his face it was worth the look he was pale enough that his freckles stood out on his skin like ink spots his blue eyes were wide theyd done something to his short red curls so they lay almost smooth he looked good if he didnt faint he gazed at tammy as if hed been hit with a hammer right between the eyes of course if theyd done two hours worth of makeup on larry he might have been a vision too but men dont have to worry about it the double standard is alive and well the woman is supposed to be beautiful on her wedding day the groom is just supposed to stand there and not embarrass himself or her i leaned back in line and tried not to embarrass anyone id tied my hair back while it was still wet so that it lay flat and smooth to my head i wasnt cutting my hair so it was the best i could do to look like a boy there were other parts of my anatomy that didnt help the boy look either i am curvy and even in a tux built for a man i was still curvy no one complained but the wedding coordinator had rolled her eyes when she saw me what she said out loud was you need more makeup none of the other groomsmen are wearing makeup i said dont you want to look pretty since id thought i already looked pretty good there was only one reply not particularly that had been the last conversation the wedding lady and i had had she positively avoided me after that i think shed been mean on purpose because i wasnt helping her keep the other groomsmen in line she seemed to believe that just because we both had ovaries instead of balls that we should have joined forces besides why should i worry about being pretty it was tammy and larrys day not mine if and that was a very big if i ever got married then id worry about it until then screw it besides i was already wearing more makeup than i normally did which for me meant any my stepmother judith keeps telling me that when i hit thirty ill feel differently about all this girl stuff ive only got three years to go until the big so far panic has not set in tammys father placed her hand in larrys tammy was three inches taller than larry in heels she was more i was standing close enough to the groom to see the look that tammys father gave larry it was not a friendly look tammy was three months almost four months pregnant and it was larrys fault or rather it was tammy and larrys fault but i dont think thats how her father viewed it no mr nathan reynolds definitely seemed to blame larry as if tammy had been snatched virgin from her bed and brought back deflowered and pregnant mr reynolds raised tammys blusher on her veil to reveal all that carefully madeup beauty he kissed her solemnly on the cheek threw one last dark look at larry and turned smiling and pleasant to join his wife in the front pew the fact that hed gone from a look that dark to pleasant and smiling when he knew the church would see his face bothered me i didnt like that larrys new fatherinlaw was capable of lying that well made me wonder what he did for a living but i was naturally suspicious comes from working too closely with the police for too long cynicism is so contagious we all turned toward the altar and the familiar ceremony began id been to dozens of weddings over the years almost all christian almost all standard denominations so the words were strangely familiar funny how you dont think youve memorized something until you hear it and realize you have dearly beloved we are gathered here today to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony it wasnt a catholic or episcopalian wedding so we didnt have to kneel or do much of anything we wouldnt even be getting communion during the ceremony i have to admit my mind began to wander a bit ive never been a big fan of weddings i understand theyre necessary but i was never one of those girls who fantasized about what my wedding would be like someday i dont remember ever thinking about it until i got engaged in college and when that fell through i went back to not thinking about it id been engaged very briefly to richard zeeman junior high science teacher and local ulfric wolfking but hed dumped me because i was more at home with the monsters than he was now id pretty much settled into the idea that i would never marry never have those words spoken over me and my honeybun a tiny part of me that id never admit to out loud was sad about that not the wedding part i think i would hate my own wedding just as much as anyone elses but not having one single person to call my own id been raised middleclass middle america small town and that meant the fact that i was currently dating a minimum of three men maybe four depending on how you looked at it still made me squirm with something painfully close to embarrassment i was working on not being uncomfortable about it but there were issues that needed to be worked out for instance who do you bring as your date to a wedding the wedding was in a church complete with holy items so two of the men were out vampires didnt do well around holy items watching jeanclaude and asher burst into flames as they came through the door would probably have put a damper on the festivities that left me with one official boyfriend micah callahan and one friend who happened to be a boy nathaniel graison theyd come to the part where the rings were exchanged which meant the maid of honor and the best man had something to do the woman got to hold tammys huge spill of white flowers and the man got to hand over the jewelry it all seemed so terribly sexist just once id like to see the men have to hold flowers and the women fork over the jewelry id been told once by a friend that i was too liberated for my own good maybe all i knew was that if i ever did get engaged again id decided either both of us got an engagement ring or neither of us did of course again that not getting married part meant that the engagement was probably off the board too oh well at last they were man and wife we all turned and the reverend presented them to the church as mr and mrs lawrence kirkland though i knew for a fact that tammy was keeping her maiden name so really it should have been mr lawrence kirkland and ms tammy reynolds we all fell into two lines i got to offer my arm to detective jessica arnet she took the arm and with her in heels i was about five inches shorter than she was she smiled at me id noticed she was pretty about a month ago because she was flirting with nathaniel but it wasnt until that moment that i realized she could be beautiful her dark hair was pulled completely back from her face so that the delicate triangle of her cheeks and chin was all you saw the makeup had widened her eyes added color to her cheeks and carved pouting lips out of her thin ones i realized that the orange that made most of the bridesmaids look wan brought out rich highlights in her skin and hair made her eyes shine so few people look good in orange its one of the reasons they use it in so many prisons like an extra punishment but detective arnet looked wonderful in it it almost made me wish id let the wedding lady talk me into the extra makeup almost i must have stared because she frowned and only then did i start forward and take our place in line we filed out like good little wedding party members wed already endured the photographer for group shots hed be hunting the bride and groom for those candid moments cutting the cake throwing the bouquet removing the garter once we got through the receiving line i could fade into the background and no one would care we all stood in a line as wed been drilled bride and groom at the front of the line because lets face it thats who everyone is really here to see the rest of us strung out behind them along the wall waiting to shake hands with mostly strangers tammys family were locals but id never met any of them larrys family were all outoftowners i knew the policemen that had been invited other than that it was all nod and smile nod and smile shake a hand or two nod and smile i must have been concentrating very hard on the people i was meeting because it surprised me when micah callahan my official date was suddenly in front of me he was exactly my height short for man or woman his rich brown hair was nearly as curly as mine and today his hair fell around his shoulders loose hed done that for me he didnt like his hair loose and i understood why he was already delicate looking for a man and with all that hair framing him his face was almost as delicate a triangle as detective arnets his lower lip was fuller than his upper lip which gave him a perpetual pout and being wider than most womens mouths didnt really help but the body under his black tailored suit that definitely helped make it clear he was a man wide shoulders slender waist and hips a swimmers body though that wasnt his sport from the neck down youd never mistake him for a girl it was just the face and the hair hed left his shirt open at the neck so that it framed the hollow in his throat i could see myself reflected darkly in his sunglasses it was actually a little dim in the hallway so why the sunglasses his eyes were kittycat eyes leopard to be exact they were yellow and green all at the same time what color predominated between the two depended on what color he wore his mood the lighting today because of the shirt theyd be very green but with a hint of yellow like dappled light in the forest he was a wereleopard nimirraj of the local pard by rights he should have been able to pass for human but if you spend too much time in animal form sometimes you dont come all the way back he didnt want to squeak the mundanes so hed worn the glasses today his hand was very warm in mine and that one small touch was enough enough to bring some of the careful shielding down the shielding that had kept me from sensing him all through the ceremony like a second heartbeat he was nimirraj to my nimirra leopard king and queen though my idea of the arrangement was closer to queen and consort partners but i reserved presidential veto im a control freak what can i say i was the first human nimirra in the wereleopards long history though since i raise the dead for a living and am a legal vampire executioner there are people wholl argue the human part theyre just jealous i started to pull him in against me for a hug but he gave a small shake of his head he was right he was right if just holding his hand sped my pulse like candy on my tongue then a hug would be bad through a series of metaphysical accidents i held something close to the beast that lived in micah that beast and micahs beast knew each other knew each other in the way of old lovers that part of us that was not human knew each other better than our human halves i still knew almost nothing about him really even though we lived together on a metaphysical level we were bound tighter than any ceremony or piece of paper could make us in real everyday life i was wondering what to do with him he was the perfect partner my other half the missing piece he complemented me in almost every way and when he was standing this close it all seemed so right give me a little distance and i would begin to wonder when the other shoe would drop and he would stop being wonderful id never had a man in my life yet that didnt spoil it somehow why should micah be different he didnt so much kiss me as lay the feel of his breath against my cheek he breathed until later that one light touch made me shiver so violently that he had to steady me with a touch on my arm he smiled at me that knowing smile that a man gives when he understands just how much his touch affects a woman i didnt like that smile it made me feel like he took his time with me for granted the moment i thought it i knew it wasnt true it wasnt even fair so why had i thought it at all because i am a master at screwing up my own love life if something works too well ive got to poke at it prod it until it breaks or bites me i was trying not to do that anymore but old habits especially bad ones die hard micah moved off down the line and detective arnet gave me a questioning look out of her heavily painted but lovely eyes she opened her mouth as if to ask if i were alright but the next person in line distracted her nathaniel was distracting no doubt about that jessica arnet was a few inches taller than nathaniels so she had to look down to meet that lavender gaze no exaggeration on the color his eyes werent blue but truly a pale purple lavender spring lilacs he wore a bandedcollar shirt that was almost the same color as his eyes so the lavender was even more vibrant drowningly beautiful those eyes he offered his hand but she hugged him hugged him because i think for the first time she was in a public situation where no one would think it was strange so she hugged him because she could there was a fraction of a moments hesitation then he hugged her back but he turned his head so he could look at me his eyes said clearly help me she hadnt done that much yet just a hug where a handshake would have done but the look in nathaniels eyes was much more serious than what shed done as if it bothered him more than it should have since in his day job hes a stripper youd think hed be used to women pawing him of course maybe that was the point he wasnt at work she stayed molded to his body and he stayed holding with only that mute look in his eyes to say he was unhappy his body seemed happy and relaxed in the hug he never showed jessica arnet his confused eyes the hug had gone on longer than was polite and i finally realized what part of the problem was nathaniel was the least dominant person id ever met he wanted out of the hug but he could not be the first one to pull back jessica had to let him go and she was probably waiting for him to move away and getting all the wrong signals from the fact that he wasnt moving away shit how do i end up with men in my life who have such interesting problems lucky i guess i held out my hand toward him and the relief on his face was clear enough that anyone down the hall would have seen it and understood it he kept his face turned so jessica never saw that look it would have hurt her feelings and nathaniel didnt want to hurt anyones feelings which meant that he didnt see her shining face all aglow with what she thought was mutual attraction truthfully id thought nathaniel liked her at least a little but his face said otherwise to me anyway nathaniel came to my hand like a scared child whos just been saved from the neighborhood bully i drew him into a hug and he clung to me pressing our bodies tighter than i would have liked in public but i couldnt blame him not really he wanted the comfort of physical contact and i think hed figured out that jessica arnet had gotten the wrong idea i held him as close as i could as close as id wanted to hold micah with micah it might have led to embarrassing things but not with nathaniel with nathaniel i could control myself i wasnt in love with him i caressed the long braid of his auburn hair that fell nearly to his ankles i played with the braid as if it were other more intimate things hoping that jessica would take the hint i should have known that a little extra hugging wouldnt have done the job i drew back from the hug first and he kept his gaze on my face i could study his face and understand what she saw there so handsome so amazingly beautiful his shoulders had broadened in the last few months from weight lifting or just the fact that he was twenty and still filling out he was luscious to look at and i was almost certain he would be nearly as luscious in bed but though he was living with me cleaning my house buying my groceries running my errands i still hadnt had intercourse with him i was really trying to avoid that since i didnt plan on keeping him someday nathaniel would need to find a new place to live a new life because i wouldnt always need him the way i did now i was human but just as i was the first human nimirra the leopards had ever had i was also the first human servant of a master vampire to acquire certain abilities with those abilities came some downsides one of those downsides was needing to feed theardeur every twelve hours or so ardeur is french for flame roughly translates to being consumed being consumed by love but it isnt exactly love i stared up into nathaniels wide lilac eyes cradled his face between my hands i did the only thing i could think of that might keep jessica arnet from embarrassing them both at the reception to follow i kissed him i kissed him because he needed me to do it i kissed him because it was strangely the right thing to do i kissed him because he was mypomme de sang my apple of blood i kissed him because he was my food and i hated the fact that anyone was my food i fed off micah too but he was my partner my boyfriend and he was dominant enough to say no if he wanted to nathaniel wanted me to take him wanted to belong to me and i didnt know what to do about it months from now theardeur would be under control and i wouldnt need apomme de sang what would nathaniel do when i didnt need him anymore i drew back from the kiss and watched nathaniels face shine at me the way jessica arnets face had shone at him i wasnt in love with nathaniel but staring up into that happy handsome face i was afraid that i couldnt say the same for him i was using him not for sex but for food he was food just food but even as i thought it i knew it was partly a lie you dont fall in love with your steak because it cant hold you cant press warm lips in the bend of your neck and whisper thank you as it glides down the hallway in the charcoal gray slacks that fit its ass like a second skin and spill roomy over the thighs that you happen to know are even lovelier out of the pants than in when i turned to the next smiling person in line i caught detective jessica arnet giving me a look it wasnt an entirely friendly look great just great the halloween theme continued into the reception hall orange and black crepe paper streamers dangled everywhere cardboard skeletons rubber bats and paper ghosts floated overhead there was a fake spiderweb against one wall big enough to hang someone from the table centerpieces were realistic looking jackolanterns with flickering electric grins the fake skeletons were long enough to be a hazard to anyone much taller than i was which meant most guests were having the tops of their hair brushed by little cardboard skeleton toes unfortunately tammy was without heels with heels she got her veil tangled with the decorations the bridesmaids finally got tammys veil unhooked from the skeletal toes but it ruined the entrance for the bride and groom if tammy had wanted the decorations safe for the tall people she shouldnt have left it to larry and his brothers there wasnt a one of them over dont blame me groomsman or not i hadnt helped decorate the hall it was not my fault there were other things that i was going to get blamed for but they werent my fault either well mostly not my fault id escorted jessica arnet into the room she hadnt smiled at me as i led her into the room shed looked way too serious when tammys veil was safely secure once more jessica had gone to the table where micah and nathaniel were sitting shed leaned into nathaniel and when i say leaned i mean it like leaned on him so that the line of her body touched his shoulder and arm it was bold and discreet at the same time if i hadnt been watching for it i might not have realized what she was doing she spoke quietly to him he finally shook his head and she turned and wove her way through the small tables full of guests she took the last empty seat at the long table where the wedding party was trapped the last empty chair was beside me we got to sit down in the order wed entered goody in the middle of the toasts after larrys brother had made the groom blush but before the parents had had their turns jessica leaned over close enough that her perfume was sweet and a little too much she whispered does nathaniel really live with you id been afraid the question would be hard this one was easy yes i said i asked if he was your boyfriend and he said that he slept in your bed i thought that was an odd way to answer she turned her head so i was suddenly way too close to her face those widesearching hazel eyes i was struck again by how lovely she was and felt stupid for not noticing sooner but i didnt notice girls i noticed boys so sue me i was heterosexual it wasnt her beauty that struck me but the demand the intelligence in her eyes she searched my face and i realized that no matter how pretty she was she was still a cop and she was trying to smell the lie here because she had smelled one she hadnt asked me a question so i didnt answer i rarely got in trouble by keeping my mouth shut she gave a small frown is he your boyfriend if he is then ill leave it alone but you could have told me sooner so i wouldnt have made a fool of myself i wanted to say you didnt make a fool of yourself but i didnt i was too busy trying to think of an answer that would be honest and not get nathaniel and me in more trouble i settled for the evasion hed used yes he sleeps in my bed she gave a small shake to her head a stubborn look coming over her face that isnt what i asked anita youre lying youre both lying i can smell it she frowned just tell me the truth if you have a prior claim say so now i sighed yeah i have a prior claim apparently the frown deepened putting lines between the pretty eyes apparently what does that mean either hes your boyfriend or hes not maybeboyfriend isnt the right word i said and tried to think of an explanation that didnt include the wordspomme de sang the police didnt really know how deeply involved with the monsters i was they suspected but they didnt know knowing is different from suspicion knowing will hold up in court suspicion wont even get you a search warrant then what is the right word she whispered but it held an edge of hiss as if she were fighting not to yell are you lovers what was i supposed to say if i said yes nathaniel would be free of jessicas unwanted attentions but it would also mean that everyone on the st louis police force would know that nathaniel was my lover it wasnt my reputation i was worried about that was pretty much trashed a girl cant be coffinbait for the master of the city and be a good girl most people feel that if a woman will do a vampire shell do anything not true but there you go no not my reputation at stake but nathaniels if it got out that he was my lover then no other woman would make a play for him if he didnt want to date jessica fine but he needed to date someone someone besides me if i wasnt going to keep nathaniel forever like almost deathdoyoupart ever then he needed a bigger social circle he needed a real girlfriend so i hesitated weighing a dozen words and not finding a single one that would help the situation my cell phone went off as i fumbled for it to stop the soft incessant ringing i was too relieved to be irritated it could have been a wrong number at that moment and i still would have felt i owed them flowers it wasnt a wrong number it was lieutenant rudolph storr head of the regional preternatural investigation team he had opted to be on duty during the wedding so that other people could attend hed asked tammy if she was inviting any nonhumans and when shed said she didnt like that term but if he meant lycanthropes the answer was yes dolph had suddenly decided hed be on duty and not come to the wedding he was having a personal problem with the monsters his son was about to marry a vampire and that vampire was trying to persuade dolphs son to join her in eternal life to say that dolph was not taking it well was an understatement hed trashed an interrogation room manhandled me and damn near gotten himself brought up on charges id arranged a dinner with dolph his wife lucille their son darrin and future daughterinlaw id persuaded darrin to put off the decision to join the undead the wedding was still on but it was a start his son still being among the living had helped dolph deal with his crisis of faith deal with it enough that he was talking to me again deal with it enough that he called me in on a case again his voice was brisk almost normal anita yeah i whispered cupping the phone with my hand it wasnt like every cop in the place which was most of the guests wasnt wondering who i was talking to and why got a body for you to look at now i made it a question the ceremony is over right i didnt call in the middle of it its over im at the reception then i need you here wheres here i asked he told me i know the strip club area across the river but im not familiar with the club name you wont be able to miss it he said itll be the only club with its own police escort it took me a second to realize that he had made a joke dolph didnt make jokes at murder scenes ever i opened my mouth to remark on it but the phone was dead in my hand dolph never had been much for goodbyes detective arnet leaned in and asked was that lieutenant storr yeah i whispered murder scene gotta run she opened her mouth as if she was going to say something else but i was already moving up the table i was going to give my apologies to larry and tammy then go look at a body i was sorry to miss the rest of the reception and all but i had a murder scene to go to not only would i get away from arnets questions but i wouldnt have to dance with micah or nathaniel or anybody the night was looking up i felt a little guilty but i was glad somebody was dead staring down at the dead woman it was impossible to be glad guilty maybe but not glad guilty that even for a second id found the idea of someones death an escape from an uncomfortable social situation i wasnt a child surely to god i could have handled jessica arnet and her questions without hiding behind a murder the fact that i was more comfortable here staring down at a corpse than at the head table at a wedding said something about me and my life i wasnt sure exactly what it said or meant something i probably didnt want to look at too closely though but wait we had a body to look at a crime to solve all the sticky personal stuff could wait had to wait yeah sure the body was a pale glimpse of flesh between two dumpsters in the parking lot there was something almost ghostlike about that shining bit of flesh like if i blinked it would vanish into the october night maybe it was the time of year or the wedding scene id just left but there was something unnerving about the way shed been left theyd stuffed the body behind the dumpsters to hide it then the black wool coat she wore had been opened around her almost naked body so that you caught that gleam of pale flesh in the bright halogen lights of the parking lot why hide her then do something to draw such attention to her it made no sense of course it may have made perfect sense to the people who killed her maybe i stood there tugging my leather jacket around me it wasnt that cold cold enough for the jacket but not enough to put the lining in it i had my hands plunged into the pockets the zipper all the way up my shoulders hunched but leather couldnt help against the cold i was fighting i stared at that pallid glimpse of death and felt nothing nothing not pity not sickness nothing somehow that bothered me more than the woman being dead i made myself move forward made myself go see what there was to see and leave my worries about my moral decay for another time business first i had to come to the far end of the righthand dumpster to see the spill of her yellow hair like a bright exclamation point on the black pavement staring down at her i could see how tiny she was my size or smaller she lay on her back the coat spread under her still securely on her arms but the cloth had been spread wide folded under on the side nearest the parked cars so that she could be seen by a customer walking out to his car her hair too had been pulled back combed out if shed been taller that too would have been visible from the parking lotjust a peek of bright yellow around the dumpster i looked down the line of her body and found the reason that someone had thought she was tallerclear plastic stilettos at least five inches high lying down she lost the height her head had been pressed to the right exposing bite marks on her long neck vampire bite marks on the mound of her small breast was another pair of bite marks with two thin lines of blood trickling from them there was no blood at the neck wound i was going to have to move the dumpsters to get back there i was also going to have to move the body around to look for more bite marks more signs of violence thered been a time when the police only called me in after all the other experts had finished with a scene but that was a while ago i had to make sure i didnt fuck up the scene which meant i needed to find the man in charge lt rudolph storr wasnt hard to spot hes and built like pro wrestlers used to be built before they all started looking like arnold schwarzenegger dolph was in shape but he didnt go for the weight lifting he didnt have time too many crimes to solve his black hair was cut so short it left his ears exposed and somehow stranded on the sides of his head which always meant hed gotten a haircut recently he always had it cut shorter than he liked it so it would be longer between haircuts his tan trench coat was perfectly pressed his shoes shined in the parking lot lights he didnt care what he looked like as long as he was neat and tidy dolph was all about the neat and tidy i think it was one of the reasons that murder pissed him off it was always so messy i nodded at the uniformed policeman whose only job seemed to be watching the body and making sure it didnt get messed with by anyone that wasnt allowed to touch it he nodded back and went back to staring at the corpse something about how wide his eyes were made me wonder if this was his first vampire kill was he worried that the victim would rise and try to munch on him i could have calmed his fears because i knew this one would never rise shed been drained to death by a group of vamps that wont make you one of them in fact the act is guaranteed to give the vamps their fun and not to make the vic one of them id seen this once before i hoped like hell it wasnt another master vampire gone rogue the last one had purposely left vics where we could find them in an attempt to get the new laws that gave vampires legal rights repealed mr oliver had believed that vampires were monsters and if they were given legal rights theyd spread too fast eventually turning the entire human race into vampires then who would everybody feed off of yeah it would take hundreds of years for vampirism to spread to that degree but the really old vampires take the long view they can afford to theyve got the time i knew it wasnt mr oliver again because id killed him id crushed his heart and no matter how many times dracula might rise in old movies oliver was well and truly dead i could guarantee it which meant we had a new group of nuts on our hands and they could have an entirely new motive for killing hell maybe it was personal vampires were legal citizens now which meant they could have grudges just like humans but somehow it didnt feel personal dont ask me to explain it but it didnt dolph saw me coming toward him he didnt smile or say hi because one it was dolph and two he wasnt completely happy with me he wasnt happy with the monsters lately which rubbed off on me because i was way too intimate with the monsters still convincing his son not to become a vampire had earned me brownie points the fact that dolph had just gotten off of a leave without pay with an informal warning that if he didnt shape up hed be suspended had also mellowed him out frankly id take whatever i could get dolph and i were friends or id thought we were we were both a little unsure where we stood right now i need to move the dumpsters to look at the body i also need to move the body around to look for more bite marks or whatever can i do that without screwing the crime scene up he looked at me and there was something in his face that said clearly he was not happy to have me here he started to say something glanced around at the other detectives the uniforms the crimescene techs and beyond that to the waiting ambulance shook his head and motioned me off to one side i could feel peoples gazes follow us as we moved away all of the detectives there knew that dolph had dragged me up a flight of stairs at a crime scene when i said manhandled i wasnt exaggerating god knows what the stories said now probably that hed hit me which he hadnt but what hed done had been bad enough bad enough i could have pressed charges and won he leaned over and spoke low i dont like you being here you called me i said god i did not want to fight with him tonight he nodded i called but i need to know that you dont have a conflict of interest here i frowned up at him what do you mean what conflict of interest if its a vamp kill then it was someone that belongs to your boyfriend its nice that you saidif its a vamp kill but if you mean jeanclaude then it might not be his people at all oh thats right you got two vampire boyfriends now his voice was ugly you want to fight each other or fight crime your choice i said he made a visible effort to control himself hands in fists at his sides eyes closed deep breaths hed been forced to go through anger management training i watched him use his newfound skills then he opened his eyescold cop eyesand said youre defending the vamps already im not saying its not a vamp kill all i said was that it might not be jeanclaudes people thats all but youre defending your boyfriend and his people already you havent even looked at the vic completely and already you say it cant be your lover boy i felt my eyes grow cold and said im not saying it couldnt have been jeanclaudes vampires im saying its unlikely thanks to the church of eternal life st louis has a lot of bloodsuckers that dont owe allegiance to the master of the city the churchs members are more straitlaced than rightwing christians he said i shrugged they do come off as sanctimonious ill grant you that most true believers do but thats not why i say it was them or strangers instead of the vampires i know best why then he asked my only excuse for telling the absolute truth is that i was pissed and tired of dolph being mad at me because if any of jeanclaudes people did this theyre dead either hell turn them in to the law himself or have me do it or theyll just be killed youre admitting that your boyfriend is a murderer i took in a deep breath and let it out slow you know dolph this is getting old yeah im fucking a vampire or two get over it he looked away i dont know how then learn i said but stop letting your personal shit rain all over the crime scene weve wasted time arguing when i could have been looking at the body i want these people caught people plural he asked ive only seen two bite marks but they both have a slightly different pattern to them the one on the chest is smaller less space between the fangs so yeah at least two but im betting more why he asked because they bled her out theres almost no blood anywhere two vamps couldnt drain an adult human being without leaving a mess theyd need more mouths to hold that much blood maybe she was killed somewhere else i frowned at him its october shes outside wearing fiveinch plastic stilettos an inexpensive wool coat and not much else i motioned at the building behind us were in the parking lot of a strip club hmm let me see fiveinch plastic stilettos naked woman could this be a clue that she worked here stepped out for a smoke or something dolph reached into his pocket and got out his everpresent notebook shes been identified as one charlene morresey twentytwo works as a stripperworked as a stripper yes she did smoke but she told one of the other girls she was going outside for a breath of fresh air we know she probably didnt know the vamps how so she came out to get some air not to visit he nodded and made a note theres no sign of a struggle yet its like she came out here for air and just walked over there with them she wouldnt do that for strangers if she was under mind control she would so one of our vamps is an old one dolph was still making notes not necessarily old but powerful and that usually means old i thought about it someone with good mind control powersthat im sure ofage i shrugged i dont know yet he was still writing in his notebook now can i move the dumpster and move the body around or do you still need the techies to get back in there and do their thing first i had them wait for you he said without looking up from his writing i looked at him tried to learn something from his face but he was all concentration and business it was a step up that hed had the techs wait for me and that hed called me at all before his time off hed tried to get me barred from crime scenes it was a step up so why was i still wondering if dolph was capable of letting his personal life go long enough to solve this case because once youve seen someone you trusted lose it completely you never truly trust them again not completely there was a matching set of bite marks on the other side of her neck they were so close to the same size as the ones on the lefthand side that i wondered if the same vamp had bitten twice i didnt have my ruler with me hell i didnt have most of my equipment with me id been planning on a wedding tonight not a crime scene i asked if anyone had something to measure bite radius one of the techs offered to measure for me fine with me she had a pair of calipersid never used a pair of them before measurements do not lie it wasnt the same vamp nor was it the same vamp at each of her inner thighs or her wrists counting the bite mark on her chest that made seven seven vampires enough to drain an adult human being dry and leave very little blood behind there was no obvious evidence of sexual assault according to a csu technician glad to hear it i did not bother explaining that the bite alone can be orgasmic both for the vic and the killer not always but often especially if the vampire is good at fogging the mind a vampire with enough juice can make someone enjoy being killed scary but true after id seen every inch of the dead woman when i knew that her pale flesh might dance through my dreams in their plastic shoes dolph wanted to talk talk to me he said i knew what he wanted seven vamps one has to be good enough at mind control to have made the vic enjoy what was happening or at least not mind it someone would have heard her screams otherwise have you walked into the club he asked no music is loud lots of people inside he said so they might not have heard her even if she did scream he nodded i sighed theres no sign of a struggle theyll look at her nails but there wont be any sign of a fight the vic didnt even know what was happening or at least not until it was way too late youre sure of that i thought for a second or two no im not sure its my best educated guess but maybe shes one of those people that doesnt fight back maybe once seven vampires surrounded her she just gave up i dont know what kind of person was charlene morresey was she a fighter dont know yet dolph said if she was a fighter then vampire mind tricks were used if she wasnt if she was real docile then maybe not maybe were looking for a bunch of young vamps i shook my head but id say not id say at least one maybe more were old and good at doing at this they hid the body he said i finished the thought for him and then exposed it so that someone would find it he nodded thats been bothering me too if they had just closed her coat over her body not messed with the hair no one would have found her tonight theyd have missed her in the club i said or was she done for the night she wasnt done and yeah they would have missed her i glanced back at the body but would they have found her maybe he said but not this quick yeah shes still fresh cool to the touch but not long gone he checked his notes less than two hours since she was on stage i looked around us at the bright halogen lights there was no good place to hide in this parking lot except behind the dumpsters did they do her behind the dumpsters or a car he said or van i said the serial killers best friend dolph said i looked at him trying to read behind those cop eyes serial killer what are you talking about this is the first kill to my knowledge he nodded yeah he started to turn away i caught his sleeve lightly i had to be careful how i touched him lately he took so many things as aggression cops do not use the phraseserial killer unless they have to one you dont want it to be true two the reporters will get hold of it and report it like its truth he looked down at me and i let go of his sleeve there arent any reporters here anita its just another dead stripper in sauget then why say it maybe im psychic dolph i said he almost smiled i got a bad feeling thats all this is either their first kill or the first kill weve found it was awful damn neat for a first kill someone meant for us to find her dolph and find her tonight yeah but who was it the killer or killers or was it someone else like who i asked another customer that couldnt afford to let his wife know where hed been so he opens her coat draws out her hair tries to make her more visible dolph gave one small nod down i dont buy it a normal person couldnt touch a dead body not enough to open the coat mess with the hair besides that flash of pale flesh was done by someone who knew that it would be as visible as it is a normal person might drag her out from behind the dumpster maybe but they wouldnt mess with her not like that you keep saying normal anita dont you know yet there is no normal theres just victims and predators he looked away when he said the last as if he didnt want me to see whatever was in his face i let him look away let him keep that moment to himself because dolph and i were trying to rebuild a friendship and sometimes you need your friends to pry and sometimes you need them to leave you the fuck alone i didnt want to go back to the reception first i wasnt in the mood to be merry second i still didnt know how to answer arnets questions third micah had made me promise id dance with him i hated to dance i didnt think i was good at it in the privacy of our home micah and nathaniel and hell jason had told me i was wrong that i actually danced very well i did not believe them i think it was a throwback to a rather horrible junior high school dance experience of course it was junior high is there any experience except horrible for those few years in hell if youre really bad you must be fourteen forever and be trapped in school and never get to go home so i walked into the reception hoping i could say i was tired and we could leave but i knew better micah had dragged a promise out of me that id dance with him and hed gotten me to promise a dance for nathaniel as well damn it i dont promise things often because once i do i keep my word double damn it the crowd had thinned out a lot murder scenes take so much time out of your night but i knew that the boys would be there because i had the car nathaniel was at the table where id left them but it was jason with him not micah jason and nathaniel were leaning so close together that their heads nearly touched jasons short blond hair seemed very yellow against nathaniels dark auburn jason wore a blue dress shirt that i knew was only a shade or two bluer than his eyes his suit was black and i knew without seeing him standing that it was tailored to his body and probably italian in cut jeanclaude had paid for the suit and he was fond of italiancut designer suits for his employees when he wasnt dressing them like they were extras in a highclass porno movie anyway for a mainstream wedding the suit worked jason also worked at guilty pleasures as a stripper and jeanclaude did own the club but it wasnt that type of employment that let jason rate designer clothes tailored to his body jason was jeanclaudespomme de sang jeanclaude did not think i treated nathaniel with enough respect for his position as mypomme de sang i had let micah and nathaniel go shopping with jason for dress clothes and i footed the bill for my two boys it had been outrageous but i couldnt let jeanclaude be nicer to his kept man than i was to mine could i technically micah wasnt a kept man but the salary he drew from the coalition for better understanding between lycanthrope and human communities didnt cover designer suits i made enough money to pay for designer suits so i did i had time to wonder what jason and nathaniel were up to talking so close together like conspirators then i felt more than saw micah he was across the room talking to a group of men most of them cops he shook his head laughed and started across the room toward me i didnt get much chance to see micah from a distance we were always so close to one another physically now i was able to watch him walk toward me able to admire how the suit clung to his body how it flattered the broad shoulders the slender waist the tightness of his hips the swell of his thighs the suit fit him like a roomy glove watching him move toward me i realized the suit was suddenly worth every penny the music stopped before he reached me some song i didnt recognize i had a moment of hope that we could just sit down and find out what the other two men were finding so fascinating but it was a vain hope because another song came on a slow song i still didnt want to dance but as micah got close enough to touch i had to admit that an excuse to touch him in public was not a bad thing he smiled and even with the sunglasses in place i knew what his eyes would look like with that smile ready i sighed and held out my arms as im ever going to be lets shed the leather jacket first i unzipped it but said lets keep it im a little cold his hands slid around my waist is it getting colder outside i shook my head not that kind of cold oh he said and he pulled back his hands which had been sliding up my back underneath the leather jacket he went back to my waist and slid his hands underneath the tux jacket so that only the thin cloth of the dress shirt separated my skin from his i shuddered under that touch he leaned his mouth in close to my ear before hed finished the long slow slide of his hands that would have pressed our bodies together ill warm you up his arms pressed me into the curve and swell of his body but not so tight as to make me uncomfortable in public close but not like we were glued together but even this close i could feel the swell of him under the cloth of his pants the barest brush of touch which let me know that there was more than one reason he didnt hold me as tight as he could he was being polite i wasnt a hundred percent sure whether this politeness was really micahs idea or if hed picked up my discomfort he was always very very careful around me in fact he mirrored back so exactly what i wanted what i needed that it made me wonder if i knew him at all or if all i saw was what he wanted me to see youre frowning whats wrong he was close enough that just turning his head in against my face allowed him to whisper what was i supposed to say that i suspected him of lying to me not about anything in particular but about nearly everything he was too perfect too perfectly what i needed him to be that had to be an act right nobody was perfectly what you needed them to be everybody disappointed you in some way right he whispered against my ear youre frowning harder whats wrong i didnt know what to say why was i left so often this night with a dozen things to say and nothing i wanted to share out loud i decided for partial truth better than a lie i guess im wondering when youre going to spoil everything he drew away enough to see my face clearly he let his puzzlement show what have i done now i shook my head thats the problem you havent done anything nothing wrong anyway i looked at him and wanted to see his eyes i finally reached up and moved his dark glasses just enough to glimpse his chartreuse eyes but of course that was a mistake because i found myself gazing into those eyes marveling at how green they looked tonight i shook my head again damn it what is wrong he asked nothing and thats whats wrong even to me it made no sense but it was still true still how i felt he gave me that smile that was part puzzlement part irony part selfdeprecation and part something else nothing about that smile was happy hed come with that smile and i still didnt understand it but i knew that he used it less and less and usually only when i was being silly even i knew i was being silly but i couldnt seem to help it he was too perfect so i had to poke at it our relationship worked too well so i had to see if i could break it not really break it but see how far it would bend i had to test it because what good was something that couldnt be tested oh hell that wasnt it the truth was that if i let myself i could be happy with micah and it was beginning to get on my nerves i leaned my forehead against his chest im sorry micah im just tired and feeling grumpy he walked me a little to one side off the dance floor not that wed been dancing what is wrong i tried to think what was wrong i was taking something out on him but what then part of it hit me it didnt bother me to see the dead woman i felt nothing you have to divorce yourself from your emotions or you cant do your job i nodded yeah but once i had to work at it now i dont he frowned down at me his eyes still peeking over his partially lowered glasses and that bothers you why only sociopaths and crazy people can look at the violently dead and feel absolutely nothing micah he hugged me to him suddenly fiercely but was careful to keep part of his body away it was the kind of hug youd give a friend in need maybe a little tighter a little more intimate but not much he always seemed to know just what i needed just when i needed it if we werent in love then how did he do that hell id been in love with people that didnt even come close to meeting this many of my needs you are not a sociopath anita you have given up pieces of yourself so you can do your job you told me once its the price you pay i wrapped my arms around him held him tight rested my forehead in the bend of his neck rubbed my face against the incredible smoothness of his skin im trying not to lose more pieces of myself but its like i cant stop i felt nothing tonight except guilt that i felt nothing how crazy is that he kept hugging me its only crazy if you think its crazy anita that made me draw back enough to see his face whats that mean he touched my face gently it means that if your life works and you work in it then its okay whatever is happening is okay i frowned then laughed then frowned again im not sure a therapist would agree with that all i know is that since i met you ive felt safer happier and better than i have in years you said safer funny id think that would be how nathaniel would order it safer then happy i may be your nimirraj and a dominant but anita i spent years at the mercy of chimera he was crazy and a sociopath ive seen the real thing anita and you are neither of those things he smiled when he said it and gave a little duck of his head almost like an old gesture that hed nearly outgrown it showed his profile for a moment and because i was in the mood to pick i asked something id been debating on for weeks i traced the bridge of his nose when i first met you your nose looked like it had been badly broken i assumed that meant it had happened when you were human but your nose is getting straighter isnt it yes and his voice was soft when he said it there was no smile now not even the confusing one his face had closed down id begun to realize that this was how he looked when he was sad id met chimera hell id killed him hed been one of the most insane beings id ever met this from a list that included selfdeluded wouldbe gods and milleniaold master vampires not to mention wereanimals that were both sexual sadists and sexual predators in the truest sense of the word so that i would put chimera near the top of my crazybadguy list said just how awful he had been i could not imagine being at his mercy for any length of time i hadnt enjoyed a few hours micah and his pard had been with chimera for years id avoided this topic because it was so obviously painful for all of them but especially for micah but tonight for so many reasons i needed to know i needed almost to cause him some pain ugly but true sometimes you fight what you are and sometimes you give in to it and some nights you just dont want to fight yourself anymore so you pick someone else to fight we ended up standing at the far side of the parking lot where trees grew in a tall thin line fastgrowing maples with their yellow leaves dancing in the october wind my hair was so tight in its french braid that the wind could do little with it but micahs hair streamed around his face like a thick dark cloud hed taken off his glasses and the streetlights made his eyes very yellow even with the green shirt on as if they reflected the light differently than they should have or would have if theyd been human eyes the wind was cool and held that crisp autumn scent what i wanted to do was take his hand and walk out into the night until we found some woods i wanted to go walking out into the darkness and let the wind take us where it wanted us to go my bad mood seemed to have faded on the cool night wind or maybe it was the sight of him his face nearly lost in a cloud of his own hair whatever it was i didnt want to fight anymore youre right my nose is healing his voice held that hint of bitter laughter to it that tone that matched that confusing smile i touched his arm if this is hard you dont have to he shook his head and put a hand up at his hair impatient angry as if he was mad at the hair for getting in his face i thought he was probably angry at me but i didnt ask i didnt really want to know if the answer was yes no you asked ill answer i took back my hand and let him talk let him open the bag that id wanted opened so badly only minutes ago now id have let it go to wipe that look off his face do you know why my hairs long it was such an odd question that i answered it no i guess i thought you liked it that way he shook his head one hand caught in the hair near his face so he could keep the wind from chasing it across his face when chimera took over a group of shapeshifters he used torture or the threat of torture to control us if the head of the group could withstand the torture then hed torment weaker members use their harm as a way to control the alphas in the group he was quiet for so long that i had to say something i know he was a sadistic bastard i remember what he did to gina and violet to keep you and merle under control you only know part of it he said and his eyes had a distant look so far away he was remembering and it wasnt pretty i hadnt meant to bring this on i hadnt micah i didnt mean no you wanted to know you can know he took in a breath so deep it made him shudder one of his favorite torments was gang rape those of us who wouldnt participate he made us grow our hair long said if we wanted to act like women we should look like women i thought about that for a second you and merle are the only men in your pard that have long hair he nodded i think caleb enjoyed it and noah well he shrugged we all did things that we didnt like just to stay alive to stay whole i couldnt think much less of caleb but it made me think less of noah i didnt know what to say out loud but micah didnt need me to talk anymore the story was started and he would tell it now whether i wanted to hear it or not it was my own damn fault so i listened and gave him the only thing i could at this pointmy attention not horror not pity just my attention horror was redundant and pityno one likes pity you talked to chimera to more than one of his faces you know how conflicted he was i nodded then said yes part of him was the ultimate male bully and that part raped women part of him was gay and the two parts hated each other chimera had given the idea of split personality a whole new meaning because each personality had had a different physical form until id met him seen it for myself id have said it was impossible i remember that part of him wanted me to be his mate and part of him didnt seem much interested in girls micah nodded exactly i was almost afraid of where this was going but id started it if he could tell the story i could hear it all of it he didnt just rape women micah said but strangely he would only rape a man if he were already gay it was as if he only wanted the sex the person enjoyed to be used against them he shrugged but it turned into a shiver i didnt understand it i was just grateful to not be on his list of victims he shivered again do you want my jacket i asked he gave a small smile i dont think its that kind of cold i reached out to touch him and he stepped back out of reach no anita let me finish if you touch me ill get distracted i wanted to say let me touch you let me distract you but i didnt i did what he asked no one to blame but myself if id kept my mouth shut wed be inside dancing instead when was i going to learn to leave well enough alone probably never but somewhere in all that mess chimera called his mind he was angry at me i wouldnt help him torture wouldnt help him rape but i wouldnt sleep with him voluntarily either though he asked i think he liked me wanted me and because his own twisted rules kept him away from me he found other ways to amuse himself at my expense he touched his face as if searching it with his fingertips almost as if he were surprised at what he found as if it wasnt the face he was expecting to find i cant even remember what it was that gina wouldnt do i think he wanted her to seduce an alpha of another pack that he wanted to own she refused and instead of taking it out on her he took it out on me he beat me bad enough that he broke my nose but i healed fast all lycanthropes heal fast i said i seem to heal faster than most not as fast as chimera did but close he thought it had something to do with how easily we could both go from one form to another he was probably right makes sense i said my voice was utterly calm as if we were talking about the weather the trick to hearing awful memories is not to be horrified the only one allowed to have emotion is the one doing the telling this listener has to be cool the next time i refused to help him rape someone he broke my nose again i healed again then he made it a game every time i refused an order he beat me worse always in the face one day he finally said im going to ruin that pretty face if i cant have it and you wont use it on anybody else then ill just ruin it but i kept healing he let go of his hair and the wind whipped it around his face but he ignored it now he hugged himself held himself tight i wanted to go to him wanted to hold him but hed said no i had to respect that had to but damn damn he didnt beat me the next time he took a knife to me he cut my face up took the nose ate it he gave a sound that was halfway between a laugh and a sob jesus it hurt and it bled god it bled i touched his arm tentatively gently he didnt tell me to go away i eased my arms around him and found that he was trembling a fine tremor that went from the top of his head down his entire body i held him in my arms and wished i knew what to say he whispered against my hair when it grew back but not all the way back he beat me again new flesh is more tender than old and when it broke enough times it stayed broken it didnt heal perfectly and once hed messed me up he seemed satisfied now that chimera isnt here to mess me up my nose is healing its getting straighter every time i come back from leopard form he leaned in against me slowly as if he had to fight to let the tension go he stayed like that relaxing by inches while i held him and rubbed his back in useless circles normal people would have told him lies like its alright im here but he deserved better than lies hes dead micah hes dead and he cant hurt you anymore he cant hurt anyone anymore he gave another sound half swallowed laugh half sob no he cant because you killed him you killed him anita i couldnt kill him i couldnt protect my people i couldnt protect them he began to collapse to his knees and if i hadnt caught him hed have fallen but i did catch him and i lowered us both to the edge of grass near the trees i sat on the grass and held him rocked him while he cried not for himself but for all the people he couldnt save i held him until the crying quieted then stopped and i held him some more in the windswept silence i held him and let the october wind wash us both clean clean of sadness clean of that horrible urge i had to tear things down i made myself a promise sitting there in the grass with the feel of him wrapped around my body i promised not to poke at things anymore i promised not to break things if they were working i promised not to stir up shit if it didnt have to be stirred i said a little prayer to help me keep those promises because god knew that the chances of me keeping any of those promises without divine intervention were slim to none by the time nathaniel and jason came looking for us micah was back to normal normal for micah meant that if i hadnt seen him break down even i wouldnt have guessed in fact he was so back to normal that it made me wonder how many other breakdowns id missed or had i caused this one was he able to maintain absolute control as long as no one made him look at it of course even if that were true that didnt sound very healthy oh hell maybe we all needed therapy if i took the entire pard in maybe we could get a group discount nathaniel sat on the other side of me putting me in the middle he sat so that the line of his body touched mine as much as possible there was a time when id have made him give me breathing space but i understood the shapeshifters need for physical contact now besides making nathaniel move over an inch when he slept mostly naked in my bed nearly every night would have been silly jason just stood and looked down at all of us he looked unnaturally solemn at least for him then suddenly he broke into a grin now he looked like himself its after midnight we thought youd be outside feeding theardeur his grin was way too wicked to match the mildish words im able to go longer between feedings i said sometimes fourteen or even sixteen hours oh pooh he said and stamped his foot pouting it was a wonderful imitation of a childish snit except for the devilish twinkle in his eye i was hoping to take another one for the team i frowned at him but couldnt make it go all the way up to my eyes jason amused me i dont know why but he always had i dont think well be needing your services tonight thanks for offering though he gave an exaggerated sigh i am never going to get to have sex with you again am i dont take this wrong jason but i hope not the sex was amazing but what put you in my bed was an emergency if i cant control theardeur better than that then im not safe to be out in public alone it was my fault nathaniel said voice soft i turned my head and was close enough to the side of his face to have kissed his cheek i wanted to make him move to give me more room but i fought the urge off i was just being grumpy it was my fault if it was anyones nathaniel micahs socalm voice came from my other shoulder it was belle mortes fault the wicked sexy vampire of the west if she hadnt been messing with anita trying to use theardeur to control her then it wouldnt have risen hours ahead of schedule belle morte beautiful death was the creator of jeanclaudes bloodline id never met her in physical person but id met her metaphysically and that had been bad enough micah laid a hand across my shoulders but managed to put his hand on nathaniels shoulder too comforting us both you havent collapsed since anitas been able to stretch the feedings out more nathaniel sighed so heavily that i felt the movement against my body i havent gotten stronger she has he sounded so sad so disappointed in himself i leaned in against his shoulder enough that micah was able to literally hug us both at the same time im your nimirra im supposed to be stronger right he gave me a faint smile i laid my head on his shoulder curving my face into the bend of his neck and getting that whiff of vanilla hed always smelled like vanilla to me id thought once it was shampoo or soap but it wasnt it was his scent for me i hadnt had the courage yet to ask micah if nathaniels skin smelled like vanilla to him too because i wasnt sure what it would mean if i was the only one who found nathaniels scent so very sweet you want to ask anita something jason said nathaniel tensed against me then in a small voice he asked do i still get my dance it was my turn to tense i couldnt control it it was involuntary nathaniel got very still beside me because hed felt it too i didnt want to dance that was true but i also had a very clear memory of thinking just minutes ago with micah that id rather have been dancing id messed up once tonight i didnt want to do it twice sure dancing sounds great that made micah and nathaniel pull back enough to look at me jason was just staring down at me what did you say nathaniel said i said dancing sounds great their astonishment almost made it worthwhile where is anita and what have you done with her jason asked face mock serious i didnt try to explain i couldnt figure out a slick way of saying to micah id rather have danced and its my fault we missed it without spilling his secrets in front of nathaniel and jason so i just stood and offered my hand to nathaniel after a second of staring at it and me he took it almost tentatively as if he were afraid id take it back i think hed come ready for an argument about the dancing and not getting one had thrown him i smiled at the surprise on his face lets go inside he gave me one of his rare fullout smiles the one that made his entire face light up for that one smile id have given him a lot more than just a dance of course my good intentions lasted about as long as it took to be escorted onto the dance floor then suddenly i was expected to dance in front of people in front of people that were mostly cops cops that i worked with on a regular basis no one is as merciless if you give them ammunition no pun intended as a bunch of policemen if i danced badly id be teased if i danced well id be teased worse if they realized i was dancing well with a stripper the teasing would be endless if they realized i was dancing badly with a stripper the jokes would be well bad either way you cut it i was so screwed i felt fourteen again and awkward as hell but it was almost impossible to be awkward with nathaniel as your partner maybe it was his day job but he knew how to bring out the best in someone on the dance floor all i had to do was let go of my inhibitions and follow his body easy maybe but not for me i like the few inhibitions i have left thank you and im going to cling to them as long as i can what i was clinging to now was nathaniel not much scares me not really but airplane rides and dancing in public are on that short list my heart was in my throat and i kept fighting the urge to stare at my feet the men had spent an afternoon proving that i could dance at home with only people who were my friends watching but suddenly in public in front of a less than friendly audience all my lessons seemed to have fled i was reduced to clinging to nathaniels hand and shoulder turning in those useless circles that have nothing to do with the song and everything to do with fear and the inability to dance anita nathaniel said i kept staring at my feet and trying to not see that we were being watched from around the room anita look at me please i raised my face and whatever he saw in my eyes made him smile and filled his own eyes with a sort of soft wonderment you really are afraid he said it like he hadnt believed it before would i ever admit to being afraid if i wasnt he smiled good point his voice was soft just look at my face my eyes no one else matters but the person youre dancing with just dont look at anyone else you sound like youve given this advice before he shrugged a lot of women are uncomfortable on stage at first i gave him raised eyebrows i used to do an act in formal wear and id pick someone from the audience to dance with very formal very fred astaire somehow fred astaire was not a name that came to mind when i thought of guilty pleasures i said as much his smile was less gentle and more his own if you ever came down to the club to watch one of us work instead of just giving us a ride youd know what we did i gave him a look youre dancing he said of course once he pointed out that id been dancing i stopped it was like walking on water if you thought about it you couldnt do it nathaniel pulled gently on my hand and pushed gently on my shoulder and got us going again i finally settled for staring at his chest watching his body movements as if hed been a bad guy and it was a fight watch the central body for the first telltale movements at home you moved to the rhythm of the song not just where i moved you that was at home i said staring at his chest and letting him move me around the floor it was damn passive for me but i couldnt lead because i couldnt dance to lead you have to know what youre doing the song stopped id made it through one song in public yeah i looked up and met nathaniels gaze i expected him to look pleased or happy or a lot of things but that wasnt what was on his face in fact i couldnt read the expression on his face it was serious again but other than that we stood there staring at each other while i tried to figure out what was happening and i think he tried to work up to saying something but what what had him all seriousfaced i had time to ask what whats wrong then the next song came on it was fast with a beat and i was so out of there i let go of nathaniel stepped back and had turned and actually gotten a step away before he grabbed my hand grabbed my hand and pulled me in against him so hard and so fast that i stumbled if i hadnt caught myself with one arm around his body id have fallen i was suddenly acutely aware of the firmness of his back against my arm the curve of his side cupped in the hollow of my hand i was holding him so close to the front of my body that it seemed every inch of us from chest to groin pressed against one another his face was painfully close to mine his mouth so close it seemed a shame not to lay a kiss upon those lips his eyes were halfstartled as if id grabbed him and i had but i hadnt meant to then he swayed to one side and took me with him and just like that we were dancing but it was different from any dancing id ever done i didnt follow his movements with my eyes i followed them with my body he moved and i moved with him not because i was supposed to but for the same reason a tree bends in the wind because it must i moved because he moved i moved because i finally understood what theyd all been talking about rhythm beat but it wasnt the beat of the music i was hearing it was the rhythm of nathaniels body pressed so close that all i could feel was him his body his hands his face his mouth was temptingly close but i did not close that distance i gave myself over to his body the warm strength in his hands but i did not take the kiss he offered for he was offering himself in the way that nathaniel had no demand just the openended offer of his flesh for the taking i ignored that kiss the way id ignored so many others he leaned into me and i had a moment just a moment before his lips touched mine to say no stop but i didnt say it i wanted that kiss that much i could admit to myself his lips brushed mine gentle then the kiss became part of the swaying of our bodies so that as our bodies rocked so the kiss moved with us he kissed me as his body moved and i turned my face up to him and gave myself to the movement of his mouth as id given myself to the movement of his body the brush of lips became a fullblown kiss and it was his tongue that pierced my lips that filled my mouth his mouth that filled mine but it was my hand that left his back and traced his face cupped his cheek pressed my body deeper against his so that i felt him stretched tight and firm under his clothes the feel of him pressed so tight against my clothes and my body brought a small sound from my mouth and the knowledge that theardeur had risen early hours early a distant part of me thought fuck the rest of me agreed but not in the way i meant it i drew back from his mouth tried to breathe tried to think his hand came up to cup the back of my head to press my mouth back to his so that i drowned in his kiss drowned in the pulse and beat of his body drowned on the rhythms and tide of his desire theardeur allowed sometimes a glimpse into another heart or at least their libido id learned to control that part but tonight it was as if my fragile control had been ripped away and i stood pressed into the curves and firmness of nathaniels body with nothing to protect me from him always before hed been safe hed never pushed an advantage never gone over a line that i drew not by word or deed now suddenly he was ignoring all my signals all my silent walls no not ignoring them smashing through them smashing them down with his hands on my body his mouth on mine his body pushing against mine i could not fight theardeur and nathaniel not at the same time i saw what he wanted i felt it felt his frustration months of being good of behaving himself of not pushing his advantage i felt all those months of good behavior shatter around us and leave us stripped and suffocating in a desire that seemed to fill the world until that moment i hadnt understood how very good hed been i hadnt understood what id been turning down i hadnt understood what he was offering i hadnt understood anything i pulled back from him put a hand on his chest to keep him from closing that distance again please anita please please his voice was low and urgent but it was as if he couldnt bring himself to put it into words but theardeur didnt need words i suddenly felt his body again even though we stood feet apart he was so hard and firm and aching aching because id denied him release denied him release for months id never had fullblown sex with nathaniel because i could feed without it it had never occurred to me what that might mean for him but now i could feel his body heavy aching with a passion that had been building for months when last id touched nathaniels needs this completely hed simply wanted to belong to me that was still there but there was a demand in him a near screaming need a need that id neglected hell a need that id pretended didnt exist now suddenly nathaniel wasnt letting me ignore that need anymore i had a moment of clear thinking because i felt guilty guilty that id left him wanting for so long while i had my own needs met id thought that having real sex with him would be using him now suddenly that one glimpse into his heart let me understand that what id done to him had used him more surely than intercourse id used nathaniel like he was some kind of sex toy something to bring me pleasure and be cleaned up and put back in a drawer i was suddenly ashamed ashamed that id treated him like an object when that wasnt how he wanted to be treated the guilt hit me like a cold shower the proverbial slap in the face and i used it to pack theardeur away for another hour or two at least it was as if nathaniel felt the heat spill away from me he gave me those wide lavender eyes huge and glittering glittering with unshed tears he let his hands drop from my arms and since id already dropped my hands away we stood on the dance floor with distance between us a distance that neither of us tried to close the first shining tear trailed down his cheek i reached out to him and said nathaniel he shook his head and backed away a step another then he turned and ran jason and micah tried to catch him as he rushed past them but he avoided their hands with a graceful gesture of his upper body that left them with nothing but air he ran out the door and they both turned to follow but it wasnt either of them who had to chase him down it was me i was the one who owed him an apology the trouble was i wasnt exactly clear on what i would be apologizing for for using him or for not using him enough the first person i saw when i hit the parking lot wasnt any of the men it was ronnie veronica simms private detective one time my best friend was standing off to one side from the door she was hugging herself so hard it looked painful shes a lot of leg and shed added high heels and a short red dress to show off the legs shed once told me if she had my chest shed never wear another high neck shirt in her life shed been kidding but when she dressed up she showed off all that nice long stretch of leg her blond hair was cut at shoulder length but shed curled the edges under tonight so the hair bobbed above the spaghetti straps on her nearly bare shoulders it was bobbing a lot because she was talking low and angry to someone i couldnt see clearly i took another step into the parking lot and the shadows cleared and i saw louis fane louie taught biology at washington university he had his doctorate and was a wererat the university knew about the doctorate but not about what he did on the full moons he was an inch or two shorter than ronnie built compact but strong his shoulders filled out the suit he was wearing nicely hed cut his dark hair short and neat since last id seen him his dark eyes were almost black and his cleancut face was as angry as id ever seen it i couldnt hear what they were saying only the tone and the tone was pissed i realized id been staring and it was none of my business even if ronnie and i had still been working out together three times a week which we werent it still wouldnt have been any of my business ronnie had had problems with me dating a vampire jeanclaude in particular but her main objection seemed to be the vampire part at a time when id needed girl advice and a little sympathy shed offered only her own outrage and anger wed started seeing each other less and less over the last few months until it had gotten to the point where we hadnt talked in a couple of months id known she and louie were still dating because he and i had mutual friends i wondered what the fight was about but it wasnt my fight my fight was waiting out there in the parking lot leaning against the side of my jeep all three of them were leaning against the jeep it was like a lineup or an ambush i hesitated in the middle of the asphalt debating on whether to go back and offer to referee ronnie and louies fight it wasnt kindness that made me want to go back it was cowardice id have much rather gotten dragged into someone elses fight than face what was waiting for me other peoples emotional pain no matter how painful is so much less painful than your own but ronnie wouldnt thank me for interfering and it really wasnt my business maybe id call her tomorrow and see if shed talk see if there was still enough friendship left to save i missed her i stood there in the darkened parking lot caught between the fight behind me and the fight waiting for me strangely i didnt want to fight with anyone i was suddenly tired so terribly tired and it had nothing to do with the late hour or a long day i walked to the waiting men and no one smiled at me but then i didnt smile at them either i guess it wasnt a smiling kind of conversation nathaniel says you didnt want to dance with him micah said not true i said i danced twice what i didnt want to do was play kissyface in front of the cops micah looked at nathaniel nathaniel looked at the ground you kissed me earlier in front of detective arnet why was this different i kissed you to give jessica the clue to stop hitting on you because you wanted me to save you from her he raised his eyes and they were like two pretty wounds so painfilled so you only kissed me to save me not because you wanted to oh hell out loud i tried again though the sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach told me that i was going to lose this argument lately around nathaniel i always felt like i was doing something wrong or at least not right that isnt what i meant i said its what you said this from micah dont you start i said and i heard the anger in my voice before i could stop it the anger had been there already i just hadnt been aware of it i was angry a lot especially when i wasnt comfortable i liked anger better than embarrassment marianne who was helping me learn to control the ever growing list of psychic powers said that i used anger to shield myself from any unwanted emotion she was right i accepted that she was right but she and i hadnt come up with an alternative solution yet whats a girl to do if she cant get angry and she cant run away from the problem hell if i know marianne had encouraged me to be honest emotionally honest with myself and those closest to me emotional honesty it sounds so harmless so wholesome its neither i dont want to fight i said there that was honest none of us do micah said just hearing him be so calm helped the anger ease away nathaniel pushed it on the dance floor and theardeur rose early i felt it micah said me too jason said but you dont feel it now do you nathaniel said his eyes were almost accusing and his voice held its own thin edge of anger i wasnt sure if id ever heard him that close to being angry anita is getting better control over theardeur micah said nathaniel shook his head hugging himself tight it reminded me of the way that ronnie had been holding herself if it had been you she would have just come out into the parking lot and fed not willingly i said yes you would he said and his eyes held the anger his voice had held id never seen those lavender eyes angry before not like this it was strangely unnerving i would not have sex in the parking lot of larry and tammys wedding reception if i had a choice that angry gaze searched my face as if trying to find something why not feed here because its tacky and because if zerbrowski ever got wind of it i would never ever live it down jason patted his arm see it isnt you she turned down its that she doesnt want to fool around at larrys wedding just not her style nathaniel glanced at jason then back at me some strange tension that i didnt quite understand seemed to flow away from him the anger began to fade from his eyes i guess youre right well if we dont want to be fooling around in the parking lot then we need to get going micah said theardeur doesnt like being denied when it does come back tonight it wont be gentle i sighed he was right that bit of metaphysical bravado on the dance floor would have all sorts of consequences later tonight when theardeur rose again i would be forced to feed there would be no stuffing it back into its box it was almost as if being able to stop theardeur in its tracks to completely turn it off once it had filled me pissed theardeur off i knew it was a psychic gift and that psychic gifts dont have feelings and dont carry grudges but sometimes it felt like this one did im sorry anita i wasnt thinking nathaniel looked so discouraged that i had to hug him a quick hug more sisterly than anything else and he responded to my body language and didnt try and hold me close he let me hug him and step away nathaniel was usually almost painfully attuned to my body language it was one of the things that had allowed him to share my bed for months without violating those last few taboos lets go home i said thats my cue to part company jason said youre welcome to bunk over if you want i said he shook his head no since im not needed to referee the fight or for sage advice ill go home too besides i couldnt stand listening to the three of you get all hot and heavy and not be invited to play he laughed and added dont get mad but having once been included its harder to be excluded i fought the blush that burned up my face which always seemed to make the blush darker and harder jason and i had had sex once before i realized it was possible to love someone to death with theardeur nathaniel had collapsed at work and been off the feeding schedule for a few days micah hadnt been in the house and theardeur had risen early hours early it had been interference from belle morte the originator of jeanclaudes bloodline and the first to my knowledge possessor of theardeur it only ran through her line of vamps nowhere else the fact that i carried it had raised very interesting metaphysical questions belle had wanted to understand what i was and she had also thought it would raise some hell belle was a good businessy vampire but when she could take care of business and make trouble all the better so it hadnt been my fault but my choices had been limited to taking nathaniel and possibly killing him or letting jason take one for the team hed been happy to do it very happy and strangely our friendship had survived it but every once in a while i couldnt pretend it hadnt happened and that made me uncomfortable i love the fact that i can make you blush now he said i dont he laughed but there was something in his eyes that was more serious than laughter i need to tell you something in private before you go running off though i didnt like how suddenly serious he was id learned in the last few months that jason used his teasing and laughter as a shield to hide a rather insightful intelligence that was sometimes so perceptive it was painful i didnt like his request for privacy either what couldnt he say in front of micah and nathaniel and why out loud i said okay i started off to the far side of the parking lot away from the jeep and farther away from ronnie and louie who even a glance showed were still having a quiet screaming match when the shade of the trees that edged the church parking lot lay cool above us i stopped and turned to jason whats up the thing on the dance floor was sort of my fault in what way your fault he actually looked embarrassed which you didnt see much from jason he wanted to know how i got to have sex with you real sex the very first time i helped feed theardeur technically it was the second i said he frowned at me yeah but that was when theardeur was brand new and we didnt have intercourse and there were three other men in the bed i turned away so the dark would help hide the blush though truthfully he could probably smell it hot on my skin sorry i brought it up you were saying hes been in your bed for what four months something like that i said and hes not had intercourse yet hell hes not had orgasm not real orgasm with like release and everything i couldnt blush harder or my head would explode im listening anita you cant keep pretending that nathaniel isnt real thats not fair maybe not but i had no idea that you werent at least doing him orally or by hand or watching him do himself something anything i just shook my head and looked at the ground i couldnt think of anything good to say if i hadnt just had my metaphysical peek inside nathaniels head i would probably have gotten angry or rude but id seen too far into nathaniels pain and i couldnt pretend anymore couldnt ignore it i thought that by not doing the final stuff that it would make it easier for him when theardeur gets under control and i dont need apomme de sang anymore is that still your idea to just dump him when you have enough control that you dont need to feed what am i supposed to do with him keep him like a pet or a really big child hes not a child and hes not a pet jason said and the first hint of anger was in his voice i know that and thats the problem jason if theardeur hadnt come up id have been nathaniels nimirra and his friend and that would have been it now suddenly hes in this category that i dont even have a name for hes yourpomme de sang like im jeanclaudes you and jeanclaude arent fucking and nobody gets upset about that no because he lets me date i have lovers if i want them ive been encouraging nathaniel to date i want him to have girlfriends and your notsosubtly encouraging him to look at other women made him turn to me for advice what do you mean i asked he doesnt want to date other people he wants to be with you and micah and the vampires he doesnt want another woman in his life i am not the woman in his life yes you are you just dont want to be i leaned against one of the narrow tree trunks oh jason what am i going to do finish what you started with nathaniel be his lover i shook my head i dont want that the hell you dont i watch the way you react around him lust isnt enough jason i dont love him id argue that too i dont love him the way i need to need to for what anita need to for your conscience your sense of morality just give him some of what he needs anita dont break yourself doing it but bend a little thats all im asking you said the thing on the dance floor was sort of your fault you never explained that i told nathaniel you dont like passive men you like a little dominance a little pushiness not much but enough so that you arent the one that says yes well have sex you need someone to take a little of the responsibility off your shoulders i stared at him studied that young face is that all it is for me jason i just need someone else to help me spread the guilt around so i can fuck he winced that isnt what i said close enough get mad if you want but that isnt what i said or what i meant get mad at me but dont take it out on nathaniel okay i was raised that if you had sex it was a commitment i still believe that you dont feel committed to me he said it as if it were just a fact nothing personal no were friends and i was sort of a friend in need but youre a grownup and you understood what it was im not sure nathaniel is enough of a grownup to understand that hell he cant even say no to women who are almost strangers he turned down at least three dance offers while we were talking and i know for a fact that he turned down the beautiful jessica arnet for a date he did really jason nodded yep i didnt think hed be able to say no hes been practicing practicing he tells you no sometimes doesnt he i thought about it sometimes he wont repeat conversations to me or tell me things he says ill get mad at him and so i should ask the other person you wanted no demanded that nathaniel be more responsible for himself you made him get his drivers license youve forced him to be less dependent right yeah but you didnt think what it would mean did you what do you mean you wanted him to be independent to think for himself to decide what he wanted out of life right yeah in fact i said almost exactly that to him i wanted him to decide what he wanted to do with his life i mean hes only twenty for gods sake and what hes decided he wants to do is be with you jason said and his voice was softer gentle that is not a life decision i meant like a career choice maybe go back to college hes got a job anita and he makes better money as a stripper than most college graduates do you cant strip forever i said and most marriages dont last forever either my eyes must have gotten too wide because he hurried with his next words what i mean is that you treat everything like its a forever question like you cant change your mind later i dont mean to imply that nathaniel wants you to make an honest man of him that never came up honest well thats a relief at least youll need apomme de sang for years anita years jeanclaude said maybe in a few months id be able to feed from a distance and not need the up close and personal stuff youve made progress on going longer between feedings anita but you havent made much progress on truly controlling theardeur i controlled it on the dance floor i said he sighed you shut it down on the dance floor thats not control not really its like you have a gun and you can lock it in the gun safe but that doesnt teach you how to shoot it a gun analogy youve been thinking on this for awhile havent you ever since nathaniel told me that you hadnt been allowing him release during the feedings allow he didnt ask and how was i supposed to know he wasnt even doing himself in private i mean i didnt tell him not to you can play with yourself and it feels good but it doesnt meet the real need i pushed my back tight into the tree as if the solid wood could catch me because i felt like i was falling falling into a chasm so deep that id never get out i dont know if i can do nathaniel and still look at myself in the mirror in the morning why does doing nathaniel bother you that much because he confuses my radar i have friends i have boyfriends i have people who are dependent on me people i take care of i do not fuck the people i take care of it would be like taking advantage of your position and nathaniel falls into the taking care of category he asked yes you think by having sex that youre taking advantage yes thats not how nathaniel sees it i know that jason now i closed my eyes and leaned my head back against the roughness of the bark damn it i want theardeur under control so i dont have to keep making these kinds of decisions and if i could wave a magic wand over you and you instantly could control theardeur what then what would you do with nathaniel id help him find a place of his own he does most of the housework around your place he buys your groceries he and micah do most of the cooking nathaniel taking care of the domestic stuff is what allows micah and you both to work all those hours without nathaniel how would you organize it i dont want to keep nathaniel just to make my life easier thats like evil jason let out a big sigh are you really this slow or just driving me crazy on purpose what i said he shook his head anita what im trying to say is that nathaniel doesnt feel used he feels useful he doesnt need a girlfriend because he thinks he already has one he doesnt want to date because hes already living with someone he doesnt need to look for a place of his own because he already has one micah knows that nathaniel knows that the only person who doesnt know that seems to be you jason he stopped me with a raised hand anita you have two men who live with you they both love you they both want you they both support your career between the two of them theyre like your wife there are people in this world who would kill to have what you have and youd just throw it away i just looked at him because i didnt know what to say the only thing that keeps this little domestic arrangement from being perfect for all concerned is that nathaniel is not getting his needs met he stepped in close to me but the look on his face was so serious that it never occurred to me that kissing was coming because it wasnt youve set up the dynamics so that you wear the pants in this trio and thats fine it works for micah and nathaniel but heres the hard part about wearing the pants anita it means you get to make the tough decisions your life is working better than its worked since i met you youve been happier longer than ive ever seen you micah i dont know that well but nathaniel has never been this happy in all the years ive known him everything is working anita everybody is making it work everybody but me i said you he said you know jason i cant say youre wrong about any of it but i hate you right this second hate me if you want to but im tired of watching people have everything their heart desires and throw it away this isnt what my heart desired i said maybe not but its what you needed you needed a wife in that old s sort of way doesnt everybody i said he grinned at me no some people would like to be the wife but i just cant find a woman whos man enough to keep me in the style to which i have not yet become accustomed it made me smile damn it you are the only one who can say shit like this to me and not have me pissed at them for days or longer how do you get away with it he planted a quick kiss on my my lips more brotherly than anything i dont know how i get away with it but if i could bottle it jeanclaude would pay a fortune for it maybe not just jeanclaude maybe not he stepped back smiling but his eyes had that serious look again please anita go home and dont freak just go home and be happy be happy and let everyone around you be happy is that so hard when jason said it like that it didnt seem hard in fact it seemed to make a lot of sense but inside it felt hard inside it felt like the hardest thing in the world to just let go and not pick everything to death to just let go and enjoy what you had to just let go and not make everybody around you miserable with your own internal dialogue to just let go and be happy so simple so difficult so terrifying a car squealed out of the parking lot as jason walked me back to the jeep i only had a moment to see it before it blasted out into the street but i recognized the car apparently ronnie was driving them home but the fight wasnt over not my problem god knew i had enough relationship problems without sticking my nose into someone elses of course sometimes no matter how hard you try to stay out of something you cant can i grab a ride home it was louie fane dr louis fane though his doctorate wasnt in the biology of humans but in the biology of bats his doctoral thesis had been on the adaption of the little brown bat to human habitation actually his work with bats a different species had put him in a cave with a wererat that attacked him its how he got to be furry once a month sure jason and i said in unison louie smiled i just need one ride but thanks his eyes which were truly black not just darkest brown like mine didnt match the smile the eyes were still angry his place is on the way to the circus jason said i nodded okay i looked at louie and wanted to ask what the fight had been about and didnt want to ask what the fight had been about i settled for are you okay he shook his head ronnie will probably call you tomorrow and tell you anyway i guess you might as well know or maybe you can talk some sense into her i gave a halfshrug i dont know ronnie can be pretty stubborn jason laughed you calling someone else stubborn thats rich i frowned at him you sure you dont want to ride home with us instead of mr comedy here he shook his head im on jasons way home he still hadnt told us what the fight was about was i supposed to remind him or let it go do you want some privacy here jason asked louie sighed yes if you dont mind ill say good night to micah and nathaniel and ill be waiting by my car he waved at me and walked away for the second no the third time that night i was standing out in the cool shadows of the trees getting a hearttoheart talk with another man this one wasnt even my boyfriend or occasional food whats wrong louie i asked ronnie to marry me tonight id been prepared for a lot of things but that hadnt even occurred to me marriage i just gaped at him when i could close my mouth and pretend to be intelligent i said and why the fight then she said no he didnt look at me as he said it he stared off into the dark his hands plunged into the pockets of his dress slacks ruining the line of his jacket but giving him something to do with his hands she said no i repeated it as if i hadnt heard it right he glanced at me then you sound surprised well last i knew you guys were getting along really well actually the last time ronnie had confided in me it had been a conversation that had set us both giggling because it had been mostly about sex wed both overshared which women do more than men and the sex had been as good between her and louie as it had been between me and micah which was pretty damned good ronnie had had this mistaken idea that dating micah meant id dumped jeanclaude when she found out it didnt mean that shed not taken it well she just couldnt seem to cope with me dating the undead picky picky i could joke but her last stand on jeanclaude had been adamant enough that we hadnt talked much since its all wonderful anita thats what is so he seemed to search for a word and settled for frustrating so you guys are getting along great i made it a question i thought so maybe i was wrong he paced two steps away from me then back no damn it i wasnt wrong its been the best two years of my life nothing starts my day off better than waking up beside her i want to start every day like that is that so wrong no louie thats not wrong then why did we just have the biggest fight weve ever had his dark face was demanding as if i had the answer and just wouldnt give it to him ill call ronnie tomorrow if she doesnt call me first ill talk to her she says she doesnt want to marry anyone she says if she married anyone it would be me but she doesnt want to she doesnt want to the pain in his voice was so raw it hurt to hear it i am so sorry i started to touch his arm thought better of it and said maybe you could just live together i offered that i offered to just live together until she was ready for more he was staring off into the darkness again as if he didnt want me to see what was in his eyes she said no to that too i asked she doesnt want to give up her independence her independence is one of the things i love most about her i know that i said and my voice was soft because it was all i had to offer he looked at me you know that then can you tell her ill do everything i can to reassure her that youre not trying to clip her wings is that it is she just afraid ill take away her freedom i dont know louie truthfully if youd asked me beforehand id have said shed say yes really he said and he was studying my face now studying it as if the secrets to the universe were somehow hidden in my eyes i preferred him staring out into the dark for his answers instead of in my face i wasnt sure what the darkness had to offer him but i knew i didnt have any answers yeah louie really last i knew she was the happiest ive ever seen her so i wasnt just fooling myself he asked and he was still giving me those raw demanding eyes no louie you werent fooling yourself then why he asked why i shrugged and had to say something because he was still staring at me i dont know im sorry it sounded so inadequate sorry but it was all i had to offer tonight he nodded a little too rapidly as he turned away and stared out into the dark again i knew he wasnt really seeing the yard that bordered the church i knew he was just staring to be staring and not to have to meet anyones eyes for a while but it was sort of unnerving unnerving to think that whatever he was feeling was so strong that he had to hide his eyes so i wouldnt see it reminded me of the way dolph had turned away at the murder scene and in a way they were both hiding the same thingpain he turned away from the dark and gave me his eyes again they were raw and i had to fight to not turn away myself my rule was always if someone could feel the emotion the least i could do was not turn away it looks like your sweetheart is coming this way i glanced back to find micah walking slowly toward us normally he wouldnt have interrupted but we were on a deadline tonight time and theardeur wait for no man i would have explained that micah wasnt being rude that we had to go but i wasnt sure louie knew about theardeur and i hated to explain it to people who didnt know it always sounded so odd how long have you and micah been living together he asked about four months ronnie and you havent been hanging out much since he moved in with you have you i thought about it then said i guess not she didnt like that im still dating jeanclaude louie watched micah walking toward us his face looked thoughtful maybe that wasnt it what do you mean maybe it was having someone live with you maybe thats what she couldnt handle she said it was me dating a vamp ronnie said a lot of things he said voice softer less angry more puzzled he shook himself like a dog coming out of water and managed to give me a smile it left his eyes sad but it was a start maybe she just couldnt stand to see you committing yourself to somebody not that much i shrugged because i didnt think that was it but i couldnt blame him for thinking it i dont know he gave me that smile again his eyes like dark hopeless pools you go home anita and enjoy it i caught a glitter of tears before he turned away and looked out into the dark again i didnt know what to do was i supposed to hug him if it had been a girlfriend i probably would have but it wasnt he wasnt and i didnt need any more complications tonight i did the guy thing and patted him awkwardly on the back whether i would have worked up to a fullblown hug i dont know because micah was beside us sorry to interrupt but its been nearly an hour since we hit the parking lot it was his subtle way of reminding me that sometimes an hour was all we got from the time i squashed theardeur down to the time it resurfaced i took the hint with micah beside me i felt more secure if theardeur had risen hed have been there to see that nothing disastrous happened i slid my arm through louies arm and bumped my head against his shoulder come on louie well walk you to jasons car he nodded as if he didnt trust his voice and was careful not to look at either of us as we walked him toward the lights of the parking lot micah pretended that nothing was wrong i pretended that there were no tears to see i kept my hold on his arm all the way to where jason waited standing beside his car jason opened the passenger side door for louie giving me a questioning look over louies shoulder i started to shake my head but louie hugged me hugged me suddenly and fiercely so tight it took my breath away i thought hed say something but he didnt he just held on and i wrapped my arms around his back held him because i couldnt not hold him about the time i thought i was going to have to think of something to say he stepped back hed been crying while he held me but i hadnt felt a single sob nothing but the fierceness in his arms his hands and silent tears he blinked and gave micah an odd smile that was almost a sob how did you talk her into moving in with you i moved in with her he said voice very quiet very even a careful voice reserved for frightened children and overly emotional adults id heard that voice often enough aimed at me and she asked me lucky louie said and that one word sounded like it meant anything but lucky i know micah said and he put an arm around my shoulders and moved me just a little back from louie so there was room for him to get through the open car door louie nodded again too rapidly and too many times lucky he slid into the car and jason shut the door behind him jason leaned into me what just happened it wasnt my secret to tell but it felt like dirty pool sending jason to drive louie home without warning him its his secret to tell not mine im sorry but lets just say hes had a rough night louie knocked on the window the sound made both jason and me jump micah had either seen it coming or had better nerves than we did jason moved back enough so the door could open dont bother to whisper this close to the car i can hear you im sorry i said dont be its not like he didnt see the fight tell him so i dont have to and louie closed the door again he leaned his head back against the seat and more of those completely silent tears began to escape him we all looked away as if it were somehow shameful to watch i think wed have been less embarrassed if hed been undressed what is up jason said he proposed to ronnie and she said no jasons mouth dropped open just like mine had you are joking me i shook my head wish i was but they are like one of the happiest couples i know i shrugged i dont explain the news i just report it shit jason said he glanced back at his car and at louie ill get him home thanks jason gave me a shadow of his usual grin well cant send him home with you wouldnt that complicate the hell out of things what i asked micah kissed me on the side of the face theardeur rising with louie in the car speaking of which you guys go jason said well be okay i kissed him on the cheek quick and sisterly youre a braver man than i am gunga din he laughed thats not the original quote is it not exactly but its still true he looked suddenly serious again very unjasonlike i dont know if im brave or not but ill get him tucked in we have to go micah said he started leading me toward our jeep i kept looking back as jason went around the car and got in louie sat motionless head back from a distance you couldnt tell he was crying micah pulled me in against his body hugging me loosely to his side i leaned in against the solidness of him and slid my arm around his waist so that we finished the walk touching from chest to thigh i was glad he was with me glad we were driving home together glad that home meant both of us nathaniel was leaning against the side of the jeep watching us walk toward him he was leaning with his hands behind him so that his weight trapped his hands behind him pinned between his hips and the jeep it wasnt just intercourse that nathaniel hadnt been getting with me nathaniel had other needs that i was if possible even less comfortable with it made him feel peaceful to be tied up peaceful to be abused peaceful id asked him why he enjoyed it once and hed told me that it made him feel peaceful it made him feel safe how could being tied up make you feel safe how could letting someone hurt you even a little make you feel good i didnt get it i just didnt get it maybe if id understood it better id have been less afraid to go that last mile with him what if we had intercourse and it wasnt enough what if he just kept pushing pushing me to do things that i found frightening he was supposed to be the submissive and i was his dominant didnt that mean that i was in charge didnt that mean he did what i said no id had to learn enough to understand nathaniel and some of the other wereleopards because he wasnt the only one with interesting hobbies the submissive had a safe word and once they said that word all the play stopped so in the end the dominant had an illusion of power but really the submissive got to say how far things went and when they stopped id thought i could control nathaniel because he was so submissive but it was tonight that i realized the truth i wasnt in control anymore i didnt know what was going to happen with nathaniel or me or micah the thought terrified me so i thought about it really thought about it what if i found nathaniel a new place to live what if i found him a new place to be a new life i rolled it over in my mind as we walked across the pavement i thought about sending him home with someone else letting him weep on someone elses shoulder but more than that i thought about getting under the covers with only micah on one side and no one on the other side nathaniel had his side of the bed now i hadnt realized it until that second hadnt let myself realize it the three of us enjoyed readingtreasure island to each other for micah and me it was a revisiting of childhood favorites for the most part but for nathaniel most of the books were new to him hed never had anyone read to him before bedtime never had anyone share their books with him what kind of childhood is it without books stories to share i knew that hed had an older brother who died and a father who died and a mother who died that theyd died i knew but not how or when except that hed been young when it happened he didnt like talking about it and i didnt like seeing the look in his eyes when he did so i didnt push i didnt have a right to push if i wasnt his girlfriend i didnt have a right to push if i wasnt his lover i was only his nimirra and he didnt owe me his life story i thought about not having nathaniel in the bed not for feeding but not having him there to hear the rest of the story to hear what happened when jim realizes what a softhearted villain long john silver really is the thought of him not being there at that moment when we come to the end of the adventure was painful a wrenching kind of pain as if my stomach and my heart both hurt at the same time he opened the door and held it for me because this close to theardeur it wasnt always good that i was driving he held the door and was as neutral as he could be as i moved past him i didnt know what to do so i let him be neutral and i was neutral too but as i buckled my seat belt in place and he closed the door i realized that i would miss him not miss him because my life ran smoother with him than without him but i would simply miss him miss the vanilla scent of him on my pillow the warmth of his body on his side of the bed the spill of his hair like some tangled living blanket if i could have stopped my list there id have sent nathaniel to his room for the night he did still have a room where all his stuff stayed all his stuff but him but i couldnt stop the list there not and be honest hed cried when charlotte died incharlottes web i wouldnt have missed seeing him cry over a dead spider for anything it had been nathaniels idea that we could have a movie marathon of old monster flicks you have not lived until youve sat throughthe wolf man the curse of the werewolf andthe werewolf with a bunch of shapeshifters they had heckled the screen and thrown popcorn and howled sometimes literally at the movie version of what they knew all too well the wereleopards had all complained that at least werewolves had some movies that once youd named cat people the leopards didnt have any movies most of the werewolves had known about the version but almost no one had known about the original in we had another movie night planned where we were going to watch both versions i was sure wed spend the night complaining cheerfully at how far off both films were and get eerily silent when they hit close to home alright theyd be eerily silent and id watch them watching the screen i was looking forward to it i tried picturing the night without nathaniel no nathaniel coming and going out of the kitchen with popcorn and soda making people use coasters no nathaniel sitting on the floor next to my legs half the night spent with his head on my knee and the other half playing his hand up and down my calf it wasnt sexual he just felt better touching me the entire pard and pack felt better touching each other it was possible to be up close and personal without it being sexual it really was just not usually for me which brought me back to the problem at hand funny how the thinking led back to it tonight when theardeur finally surfaced what was i going to do i could exile nathaniel to his room legitimately because id need to feed tomorrow too i could save him like for dessert but wed both know that that wasnt it i wasnt saving him i was saving myself saving myself from what i wasnt sure but it was definitely about saving me and had nothing to do with saving nathaniel he didnt want to be saved no that wasnt true nathaniel already thought he had been saved id saved him id been treating him like a prince who needed to find his princess but that was all wrong nathaniel was the princess and he had been rescued by me as far as nathaniel was concerned i was the prince in shining armor i just needed to come across and then we could all live happily ever after trouble was i was no ones prince and no ones princess i was just me and i was all out of armor shiny or otherwise i just wasnt the fairytale type and i didnt believe in happily ever after the question was did i believe in happily for now if i could have answered that question then all the worry would have been ended but i couldnt answer it so as micah drove us toward home in the october dark i still didnt know what id do when theardeur finally rose for the night i didnt even know what the right thing to do was anymore wasnt right supposed to help people and wrong supposed to hurt people didnt you make the right choice because it was the right thing to do i always felt squeamish about praying to god about sex in any context but i prayed as we drove because i was out of options i asked for guidance i asked for a clue as to what was the best for everyone i didnt get an answer and i hadnt expected one i have a lot psychic gifts but talking directly to god is not one of them thank goodness read the old testament if you dont think its a scary idea but worse than no answer i didnt feel that peace that i usually get when i pray my cell phone rang it made me jump and my pulse was so thick in my throat that i couldnt answer right away a womans voice said anita anita are you there it was marianne she lived in tennessee and was the vargamor for the oak tree clan it was a very oldfashioned title and job basically she was the witch that helped them deal with their metaphysical problems most packs didnt have one anymore too oldfashioned maybe the new age stuff would bring it back into vogue she was also helping me cope with my abilities she was the only psychic i knew and trusted she knew the shapeshifters almost as well as i did in some ways better in some ways not but she was the closest thing i had to a mentor of late and i needed one marianne its great to hear your voice whats up my voice sounded breathy even to me i just got this overwhelming urge to call you whats wrong see shes psychic i wanted to explain everything but nathaniel was behind me in the car what was i supposed to do make him put his fingers in his ears and hum while i talked its a little awkward right now should i guess if you want she was quiet for a few moments and she wasnt guessing she was using either her own gifted intuition or she was drawing a card a tarot card that is im looking at the knight of cups here thats usually nathaniels card id been skeptical to say the least when marianne first got out a deck of cards to do a reading but they were eerily accurate at least in her hands when shed first started nathaniels card had been the page of cups a childs card or a least a very young person but of late hed been promoted knight of cups yeah thats it silence and i knew she was laying a spread shed actually tried to get me to use the cards to see if i had any abilities for divination but they were just pretty pictures to me my gifts lay elsewhere king of wands micah is with you too it wasnt a question yes i could picture her with her long gray hair tied back in a nononsense ponytail probably in one of her loose flowing gowns sitting crosslegged on the bed which is where shed have been this late she was slender and strong and her body didnt match her hair or the fact that she was closer to sixty than fifty the devil temptation you havent fed theardeur yet have you it used to creep me out that she could do this but id gotten used to it it was just something marianne could do she didnt hold it against me that i raised zombies and i didnt hold it against her that she could tell what was happening hundreds of miles away in fact sometimes like now it came in handy not yet the priestess you have a question for me yes youre not doing something silly like trying to choose between micah and nathaniel are you thanks a lot you cant blame me anita you do tend to complicate your life i sighed fine true but sort of and not exactly fine be cryptic not in the way you might mean i said finally so not dumping one for the other she said no well thats good she was quiet for longer this time ill stop guessing ive laid a reading she preferred to do a reading without knowing anything about the problem marianne felt that if you talked to much you influenced the person doing the reading i put you in the center queen of swords the past is the five of pentagrams being left out in the cold not getting your needs met deity is the six of cups which can be someone from your past coming back into your life someone you felt a strong connection with future is the knight of cups nathaniels card the mundane is the four of pentacles the miser holding on to things that no longer help your life run smoothly now well do the connecting cards she was quiet for a second or two while she thought or prayed or whatever she did to make the cards talk to her i understood everything but the six of cups so far connecting the mundane to the past is the lovers card something happened in your love life that made you be afraid of being hurt or giving up something or someone connecting the past to deity is the king of wands usually micahs card but it could be energy a male presence in your life connecting deity to the future is the two of swords you have a choice to make and you think its difficult but if you take off the blindfold you can see and you have what you need to do it connecting the future to the mundane is the knight of wands another man in your life you do draw a lot of male energy to you not on purpose i said hush im not finished overlaying the miser is the six of swords help unseen or help from a spiritual source overlaying the lovers is the four of rods the marriage card overlaying the out in the cold is the ten of pentacles happy prosperous home hmm the king of rods and the six of cups stand on their own but the two of swords has crossed with the queen of wands nathaniels card is crossed with the ten of cups a happy home true love the knight of wands is crossed by the devil temptation okay i get most of it but who is the knight of wands and why is he covered by temptation and who is the queen of wands i think the queen of wands is you im always the queen of swords maybe thats changing maybe youre coming into your power into yourself im already myself i said have it your way im trying to id say the lovers and the four of rods are your old fiancé in college that dumped you that experience led you to be the miser with your emotions you need to let that go your home was the five of pentacles cold but now its a happy prosperous home youre going to be offered up some difficult choices soon that has something to do with someone from your past i think micahs card is the message that hes helped you heal some of those old wounds because he bridges the past with deity hes a gift from deity dont be cheeky when the universe or god or goddess or whatever you choose to say gives you someone in your life that comes in and makes so much right so quickly be grateful be grateful instead of picking at it marianne knew me too well and the knight of wands someone new or someone old but youll be seeing them in a new light it will be a temptation but the wands represent power so it could be a temptation to use power or gain power rather than anything relationshipwise i dont need more temptation in my life marianne did you start a case tonight why i asked because i felt compelled to draw another card its the eight of swords a woman bound and blindfolded surrounded by swords a woman died tonight i try to avoid calling marianne in the middle of a murder case for a lot of reasons this was one of them it creeped me out and gave her nightmares five of rods there will be a lot of conflict on this one and more to die but the justice card says the guilty will be punished and it will work out but not without loss the eight of pentacles thats odd someone will be involved that was once your teacher someone older do you know who that would be i thought about it being dolph but that didnt sound right i dont know maybe they havent come into the situation yet but they will they will help you how sure are you that there will be more killings arent you sure of it she asked and she had that tone in her voice that said she was listening to voices i couldnt hear yeah i got that feeling trust your feelings anita ill try i said you must be almost home by now i didnt ask how she knew we were turning into the driveway she wouldnt really have been able to tell me psychic stuff wasnt big on a b c logic it was more like a to g leaps of logic with no road map as to how we got to g yeah were home micah blew me a kiss and got out of the jeep i heard nathaniel get out of the back they both closed the doors and left me in the suddenly dark car alone with the phone marianne spoke into the sudden silence oh one more thing the message i just got was you know what you need to do why are you asking me thats not my message to you you know i never mind you asking my advice i actually kind of like it who else have you been asking advice from i opened my mouth and closed it i prayed what im getting is that you usually only pray when youre out of other options that you like it might be nice if you prayed as something other than a last resort she said it so matteroffactly nothing big you prayed god cant talk to you so he left a message on your machine great i licked my suddenly dry lips and said it doesnt bother you that you just took a message from god for me well it wasnt from him directly he just sent it again utterly matteroffact no big deal marianne yes sometimes you creep me out she laughed you raise the dead and slay the undead and i frighten you put that way it sounded silly but it was still true lets just say that im glad you have your psychic powers and i have mine i feel guilty enough without knowing the future dont feel guilty anita follow your heart no it was the queen of rods not of cups so follow your power let it take you where you need to go trust yourself and trust those around you you know i dont trust anybody you trust me yeah but stop poking at it anita your heart is not a wound to be poked at to see if the scab is ready to come off you can be healed of that very old pain if youll just let it happen so everybody keeps telling me if all your friends are saying one thing and your heart is saying the same thing and only your fear is arguing then stop fighting im not good at giving up no id say that is the thing you are worst at giving up something that no longer serves a purpose or protects you or helps you isnt giving up at all its growing up i sighed i hate it when you make this much sense you hate it and you count on it yeah go inside anita go inside and make your choice ive said all i have to say now its up to you and i hate that most of all i said what she asked that you dont try and influence me not really you just report tell me my choices and let me go i offer guidance nothing more i know im hanging up now and youre going inside because you cant sleep out in the car the phone went dead before i could whine at her anymore marianne was right like usual i hated that she just gave me information and helped me think but wouldnt tell me what to do of course if shed tried to boss me around i wouldnt have tolerated it i made my own choices and when someone pushed me it just made me more determined to ignore them so marianne never pushed heres your information here are your choices now go be a grownup and make them i got out of the jeep and hoped i was grownup enough for this particular choice the living room was dark as i entered the house the only light was from the kitchen one or both of them had walked through the pitchdark living room and only hit a light switch when they went to the kitchen to check messages on the machine which was on the kitchen counter leopards eyes are better in the dark than a humans and micahs eyes were permanently stuck in kittycat mode he often walked through the entire house with no lights just drifting from room to room avoiding every obstacle gliding through the dark with the same confidence i used in bright light there was enough light from the kitchen so i too left the living room dark the white couch seemed to give off its own glow though i knew that was illusion made up of the reflective quality of the white white cloth i was pretty sure the men had both gone to change for the night most lycanthropes whatever the flavor preferred fewer clothes and micah didnt like dressing up i walked into the empty kitchen not because i needed to but because i wasnt ready to go to the bedroom i still didnt know what i was going to do the kitchen held a large dining room table now the breakfast nook on its little raised platform with its bay window looking out over the woods still held a smaller fourseater table four had been more chairs than i needed when i moved into this house now because we usually had at least some of the other wereleopards bunking over due to emergency or often just the need to be close to more of their group their pard we needed a sixseater table actually we needed a bigger one than that but it was all my kitchen would hold there was a vase in the middle of the table jeanclaude had sent me a dozen white roses a week after we started dating once we had sex hed added one red rose so it was actually thirteen one red rose like a spot of blood in a sea of white roses and white babys breath it certainly made a statement i smelled the roses and the red one had the strongest scent hard to find white roses that smelled good all i had to do was call jeanclaude he was fast enough to fly here before dawn id fed off of him before i could do it again of course that would simply be putting off the decision no it would be hiding i hated cowardice almost more than anything else and calling on my vampire lover in this instance was cowardice the phone rang i jumped back so hard that the roses rocked in their vase youd think i was nervous or guilty of something i got the phone on the second ring the voice on the other end was cultured a professors voice but it wasnt a professor teddy was over six feet and a serious weight lifter that he also had a very fine mind and was articulate had surprised me the first time id met him he looks like dumb muscle and talks like a philosopher he was also a werewolf richard had allowed the wolves that wanted to help to join the coalition anita this is teddy hey teddy whats up i am fine but gil is not he will be but right this moment we are in the emergency room of saint anthonys gil was the only werefox in town so he depended a great deal on the furry coalition as the local shapeshifters and even the local police had started calling it the coalition had originally been designed to promote better understanding and cooperation among the various animal groups but wed branched out to dealing with the human world to try and promote better understanding with them too one great big love fest what happened i asked car accident a man ran a red light weve got other victims in the emergency room that are still ranting at the man if gil had been human hed have been killed okay so he called the answering service and got your cell phone number and a policeman at the accident site noticed that gil was healing much faster than he should have been okay why do i think this is going somewhere bad gil was unconscious so someone called the number in his wallet marked in case of emergencies he has no family so it was the answering service number by the time i got to the hospital gil was handcuffed to a bed rail why the policeman who is still by his side says hes afraid gil will be dangerous when he wakes up shit that is illegal i said technically yes but the officer can at his discretion prevent harm from coming to the citizenry thats not what the cop said actually he said until i know what the fuck he is im just playing it safe i nodded even though he couldnt see me that sounds more like it so youre there to make sure he doesnt put gil in a safe house safe houses were really prisons for lycanthropes theyd been designed originally for new lycanthropes so you had someplace safe to go during your first few full moons it was a good idea since the first few moons could turn into a killing spree unless you had other shapeshifters to watch over you the newly furry spent a few full moons with no memory of what theyd done and very little human in them while they were in animal form the safe houses were a good idea in theory but in practice once you went in they never let you out you never had enough control to pass their tests and get out you were dangerous and would always be dangerous the aclu had begun the legal battles on grounds of illegal imprisonment without due process but so far they were still bad places to be sent the hospital seems worried that gil is dangerous and have mentioned that do you need a lawyer down there i have taken the liberty of calling the law firm that the coalition has on retainer im surprised its gone this bad this soon usually you need an attack to get them handcuffing people and talking safe house is there something youre not telling me he hesitated teddy i said his name the way my father used to say mine when he suspected i was doing something i shouldnt have been the emergency room staff are wearing full hazardous material gear youre joking i said i wish i were is everyone just panicking i believe so is gil still unconscious in and out well stay with him wait for the lawyer i cant come down tonight teddy im sorry that is not why i called i had one of those uhoh moments okay then why did you call there is another emergency that needs someone right now shit what one of the pack called he is at a bar he has had far too much to drink and he is fairly new are you saying hes going to lose control in the bar i fear so shit you keep saying that he said i know i know profanity doesnt solve anything teddy had started commenting on how much cussing i did him and my stepmother i cant come down teddy someone must the lawyer is not here and you know there is that little law on the books that they can sign an unconscious shapeshifter into a safe house if they deem him a danger i do not understand why everyone is panicking this badly but if i leave gil alone i think we will be trying to get him out of a place that has no bail i know i know i was really happy that richard had allowed the wolves to join the coalition they were the largest shifter population in town so the wolves came in handy to help man the phones and the emergencies the downside was that richard felt that if the pack were going to help then the pack could take advantage of the emergency service it sounded fair but since there were nearly six hundred werewolves in the area it had quadrupled our emergencies the wolves gave us enough person power to meet the demands it was a blessing and a problem all in one did the wolf call his brotherbrother was slang for the older more experienced werewolf that all the new wolves got they carried their number for emergencies he says he did and got no answer he sounded very fragile anita i fear that if he changes in the bar theyll call the police and theyll shoot him i finished it for him yes i sighed into the phone i take it you cant make this one either teddy said i cant but micah can micah came into the kitchen about that time he looked a question at me hed already changed out of the suit and knowing him hung it up he was wearing a pair of sweat pants and nothing else just the sight of him shirtless and padding barefoot across the floor made my heart go pitapat hed tied his hair back in a loose ponytail but i could forgive that when i could see the fine muscle of his chest and stomach his arms and shoulders looked like some weight lifting had gone into them but truthfully most of it was natural not all but most he was just shaped nicely anita are you still there i realized that teddy had been saying something and i hadnt heard him sorry teddy can you repeat that do you want me to give you the address of the bar or wait to talk to micah micah is right here i handed him the phone and he took it with raised eyebrows i explained as briefly as i could micah put his hand over the phone are you sure this is a good idea i shook my head almost sure its not but i cant take the run not with theardeur about to surface sometime in the next minute or the next two hours im stuck here until its fed i know but maybe nathaniel could go what go down to a bar in maybe a bad section of town and arm wrestle a werewolf so new he cant drink safely i shook my head nathaniel has many fine skills but this isnt one of them youre not really good at it either he said with a smile to soften the harsh truth i smiled back because he was sooo right no i could have done the hospital run and kept gil out of a safe house but i couldnt talk down the werewolf i could shoot him but not talk him down not if i dont know him micah got on the phone long enough to take the address and name of the bar down then hung up he looked at me face careful neutral with an edge of concern im okay with you and nathaniel being here alone for theardeur the question is are you okay with it i shrugged he shook his head no anita i need an answer before i leave i sighed you need to get there before the wolf loses it go well be alright he looked like he didnt believe me go i said its not just you im worried about anita i will do my best for nathaniel micah he frowned what does that mean it means what it says he didnt look happy with the answer if you wait around for me to say oh yes its fine that im going to feed theardeur and fuck nathaniel the wolf in question will have shapeshifted been shot by the cops and maybe taken some civilians with him before you even leave the house youre both important to me anita our pard is important to me what happens here tonight could change everything i swallowed hard because i suddenly didnt want to meet his eyes he touched my chin raised my face up to meet his gaze anita ill be good i said what does that mean im not sure but ill do my best and that is the best i can offer i wont really know what im going to do until theardeur rises sorry but thats the truth to say anything else would be a lie he took a deep breath that made his chest rise and fall nicely i guess ill have to settle for that what exactly do you want me to say i asked he leaned in and laid a gentle kiss against my lips we rarely kissed so chaste but this close to theardeur he was being careful i want you to say youll take care of this define take care of it he sighed again shook his head and stepped back ive got to get dressed are you taking your car or the jeep ill take my car you might get a call from the police for another body and your gear is all in the back of the jeep he smiled at me almost sadly and left to go get dressed he made a soft exclamation as he went around the corner he spoke in low voices with another man the cadence was wrong for nathaniel damian glided around the corner you must be very distracted not to have sensed me sooner he was right i was good at sensing the undead no vamp should have been able to get this close without me knowing especially not damian damian was my vampire servant as i was jeanclaudes human servant theardeur was jeanclaude and belle mortes fault something about their line had contaminated me but damian as my servant that was my fault i was a necromancer and apparently mixing necromancy with being a human servant had some unforeseen side effects one of them was standing across the kitchen staring at me with eyes the color of green grass humans didnt have eyes like that but apparently damian had because becoming a vamp doesnt change your original physical description it may pale you out lengthen some of the teeth but your hair and eye and skin color remain the same the only thing that was probably more vibrant was his hair red hair that hadnt seen the sun for hundreds of years so that it was almost the color of fresh blood a bright fresh scarlet all vamps are pale but damian started life with that milk and honey complexion that some redheads have so he was even paler than the norm or maybe it was the quality of his paleness like his skin had been formed of white marble and some demon or god had breathed life into that paleness oh wait i was that demon technically my power my necromancy made damians heart beat he was over a thousand years old and he would never be a master vampire if you arent a master then you need a master to give you enough power to rise from the grave not just the first night but every night sometimes people rise by accident with no master near and that is how you get revenants walking corpses little better than zombies but they take blood instead of meat and they dont rot little problems like that is why there are vampire laws about how you attack humans and how you dont break the laws and the vamps will kill you for it and thats in countries where vampires are still illegal in the united states where they have rights the vamps are more civilized if the police find out about the crime if they can keep it secret they take care of their own even if it means killing their own damian must have come straight from work because though he like most of the vamps fresh over from europe almost never wore jeans and tennis shoes he also didnt like dressing up as much as jeanclaude insisted on he was wearing a coat id seen before it was a deep pine green a frock coat like something out of the s but it was new designed to gape open to expose the pale gleam of his chest and stomach embroidery nearly covered the sleeves and lapels of the coat putting a little glitter of color near all that white skin the pants were black satin poofy like there was way more cloth there than was needed for damians slender legs he wore a wide green sash for a belt and a pair of black leather boots that folded over just above the knee so that the outfit was very piratey how was work i asked danse macabre is the hottest dance club in st louis he kept walking toward me gliding rather there was something about the way he looked at me that i didnt care for its the only place where people can go and dance with vampires of course its hot i looked at him concentrated and i knew he had fed tonight on some willing woman willing blood feeding was considered the same as willing sex just be of age and you could feed the undead and have bite marks to show your friends id ordered damian to only feed from willing victims and because of our bond together he could not disobey me necromancers of legend could boss around all types of undead and they had to do your bidding the only undead i could boss around were zombies and damian and frankly i found even that unsettling i didnt like to have that kind of control over anyone of course there was one kind of control that damian had over me i wanted to touch him when he entered a room i had an almost overwhelming urge to touch his skin it was part of what it meant to be master and servant this attraction to your servants this need to touch and tend to them was one of the reasons that most servants were treasured possessions i think it also kept even the craziest most evil of vamps from killing their servants out of hand for often a vamp didnt survive the death of his servant the bond was that close he walked around the table fingers trailing on the backs of the chairs and i am one of the vampires that they have been pressing their bodies up against all night hannah is still managing the club right oh yes i am merely a cold body to send into the crowd he was around the table now to the island that separated the working area of the kitchen from the rest of the room i am merely color like a statue or a drape thats not fair ive seen you work the crowd damian you enjoy the flirting he nodded as he came around the end of the island nothing separated us now but the fact that i was still leaning against the far cabinets and he had stopped at the end of the island the urge to close that distance to wrap my hands around his body was almost overwhelming it made my hands ache with the need and i ended with them pressed behind me pinned by my body the way nathaniel had leaned against the jeep earlier i enjoy the flirting very much he traced pale fingers along the edge of the island slowly tenderly as if he were touching something else but we are not allowed to have sex while we work though some of them beg for it the emerald of his eyes spread and swallowed his pupils so that he looked at me with eyes like green fire his power danced along my skin caught my breath in my throat my voice started out a little shaky but i gained firmness as i talked until the last was said in an almost normal voice youve got my permission to date or fuck or whatever you can have lovers damian and where would i take them he leaned against the island arms crossing over that expanse of pale chest what do you mean i have a coffin in your basement it is adequate but hardly romantic he could have said a lot of things that id expected but that wasnt one of them im sorry damian it never occurred to me you need a room dont you he gave a small smile a room to use for my lovers yes then i realized something you mean like bring strangers here people youve just picked up and have them like sleep over be at the breakfast table in the morning yes he said and i understood the look on his face now it was a challenge he knew i wouldnt like the thought of strangers coming into the house much less facing a strange woman that hed simply brought home to fuck first thing in the morning i had a tiny spurt of anger and that helped me think helped push back that need to touch him that had nothing to do with theardeur and everything to do with power i know you had a room at the circus maybe we could arrange something with jeanclaude so you could take lovers back there my home is here with you you are my master now i cringed a little at the master part i know that damian do you he pushed away from the island and came to stand just in front of me this close the power shivered between us it made him close his eyes and when he opened them they were still drowning emerald pools if you are my master then touch me my pulse was jumping in my throat like a trapped thing i didnt want to touch him because i wanted to touch him so badly in a way this was part of the attraction between jeanclaude and me as well what id taken for lust and new love was also partly vampire trickery a trick to bind the servant to the master and the master to the servant so that both served the other willingly joyfully it had bothered me when i first realized that part of what i felt for jeanclaude was somehow tainted with vampire mind games though it wasnt on purpose from jeanclaudes point of view he couldnt help how it worked on me any more than i could help how it worked on damian he was standing so close i had to crane my neck backward to see his face clearly i want to touch you damian but youre acting awfully funny tonight funny he said he moved in so close that the edges of his coat the poofy satin of his pants brushed the thick cloth of my tuxedo pants funny i dont feel funny anita he leaned his face close to mine and whispered his next words i feel halfcrazed all those women touching me rubbing themselves against me pressing their warm he leaned in so that his hair brushed my cheek soft his breath felt hot against my skin wet his lips touched my cheek and i shuddered bodies against me my breath shook on its way out and my pulse was suddenly loud in my ears it was hard to concentrate on anything but the feel of his lips against my cheek though all his lips were doing was resting lightly against my skin i swallowed hard enough that it hurt and said you could have gone with any one of them he laid his cheek against mine but it meant he had to bend over more which moved his body farther from mine compromise and could i trust that their windows were proof against sunlight he stood up and put a hand on either side of the cabinet behind me so that i was trapped between his arms could i trust that they would not harm me once the sun rose and i lay helpless i tried to think of something to say something helpful something that would help me to think about something other than how much i wanted to touch him when in doubt be bitchy im getting a crick in my neck with you standing this close my voice was only a little breathy when i said it good damian put his hands around my waist and just the solid feel of his hands around me stopped whatever else i meant to say it stopped him for a moment too made him bend his head down eyes closed as if he were trying to concentrate or clear his mind then he lifted me suddenly and sat me on the edge of the counter it caught me off guard and he had put his hips between my knees before i could react we werent pressed together except for his hands on my waist but we were one step away from it there he said voice hoarse now you can see me better he was right but it hadnt been what i meant him to do i wanted breathing space and instead my hands were free and he was a hard thought away my hands came to rest on his arms and even through the heavy material of his coat i could feel the solidness of him it was as if my hands had a mind of their own i traced up the line of his arms found his shoulders and ended with my hands on the broadness of those shoulders with his hair tickling along the back of my hands there was something about my hands on his shoulders or the silk of his hair on my skin that made me bend toward him i wanted a kiss simple as that it seemed wrong to be this near and not touch him he bowed his head toward mine his eyes were like deep green pools deep enough to drown in he whispered you have but to tell me stop and i will stop i didnt say stop i slid my hands to the smooth pale line of his neck and the moment i touched his bare skin with mine i was calmer i could think again that was his gift to me as my servant he helped me be calmer more in control when i was touching him it was almost impossible for me to lose my temper he lowered my blood pressure helped me think i cupped his face between my hands because i wanted to touch him but what i gained from his centuries of controlling his own emotions was that when he put his lips against mine i was not lost not overwhelmed unless i wanted to be overwhelmed it wasnt that i felt nothing because it wasnt possible to be enfolded in damians arms pressed against his chest have his lips caressing mine and be unmoved youd have had to be made of stone not to melt into that embrace just a little but as id gained calmness from him he had begun to gain back the passion that hed lost over the centuries a passion not just for sex but any strong emotion because the master that made him tolerated no strong emotion save fear shed beat everything else out of him over more centuries than most vampires ever survived he drew back enough to see my face youre calm why are you calm i feel crazed and you give me peaceful eyes he grabbed my upper arms and dug his fingers in until it hurt and i still felt calm it is cruel fate that makes you calmer and calmer the more we touch and drives me more and more wild he gave me a small shake his face raw with emotion i am being punished and i have done nothing wrong its not punishment damian and even my voice was low and calm jeanclaude says that if you wished you could gain calm only when you needed it that you could touch me and enjoy touching me but not be trapped behind this mask his fingers were digging in so hard i was bruising youre hurting me damian my voice was still calm but there was an edge of heat to it an edge of anger at least you feel something when i touch you let go of my arms damian and just like that he released me let me go as if my arms had grown hot to the touch because he could not disobey a direct order from me whatever that order might be take a step back damian give me some room i was angry now even with the rest of his body touching me when he did what i told him and was no longer touching me at all the anger filled me up and spilled over my skin like heat god it felt good i was used to being angry i liked it not the most positive thing to say but still true i started to rub my arms where hed squeezed then stopped i didnt like letting anyone know how much theyd hurt me i didnt mean to hurt you he said and he was holding his own arms i thought for a moment he was feeling my pain then realized he was hugging himself to keep from touching me no you just want to fuck me thats not fair he said he was right it wasnt fair but i didnt care without him touching me i could be as unfair as i wanted to be i wrapped my anger around myself i fed it with every petty impulse id fought for days i should have remembered that one control is much like another that if you throw away one kind of control it makes other kinds harder to hold on to i unleashed my anger like youd unleash a rabid dog it roared through me and i remembered a time when my rage had been the only warmth i allowed in my life when my anger had been my solace and my shield get out damian just go to bed dont do this anita please he held his hand out to me would have touched me but i moved back just out of reach go now and with that he couldnt help himself id given him a direct order he had to obey he walked out tears glittering in his green eyes he passed nathaniel in the doorway nathaniel gave me neutral eyes a careful face micah had to go i nodded because i didnt trust my voice i hadnt let myself get this angry in so long it had felt good for a few moments but i was already beginning to regret how id treated damian he hadnt asked to be my servant the fact that id done it accidentally didnt make it any more right he was an adult person and id just ordered him to bed like he was a naughty child he deserved better than that anyone did the anger pulled back and even my skin felt cooler the termhot with anger was very real i was ashamed of what id just done i understood why in part i so did not need another man tied to me by metaphysics that demanded a piece of my bed or at least my body i didnt need that i especially didnt need a man who might not even be capable of feeding theardeur because even in the middle of the worst of theardeur damians touch could cool that fire with him holding my hand theardeur could not rise or at least it could be put away for hours so why didnt i paste damian to my body because of how much more he wanted from me than i was comfortable with giving i could not use him to help me fight theardeur if i wasnt willing to give in to that skin hunger we both felt for each other nathaniel padded into the room wearing nothing but a pair of silky jogging shorts they were his version of jammies hed taken his braid out so that his thick hair spilled around him like some kind of cape are you alright i started to say i owe damian an apology but i didnt say it because in that one breath theardeur rose no not rose engulfed drowned suffocated i suddenly couldnt breathe past the pulse in my throat my skin felt thick and heavy with it i dont know what showed in my eyes but whatever it was it stopped nathaniel where he stood froze him like a rabbit in the grass that knows the fox is near theardeur spilled outward like invisible water hot wet and suffocating i knew when the power hit nathaniel because he shivered goose bumps broke on his body as his very skin reacted to the power id shoved theardeur down once tonight and that had a price id refused the touch of my servant and that had a price id embraced my anger and let it spill out onto someone i cared about that had a price too i didnt want nathaniel to be the one who paid that price i didnt remember crossing the room but i must have because i was standing in front of him his eyes were wide so wide his lips halfparted i was close enough to see the pulse in his throat beating against the skin of his neck like a trapped thing i leaned in toward him leaned just my face until i could smell the warm vanilla scent of his neck close enough to taste his pulse on my tongue like candy and i knew this candy would be red and soft and hot i had to close my eyes so that i didnt lean my mouth down to that point didnt lick over his skin didnt bite down and free that quivering piece of him i had to close my eyes so i wouldnt keep staring at that pulsing jumping my own pulse was too fast as if i would choke on it id thought that feeding theardeur on nathaniel was the worst i could do but the thoughts in my head werent about sex they were about food thanks to my ties with jeanclaude and richard i had darker things inside me than theardeur dangerous things deadly things i stayed perfectly still trying to master my own pulse my own heartbeat but even with my eyes closed i could still smell nathaniels skin sweet and warm and close i felt his breath on my face before i opened my eyes he had moved in so close that his face filled my vision my voice came soft halfstrangled with the needs i was fighting nathaniel please he whispered it as he leaned in whispered it again as his mouth hovered above mine he sighed please against my lips his breath felt hot against my mouth as if it would burn when we kissed his lips this close to mine had done one thing i wasnt thinking about ripping his throat out anymore i understood then that we could feed on sex or we could feed on meat and blood i knew that one hunger could be turned into another but until that moment where i could almost taste his lips on mine i hadnt realized that there would come a point wheresomething must be fed i did not feed jeanclaudes blood lust though there was a shadow of it in me i did not feed richards beast with its hunger for meat but that lived in me too i held so many hungers in me and fed none of them except theardeur that i could feed that i did feed but it was in that heartbeat as nathaniel kissed me that i understood why i hadnt been able to control theardeur better all the hungers channeled into that one hunger jeanclaudes fascination with the blood that ran just under the skin richards desire for fresh bloody meat i had pretended i didnt carry their hungers inside me not really but i did theardeur had risen to give me a way to feed a way that didnt tear peoples throats out a way that didnt fill my mouth with fresh blood nathaniel kissed me he kissed me and i let him because if i drew back from it fought it there were other ways to feed other ways that would leave him bleeding and dying on the floor his lips were like heat against my skin but part of me wanted something hotter part of me knew that blood would be like a scalding wave in my mouth i had a sudden image so strong that it made me stumble back from him made me push away from that warm firm flesh i felt my teeth sinking into flesh through hair that was rough and choking on my tongue but i could feel the pulse underneath that skin feel it like a frantic thing the pulse running from me like the deer had run through the forest the deer was caught but that sweet beating thing lay just out of reach i bit harder shearing through the skin with teeth that were made for tearing blood gushed into my mouth hot scalding because the deers blood ran hotter than mine their warmth helped lead me to them helped me hunt them the heat of their blood called me to them made their scent run rich on every leaf they passed every blade of grass that brushed them carried that warmth away betrayed them to me my teeth closed around the throat tore the front of it free blood sprayed out over me and the leaves a sound like rain i swallowed the blood first scalding from the chase and then the meat that still held the last flickering of pulse a last beat of life the meat moved in my mouth as it went down as if it were struggling even now to live i came back to the kitchen on my knees screaming nathaniel reached out toward me and i slapped at his hands because i didnt trust myself to touch him i could still taste the meat the blood feel it going down richards throat it wasnt horror that made me slap at nathaniel it was that i had liked it gloried in the feel of blood raining down on me the struggles of the animal had excited me made the kill all the sweeter always when i touched richard there had been hesitation regret revulsion about what he was but there had been no hesitation in that shared vision he had been the wolf and he had brought the deer down taken its life and there had been no regret his beast had fed and for this one moment the man in him had not cared i shut down every shield i had between him and me and it was only then that i felt him look up felt him raise his bloody muzzle and look as if he could see me watching him he licked his bloody lips and the only thought i had from him was good it was good and there was more and he would feed i couldnt seem to cut myself off from him couldnt shut it down i did not want to feel him sink teeth into the deer again i did not want to be in his head for the next bite i reached out to jeanclaude reached out for help and found blood his mouth was locked on a throat fangs buried into that flesh i smelled that flesh knew that scent knew it was jason hispomme de sang that he held clasped in his arms clasped tighter than you hold a lover because a lover does not struggle a lover does not feel their death in your kiss the blood was so sweet sweeter than the deers had been sweeter cleaner better and part of that better was the feel of his arms locked around us holding us as tight as we held him part of what made this more was the embrace the feel of jasons heart beating inside his chest beating against the front of our bodies so that we could feel the franticness of it as the heart began to realize something was wrong and the more frightened it got the more blood it pumped the more of that sweet warmth poured down our throats all i could taste was blood all i could smell was blood it spilled down my throat and i couldnt breathe i was drowning drowning in jasons blood the world had run red and i was lost a pulse a pulse in that red darkness a pulse a heartbeat that found me that brought me out two things came to me at once i was lying on cool tile and that someone had me by the wrist their hand on my wrist i opened my eyes and found nathaniel kneeling beside me his hand on my wrist the pulse in the palm of his hand beat against the pulse in my wrist it was as if i could feel the blood running up his arm smell it almost taste it i rolled closer to him curled my body around his legs laid my head upon his thigh he smelled so warm i kissed the edge of his thigh and he opened his legs for me let my face slip between them so that the next kiss was against the smooth warmth of his inner thigh i licked along that warm warm skin he shuddered and his pulse sped against mine the pulse in the palm of his hand pushing against the pulse in my wrist as if his heartbeat wanted inside me but it wasnt his heartbeat that he wanted inside me a roll of my eyes and i could see him swollen and tight against the front of his shorts i licked up the line of his thigh licked closer and closer to that thin line of satin that stretched over the front of his body i tasted his pulse against my lips but it wasnt an echo from his hand my mouth was over the pulse in his inner thigh he let go of my wrist as if now we didnt need it we had another pulse another sweeter place to explore i could smell the blood just under his skin like some exotic perfume i pressed my mouth over that quivering heat kissed the blood just under his skin licked the jumping thud of his pulse just a quick flick of my tongue it tasted like his skin sweet and clean but it also tasted of blood sweet copper pennies on my tongue i bit him lightly and he cried out above me i slid hands over his thigh held it tight so that the next bite was harder deeper his meat filled my mouth for a second and i could taste the pulse under his skin knew that if i bit down that blood would pour into my mouth that his heart would spill itself down my throat as if it wanted to die i stayed with my teeth around his pulse fought with myself not to bite down not to bring that hot red rush i could not let go and it was taking everything i had not to finish it i reached down those metaphysical cords that bound me to jeanclaude and richard i had a confusing image of meat and viscera and other bodies crowding close the pack was feeding i shoved that image away because it wanted me to bite down richards muzzle was buried deep into the warmth of the body buried in the sweet things inside i had to run from those feelings before i fed on nathaniel the way they were feeding on the deer i found jason lying pale on jeanclaudes bed bleeding on the sheets jeanclaudes blood thirst was quenched but there were other hungers he looked up at me as if he could see me his eyes were drowning blue and i felt it theardeur had risen in him risen in a wave of heat that left him staring down at jasons still form with thoughts that had nothing to do with blood he spoke his voice echoing through me i must shut you out ma petite something is wrong tonight you will force me to do things i do not wish to do feed theardeur ma petite choose its flame before another hunger comes and carries you away with that he was gone gone as if a door had slammed shut between us i had a moment to realize that hed slammed a door between not just himself and me but between richard and me as well so that i was suddenly cut adrift i was alone with the feel of nathaniels pulse in my mouth his flesh was so warm so warm and his pulse beat like something alive inside his skin i wanted to free that struggling quivering thing i wanted to break it free of its cage to free nathaniel of this cage of flesh to set him free i fought not to bite down because some part of me knew that if i once tasted blood that i would feed i would feed and nathaniel might not survive it a hand grabbed mine grabbed mine and held on i knew who it was before i raised my face from nathaniels thigh damian knelt beside us his touch helped me get to my knees helped me think at least a little but theardeur didnt go away it pulled back like the ocean drawing back from the shore but it didnt leave and i knew it would come back another wave was building and when it crashed over us we needed a plan somethings wrong i said and my voice shook i held on to damians hand like it was the last solid thing in the world i felt theardeur rise and i thought great just great left out again then it changed it felt wonderful nathaniels voice came distant and dreamy as if all hed been having was good foreplay didnt you feel it change i asked yes he said werent you afraid no he said i knew you wouldnt hurt me im glad one of us was so sure he raised up onto his knees from where hed half swooned trust yourself trust what you feel it changed when you tried to fight it stop fighting it he leaned in toward me let me be your food i shook my head and clung to damians hand but it was as if i could feel the tide rushing back toward the shore feel the wave building building and when it came it would sweep us away i didnt want to be swept away if jeanclaude told you to feed theardeur then feed it damian said what i felt from you just now was closer to blood lust his face was very serious sorrowful even you dont want to know what blood lust can make you do anita you dont want that why is it different tonight it was a child asking someone to explain why the monster under the bed has grown a new and scarier head i dont know but i do know that for the first time when you touch me i feel it a dim echo but i feel it always before anita when you touched me it went away he made a movement with his fingers like putting out a candle snuffed out tonight he leaned over my hand and i knew he was going to lay his lips across my knuckles one of the gifts of theardeur is that it lets you look inside someones heart it lets you see what they truly feel when his lips touched my skin i felt what damian was feeling satisfaction eagerness worry but that was fast fading under the feel of his lips on my skin he wanted he wanted me he wanted to feed the hunger of his skin the hunger of his body not so much for orgasm but for that need to be held close and tight that need we all have to press our nakedness against someone elses i felt his loneliness and his need even if it was only for one night not to be lonely not to be exiled down in the dark alone i saw how he felt about his coffin down in the basement it was not his room it was not his in any way it was just the place he went to die every dawn the place where he went to die alone knowing that he would rise as he had died alone i saw the endless stream of women that he had fed on like pages in a book a blonde a brunette the one with a tattoo on her neck dark skin pale skin the one with blue hair an endless stream of necks and wrists and their eager eyes and grasping hands and nearly every night it was in public view as part of the floor show at danse macabre so that even his feedings were not private even that was not special it was eating so you wouldnt die with no meaning to it in the center of his being was a great emptiness i was supposed to be his master i was supposed to take care of him and i hadnt known i hadnt asked and id been so busy trying not to be tied to another man through some weird metaphysical shit that i hadnt noticed that damians life sucked im sorry damian i i dont know what i would have said because his fingers touched my lips and i couldnt think his fingers held heat and weight that theyd never had before his eyes widened surprised i think as surprised as i was at the sensation or did my lips give heat to his skin too did my lips suddenly feel swollen and eager as his fingertips did to me as if both mouth and fingers were suddenly more i moved my lips against his touch barely a movement just enough to press my mouth against the ripeness of his fingers barely enough to call it a kiss but it wasnt his skin i tasted or not the skin i was touching it was as if i laid my mouth against the most intimate parts of him there was the hard solid press of his fingers but the taste the smell of him was the perfume of lower things as if i were a dog on the scent of where i wanted to be he drew his breath in with a shaking gasp and when i rolled my eyes up to see his face the look in his eyes was one of drowning as if i already touched what i could taste his eyes filled with emerald fire and just like that there was a line of desire carved from my mouth down his fingers his hand his arm his chest his hips to the center of his body i could feel him thick and rich and full of blood could taste the warmth of him as if my mouth were nestled against his groin i could taste him feel him and when i slipped my mouth over the tips of his fingers slid something so much smaller harder into my mouth his green eyes rolled back into his head ginger lashes fluttering downward his breath sighed out in one word master i knew he was right in that one moment i knew because i remembered being on the other side of such a kiss jeanclaude could push desire through me as if his kiss were a finger drawn across my body down my very nerves so that he touched things that no hand or finger could ever caress for the first time i felt the other side of such a touch felt what jeanclaude had felt for years hed tasted my most intimate parts long before hed ever been allowed to touch them or even see them i felt what hed felt and it was wondrous nathaniel touched my hand i think id actually forgotten about him forgotten about anything but the sensation of damians flesh against mine then nathaniel touched me and i could feel his body through the palm of my hand as if a line ran from the pulse in my palm down his body in a long line of heat and desire and power i felt that power flare outward from my mouth and hand to their bodies it was my power the power jeanclaude had woken in me by his marks but it was also my power my necromancy that burned like some cold fire through damians body but when it hit nathaniels body the power changed shifted became something warm and alive in the blink of an eye the power flared through me through all of us but it wasnt sex that i felt anymore it was pain i was trapped between ice and fire a cold so intense that it burned and the fire burned because that was what it was it was as if half the blood in my body had turned to ice so that nothing flowed and i was dying and the other half of my body held blood that was molten like melted gold and my skin could not hold it i was melting dying i screamed and the men screamed with me it was the sound of nathaniel and damian their screams not my own that dragged some part of me above the pain that one blinded aching part knew that if i let this consume me we would all die and that was not acceptable i had to find a way to ride this to control this or we would be destroyed but how do you control something that you dont understand how do you ride something you cant see or even touch i realized in that moment that i touched nothing that somewhere in the pain id let go of both of them my skin was empty of their touch but the link between us was still there one of us or all of us had tried to save ourselves by letting go but this was not a magic so easily defeated i knelt alone on the floor touching no one and nothing but i could feel them feel their hearts in their chests as if i could have reached out my hand and carved those warm beating organs from their bodies as if their flesh was water to me the image was so strong so real that it made me open my eyes helped me ride down the pain nathaniel was half crouched his hand reaching out to me as if id been the one who pulled away his eyes were closed his face screwed tight with pain damian knelt pale face empty if i hadnt been able to feel his pain i wouldnt have known that his blood was turning to ice nathaniels hand touched mine like a child groping in the dark but the moment his fingers brushed me the burning began to fade i gripped his hand and it didnt hurt anymore it was still hot but it was the beating pulse of life as if the heat of a summers day filled us the other half of my body was still so cold it burned i took damians hand and the moment we touched that too ceased to hurt the magic for lack of a better term flowed through me the chill of the grave and the heat of the living and i knelt in the middle like something caught between life and death i was a necromancer i was caught between life and death always i remembered death the smell of my mothers perfume hypnotique the taste of her lipstick as she kissed me goodbye the sweet powdery scent of her skin i remembered the feel of smooth wood under small hands my mothers coffin the clove scent of carnations from the grave blanket there was a bloodstain on the car seat and an oval of cracks in the windshield i laid a tiny hand on that dried blood and remembered the nightmares afterward where the blood was always wet and the car was dark and i could hear my mother screaming the blood had been dry by the time i saw it she had died without me ever saying goodbye and i had not heard her screams shed died almost instantly and probably hadnt screamed at all i remembered the feel of the couch rough and knobbly and it smelled musty because after mommy went away nothing got cleaned in that moment i knew it wasnt my memory my fathers german mother had moved in and kept everything spotless but i was still small and hugging the side of that musty couch in a room id never known where the only light was the flickering of the television screen there was a man a huge dark shadow of a man and he was beating a boy beating him with the buckle end of a belt he kept saying scream for me you little bastard scream for me blood spurted from the boys back and i screamed i screamed for him because nicholas would never scream i screamed for him and the beating stopped i remembered the feel of nicholas spooning the back of my body stroking my hair if anything happens to me promise me youll run away nicholas promise me nathaniel promise me i promise nicky sleep and the only safety i ever knew because if nicholas watched over me the man couldnt hurt me nicholas wouldnt let him the images broke then shattering like a mirror that had been hit glimpses the man looming up and up the first blow falling to the carpet blood on the carpet my blood nicholas in the doorway with a baseball bat the bat hitting the man the man silhouetted against the light from that damned television the bat in his hands blood spraying the screen nicholas screaming run nathaniel run running running through the yards a dog on a chain barking snarling running running falling down beside a stream coughing blood darkness i remembered battle swords and shields and chaos and try as i might chaos was all i could see a mans throat exploding in a bright gush of blood the feel of my blade hacking so deep that it numbed my arm the force of running headlong into someone elses shield with my own being forced back down narrow stone steps and over all that was a fierce joy an utter contentment battle was what we lived for everything else was just biding time familiar faces swam into view blue eyes green blond and redhaired all like me the feel of a ship under me and a gray sea running white with the wind a dark castle on a lonely shore there had been fighting there i knew that but that was not the memory i got what i saw was a narrow stone stairway that wound up and up into a dark tower torchlight flickered on those stairs and there was a shadow we ran from that shadow because terror rode before it the gate crashed down trapped against it we turned and made our stand the crushing fear until you could not breathe many dropped their weapons and simply went mad at the touch of it the shadow stepped out into the starlight and it was a woman a woman with skin white as bone lips red as blood and hair like golden spiderwebs terrible she was and beautiful though it was a beauty that would make men weep rather than smile but she smiled that first curve of those red red lips that first glimpse of teeth that no mortal mouth would hold confusion then the feel of small white hands like white steel and her eyes her eyes like gray flames as if ashes could burn the images jumped and damian was lying in a bed with that terrible beauty riding him his body was filling up about to spill over and into her riding the edge of pleasure when she changed it with a flex of her will as a flex of her thighs could give pleasure a thought and he was drowning in fear a fear so great and so awful that it shriveled him tore him back from pleasure threw him close to madness then it would pull back like the ocean pulling away from the shore and she would begin again over and over over and over pleasure terror pleasure and terror until he begged her to kill him when he begged she would let him finish let him ride pleasure to its conclusion but only if he begged a voice broke through the memories shattered it anita anita i blinked and i was still kneeling between nathaniel and damian it was damian that had called my name no more he said nathaniel was crying and shaking his head please anita no more why are you blaming me for the tour down bad memory lane because youre the master damian said so its my fault were reliving the worst events of our lives i searched his face while i kept a tight grip on his hand it wasnt erotic anymore it was more like their hands were safety lines you are the master damian repeated maybe its over whatever it was maybe its finished he gave me a look that was so like one of jeanclaudes that it was unnerving whats with the look i asked i can still feel it nathaniel said and his voice was hushed thick with fear if you would stop arguing and start paying attention to whats happening youd feel it too damian said and he wasnt talking to nathaniel i shut my mouth it was the best i could do for not arguing but even silence was enough into that brief silence i felt power like something large had pushed against a door in my head a door that would not hold for long how did you break us free of it this much im not a master but i am over a thousand years old ive learned some skills over the years just to stay sane alright mr smartievampire whats happening to us he squeezed my hand and something in his eyes said plainly that he didnt want to say it out loud i realized that i couldnt feel his emotions youre shielding us all arent you he nodded but it wont hold what is it whats happening to us why are we sharing memories its a mark i frowned at him what marks were metaphysical connections i shared them with both jeanclaude and richard i dont know what number but its a mark its not the first maybe not even the second maybe the third ive never had a human servant or an animal to call ive never been part of a triumvirate you have so you tell me us nathaniel said in that breathy scared voice i looked into those wide lavender eyes he was waiting for me to make this better the problem was i didnt know how i didnt know how it had begun so how could i end it i turned away from the utter trust in his face because i couldnt think looking into his eyes i tried to think back to the third mark there had been a sharing of memories but it had been benign glimpses of jeanclaude feeding on perfumed wrists sex with women wearing way too many undergarments richard running in wolf form in the forest the rich world of scent that he had in that form they had all been sensual but safe memories it had never occurred to me to ask either of them what memories theyd gotten from me i probably didnt want to know third mark i think though with jeanclaude in charge it was just flashes of memory mostly sensual nothing too serious why are we trapped in therapy hell what did you think of just before the memories began damian asked death i said i was thinking about death i dont know why then think of something else quickly his voice held a hint of panic and i could feel why i could feel that door in my head beginning to bow outward as if it were melting i knew that when it went we better have a plan i didnt try to mark anybody i said do you know how to stop it he asked no i said then think of something else something better think happy thoughts nathaniel said i gave him a look who do i look likepeter pan what damian asked yes i mean no but think nathaniel said think happy thoughts think like you need to fly i survived what happened after after nicholas died but i do not want to live through it twice please anita think happy thoughts why dont one of you think happy thoughts i asked because youre the master not us damian said your mind your attitudes your desires are what will rule how this goes not ours but for gods sake stop thinking about the worst things that ever happened to you because i dont want to see the worst that i remember nathaniels right think happy thoughts happy thoughts nathaniel said and he wrapped both his hands around one of mine please anita happy thoughts i am fresh out of pixie dust i said pixie dust damian said but he shook his head i dont know what you are talking about just think of something pleasant happy anything anything at all i tried to think happy i thought about my dog jenny who had died when i was fourteen and crawled out of the grave a week after she died crawled out of the grave and into bed with me i remembered the weight of her the smell of fresh turned earth and ripe flesh no damian screamed he jerked me to face him his eyes wild no i will not see what comes next in my story i will not he grabbed my upper arms and turned me to face him shaking me nathaniel wrapped himself around my waist huddling around my body damian said dont you have any good memories it was like one of those games where they tell you not to think of something or to think of something i was supposed to think of good things and for the life of me everything ended badly my mother had been wonderful but shed died id loved my dog but shed died id loved richard but hed dumped me i thought id loved someone once in college but hed dumped me i thought about the feel of micahs body but i was waiting for him to dump me too nathaniel hugged me tighter his face buried against my back please anita please happy thoughts fly for me anita please god fly for me i touched his arm his hand and thought of the vanilla scent of his hair thought of his face alive and listening as micah read to us i still thought micah would go from prince charming to the big bad wolf no anthropomorphic bias intended but nathaniel would never dump me there were moments when the thought of having nathaniel with me forever panicked the hell out of me but i forced that worry down pushed it away i concentrated on the feel of him and as if he felt my thoughts he began to relax against me he came to his knees behind me his arms still around my waist spooning our bodies together he leaned his face over my shoulder and i caught the sweet scent of his skin i had my happy thought i wouldnt fly because nathaniel had asked me to i would fly because of nathaniel i laid a kiss against his cheek and he wound himself around the back of my body rubbing his cheek against the side of my face my neck damian still held my arms in his hands but loosely now he stared down at both of us i take it you found a happy thought i breathed in that clean vanilla scent and gazed up at damian yes my voice was already thick with the scent of skin and the sensation of nathaniels body against mine i thought its like hes a living comfort object like a teddy bear or a penguin but even as i thought that i knew it was only partial truth my stuffed toy penguin sigmund had never kissed my neck and never would it was one of sigmunds charms he didnt make many demands on me that door in my mind was melting like a block of ice left in the sun panic fluttered in my chest and i knew that panic would be a bad emotion to take behind that melting door i pulled damian down to us and whispered kiss me his lips touched mine and the door vanished but we didnt get memories this time we got theardeur for the first time i embraced it called it pet names and did the metaphysical equivalent of saying come and get me come and get us id never embraced theardeur before id been overwhelmed by it conquered by it given in to it but never lowered my flag and surrendered to it not without at least a fight jeanclaude had told me that if i could only stop fighting it wouldnt be so terrible that once a little control was gained you needed to make friends with the power id given him a look and hed dropped the subject but he was right and he was wrong for him i think it would have been a seduction but it was me and the fact that i could still think while it was happening was a problem more than a blessing i was okay with my tuxedo jacket going byebye i was okay with damians green coat sliding to the floor even if it did leave his upper body pale and naked with the fine muscles gliding under skin the color of fresh white sheets nathaniel was the problem or rather my confusion about him i ran my hands up the unbelievable warmth of his skin but the look in his lavender eyes was too much i did not love nathaniel not the way i needed to but the look in his eyes left no doubt how he felt about me this was wrong i could not take this from him if he were in love with me and i was not in love with him i could not do it i pulled my hands away shaking my head damian was molded against my back but the moment i pulled away from nathaniel his eager hands slowed shit he whispered and leaned his face against the top of my head nathaniels eyes went from shining with love to something darker older he put his hands on either side of my face cradling me dont pull away he said i have to if its not sex it will be blood anita cant you feel it damian asked i could feel something it was as if this time it was i who put up the shields but there was still something large and frightening on the other side something that i had put in process but not on purpose something that was hungry it didnt care what it fed on but it would eventually feed on something damians hands were still on my shoulders but hed leaned his body back enough so we no longer touched anywhere else anita please i turned in nathaniels hands so that i could glimpse damians face its wrong damian the sex or who the sex is with he asked i took a breath to answer him but nathaniels hands closed round my face he turned me back to look at him and i was suddenly almost painfully aware of the strength in his hands a strength that could have crushed my face rather than cradled it he was so submissive that he rarely reminded me of how very strong he was how dangerous he could have been if hed been a different person i started to say let go of me nathaniel but only got as far as let go before he kissed me the feel of his lips on mine stopped my words froze my mind i couldnt think couldnt think about anything but the velvet feel of his mouth on mine then something seemed to break inside of him some barrier and his tongue thrust into my mouth as deep and far as it could go the sensation of him thrusting that much of himself that deeply into me tore my shields away and since no one else was fighting theardeur roared back to life it roared back to life on the edge of nathaniels lips his hands his need there was a confusion of ripping cloth buttons snapping and raining down on us hands hands everywhere and the sound of clothing ripping my body jerked with the force of my clothes being ripped away and my hands were ripping at their clothes it was as if every inch of my skin craved every inch of their skin i needed to feel their nakedness glide over mine my skin felt like a starved thing as if i hadnt touched anyone in ages i knew whose skin hunger i was channeling it wasnt just sex that damian had missed there are needs of the body that can be mistaken for sex or lead to sex but it isnt sex that they are about there was one leg left of my pants pooled around my ankle my vest flapped open and the shirt was in shreds it was damians hand from behind that grabbed a handful of my panties and pulled ripping them off my body leaving me nude from the waist down i might have turned around to see how much clothing he still had on but nathaniel was in front of me his shorts had been shredded by me i think he knelt on the floor in front of me naked i almost never let nathaniel be nude around me it had been one of the reasons id been able to resist taking those last steps with him just keep your clothes on and nothing too bad will happen now he knelt in front of me and all i could do was gaze up the line of his body his face with those amazing eyes that mouth the line of his neck spilling into the wide hard flesh of his shoulders the chest that showed the weight lifting hed been doing the curve of his ribs under muscle leading my gaze to the flat plains of his stomach the slight dimple of flesh that was his belly button the rich swell of his hips and finally the ripeness of him id seen him totally nude and excited only once before i didnt remember him being this wide not quite this long of course he hadnt been pressed this tight to his own stomach as if the very ripeness of his flesh was almost too much to contain he seemed thick and heavy with need as if the lightest touch might make him spill that ripeness out and over me i started to reach for him but damian chose that moment to brush the head of his own ripeness against the back of my body the movement made me writhe and lower the front of my body raising myself upward to him like an offering like something in heat the thought helped me swim back up into control at least a little id never even seen damian nude and now he was about to plunge that nudeness into my body it seemed wrong i should see him first shouldnt i there was no logic to the argument no logic left to anything but it made me turn my head made me look at him the blood red of his hair spilled over his shoulders so that it framed the unbelievable whiteness of his body he was narrower of shoulder of chest and his waist seemed to go on forever smooth and creamy like something you should lick down until you found the center of his belly button and just under that the length of him he rode out from his body so it was harder to judge length he seemed carved of ivory and pearl and where the blood ran close to the surface he blushed pink like the shine inside a seashell delicate and shining i realized in that moment that he had been paler in life than any vampire id ever seen nude and his body was almost ghostlike in its coloring as if somehow he wouldnt be real nathaniels face brushed mine brought my attention back to him he had knelt down so low that his face like mine was almost touching the floor he pressed his cheek against mine and whispered please please please over and over and between eachplease he kissed me a light touch of lips please kiss please kiss with his kisses and his voice warm against my face he brought us both up to our knees again id been so aware of his face his mouth his eyes that i hadnt thought what kneeling this close would do until his nude body pressed against the front of mine until the thick solid length of him pressed between us pinned against my stomach by the push of our bodies he was so warm so unbelievably warm so warm almost hot and the push of him against my body was so solid as if he were fighting not to push himself through the front of me to make a new opening anything anything just to be in the warm depths of my body it took me a second to understand it was nathaniels need i was feeling that he did want that badly but it was my wanting too my wanting and denying that want that helped make this moment what it was over all that was damian at my back his body one huge piece of need nathaniel and i were being drowned in damians skinhunger so lonely so terribly lonely and under that was damians fear fear that this would not happen that he would be exiled back to his coffin with all this undone his loneliness was like a theme underneath his lust and i had a glimpse of a room high in the castle a room that overlooked the sea silver bars upon the windows heavy with runes and the sound of the surf always through the windows so that even if he turned away he could still hear it shed given him one of the best rooms in the castle as his prison because she had a way of knowing what things meant to you a way of knowing what would hurt the most it was her gift someone kissed me hard and fast forcing my mouth open pushing his tongue so far in i almost choked but it brought me back brought us all back from that lonely room and the sound of the sea on the rocks below nathaniel drew back enough to say in a harsh whisper happy thoughts anita happy thoughts then his mouth was on mine tongue lips even teeth light against my own lips so that it was more eating than kissing but it brought a whimper from my throat a small helpless sound of pleasure my hands were on his body following the flow of his shoulders his back and the smooth silken curve of his ass the back of his body filled my hands and the front of him was like heat wrapped in flesh as if wed burst into flame damians hands were on the back of my bra somehow it had survived that first rush he snapped it open and the front of it fell against nathaniels chest hands spilled over my breasts one from behind and one from the man pressed against the front of my body damians touch was delicate stroking nathaniel wrapped his hand around my breast and dug his nails into my flesh it was nathaniels hand that bowed my back tore my mouth away from his and forced a scream from my mouth damian hesitated pulled back from that scream as though he had to feel that it was pleasure and not pain he didnt like to hear women scream and just like that we were back in his memory there was a room underneath the castle torches darkness and women any woman that she thought was prettier than she no one was allowed hair more yellow than hers eyes more blue or breasts larger these were all sins and sins were punished a rush of images piles of yellow hair wide blue eyes like cornflowers and the spear that put them out a chest as pale and fair as any hed seen and the sword nathaniel screamed noooo he reached past me and grabbed a handful of red hair he jerked damian so hard against me that just feeling the hard length of him made me writhe between them happy thoughts damian happy thoughts i dont have any happy thoughts and on the heels of that statement were other dark rooms and the smell of burning flesh i was the one who screamed this time god damian no more keep your nightmares to yourself the memory that had gone with that smell had dampened theardeur i could think again even pressed between both their bodies tell him to fuck you nathaniel said i stared at him what order him to do it then he wont be conflicted it seemed almost ridiculous to be huffy kneeling pretty much nude between two nude men but it was still how i felt maybeim conflicted almost always he said and smiled to soften the words damians voice came low and heavy with something like sorrow she doesnt want to do this she wants me to help her stop theardeur not to feed it thats what she really wants i can feel it and thats what i have to do anita please tell him but damian was right he was the only port in a storm of sexual temptation i valued his ability to make me not feel theardeur i valued that more than anything his body could do for me and because i truly was his master and that was my true wish he had to help me do it the coolness of the grave rose between us and it wasnt frightening this time it was soothing comforting anita no nathaniel said no he put his face against my shoulder the movement put his body farther away from mine and that helped me think too i turned to look at damian though i didnt need to see his face to feel the overwhelming sadness the sense of aching loss that seemed to fill him like some bitter medicine but the look on his face drove the sorrow home like a blade thrust through my heart it hurt to see anyones eyes full of such pain i turned to face him still held lightly in both their arms nathaniel put the top of his head against my naked back shaking his head anita cant you feel how sad he is cant you feel it i looked into damians catgreen eyes and said yes he turned his face away as if hed shown me more than he was comfortable with i touched his chin and brought his face back to me you dont want me and there was a world of loss in those words a loss that tightened my throat made my chest hurt i wanted to deny it but he could feel what i was feeling he was right i didnt want him not the way i wanted nathaniel let alone the way i wanted jeanclaude or micah what do you say when someone can read your emotions so that you cant hide behind polite lies what do you say when the truth is awful and you cant lie nothing no words would heal this but id learned there were other ways to say youre sorry other ways to say id change it if i could of course even that was a lie i wouldnt lose the cool reserve that damian could give me not for anything i kissed him and meant for it to be light gentle an apology that words could not make but damian thought hed never get this close to me again i felt a fierceness rise up through him a desperation that made him tighten his grip on my arms made him thrust his tongue into my mouth and kiss me hard and eager and angry i tasted blood and assumed hed nicked me with his fangs i swallowed the sweetish taste of the blood without thinking then i could smell the ocean smell it like salt on my tongue we drew back enough to look into each others faces and i saw the trickle of blood trailing over his lower lip nathaniel had time to say i smell seawater then the power flooded up and up and smashed us against each other it ground us against the floor like a wave cracking a boat against the rocks we screamed and writhed and i could not control it if id been a true master then i could have ridden it helped us all but id never meant to mark anyone never meant to be anyones master the fourth mark was crushing us and i didnt know what to do the inside of my head exploded in white star bursts and gray miasma darkness ate at the inside of my head if id been sure wed wake up again id have welcomed passing out but i wasnt sure i didnt know but it didnt matter darkness filled up the inside of my head and we all fell into it no more screaming no more pain no more panic no more anything i woke to early morning sunlight it left me blinking and only after i could see through the warmdazzle of it did i wonder where am i and why am i on the floor why was i naked on the floor without turning my head i saw the chair legs and the little raised area that was my breakfast nook okay i was in the floor of my own kitchen naked why i heard the soft sounds of movement before i felt a hand brush mine it seemed to take a lot of effort to look to my right down my body and see nathaniel lying on the floor more nude than i was i still had the remnants of my tuxedo clinging to my legs the tuxedo made me remember the wedding i remembered talking to micah after we got home i remembered micah had had to go out and save one of richards wolves i remembered theardeur rising and that something had gone wrong i remembered that damian had been there he must have woken before we did and dragged himself down to his coffin trust the undead to recover quickest someone groaned and it wasnt nathaniel and it wasnt me i suddenly found i could turn my head a lot quicker than i had before adrenaline will do that to you damian lay on the floor his upper body bathed in golden morning light as if his white skin had been dipped in honey part of my mind registered the beauty of him lying there in a pool of bloodred hair and golden light but most of me was terrified i was on my knees and grabbing for his leg before my body could argue nathaniel was beside me and we jerked damian out of the sunlight he was awake now awake and screaming he was out of the direct sunlight but the kitchen faced east and north and the room was bright with early morning light damian had backed into the cabinets pressing his body into them as if he thought he could melt into them and hide in the dark i tried to take his arm to get him to his feet to get him out of the light but he fought me his hands were beating at his skin like someone covered in spiders trying to bat away their darkest fears when those fears are crawling on their body but sunlight isnt spiders and you cant brush it off of you i grabbed a flailing wrist and held on i yelled above the screaming nathaniel help me nathaniel fought for a grip on the other arm and we pulled the vampire out of the light and into the curtained dimness of the living room he didnt stop screaming even when we put him up against the wall in the cool neardark he still shrieked the moment we let go of his hands he started beating at his skin again as if he were putting out invisible fire but it shouldnt have been invisible flame id seen a vampire burn in sunlight and they flash burned hot white flames like magnesium there was nothing invisible about it they burned and if they didnt get out of the light they melted even bone it takes a hot fire to melt bone but vamps in sunlight burn good nathaniel was kneeling trying to comfort damian to hold him to just get him to stop swatting at things we couldnt see i stared down at damian and tried to think past the fear that was choking me i was choking on damians terror i couldnt think past it i could barely breathe past it i threw up shields put metal in my mind against his fear and tried to think i looked down at damians white skin and there was not a blister not even a red spot he wasnt burned he wasnt burning i didnt know why not he should have burst into flames the moment the sunlight touched him but he hadnt and if he hadnt burned with the sunlight drowning him then he wasnt going to burn here in the dark i could hear the phone ringing in the other room but it was dim over the sound of damians screams for once i let it ring if it was the police theyd call back if it was a friend theyd call back if it was another emergency it could wait one disaster at a time i knelt in front of him and tried to talk over the awful screaming damian damian youre safe youre okay youre not burning i put my hands on either side of his face and screamed back at him safe youre safe his eyes stayed wide the pupils like pinpoints he wasnt hearing anything it was like shock but worse if it had been an old movie id have slapped him but i wasnt sure that would help what do you do with a hysterical vampire what do you do with a hysterical anybody the front door burst open behind us my eyes were dazzled by the sunlight that spilled over us gregory one of my leopards stepped out of that blaze of light i dont know what i would have said because damian let out a sound that was beyond a scream it was a sound that should never have come from a human throat he was up and moving like a white and red blur darting farther into the house out of the warm blaze of light nathaniel followed him in that fasterthantheeyecansee speed that shapeshifters have and theyd both turned the corner before i got to it i expected to see the basement door open but it wasnt movement up the stairs caught my eye and i saw nathaniel clear the last step and vanish down the hall in his panic damian had run up not down up into the part of the house where the vampires rarely went up into the part of the house where the drapes were open and the morning light streamed in shit i was nearly to the top of the stairs when i heard gregory behind me he called up after me whats going on i didnt know how to answer the question so i ignored it the upper hallway was a blaze of light the big window at the end open to the risen sun the hallway was empty i thought where are they and i knew i could feel them both of them in the smallest room to the left our guest room i had made one step toward the doorway when damian came running out as if all the demons of hell were chasing him he ran screaming into the room across the hall which was the bathroom unfortunately it had a window too all the rooms up here had windows if we could get him into a closet maybe he came running out of the bathroom and fell and scrambled on all fours like an animal toward the next open door he vanished inside only his piteous screaming coming back out to tell us hed found another open window another wash of sunlight was that damian gregory asked i nodded nathaniel came to the first door damian had run out of blood ran down his shoulder and he was cradling his arm he looked at me and his eyes held all the sorrow in the world hes gone crazy again the last time damian had gone mad hed killed several people butchered them not just fed but that had been because i was his master and id left town i hadnt known i was his master then i hadnt known that leaving him alone without the touch of my magic or whatever you want to call it would make him a revenant a mindless killing thing if it had been my fault before somehow it was my fault again i was his master now more than ever i had to be able to fix this gregory close the drapes start with the ones at the end of the hall his blue eyes were wide and his face held a dozen questions but gregory could follow orders when he wanted to or you made him he didnt argue just started down toward the end of the hallway i went for the room that damian had gone into but i never made it because he came tearing back out of it and nearly ran me down i grabbed him but my touch didnt calm him and his didnt calm me not today he slammed me into the wall and if id let go of his arm hed have run again but i didnt let go i hung on and got slammed into the wall on the other side of the hallway shit i yelled damian stop it but either he couldnt hear me or id lost the power to make him obey me either way it wasnt good when he tried to slam me into the wall again i braced my legs and used his own momentum turning him into the wall so that his own strength drove him into it so hard the plaster gave under the impact he came off the wall snarling fangs bared his face thinning down his humanity folding away until what pinned me to the floor wasnt damian the only thing that saved me from having my throat torn out was that little extra bit of speed id gained from all the metaphysical shit it gave me the time to throw one hand across his throat and one hand into his chest i held him off of me by an arms length my fingers curled around his throat normally id have thrown an arm into his throat and not trusted that i could get a hand there in time but the last two times i tried that maneuver with a vampire theyd torn up my arm so i set my fingers in his throat and my palm against his chest and tried to hold him off me his teeth snapped and snarled at me like a dog on the end of its chain saliva splattered my face trailed from his mouth as if he were a rabid animal he struggled mindlessly to reach me to sink those teeth into my flesh if hed been thinking like a person hed have used his hands his arms to overwhelm me but he wasnt thinking like a person so he fought my hands pressing his body against the force of my hands as if that were all that mattered he pressed the strength of his madness against the push of my hands and he began to press my arm inward i dont know if hed been sane whether my new metaphysics would have helped more but he wasnt sane and crazy anything is stronger than sane it was like trying to benchpress pure muscle a snarling breathing force of nature my arms began to bend and i knew that if he got close enough hed tear me apart his eyes had bled to green and there was nothing in them but a mindless ferocity i had no weapons on me i might have been able to tear his throat out i didnt know if i was that strong now or not but he wasnt a master vamp and i didnt know for certain that hed heal if i pulled his throat apart if hed just been a bad guy id have torn into him and done my best to take him out before he took me out but damian wasnt a bad guy and whatever was wrong was somehow my fault i couldnt kill him because i wasnt master enough to handle him he pressed himself into me and i put everything i had into keeping him away from my face and throat my arms started to shake with the effort and my elbows were bending his face filled my vision and his saliva dripped on my face i did the only thing i could think of i yelled for help gregory was there his hands on damians arm and shoulder trying to use supernatural strength against supernatural strength he slowed damians push toward my face but only slowed it damian was like a human on angel dust stronger even than hed been because there was no one home to help him regulate his force he was all about that force and his goal in life seemed to be my face nathaniel grabbed damians other shoulder blood was still dripping down his arm but it had slowed which meant damian had found a way to injure him that didnt include teeth or nails those wouldnt have started healing yet i think with the two of them pulling and me pushing we might have made it but nathaniels bloody arm was next to damians face he was enraged but all vampires even revenants react to fresh blood his neck turned in my hand and id been so intent on pushing him away that it surprised me he would have sunk fangs into nathaniels arm except gregory was a fraction too quick and a fraction too slow he managed to get his arm halfway around damians neck which put his wrist almost in the vampires mouth damian did what any animal would do he bit him gregory screamed and tried to pull away it worked and it didnt he pulled away from us but the vampire went with him they moved so fast that nathaniel fell against me smearing blood down my skin he was on his feet and moving toward the sounds of fighting farther down the hallway before id gotten to my knees damian had gregory pinned on the floor worrying at his arm like a dog with a bone even over gregorys screams i heard the bone crack nathaniel was there wrapping his arms around damians waist he lifted him into the air but the teeth stayed in gregorys broken arm so that gregory was pulled to his knees by the pain and the fangs locked into his arm i was almost to them when damian remembered he could fly he pushed off from the floor and smashed nathaniel against the ceiling hard enough that plaster dust rained down on them and when damian touched ground he rolled out of nathaniels loosened grip damian had been a warrior once and though nathaniel and gregory had the strength they didnt know how to fight strength without training was no match i was suddenly the only one standing in the hallway except for damian he came for me in a blur of movement i got one foot planted and had a heartbeat to see him think what id do and do it years of practice in judo and my body remembered before my mind had caught up i used his own momentum against him one arm and his hip as the pivot points and i threw him as far and as hard as his own motion would let me he ended at the top of the stairs crouched and turned toward me before i had time to marvel at how far id thrown him lets hear it for not being human anymore but a figure rose above him coming up the stairs it was richard zeeman local ulfric wolfking exfiancé and in the wrong place at the worst time i had a few seconds to see that his hair had grown out just enough to give some curl to his woefully short locks that the white tshirt made his fading tan summerdark with contrast that he was still one of the most handsome men id ever seen then the vampire turned noticed him and launched himself at richard he balanced them both for a second then the other mans weight took them both and richard fell backward down the stairs with the vampire riding him they vanished from sight and over the sound of their bodies falling down the stairs i heard a woman start to scream i went to the stairs expecting to see them struggling on the steps but the stairs stretched empty i ran down the stairs toward the sound of fighting richard had taken the fight out into the living room so he had room to use his long legs and arms he kicked damian in the face hard enough that the vampire staggered backward i got a profile glimpse of damians face blood ran from his mouth and the right side of his face richard took the extra seconds that the vampire gave him to do a beautiful roundhouse kick to the other side of damians face this one was hard enough that blood flew in a thin arc damian staggered and i think would have gone down but he bumped into the wall he hesitated long enough for richard to get set up for another kick back foot set front foot set but loose body partially turned to give that pivoting strength the way when you land a fist you turn the fist into the skin for that extra little bit of harm looking at richard with all his attention on the vampire his body tensed and ready hands held in loose fists even though he was setting up for a kick i was reminded that here was someone with preternatural strength that did know how to fight there was blood on his left hand and i couldnt tell if it was damians blood or his own a small sound jerked my attention to the far side of the living room a woman i didnt know was standing near the television set she was pale darkhaired and scared i didnt have time to notice more i was standing too close to the fighting to sightsee if damian had just been a big bad vamp in my house id have gotten my gun and finished him but he wasnt a villain it was damian and somehow it was all my fault i couldnt get a gun and just shoot him for one of the few times in my life i was frozen overwhelmed by my choices or the lack of them damian had been against the wall for so longfifteen thirty secondsthat i thought the fight might be over that richard might have actually kicked some sense into him i was wrong the vampire came off the wall in a white and red blur richard met the charge with a kick to damians chest it wasnt a pretty kick not like the roundhouse but the sound of its impact was thick and meaty if hed been human it would have dropped him but he wasnt human and it didnt he staggered backward and i could have almost reached out a hand and touched his back damian went very still like the old vamps can as if he were some beautiful statue then i knew knew that he was about to move and not toward richard i had an extra few seconds to react when he turned in a whirl of white skin and red hair turned so fast that the colors blurred so he looked like a whirlwind of snow and blood i threw myself to one side rolling over the back of the couch i ended up on the other side of it on the area rug i had a heartbeat to stand and damian was on me i braced for it but it was like trying to brace for a freight train there was no stopping it or fighting it i was just suddenly falling backward with damian on top of me i didnt fight the fall i used it when my body met the floor i had one foot in damians stomach and two hands on his arms atome nage throw is the only throw in judo where you commit your whole body to it most throws have variations you can do at the last minute if they dont work but thetome nage either works or it doesnt you fail and your opponent is on top of you in a perfect position to pin you but i hadnt chosen the throw it had been the only move damians attack left me i had seconds to do it right or have him eat my face so when i kicked up with my feet i gave it all i had id forgotten that all i had was more than it used to be damian flew through the air again but it wasnt his supernatural powers this time i rolled over in time to see damian hit the wall yards away he hit hard enough to crack the paint and leave a partial imprint of his body on the wall when he slid to the floor i heard someone behind me say wow and it wasnt richard because he was nearly up beside me rounding the couch i didnt have time to glance behind me to see if it was nathaniel or gregory because two bad things were happening at once the first bad thing was that damian was getting slowly to his feet slowly enough that i think id hurt him but he was still getting up still not unconscious the second bad thing was the woman had started screaming again and thanks to me throwing damian across the room she was the closest person to him shed backed up when he sailed through the air otherwise shed have been almost where he landed but when he turned around shed be a yard away not good richard made a move toward her but she was already backing up and not toward us she was backing up toward the open front door there was something about the way she was moving that made both richard and i say something richard had time to say clair dont i had time to say dont run but it was too late she ran just as damian turned to see her it was like putting a cat into a room full of mice theyll chase the running one first richard was moving but even with his speed there wasnt time to get ahead of damian and block the door all richard had time for was to rush damian to crash into him and take them both to the floor he had the vampire down but not pinned richard screamed his shoulders blocked my view and i had to move around to their heads to see damians mouth buried into richards upper chest i knelt to help pry damians mouth from his flesh but richard made the preternatural rookie mistake he grabbed damian by the hair and pulled him off of him vampire bites are like snake bites if the snake has a good grip you dont just yank it off yanking it off causes more damage than letting the snake let go on its own or prying it loose i guess the exception would be a venomous snake if you go on the assumption that the longer it bites you the more poison it pumps in which may or may not be true but vampires arent venomous it was an impressive show of strength tearing the vampires mouth away from his flesh but impressive shows of strength have their price richards shirt ripped away from that entire side of his body and a great bloody hole showed in his upper chest almost to the shoulder his hand which had been pushing against damians shoulder suddenly went limp and all that kept damian from sinking teeth into richard again was richards grip on his long red hair i put a hand on damians shoulder and pressed and unlike every other time id tried to hold down a rampaging vampire this time it worked at least a little lets hear it for preternatural strength a gobbet of flesh fell out of damians mouth as he tried to turn and sink fangs into me richard yanked on his hair and kept those straining fangs from me he tried to use his left arm again and it moved but he couldnt push with it something important had gotten torn up super strong or not he was suddenly fighting with only one arm between the two of us we could keep damian from sitting up completely but we couldnt keep him pressed to the floor he kept straining upward teeth slashing the air sounds coming from his throat that were more animal than human we werent losing the fight but we werent winning either we needed a different plan of attack i moved off of his shoulders enough that he raised up more and richards eyes were wide i cant hold him onehanded not alone im going to put an arm around his neck to control his head i said but i need him higher off the ground a choke hold wont work on a vampire they dont breathe that was half true but i let it go we could argue later im just trying to control his head thats it he gave a small nod he didnt look convinced but he didnt argue about it and that was good enough i slid in behind damian and he was so busy straining after richard that he didnt seem to notice i knelt behind the vampire and for the first time was very aware that i was nude the fight had sort of made it unimportant what made it important now was that richards hand was still in damians hair and his hand had to stay there until i had my arm wrapped around the vampires neck i needed to have one arm wrapped around damians neck and the other arm holding my wrist and i needed to be squeezing like a son of a bitch while my face was buried against the back of his head so he theoretically couldnt reach me only richards grip and the vampires desire to bite him would keep him from tearing into me during the process so richard had to keep his hand there but now suddenly my bare breasts were going to be pressed into the back of his hand and arm the fact that that bit of knowledge froze me for a second tells you how badly i behaved around richard or how screwed up about him i was a life and death struggle and i was worried about pressing my breasts against his hand focus anita focus survive first be embarrassed later hurry richard said and there was strain in that one word super strong doesnt mean you dont get tired i took a deep breath let it out and moved into both damians body and richards hand i had to move fast and firm no hesitations because richards grip wasnt perfect control if damian noticed me before my arm was under his chin i wasnt sure there was anything richard could do to save me some damage my hand touched damians bloodslick skin and i had to follow through i had to ignore the almost electric reaction i had when my bare breasts brushed the back of richards hand one small touch and my skin ran with goosebumps but it was more than just physical attraction it was as if the world held its breath even damian went still for that frozen moment i felt jeanclaude wake felt his eyes open knew he woke in a welter of silk sheets in the sunless dark of the underground in circus of the damned he turned in that nest of silk and darkness and touched ashers body found it still cold still hours from waking jeanclaudes voice echoed through my head what have you done ma petite i dont know what i would have answered because in that moment the world came back into focus i could still feel jeanclaude all those miles away but i was back to the here and now damian helped me concentrate on the here and now he twisted in richards desperate grip and lunged at me mouth wide fangs straining like a striking snake i suddenly had my own grip on his hair and helped richard hold him away from my skin by fractions of an inch i snugged my right arm under his chin tight against the front of his neck and he reacted like the only danger was the arm sliding in from his right so that he never tried to turn in against mine and richards grip on the other side there was no human thought to him in that moment no human no vampire i wasnt even sureanimal was the word i had no word for what damian had become in a different century it would have beendemon possessed damned jeanclaudes voice in my head again he will be damned if you cannot bring him back i had to shake my head like his voice was an insect buzzing inside my skull it distracted me i thought very hard stop talking i dont know if he heard me or figured out on his own that he was distracting me but he stopped i let go of damians hair and used my arms to close around his neck in what would have been a choke hold if hed needed to breathe vampires do breathe but they dont have to my arm slid into place more easily because of all the blood but the blood also made it harder to hold him still harder to maintain my grip i put my head down tight against the side of his head using all my upper body to simply control his head richard let go of damians hair and the vampire sprang up off the floor i tightened my grip around his neck but was along for the ride i could control his head from moving side to side but i couldnt choke him and i didnt weigh enough to slow him down damian was on top of richard pinning the bigger man to the floor richard had his good arm pushing out against damians chest i got my feet under me on either side of them it was awkward because i just wasnt tall enough to do it comfortably but i began to fight to pull damians neck backward i could feel that i could snap his neck i was almost sure i could but i could not simply fight him backward i knew if you decapitated most vamps they died id never had the strength before to snap a neck this easily so id never tried if i snapped his spine would he die would he be crippled would spinal damage cripple a vampire richards arm was beginning to shake and collapse at the elbow i pulled backward and felt damians windpipe begin to give i was going to crush his neck before i broke his spine i looked past us and found nathaniel bent over gregory at the foot of the stairs gregory wasnt moving but one problem at a time i screamed nathaniel he turned and there was blood all over the front of his body i didnt think most of it was his his face looked surprised as if he had lost track of our fight but he came to me he grabbed damians arm and it was as if hed given the vampire another target damian leapt off of richard and was suddenly on top of nathaniel i was beginning to feel positively useless if i couldnt choke him wasnt heavy enough to slow him down wasnt willing to break his neck i was useless i used what weight i had to stagger him throw him off balance so that nathaniel had time to get his arms up and a leg into damians stomach if nathaniel had known how to fight hed have been able to do more but at the moment just keeping the vampire from biting him was good jeanclaudes voice soft in my head you have done something to damage the bond between yourself and damian you must reopen it ma petite a little busy right now i said richard wrapped his one arm around damians waist and helped me pull him off of nathaniel the three of us rode him down to the floor i changed my grip on his neck to a choke hold that wouldnt have worked at all if nathaniel hadnt been pressing on his shoulder and chest and richard sitting on the rest of him my body was curled around his neck using my own weight as an anchor to make it harder for him to rise and strike but id tried this hold on large human males in judo class before and it wasnt effective not if they had the upper body strength to sit up with me dangling from their neck i did it now only to control his head his mouth those fangs and because i had richard and nathaniel to help me he fought us but three on one we had some control not much but some my voice came breathy but clear what do you mean ive damaged the bond between damian and me who are you talking to nathaniel asked through gritted teeth jeanclaude richard answered for me can you hear him too i asked sometimes i wanted to ask like now but jeanclaude was answering me you have put up shields specifically against damian why he woke up in a flood of sunlight it seemed to terrify him he was so afraid the fear was choking nathaniel and me both you and nathaniel jeanclaude asked i could see him lying on the white silk sheets his black hair spread out like a dark dream across the pillow one hand idly touching ashers bare back the way youd drum your fingers on a desk or pet a dog if you were thinking about other things yes both of us i asked you when i woke what had you done now i may know for once i was at least up to speed on the metaphysical disasters in my life i got to say we know already know what ma petite damian gave a particularly violent movement bucking me up off the floor slamming me back down only after i felt rather than saw the other two men force him back down i thought it because i didnt have breath to speak at the moment that were a triumvirate i heard that richard said and there was a sullen note under his breathless exertion as if hed thought id only thought it to keep it from him or maybe i was just projecting i was always willing to believe that richard was being difficult as he was always willing to believe i was being bloodthirsty jeanclaude didnt ask stupid questions or try to discuss metaphysics if we all knew that somehow id managed to forge a second triumvirate then we could move on when you shielded from damians fear you shielded too well you have cut him off from your power as you did by leaving once im right here i said trying to turn my face away from the blood that had decided to trickle down damians face and onto mine there physically but not metaphysically and your servant needs both how do i fix this i asked drop your shields he said and even in my head his voice was matteroffact it sounded so simple so obvious i remembered shielding from damians fear i had thought of metal hard cold solid unpenetrable not a metal wall or door but truly just the essence of metal it had taken me months of work to understand how to shield not with an imaginary door or wall or building but just to think rock water metal block the things you dont want to get through or drown them marianne could also shield with air and fire but i didnt get that air just wasnt strong enough for shielding and fire well fires fire i used the tools i understood how do you unshield once id had to picture the wall crumbling or the door opening but very lately id understood something that marianne had been saying but i hadnt been understanding i simply stopped thinking about metal i stopped it went away poof gone one second i was safe behind my thought of metal the next i was drowning in damians rage no not rage rage implies anger human emotion and that wasnt what roared through my head id thought more than once that i was going crazy in a detached sort of sociopathic way but id been wrong that hadnt been being crazythis was i forgot about holding damian down i forgot about why id dropped my shields i forgot about everything there were no thoughts no words there was just sensation and impulse the smell of fresh blood the taste of our own blood in our mouths bitter hands pushing us to the floor crushing us hunger hunger like fire in our gut like something that would eat us alive if we didnt feed and feed and feed the smell of fresh blood the warmth in their hands pushing on us all that was maddening pain my body was just pain like a fire that was burning me up from the inside i screamed and the sound was loud and not loud enough it didnt help only one thing would quench that fire fill me up stop the pain blood fresh blood warm blood my hands touched warm skin and if it hadnt been richard im not sure i would have stopped but the feel of richards muscled arm under my hands called something of me up through the hunger i was staring into richards solid brown eyes from inches away almost as if id moved in for a kiss but it hadnt been his mouth id been aiming at even now the long solid line of his neck beckoned to me the smell of fresh blood overwhelmed the subtler scent of the blood that pulsed under his skin but somehow lapping at the bloody wound wasnt enough it needed to be fresh i needed my teeth in flesh i needed to make my own hole to tear at only that would satisfy only that would be enough i forced my gaze up to richards face i looked into his wide eyes made myself look at his face trace the line of his jaw the fullness of his lips i looked on the face of someone id loved once and i had to work harder than id worked at almost anything ever to see him as something other than food damian bucked and richard had to pay more attention to the vampire he and nathaniel were still pinning to the floor than to me a cool voice flowed through my mind i am helping you shield ma petite forgive me i did not understand what dropping your shield would do to you hes a revenant i said and i dont think i said it out loud oui how do i help him you must rebind him as you did when he came out of the coffin let him taste your blood and say the words over him are the words really important i asked i felt him shrug where he sat on his silkcovered bed they are the words that masters of the city have spoken over their followers for thousands of years i would not want to chance that the words are not part of the magic that will bind master to servant by leaving them out i nodded did richard hear this non tell him a moment after i said it i was still cool and a little distant from what was happening but i could hear it again see it i was sitting on my living room floor not too far from the door and richard and nathaniel were still trying to keep damian on the floor they were mostly succeeding though it was hard to tell through the blood if there were any new wounds they were all three covered in blood i stared down at myself and realized that the front of my body was covered in it too i didnt remember getting that messy for a moment i wondered if id done something that i didnt remember but i pushed the thought away time later for too much truth survive keep moving worry about what you did later yeah thats the ticket but after a peek inside damians mind a ticket to the situational sociopath express didnt look half bad i knew now for dead certain that there were worse things damian bucked so hard that he threw nathaniel to one side richards weight alone wasnt enough damian sat up and richard rolled off of him to keep the vampire from sinking fangs into him again i waved my arms and yelled damian here im here i dont think it was his name that attracted his attention i think it was the movement id been in his mind i knew he was past words he rushed toward me so fast he was a blur of white and red and his eyes like green streaks nathaniel ran for him i yelled no let him come richard hesitated still on the floor but with his hand outstretched toward the vampires legs they could have caught him again but why it was my blood he needed i was calm peaceful it was like that quiet place i went when i killed no fear nothing i watched the vampire come at me like a comet streaking across the heavens something elemental and otherworldly to say he smashed into me didnt come close to the impact of flesh on flesh i was on the floor breathless sightless and only years of training on how to fall kept me from smacking my head against the floor or breaking a bone i caught my breath in time to scream damian plunged his mouth low in my neck just above the shoulder it had been a long time since id been vampire bit without head games or sex it hurt a wereleopard appeared over us standing on crooked almosthuman legs he was yellow and pale gold and white with beautiful black rosettes scattered over a body that was more than a foot taller than he was in human form the color told me it was gregory because nathaniel was black in leopard form gregorys chest was broader his arms were longer muscled and tipped with talons like frightening knives the face was leopard but with something strangely different around the muzzle and the neck he towered over us snarling and reaching down for the vampires pale back he was going to pull damian off of me like richard had pushed the vampire off of himself i wrapped my arms around damians shoulders and back got one leg free to wrap around his waist i held him to me and said no gregory if he pulled him off id end up hurt as bad as richard youll tear me up worse the leopardman hesitated growling he said in that thick voice they all had in halfhuman form hes hurting you damian snuggled his mouth deeper into my flesh forced a sound that was not happy out of my mouth but i said in a breathy voice when i need your help ill ask for it i could tell gregory was puzzled even through the fur i wasnt always good at facial expressions once my friends went furry but this one even i could read damian i said my voice was soft i wanted to see that he was in there before i said the words his eyes were closed but he relaxed against me by inches until he wasnt so much pinning me to the floor as lying on top of me it was more my arms and leg that held him pressed to me damian i said again i felt him come back into himself as if a switch had been thrown one moment monster the next damian even before he opened his eyes and looked at me i knew he was in there again he was back from wherever hed gone relief flooded through me until my arms and leg started to slide off of him weak with relief wasnt just an expression he was still sucking at the wound but it was gentler now it had stopped hurting he drew slowly from the wound his mouth crimson with my blood i was suddenly aware in a way that i hadnt been before that we were both nude and he was male and he had fed his body was thick and heavy against my thigh where a moment ago it hadnt been blood pressure is a wonderful thing if i had not put a leg over his body to help hold him against me it wouldnt have been quite so compromising if gregory hadnt tried to help me i wouldnt have oh hell i was suddenly afraid in a very different way afraid to move afraid of making things worse or better afraid of how my body pulsed in his arms it was as if all the blood in our bodies was pulsing in time it was hard to breathe i was almost choking on power magic id bound him once before and it hadnt been like this his hand slid slowly tentatively down the side of my body and it wasnt so much a caress for sex as just for touching he used his whole hand getting as much of his skin against mine as he could i felt him marveling at the grace of our bodies so close so completely without barriers his skin hunger was there like some new kind of beast a need so intense and so long denied that it was a kind of madness of its own i felt his loneliness like a great echoing thing it brought tears to the edges of my eyes and made me want to fix it i moved my hands along his back so that i was no longer holding him but closer to an embrace blood of my blood and he moved upward to bring his mouth to mine for the kiss that would seal the words but that small movement slid his body against the front of mine so that the swell of him brushed against me and that brief touch made me writhe underneath him and it suddenly wasnt a kiss i wanted to seal this bargain with the thought helped me pull back helped me realize that what i was thinking was not entirely me i gazed up into his emerald eyes and knew who was doing the thinking nathaniel knelt beside us i reached out a hand and the moment he touched me i could think a little and damians pull was a little less damian snarled at him and those green eyes wavered as if sanity wasnt permanent in them not yet jeanclaude was in my head and i felt a tiny thread of fear from him you must finish binding him ma petite and you must start from the beginning of the words i wanted to ask why are you afraid and i must have thought it very hard because he answered if he goes insane now ma petite your lovely throat is very unprotected finish it maybe richard was hearing the interior conversation because he came to kneel on the other side of us suddenly it couldnt have gotten more awkward im here he said and he said it like it should have made things better as if he didnt understand how horribly embarrassing it was to have him kneeling there damian gave him an unfriendly look and a sound that was more growl than anything trickled from his mouth i was losing him blood of my blood flesh of my flesh and he gazed back down at me and with each word sanity filled his eyes his face him he slid his body against mine and i felt him pushing against me and again i felt that almost overwhelming need that certainty that it was not a kiss we needed to seal this with the need roared over me i thought for a heartbeat wed raised theardeur but then i could hear itthem two needs i turned my head and found nathaniel gazing down at me with those lavender eyes it was there in his eyes his face but i could have told you what was there without using my eyes because i could feel it feel him them both of them pushing at me not just physically but in ways that hands could never hold you down or bodies pin you to the floor their need undid me more easily than any physical strength or threat their need undid me because i cared for them and if you could feel anothers pain as if it were your own wouldnt you do anything to stop that pain wouldnt you my voice was breathy and it was nathaniels gaze i held when i said breath to breath my heart to yours damian slid inside me in one long push of his hips the sensation made me writhe underneath him made me grip nathaniels hand hard enough to dig nails into his flesh my hips ground upward to meet damians thrust it was as involuntary as the next breath i took a sound drew my attention away from nathaniel and it wasnt a sound from above me the sound came from the other side of us richard had pushed himself away from us until his back met the side of the white couch i dont know what i expected to see on his face lust disgust anger jealousy maybe but what i saw was fear a fear so raw and naked that it hurt to meet his eyes damian grabbed my face turned me back to look up at him its me i want you to be thinking about he said and he began to pull himself out of me slowly for a second i thought that would be it but part of me knew better hed raised himself up almost in a pushup the tip of him barely inside me and gazing full into my face his eyes pinning mine as surely as his body pinned the rest of me he said blood of my blood and thrust into me i cried out underneath him and nathaniel echoed that cry while his hand gripped mine his lavender eyes were wild when i turned to look at him damian touched my face again but a touch was enough to turn me to face him to feel his body sliding out of mine to hear his whisper flesh of my flesh before he married our flesh as close as fast as he could i felt nathaniel convulse hand to hand and i felt his pulse like a second heartbeat against my palm but i kept my eyes on damians face my gaze on his as he drew his body out of me almost and said breath to breath and slammed himself inside me i screamed and nathaniels voice echoed mine i finally realized that nathaniel was getting if not the full ride a shadow of what i was feeling damian drew himself out out until my heart to yours and he slid himself inside me he stayed frozen above me body as deep inside me as he could get his breathing was harsh and shallow a shudder passed down his body from head to toe and i writhed underneath him from it nathaniel moaned jerking on my hand as if it were his body being explored damians voice was shaky oh dont do that if you do that again i wont last he buried his face against my hair and another shudder rippled down his body and made me dance underneath him crying out and that was it he was suddenly above me his upper body arched and he shoved himself into me deep hard and it was partly his body inside me partly watching his body above mine his eyes closed his head thrown back his hair like a bloody waterfall around the pale candle of his body and knowing that he was thrust as deep inside me as he could get that tore a scream from my lips and nathaniels voice screamed with me our hands convulsing around each other our nails biting into each others skin i felt nathaniels body thrust against the carpet felt him let go and that orgasm traveled back up my arm and into damian it was his turn to scream and that made him writhe with his body still plunged inside of mine which made me move underneath him it was like being caught in an endless loop of pleasure one bodys release bringing the other until we ended in a sweating bloody pile on the floor damian let out a shaky laugh and i felt heard knew that underneath the lust was sorrow and an almost certain knowledge that he might never get to do this again once my head cleared for some reason that made me think of something i had forgotten i turned my head and found that richard was still there but it wasnt fear on his face now but a sort of wonderment i realized in that moment that though richard wasnt getting all the sensations that nathaniel was getting he could still hear inside my head so could jeanclaude but it was richards thought that came the clearest youve never fucked either of them on the heels of that thought came another that hed assumed i was screwing everything in the house because hed pretty much been doing the same down at the lupanar i was naked in the middle ofsex with one man maybe two depending on how you counted things yet suddenly i had the moral high ground weird gregory crawled to us on all fours sniffing just above our bodies he said in that growling voice me next i had to look up and back over my shoulder to give him the look he deserved but looking back with him on all fours gave me a sight line down his body and suddenly i was more embarrassed than i had been shapeshifters look sort of like they do in the movies in halfman form but there is one big difference they have genitalia and right at that moment gregory was very very happy to be here i think what bothered me more than the erection was that hed gotten it from watching me have sex with damian for some reason unfair probably it bothered me that gregory had enjoyed the show back off gregory i said and my voice sounded harsh and like i meant it even while i blushed he did his kittycat impression of a smile and backed off literally he put his head down and crawled backward abasing himself it was a gesture closer to a real wolf than a real leopard but wereanimals are people at heart and some gestures just translate better to our human brains abasing yourself by going low is one of those gestures damian was looking down at me and the look was not one that id ever seen on a mans face just after finishing sex he looked sad and i remembered the burst of emotion at the end sorrow covering the pleasure like evil chocolate ruining your ice cream but it was more than the look on his face i realized that i could feel his sadness feel it not like it was my own but like it was a coat that clung to my skin i was still hooked up to him emotionally well not just emotionally i could feel him plunged deep inside me his weight still pinning my lower body touching made any sort of metaphysical intermingling worse i needed to stop touching him and not just him nathaniel lay beside us his fingers still tangled in mine the side of his body pressed up against me so that our bodies touched from shoulder to hip he must have scooted closer when damian finished i think i would have remembered if nathaniels body had been touching mine during the act wouldnt i his lavender eyes were unfocused almost sleepy what came through his skin was contentment contentment like a great warm ocean that filled him floated him held him rocked him maybe i stared at him too long or maybe he sensed my own growing unease because his eyes focused sharpened and the look in them wasnt the least bit sleepy it was almost an anticipatory look as if he were already thinking about next time since i didnt think hed had a first time yet it helped clear my head anger always did everybody off out of the pool i said damians sorrow was almost like rain on my skin nathaniel wasnt sad he went straight to panic afraid hed done something wrong its alright nathaniel youre alright were all alright i wasnt sure i actually believed that down to my toes but the panic subsided and everybody got off of me yeah though damians sadness clung to me like id walked through some metaphysical cobweb while we were getting untangled micah came through the splintered door id been found in compromising positions by boyfriends before but never with less embarrassment he didnt ask stupid questions or make me feel like a slut in fact he concentrated on the most important thing wow he said and the wow seemed to take in the blood scattered here and there on the floor and the walls the injuries that he could see on most of us the broken door all of it but what he said out loud was is everybody alright i started to get up off the floor and damian offered me a hand up i wouldnt have taken it normally but wed just had sex and it seemed odd to slap away his hand the moment my hand touched his i realized it was more than that that need to put my skin against his was still there one moment of good sex didnt take away centuries of need sex was like some kind of fuel like foodyou burned it up and needed more i got my hand out of his and took a slightly shaky step away from nathaniel and damian a little distance would be helpful i hoped well all live i said good he cocked his head to one side and said i didnt know that damian could walk around this early in the day he cant i said do i say the obvious but he is walking around during the day or do you want me to just stop asking questions i was suddenly tired and i probably wasnt the only one have you been to bed at all he shook his head and as if id reminded him he rubbed his chartreuse eyes his sunglasses already tucked into the front of his shirt when i drove the guy home from the bar he had a livein girlfriend and a child girlfriend started a fight about his drinking anger does not help you fight the change did he shift i asked no but it was close and hes so new micah shook his head again id feel better if the girlfriend was a little more understanding about how dangerous he could be she just didnt seem to understand she didnt want to understand richard said micah turned and looked at him i realized that of all the people in the room richard had been the only one that micah hadnt really looked at then youve met patricks girlfriend richard started to shake his head stopped in midmotion and winced no but ive seen it the human spouse just doesnt want to understand that theyre married to a monster i think he meant it to sound matteroffact but it didnt it sounded bitter id never made richard feel like that that i knew of no hed spent a great deal more time making me feel like a monster so i let it go i let it go because i didnt know what to say or if there was anything to say okay i had one thing to say the coalition is offering a monthly meeting for family members i thought wed given flyers out to the werewolves richard got to his feet cradling his arm this is my patrick patrick cook micah said yes and youve been babysitting him all night yes micah said again richard looked down at the floor then back up he met micahs gaze but his face wasnt completely happy about it thank you for looking after my wolf the wolves are part of the coalition too micah said id do the same for anyones people all the same thank you dont mention it there was one of those awkward silences i hated to leave everybody alone but i really needed a shower the shower would hurt the wound on my throat but id just had sex without a condom which meant all the mess had gone into me but it wouldnt stay there so i needed to clean up truthfully id have preferred a condom but it hadnt occurred to me until afterward tammy had gotten pregnant on the pill yeah she had fallen afoul of the fact that antibiotics dont mix well with the pill but still that one percent chance suddenly seemed like it wasnt good odds damian was a thousandyearold vampire chances were he was infertile but still it was one thing getting pregnant by a boyfriend but pregnant by someone who wasnt even that well that seemed somehow worse im taking a shower they all looked at me i guess it was abrupt im sorry but i just cant stand here like this anymore so everybody behave themselves ill be as quick as i can ill call for a doctor micah said i nodded good good i suddenly had to not be there naked smelling of fresh sex with richard and micah in the same room having damian and nathaniel naked didnt help my comfort level i was fairly comfortable around nudity in general now but specific nudity that was still a problem for more reasons than i was comfortable with i needed to leave the room by the way theres a woman crying in your car in the driveway micah said my car i asked no richards or at least i assume its richards i know gregorys car and thats not the one shes in richard cursed under his breath something he rarely did clair i forgot about clair whos clair i asked he hesitated then said my girlfriend then he was walking to the door holding his arm like it hurt to walk that fast his girlfriend and im buck naked the first time she sees me great well at least she hadnt seen me fuck damian that helped sure great just great i was shaking my head as i went toward the bathroom it was gregory in his growling voice who said i guess its none of my business but should richard really be in front of the house where cars could see him he is covered in blood i turned and looked at the leopardman and said shit no i started for the door and micah stopped me ill go im the only one that they wouldnt call the cops on right now he squeezed my shoulder and smiled at me i realized that i hadnt kissed him hello i always kissed him hello of course i was still covered in blood and other bodily fluids and none of them were his but he might not understand that that was why i hadnt wanted to get too close some of my confusion must have shown on my face because his smile widened he turned me around by the shoulders gave me a little push toward the bathroom and slapped me on the ass get cleaned up ill take care of things here i cant believe you just did that i said did what he said and he was grinning at me i could probably count on one hand the number of times micah had grinned at me his eyes were sparkling with laughter as if it were all he could do not to let it out i was happy to see him having this good a time really i was but i wasnt sure what was funny and i didnt have the courage to ask it was probably something that would be at my expense or something id just done that he found cute i was not cute confused fuckedup bruised but not cute nathaniel and damian knew better but as i passed gregory i had to say if you touch my ass i will rip you a new one i said it as i moved past him not even pausing youre no fun he growled i looked back just before i turned out of sight of him oh im a lot of fun just not for you he snarled at me bitch woof woof i said and finally made it into the bathroom i tried not to think in the shower thinking bad hot water good i turned the shower head to as hard as the water would go and the let the water beat against my body finding bruises i didnt know i had once i would have been hurt really hurt by the beating that damian had given me thanks to jeanclaudes vampire marks i was just a little stiff the bite would take the longest to heal and even that would be gone in few days a week at the outside the healing was great the rest of it well lets just say the jury was still out i heard a noise over the pounding water it took me a minute to realize that someone was knocking at the door i tried to ignore it the knocking stopped for a second and i thought oh good but it started again louder as if whoever was knocking thought i hadnt heard the first time i sighed turned off the water and called what damian isnt doing well nathaniel said through the closed door i stood there a second water dripping into my eyes and said what do you mean damians not doing well cant you feel it i thought about it i thought about damian and suddenly fear was like a crushing weight on my chest it staggered me for a second and i was glad there was a safety bar in the shower to grab on to it was a shadow of what had driven him to run screaming through the house i wasnt sure wed all survive him doing it twice im coming i squeezed out my hair wound a towel around it and was trying to towel off enough for a robe when the door sprang open gregory came first in his fur suit one clawed hand under damians arm richard had the other arm they halfdragged halfcarried him through the door they carried him toward me and his fear rode before him id felt fear before but not like this it crushed my chest so that i couldnt breathe closed my throat the fear had weight enough to slam me to the floor as if something had smashed into me it wasnt my pulse i was choking on it was as if the terror itself were wet silk and i was trying to swallow it slick wet suffocating more real than any fear id ever felt not real the way an emotion is real but real the way a rock a chair or an animal is real fear had become something more they dropped damian into my lap and it was as if every part of my skin ran with chills and then every inch of my skin tried to crawl away tried to crawl away and leave my body to die my skin would have saved itself if it hadnt been trapped against my body the rest of me would have gone with it but we were trapped under damians weight trapped in his fear frozen in it if i could have breathed i would have screamed but all i could do was drown drown in damians fear someone touched my shoulder but it was distant as if no ones skin were as real to me as damians someone shook me sharp and hard my breath came in a huge gasp as if i hadnt been breathing for a long time when my breath came out it was a shriek i was staring up into richards startled face it was his hand on my shoulder him kneeling beside us anita anita can you hear me i grabbed richards arm my other hand clutching damian to me as if i were afraid if i let him go hed be lost as if the fear were some horrible beast that could literally eat him up and destroy him richard shook me again anita say something god its so awful damian nodded his head against my stomach hed been lying almost limply against me but now he grabbed me around the waist and hip his hands holding on as if i were the last solid thing in the world i felt a burst of emotion from him and it was gratitude he was grateful that i could share his fear sharing it seemed to make it less or make it more bearable that thought that sharing fear made it easier to bear brought a memory it wasnt my memory it was a face that i had never seen before but one that damian knew as well as his own all high angles and strong lines a scar from his forehead to his cheek where hed been cut in the first raid wed gone on shewhomadeus said once that the scar saved his life because without it his hair was more blond than hers his eyes more blue that scar ruined his handsomeness enough for her to leave him whole for even men who were too fair were not safe from her envy the only name i heard in my head was perrin but i knew that wasnt right that hadnt been his name anymore than damian had been mine ours his i smelled vanilla and felt something thick and warm glide over my skin i blinked awake ifawake was the right word nathaniel was kneeling beside us hed undone his braid so that the vanilla scent of his hair had perfumed around me his hair cascaded around him and spilled over the side of my body pooling into my lap covering damian like a blanket if a blanket could flow like liquid over a body nathaniel had covered us in his hair but had very carefully avoided touching our skin with his he was so close to us that not touching took effort so close it was as if a sigh would have pressed the line of his body against mine but he stayed that near painful inch away letting only scent and the furred glide of hair reach us the only thing he gave me of his skin was the warmth of it which even from a distance i could feel heat trembling against my skin as if the warmth of him breathed outward and wanted to touch me maybe it did it had been such a smart way to bring me out of damians memory without risking nathaniel being dragged into it himself so smart but a plan is only as good as everyone in it damian moved in my lap and i had a second to realize what he was going to do i drew a breath to warn nathaniel but didnt have time to breath out it was that quick damian grabbed nathaniels arm and that one touch was enough it was like drowning in light as if the world had caught fire and become heat and heat was golden like the color yellow had spilled out and covered everything yellow warmth golden heat our eyes were dazzled by it we were blind in the light there was nothing but the light and the touch of her small hands and perrins hand in mine his hand so large firm an anchor in the nightmare of the light her hands caressed but it wasnt real shed dragged us into the light to drink our fear not our sex she tore his hand away from mine and her voice which once id thought beautiful sounded like an evil whine in my head poisonous because i could not tell her no one to burn one to keep perrin turned framed for a moment in the light his hair as yellow as the light itself his eyes like the sky beyond the window he was tall his shoulders so wide that he filled most of the window hed always been a big man even among big men some of the towns wed raided people had run screaming giant or their word for it perrin stood covered in the light covered in the light but not burning the words that had begun this folly came back perhaps the reason they can walk out with you in the sun moroven is not you sharing power with them but that they have gained power of their own to sun walk a messenger from the council had said the evil words and left it as a poisonous flea in shewhomadeuss ear for a hearts beat we thought the messenger had spoken true we thought perrin stood in the light on his own power for one glorious second we believed but the look on his face wasnt triumphant it was frightened that one look was enough something was wrong the smoke began to curl off his skin just like in the movies the part that was still me still anita thought butthats not right all the vampires that id seen die by sunlight just burst into flames no smoke no waiting just instant inferno poof my puzzlement helped drag us back from the edge of terror it helped us watch smoke rise from perrins skin kept the horror from choking us flames burst along his skin and for the blink of an eye he was haloed by rich orange and gold flames his long yellow hair fluttered in the wind of the heat a moment to think how pretty then the flames ate over him and his skin crawled with fire perrin shrieked shrieked for scream did not describe that sound coming from a mans mouth we screamed because we had to all the horror the sorrow the fear had to come out our mouths or it would have burst out of our skin and shattered our minds we screamed because it was all that kept us from going mad i suddenly smelled forest that rich green smell of the deep woodshalf christmas tree pine and half freshturned earth i stared at the burning vampire my lifelong friend my brother but i was calm all i could smell was forest not the salt of ocean not anything then there was something elsewolf the sweet musk of wolf richard the thought of him made the scent of forest and fur override everything else the memory began to fade literally the images became misty and we began to draw away from that awful room perrins voice floated down all those years his scream turned distant by the fading he began by screaming her name the name id heard used for shewhomadethem moroven moroven but the screams changed became another name nemhain i had enough left of damians mind in me to understand that nemhain was her secret name her true name over and over again perrin screamed her name and damian echoed it his screams which were louder now as the memory faded his screams were her name nemhain we spilled back into the now into the floor of my bathroom into richards hand on my arm i started to look into his face but damian came to his knees as if he would run toward something i couldnt see i wrapped my hands around his waist and chest nathaniel had a death grip on damians arm we held him as if he could still run to perrins fire and destroy himself he was still screaming nemhain nemhain curse you he collapsed so suddenly that id have fallen back into the glass doors of the shower if richard hadnt caught me with a hand across my back nathaniel caught damian around one shoulder slowing his fall damian was still talking in a voice that was more sob than whisper curse you nemhain curse you he curled into a ball in my lap pushing me hard into the curve of richards arm nathaniel stroked damians hair over and over the way youd comfort a child he was still muttering her name and literally cursing her when the world suddenly drowned in fear it was as if terror could become air and you had to breathe it in or you would die but breathing it in was dying too it was all death all fear it roared through my head thoughtless formless fear so pure that it stopped my heartbeat for a second a hesitation as if my heart would simply stop from fear dying of fright wasnt just a saying there was a breathless moment where i waited for my heart to decide whether it would beat again or whether silence was better anything to escape anything the support of richards arm vanished and i was left with the cold press of glass behind me as if hed closed the door to support me so he wouldnt have to touch me anymore my breath came out in a rattle and my heart leaped in my chest and hurt as if it had bruised itself against my body my chest hurt my throat hurt and still the air was fear made real every breath seemed to draw her in deeper because it was a her it was nemhain moroven damians maker and perrins it wasnt just a superstition that you did not speak her name her name had conjured her power brought us to her attention i expected a voice to match the terror but there was silence a silence so loud that all i could hear was the beating of the blood in my veins my heart thundering inside my body then i heard another heartbeat faster more frightened even than mine how could he live so afraid i turned my head slowly because i couldnt do anything else i made myself turn through the fear and look at nathaniel his eyes were so wide they flashed white and he was gulping at the air as if he was having trouble breathing it down as if he would choke on the fear damian lay like the dead in my lap his eyes were closed and he wasnt breathing there was no heartbeat to hear the thought came shes taken what she gave him but on the heels of that thought came another hes mine i make his heart beat i make the blood move in his veins hes mine not yours not anymore mine nathaniels fingers dug into my arm and he was gasping as if some invisible hand were choking off his air i didnt think that was really happening but he was choking on the fear choking on her power i met his terrified gaze and tried to say his name tried to say anything but no sound came out i tried to call power anything but i couldnt think fear had stolen my thoughts my logic my power no no some small part of me knew that wasnt true she was just another vampire just another vampire i was a necromancer she could not do this to me part of me believed that but most of me was fighting too hard to breathe to think at all if id had air enough id have screamed not my fear but my frustration i didnt know how to fight this she wasnt trying to mark any of us as servants or seduce us or control us she simply had sent terror like some invisible wind to kill if it could or not she didnt care there was no malice here no strong emotion of any kind except the fear and the fear was a sending she felt nothing absolutely nothing i didnt know how to fight against nothing i didnt know what to do we were dying and i didnt know what to do jeanclaude called in my mind ma petite but the fear swelled upward and covered his words i knew he was talking in my head but i couldnt understand what he said the fear was drowning him out like one radio station overwhelming another his words were like the ghost sound of a distant station just under the sound of the terror but all i could hear all i could feel was morovens fear nathaniel collapsed against me mouth still open gasping as if the air were too thick to breathe me dying was one thing but it wouldnt just be me nathaniel and damian lay across my lap their hair mingling like bright and dark ribbons gregory knelt in front of me id almost forgotten he was there i usually had trouble reading his face when he was in halfleopard form but this face this face i could read even under spotted fur and yellow kittycat eyes the hunger showed through not lust hunger he said in that growling voice they smell like food i know richards voice and it turned me to him i stretched my hand out toward him hed dragged us out of damians memory maybe he could drag us out of this he looked unhappy angry i let my hand begin to fall but he took it at the last minute he took my hand in his instantly there was the sweet scent of forest and the musk of fur the fear receded a little like a wave of the ocean pulling back but there was another wave just off shore and you knew it was coming i could talk now and what i said was help me jeanclaudes voice swelled inside me pushed back the fear enough so i could hear his words you must raise theardeur ma petite you must she does not understand a clean lust free of pain and terror use our richard and i will be able to join my powers to yours and we can defeat her i stared up into the face of the man that jeanclaude had so casually called ours and knew he wasnt i could smell that wonderful musk the calm of pine and leaf mold but the look on his face was anything but calm his brown eyes were full of a fine shimmering anger touching his hand like this i should have felt that anger dance over my skin but i didnt all i could feel was morovens power like a storm hovering over me the only emotion left in me was terror ma petite can you hear me yes i managed a whisper then what is wrong i wanted to ask him what am i supposed to do wrestle richard to the floor and ravage him but all that came out was cant i cant cant what ma petite cant feed off richard it seemed silly to say that out loud while staring up into that handsome angry face but i couldnt concentrate enough to say it silently in my head talking was hard enough richard has agreed to this ma petite i shook my head dont believe it hes angry richard looked even angrier but he said out loud jeanclaudes telling the truth anita i agreed to feed theardeur his face was dark and frowning with his rage hed agreed but he didnt want to do it come to think of it neither did i i did not want to go down this metaphysical path again wed worked so hard to separate ourselves out and sex with richard would bind us close again i didnt want that wasnt sure my heart would survive being broken again theres only so much emotional super glue in a persons soul after that everything just stays broken i cannot hold morovens fear off forever ma petite you must act before my strength fails us all easy for you to say and it almost sounded like my own voice not breathy with terror but nicely sarcastic good its not your lilywhite ass on the line if i could fly to you i would but it is broad daylight and i cannot you and richard must do this for already i am losing against moroven i can feel her nightmare coming closer and when it comes close enough i will flee and save myself in hopes that when darkness falls there will be something left to rescue but if you and richard do what i fear you will do then darkness will come too late too late for damian too late for nathaniel and if you do not survive the deaths of your servant and your animal then richard and i may never see moonrise again is it so horrible to feed from our richard ma petite is that a fate worse than death put that way no but damn it why did it always come down to sex why wasnt there ever another way to fight jeanclaude answered inside my head because we can only fight with the tools at our command i am an incubus ma petite and seduction is both my curse and my greatest power if i had another magic to offer you i would but it is what i know it is almost all i know if the only tool youve got is a hammer every problem looks like a nail i said jeanclaude started to ask something but he was swept away everything was swept away by terror my heart was in my throat like id swallowed a fish i was choking on my own heart my skin was cold with the iciness of her power so afraid so very afraid richard jerked away from my hand stepped back from me and i couldnt read his face now it wasnt anger gregory knelt closer to us and stretched his upper body out over nathaniel and damian stretched out until his halfleopard face was only inches from mine he sniffed the air in front of me smells so good so yummy fear and flesh he let out a long sigh that tickled his breath along my skin fear and flesh i wasnt afraid of gregory i knew that but i was afraid and the fear was formless but it didnt want to be when gregory drew his lips back from his teeth in what was supposed to be a smile i gasped the fear coalesced around that flash of fangs that hungry gleam in those eyes i was suddenly not just afraid i was afraid of gregory afraid of the claws the teeth i was afraid in a way that id never been of him or any of my leopards he licked my face one quick movement i yipped a small highpitched frightened sound gregory growled next to my skin hmm do it again richard grabbed him and pulled him away from me stop playing with her gregory stayed crouched on the floor as if he were halfthinking about springing up and turning it all into a fight but what he said was alright i wont play with her he turned and put his face next to nathaniels gregory snapped his teeth just short of his skin and nathaniel screamed our fear had found a cause to wrap itself around there was no logic to it anything fearful would have done we just happened to have a leopardman so conveniently at hand gregory laughed richard jerked him back and dragged him as far away as the bathroom would allow i said stop playing with them you said stop playing with her i did leave them all alone richard said gregory stood and in leopardman form he was as tall as richard dont tell me you dont want to play with them too yes yes i want to play but im not going to why not gregory asked because you dont torment your friends gregory micah said from the doorway with richards newest girlfriend beside him she was about my size with dark brunette hair cut just above her shoulders she was wearing a pale blue skirt and a white blouse with little blue flowers all over it sandals and carefully painted toenails completed the outfit she was clinging to micahs hand and arm with both her hands you didnt usually hang on to someone like that unless they were your boyfriend i realized there was an emotion i could feel through the fearjealousy what the hell was she doing hanging on to micah she shivered in the doorway and her eyes lost focus as if she was hearing things no one else could hear she whispered what is that fear gregory said oh she said in a small voice and she pulled away from micah and walked into the room she stopped staring down at us then looked away she blushed and met richards eyes and blushed harder gregory came to stand beside her his furred form towering over her you want to play too dont you she looked down at us again and this time her eyes werent human id seen that particular trick a thousand times but this time i screamed screamed like a tourist and nathaniel pressed himself against me as if he were trying to push himself out the other side damian just lay in my lap like the fear had already killed him get clair out of here richard said and his voice held that first edge of growl shes too new if you bring her beast like this shell bleed people i made a small sound in my throat a helpless sound micah took clair by the arm and started leading her toward the door she didnt fight him but she made him pull a little while her animal eyes in that pretty face stared at us she wasnt embarrassed anymore there was nothing human enough left in her to be embarrassed about nudity whats happening to them micah asked damians first master is trying to kill them richard said how i wasnt sure if he were asking how shed kill us or how it had happened scare them to death micah almost had clair to the door how can you stop it richard looked at micah then i let anita feed on me and jeanclaude comes riding to the rescue the growl had left his voice and all that remained was tiredness and a sort of worldweariness as if hed seen too much done too much and didnt want to do it anymore micah and richard stared at each other for a moment then micah gave a small nod keep everybody alive he said and he pulled clair through the doorway she grabbed the door frame they smell so good micah threw her over his shoulders and the movement startled her enough that she let go of the door and he carried her out of sight her words floated back no i dont want to go richard tried to get his jeans unfastened onehanded and it wasnt working i need some help here gregory the leopardman looked at him going to fuck while you have the chance richard growled at him and i made a small sound nathaniel whimpered i knew in the front of my head that this was stupid that richard would not hurt me not in that way but the fear had a mind of its own nathaniel was a wereleopard but he was terrified too no logic just fear if i shift the pants will shred and i dont have extra clothes over here anymore richard said i thought your control was better than that ulfric gregory growled richard turned some of that anger loose and yelled i can taste their fear on my tongue down my throat as if ive already swallowed them he balled his good hand into the torn front of his tshirt and pulled he was suddenly standing over me naked from the waist up with a look in his eyes that would have frightened me even if id been myself it was a wild fierce look made up of hatred and lust hatred and lust in a mans eyes is a bad combination it seemed to take physical effort for him to turn away from me and look at gregory again did you feel that gregorys only answer was a low growl that made nathaniel whimper again god help me shes afraid to see me nude and i fucking love it i love that shes afraid of me and i hate myself for loving it theardeur will rise but god alone knows what well do before it does with this much fear with her i dont trust my control and whatever happens i want clothes when its over because im going to want to get the hell out of here he undid his belt with one hand and squeezed the top button of his pants the button popped open and still gripping the top of the pants he made a rolling motion with his hand and the buttons snapped open in a long rolling line the front of his pants spilled open and he spilled out either he wasnt wearing any underwear or it couldnt keep him contained id seen richard nude enough times to lose track the sight of him nude had excited me made me nervous afraid in that ohmygod whereamigoingtoputitall sort of way envious when id lost my naked privileges angry when he was being shitty or trying to rub my face in the fact that i still found him handsome but he wasnt mine anymore all those emotions and lust and love but never fear never that feeling that he was physically so much larger than i was so much stronger so much hed never hurt me physically and id never been afraid of him physically but i was now i was afraid the way virgins are supposed to be afraid when white slavers snatch them away afraid of being ravished afraid of him using that body in mine afraid in a way that id never been afraid of anyone that i loved i put my hands over my eyes like a child if i couldnt see him he couldnt hurt me stupid silly but i couldnt stop the way i felt couldnt change the way i felt i felt a scream growing in my throat a scream that was waiting to be touched i knew i was going to do it and i couldnt stop it but it was as if he felt that scream waiting to come out because he didnt touch me i felt his face on the other side of my hands like heat a moment before i felt his breath against the back of my hands if hed touched me the fear would have spilled out my mouth but he didnt touch me not with his body his breath was hot against my skin so hot i felt damian being lifted out of my lap i wasnt sure how i knew he hadnt crawled out on his own but i did anita look at me his voice was very soft and very close each word breathing out against my hands please anita please look at me his voice floated through the fear eased the tightness in my throat relaxed the muscles along my shoulders anita look at me please he whispered i could breathe past my pulse again please he whispered and he touched fingertips to the back of my hand the lightest of touches and my hands lowered an inch two inches and i could see his face from between my fingers his eyes were pure chocolate brown and at that moment they were gentle there was no trace of anger or lust nothing but patience and gentleness this was the part of him id fallen in love with once he touched my wrists gently and lowered my hands away from my face he smiled and said better i started to nod then damian grabbed my leg and the fear roared back and the scream ripped out of my throat it wasnt just morovens power it was damians fear of that power and the fact that i couldnt shield against it i screamed and richards mouth was suddenly on mine he kissed me a gentle press of lips fear thrilled through me all the way to my fingertips as if terror were an electric current i shoved him away from me i waited for the anger to come rushing through me to ride over the fear and everything else but it didnt come in fact the fear blossomed into panic panic that freezes your body numbs your mind makes you forget everything youve ever learned about how to make your body a weapon and all that is left is a small screaming voice inside your head that makes you a victim if you cant think and cant move then you are a victim thats why panic will get you killed richard knelt in front of me only as far away as my arms had moved him there was nothing gentle in his face now he looked eager anticipatory he was on one knee the other leg turned so that he shielded himself from my view the body language was modest the look on his face was not he leaned in toward me and sniffed drawing the air in deep so that his chest rose and fell with it his eyes closed as if hed smelled the sweetest of flowers his head thrown back just a little when he opened his eyes they werent brown they were amber dark orange wolf amber there was a moment where seeing those eyes in the tan of his face was breathtaking then damians fingers dug into my leg a fresh wave of panic poured through me tore a scream from my throat and damian echoed it i had a confused image of bodies hands being held down cloth ripping the weight of a body pinning us to the table and a hand wrapped around my wrist and jerked me up and away damians nails ripped through my skin as he tried to hold on richard tore me away from damians hands his horror his memories and his fear the moment damian couldnt touch me the panic faded a little i could breathe again the fear was still there pulsing through me but it was diminished some it was like the difference between drowning in the ocean and drowning in a fish pond better less frightening but just as dead i looked back at damian and he lay on the floor his hand outstretched and even from a distance i reached back for him i could feel his need richard pulled on my arm sharp sudden it threw me off balance and he used that momentary stumble to swing me in against his body my arm behind my back with his hand still on my wrist i should have been more interested in the pain but it was the sensation of being suddenly pressed against his naked body that overwhelmed me it was not just being pressed against a mans body even a lovely body that unnerved me it was as if my body remembered him remembered what it was like to be pressed against this flesh these arms and with the skin memory it was as if the emotional scars tore open and spilled my heart out into my skin you fight so hard so long to cut someone out of your heart but its not always your heart that betrays you but in among the emotional debris i felt moroven pull back we hadnt needed theardeur to confuse her all wed needed was how richard and i felt about each other just as moroven didnt understand pure lust she didnt understand love no matter how broken i dont know if the emotion frightened her or if she simply couldnt understand it she wasnt the only one we were touching and the triumvirate was working just fine wed both thrown down our shields to help jeanclaude raise theardeur and save us but shields protect you from so many things what is love what does it feel like in its rawest form lust need desire and that aching want as if the center of your body was carved out and hollow and the only thing that can fill it is the person that youre touching i loved richard i couldnt hide how i felt couldnt deny it i was laid bare in his arms in every way for a moment i felt him feel the exact same way then i felt something else shame he was ashamed not that he loved me but that part of him was angry that moroven had fled hed wanted to drink my fear while he fucked me that was the thought that came not in words but in confused images i felt that to him my terror was almost the same as the terror of the deer hed chased down and killed fear even a little fear made everything betterfood and sex he let me go stepped away so we wouldnt be touching he clanged his shields tight into place and left me standing alone i was shaking and couldnt understand why richards face got that angry look he used to hide what he was thinking he grabbed his pants and went for the door youre as horrified by it as i am he said and was gone i wanted to say he was wrong but in a way he was right i wasnt horrified by the fact that he liked a little fear with his sex a little rough play most of the shapeshifters did i think it had something to do with them being programmed to chase animals and kill them if they didnt get off on the fear their human sides might come to the forefront and cripple them for the kill or maybe that wasnt it maybe it was something else maybe it was that raina and gabriel had been attracted by latent talent i dont know but i wasnt horrified with what richard had wanted the fact that he thought of taking me while morovens fear rode me hadnt bothered me it was mild compared to some of the things that my wereleopards liked just because i didnt participate didnt mean i was blind no that wasnt the problem i dropped to my knees and stayed there id felt that he loved me still but id also felt that his hatred for everything he was was stronger and more important than his feelings for me id thought he loathed his beast but it was more than that he hated what he liked in the bedroom wed been lovers for months off and on and id never known that he was a closet sadist how tight he must have to hold his own leash for me not to have known a hand touched my shoulder and i jumped nathaniel was staring at me with those lavender eyes are you okay my eyes felt hot and my throat tight god i didnt want to cry i shook my head because i didnt trust what would come out if i opened my mouth no sobbing no screaming no hysterics i hadnt realized until moments ago that somewhere in the depths of my soul id held out hope hope that richard and i would work out somehow i thought id moved onstupid i hadnt moved on id just hidden it away i couldnt give myself completely to anyone because i was still in love with richard how fucking stupid was that he did love me but he loved his shame more he hadnt run because i could accept his beast hed run because living with me he couldnt pretend he couldnt pretend to be normal id never been much on pretending to be something i wasnt and lately id gotten even worse at it could you pretend to be someone else and truly be happy i dont think so nathaniel put his arms around me slowly as if he were afraid id stop him but i didnt i needed to be held right then i needed to be held by someone who wanted me wanted all of me the good and the bad the nice and the scary richard had been pressed naked against my body and even the promise of that hadnt been enough micah appeared in the doorway dr lillian is in the kitchen looking at richards wound he looked from nathaniel to damian then to me richard looks shaken what happened i held out my hand and he came to me without me having to say a word i buried my face against his shoulder and that hot hot tightness spilled out of my eyes and my lips i balled my hands into his shirt and cried nathaniel was at my back rubbing his hands over and over my skin making soothing noises what happened micah asked again it was damian who answered and his voice let me know that he was close before his hand patted my shoulder richard hates himself more than he loves anyone else it was only in that moment that i realized that damian and nathaniel had still been connected to me when richard and i had had our moment my first thought was he would hate knowing that they know his big dark secret my second thought was who the fuck cares i clung to micah with nathaniel at my back and damian patting me awkwardly on the shoulder gregory growled in his leopard voice what just happened i thought you and richard were going to fuck micah saved me the trouble of saying anything get out gregory now before you say something even more stupid i didnt mean now micahs voice held that edge of growl to it enough that it sparked his beast awake inside him and i felt it curl inside his body like brushing up against a cat in the dark a cat that youve shared a bed with until the feel of that fur that small body is like your pillows or your sheets just a part of a safe nights sleep comfort companionship warmth and the knowledge that there are claws in the dark in case things go wrong his beast flared mine and it felt so warm so comfortable as those two invisible bodies rubbed against each other the feel of his neck against my face his skin wet with my tears our beasts resting against each other his arms around me and i had one of those moments where i understood that if i let him close enough his arms could be home nathaniel kissed me very lightly on the shoulder dont be sad anita please dont be sad i turned my head enough to see his face there were tears on his cheeks i opened one arm so that i could wrap it around his waist and hug them both i let myself sink in against them let them hold me let myself cling to them both what is love sometimes its just letting yourself be who and what you are and letting the person youre supposed to love be who and what he is too or maybe what and who they are when i finished having hysterics and everyone had rinsed enough blood off them to be presentable or at least not make my neighbors call the police i got dressed micah had pointed out that wed probably all be going to bed so why bother getting dressed but i needed clothes black everything from the skin out including the shoulder holster browning hipower and hidden under my hair the hilt of a really big knife it sat in a custommade sheath along my spine that attached to the shoulder holster though it could be worn without but not as comfortably micah tried to point out that i probably didnt need that much weaponry to go into my own kitchen i looked at him and he stopped no one else complained have you ever tried to get dressed with three men watching you i wanted micah and it seemed shitty to kick nathaniel out and damian we were all afraid what might happen if the vampire was separated from me by a room and a door he and i had had sex and hed seen me very naked and even walked behind me into the bedroom but i still made him turn and face the wall while i dressed maybe the wereanimals were finally affecting my view of nudity it just seemed strangely more intimate to dress in front of someone than to be naked or maybe my modesty had just had all the shocks it could handle for one day speaking of which if i hadnt thought it was cowardly and childish id have hidden in the bedroom until richard left but it was cowardly and it was childish damn it besides nathaniel promised hed make coffee i hated eating before ten oclock but coffee before ten was a necessity damian had done one thing that made me feel better hed asked for a robe his request made me realize something none of the vampires i knew did casual nudity theyd be naked for a good cause but wouldnt just walk around nude like the shapeshifters did funny id never thought about it before nathaniel had fetched damians very own robe from the basement and had taken a side trip to put on a pair of jeans himself he got brownie points for dressing without me having to ask damians robe looked like something straight out of victorian england and maybe it was it was a dark rich blue velvet and heavy almost more like a coat than a robe there were worn places at the elbows and the cuffs and hem were beginning to fray but the whole robe screamed expensive damian wrapped it around himself like it was his favorite teddy bear once he belted it in place it covered him from neck to ankle only his hands peeking out thats not a robe is it i asked he shook his head as he pulled his hair free of the collar so it spilled like a surprised red splash against all that blue its a dressing gown he said i nodded as if i understood exactly what that meant then i offered him my hand not because i wanted to touch him though that was there but because of the lost look in his eyes and the way his hands kept rubbing the thinning velvet as if touching it made him feel safer he took my hand and gave me the first smile id seen since shewhomadehim had reared her vicious head the smile was shaky round the edges but it firmed up when he touched my hand id been afraid that when i touched him again that it would change that thered be lust or love or something else i couldnt deal with but that wasnt what came through the touch of his hand what came through was a sense of safety relief that id reached out to touch him first if i touched him first i couldnt be that angry im not mad i said his eyes widened just a little you know what im thinking dont you know what im thinking no ask him if he knows what youre feeling nathaniel said i just asked that no you didnt i thought about it for a second he was right okay what am i feeling nothing damian said you are very carefully feeling nothing i thought about that too and just nodded he was right i felt numb at most relieved that damians need for safety overrode other complications but really truly i felt nothing i felt like one of those shells that washed up on the sand so pretty so clean so white and pink and so empty that place inside me where richard had been meant to fit to fill was empty but not empty like a wound empty like that seashell all slick and wet and waiting waiting for someone else to come along and slip inside and make that emptiness into their protection their shield their armor their home even thinking it that clearly i still felt almost nothing i realized it was close to that static emptiness where i went when i had to kill but it wasnt staticky it was a peaceful emptiness like gazing out to a horizon of just water and sky peace quiet but not empty just waiting waiting for what damian squeezed my hand i smiled at him but knew it didnt reach my eyes i smiled because he smiled at me more reflex than emotion inside was nothing it was a little like being in shock shock is natures insulation the thing that shuts you down so you can heal or sometimes so you can die without hurting or being afraid well i wasnt going to die you didnt die of a broken heart it just felt like you were going to i knew from personal experience that if you just kept moving acting as if you werent bleeding inside you didnt die and eventually you stopped wanting to micah came to stand in front of me once it had seemed odd to have such serious intelligence out of kittycat eyes now they were just micahs eyes he touched my face and his hand was so warm that i wanted to rub my cheek against it but i didnt i dont know why but i didnt i just stood there with micah touching my face and damian clinging to my hand i could feel that my face was as empty as i felt inside you dont have to go in there micah said yes i said i do he put his other hand up so that he framed my face between his warm warm hands no anita you dont have to damian was rubbing his fingers across my knuckles the way he did when he was worried that i would be angry with someone i wasnt angry or maybe he was worried about another emotion all together damian could help me be calmer help me control my temper and be less ruthless or less quick to kill but your servant can only give you what they have to share damian could not help me fight fear or loneliness or sorrow because he carried too much of it inside himself today the only real comfort he could offer was the touch of a friendly hand but there are worse things to offer i closed my eyes not to hide from micahs serious face but to bask in the warmth of his hands i had to close my eyes so i could feel his hands and not be distracted by the color of his eyes i let myself do what id wanted to do since he touched my face i rubbed my cheek against first one of his hands then the other his hands moved with me so that it was like a dance his hands against my face my hair and me rubbing against him catlike he kissed me somewhere in all that movement with my face writhing between his hands his lips were soft and full and he pressed them against mine firm but gentle i opened my eyes to his face so close i couldnt focus on his eyes he drew back enough so we could see each other but kept my face between his hands i would spare you this if youd let me i put my hands over both of his so that we held each other you mean make my apologies for me and damian and i go hide out in the bedroom someone had propped the front door back into place the door hung crooked in the frame and a little light leaked around the edges but it wasnt bad damian had grabbed at my shoulder at the first line of light that crawled across the floor id patted his hand but didnt know what else to do micah informed us that hed shut the drapes in the kitchen so it was as dim as he could make it id smiled at him for that he always seemed to anticipate my wants sometimes it bugged me but not today today id take all the help i could get damian would have been the perfect excuse to hang out in a darker part of the house unfortunately almost as much as i didnt want to see richard i didnt want to be alone with damian men can be sort of funny after youve had sex with them some get downright possessive others get emotional and still others just want a chance to do it again none of that sounded like something i wanted to deal with right that minute sure he felt calm against my skin but that didnt mean that once we were alone hed be able to stop himself from being male after all he was one i just wasnt willing to risk it if you have to look at it that way yes its not that i have to look at it that way micah its the way it is it would be hiding out she wont hide nathaniel said voice soft and full of sorrow that i couldnt understand and just the sound in his voice made me glad at that moment that we werent touching whatever he was feeling didnt sound fun in the least isnt discretion ever the better part of valor with you micah asked and there was a look in his eyes that was close to pain but strangely of all the men in my life he was one of the few whose mind and emotions i couldnt read i could read his face his eyes his body but his mind and internal emotions were his own no i said never well almost never i patted his hands and stepped back just enough so that he had to let me go or hold on when he knew i didnt want him to he let his hands fall away from me and the first hint of anger trickled into his eyes i dont like seeing you hurt i dont like seeing me hurt either i said that almost made him smile trying to make jokes i guess thats a good sign trying only trying i thought it was funny no nathaniel said no it wasnt he squeezed my arm as he walked by ill get the coffee started youre not going to wait for us i asked he turned back just short of the kitchen doorway he was smiling i know youll get in here eventually because you couldnt stand yourself if you chickened out but by the time you talk yourself into it i could already have coffee made i frowned at him and just a tiny thread of anger came with it damian grabbed for my hand again and i didnt fight it dont get mad at me nathaniel said im about to grind fresh coffee beans for you and use the new french press jeanclaude got you i frowned harder i know how much you hate to admit that you like the french press but you do like it it doesnt make enough coffee at one time i said even to me it sounded churlish ill tell jeanclaude that you would like a really really big french press he said it completely deadpan and only the faintest of smiles and the tiniest gleam in his eyes let me know he was going to add something size queen then he was through the door before i could close my mouth and decide whether to yell at him or laugh nathaniels attempt to make me laugh accomplished one thing it made me feel better though i have to admit the smell of freshly ground coffee helped lure me through the door i couldnt let one exfiancé stand between me and my coffee could i not and keep my selfrespect so in we went richard was sitting at the kitchen table on the side nearest the door dr lillian was standing over him finishing the bandaging of his entire right shoulder and arm she glanced at us as we came through the door but most of her attention stayed on her patient the first time id met her shed been gray and furry but now she was a woman of about fifty slender with hair as gray and white as her fur was when she was in rat form there was always something neat about dr lillian as if her clothes never got too dirty and she always had medical supplies when she needed them she never seemed to panic in the human world she was head of one of the few local emergency trauma centers that had survived the cutbacks but she spent more and more time helping the semipermanently furry since marcus had died we were really short on doctors which explained why there was a bodyguard leaning on the other side of the doorway watching us move into the room he was slender a little shy of six feet though something about the way he stood made him seem shorter a tangle of black hair fell into his eyes and they glittered like black jewels from that fall of hair his graceful hands caressed the edges of his leather jacket and i caught glimpses of at least four knife hilts before he let the jacket fall closed there might have been six hilts but i was sure of four and that was plenty id been told the wererats were here plural but i hadnt thought about it hadnt really heard it id been so busy not seeing richard that i hadnt really looked at the room id strapped on a knife and my gun but i might as well have been unarmed for all the good they would have done me if fredo had meant me harm i hadnt seen him hed been standing just inside the door opposite the side i came through and i hadnt seen him shit i managed to keep it off my face i nodded to fredo he nodded back i wanted to say something but i didnt trust my voice i was thinking stupid stupid and that kind of stupid could get me killed nathaniel was at the back of the kitchen by the sink under the window that wed once had to replace because of shotgun damage the window was fine now but i wasnt i lived in a world where i had to see the bad guys fredo was on our side but he was definitely a bad guy not a bad guy that would kill me but one that could and id walked into the room right past him it was a rookie mistake that let me know just how badly i was doing i kept walking until i stood beside nathaniel with our backs to the room damian trailed me like a lost puppy that had found a likely handout id let go of his hand when i realized i hadnt seen fredo when id felt the movement of fredo behind me i wanted my hands free i knew that damian needed to touch me but i needed my hands free i was feeling claustrophobic the kitchens a goodsized room when the curtains are open its bright and shiny but with the curtains shut and the overhead lights on it was dim and shadowy and i wanted light i wanted to step out on the deck and watch the trees with the morning light on them i didnt want to stand here in the dark and hold the vampires hand i wanted a choice and i didnt seem to have any i was suddenly so angry and it wasnt damian i was mad at the far drapes moved and clair came back in from the deck all smiles its a wonderful view thanks i said and went back to watching nathaniel make coffee if i just kept not looking anywhere else maybe i wouldnt let my anger get the best of me i wanted to rant at richard to scream and accuse and i so did not want to do that in front of his new girlfriend or my boyfriends did i just sayboyfriends i put my hands on the coolness of the counter closed my eyes and just tried not to think again not thinking was good not feeling was better a hand laid itself over mine and the moment it did i was calmer i knew without opening my eyes who it was because only one mans touch calmed me calmed me because hed spent centuries perfecting his calmness i opened my eyes and met damians green gaze i wanted to hate him i wanted to be furious at being trapped with him tied but i couldnt be with him touching my hand with his eyes so ready to fill with pain i couldnt be angry not with him shit i couldnt breathe not a good solid breath he took my anger but he couldnt take the fear i jerked away from him i need to be angry right now damian its all ive got a hand touched my arm and i jerked away from it nathaniels eyes were cautious rather than hurt whats wrong i moved back from both of them bumping up against the island hard enough that the dishes rattled in the cabinets anita micahs voice he was at the end of the island looking at me with his serious kittycat eyes i couldnt seem to get a deep enough breath it was as if the room was getting smaller nathaniel was in front of me and either side of the island was blocked by the other two i felt cornered trapped in so many ways boys dr lillian said i think anita needs a little air i cant leave damian alone i said but my voice sounded choked she came and moved them all away from me shooing them back come on a little fresh air and some open spaces doctors orders she held out her hand to me but was careful not to touch me as if she knew what i was feeling better than i did she eased me to the drapes and pushed me through them onto the open deck the light was dazzling and i was blind with it for a moment when i could see again she was as far away as the wraparound deck would allow her to be and still be on it she didnt say anything just looked out at the view i started to say something then thought fuck it shes right i went to the rail and looked out at the trees the trees were a kaleidoscope of color the wind stirred all that gold and orange and a cascade of leaves like an upturned bag of gold showered down around me the sky was that flawless blue that only happens here in october as if the sky were closer fresher newly minted blue as if all the clear skies until now had been practice for these few weeks of blue blue sky i breathed in the heavy gold of the sun like pale syrup on the leaves it smelled like autumn that crisp clean sharp smell that is made up of dying leaves chill nights and the warm breath of the day before night falls you could taste fall on your tongue like some kind of bread or cake something thick and nutty and sweet i took in as much air as i could and let it out slow as if my body didnt want to let it go i stood there leaning on the railing drinking in the sunlight the colors and the rich scent of autumn woods i was smiling and calm all on my own by the time dr lillian spoke she stayed on her end of the deck as if she wasnt sure how much room i needed feel better yes and i smiled at her though i felt a little embarrassed sorry that i lost it in there youve had some big changes in a very short space of time anita how much do you know that youve somehow tied yourself to damian and nathaniel somewhat the way that jeanclaude tied you and richard to him that you did it by accident that its a miracle no ones dead i sighed and the smile was gone yeah i could have handled it better no one could handle all that you handle anita better or worse you keep surprising all of us us who i asked she smiled all of us the shapeshifters the vampires all of us i cant really speak for everybody but i know you are a constant amazement to the wererats we never know what youre going to do next she leaned against the rail with her arms crossed over her clean white shirt neither do i not anymore that loss of control issue again isnt it you know i really dont want to psychoanalyze myself right now fine she raised her hands as if to show she was unarmed but the next time you start getting claustrophobic and you need some air get some air okay it was that obvious i asked if i say yes you wont like it because you hate for anyone to be able to read you if i say no id be lying and you hate that too im just impossible to get along with arent i not impossible but not exactly easy either she gave a small laugh to soften it and said do you feel up to going back inside i took another deep breath and nodded sure she nodded too good be careful when you move the drapes dont want to flash too much of this beautiful sun onto damian i nodded and felt the good air leaving me before i stepped back through the sliding glass doors i was wondering what was i going to do with him i couldnt keep touching him all day could i i was willing to do it up to a point but all day would drive me mad especially if it was not just today but every day i suddenly saw an endless stream of days with damian permanently attached to me it was claustrophobic i half expected him to leech onto me when i came through the door but he didnt i stood there in the sudden dimness of the curtained kitchen letting my eyes adjust my eyes automatically turned to where richard had been but i forced myself to look for fredo first hed moved closer like a good bodyguard leaning against the small twoseater table in the breakfast nook the white roses that jeanclaude sent every week framed fredos darkness his fingers were tracing the edges of his jacket again id never seen fredo use his knives but something told me that hed get to his blades faster than id get to my gun not to mention my knife the back sheath was really an emergency backup not a main weapon if id wanted a blade as a main weapon id have put on the wrist sheaths i eased into the room away from fredo not because he meant me harm but simply on principle i wasnt at my best and he was the only professional bad guy in the room so i treated him with the caution he deserved besides i had to redeem my earlier stupidity somehow and the days when i would have picked a fight just to reassure myself i was still tough were long ago and far away being a girl that phase had been shorter anyway we are much more practical creatures than men as a general rule richard was still at the table clair was beside him now she had a hand on his good shoulder her small hand very pale against the darkness of his skin she was watching me her eyes were blue a dark sort of gray blue but blue nonetheless micah stood at the side of the island closest to the table he seemed tense but it was a flicker of his eyes that helped me find damian and nathaniel the vampire had wedged himself into the corner between the cabinets and the sink he was holding his knees tight to his chest his face resting on them so that he could hide his eyes hed managed to hide almost all of himself in the blue velvet dressing gown and the fall of his own hair nathaniel was beside him on the floor he was touching damians hands but that was all nathaniel looked up at me and there was something in his violet eyes pain helplessness something i wasnt mad anymore and i didnt feel claustrophobic as i crossed the kitchen to them i knelt on the other side of damian and looked a question at nathaniel i thought my touch might help him until you got back inside i nodded it sounded logical he didnt want me to touch him much he wasnt hurt when he said it it was just a fact i touched damians bowed head his hand suddenly wrapped around my wrist the movement had been too fast to see which didnt happen often to me with vamps and shouldnt have happened with this one the speed of it and the strength in his hand made me gasp he raised up and gave me the full look of those emerald eyes i was suddenly struck by the sheer beauty of him it was almost a physical force as if beauty were a hammer and id taken a hit directly between the eyes my god nathaniel whispered it took more effort than was pretty for me to tear my glance away from damian once i saw nathaniels face it was easier and i could breathe again do you see it too i asked he nodded its like a really good facelift not much change but the changes are just right what are the two of you talking about damian asked his talking made me look at him again and i was held spellbound hed always been handsome but not like this its vampire powers somehow i thought as my servant hed be less able to do that not more i dont think its mind games anita nathaniel said he reached out to touch damians face damian pulled back what whats wrong with my face absolutely nothing i said richard beat the shit out of you but theres not a mark left he raised his own hand up and touched his mouth its healed he said i nodded and it was as if i was mesmerized by him was it mind tricks or had more than just the damage healed i couldnt tell and i wasnt sure whether nathaniel was a better judge than i was micah can you look at him micah came to stand at the end of the island closest to us the look on his face was enough before he said wow but was it mind tricks thats what i wanted to know i reached up to touch his face and he didnt lean away from me as he had nathaniel id seen part of his memory of what had happened to him at the hands of other men men that shewhomadehim had given him to so she could feed off his pain and fear so i understood some of the homophobia but nathaniel wasnt a threat to him not in that way in other ways he was a threat to everyone who saw him oh well i touched damians cheek and it was solid but it was all solid nathaniel was right it was like a really good facelift there wasnt that much difference what was it about his face that was different what had kept damians face from being this heartstopping before id never made a study of his face i wasnt sure i knew him well enough to know what had changed maybe my confusion showed on my face because nathaniel said his mouth his lips were too thin for his face now theyre full and they match now that nathaniel had said it i could remember damians mouth and this wasnt it was it just mind glamour it had to be didnt it i closed my eyes and touched his mouth but id never run my fingers over his lips i didnt remember them i kept my eyes closed and used my hands to guide me i kissed him soft but firm id kissed this mouth less than two hours ago and it wasnt the same mouth the lips were fuller as if hed gotten a collagen injection while we werent looking i drew back just enough to see his face clearly there was a slight uptilt to his eyes and they were bigger not much but just a little or was it that his eyebrows had a wider arch to them were his lashes thicker darker shit whats wrong damian asked again and this time there was a thread of fear in his voice ill get a mirror micah said and turned and went for one this isnt possible i said is there anything i can do dr lillian was at the far end of the island damian looked up at her and she said oh my what he asked and his voice was frantic i patted his hand youre fine in fact youre beautiful the fear spread from his voice to his eyes what are you talking about micah came back in with a hand mirror he simply held it out toward me i took it but damian shut his eyes tight as if he were afraid to look its okay damian i promise you look wonderful but i sort of understood the fear because even if it was an improvement how weird would it be for the face youve had for a thousand years to suddenly change id have had trouble with changes to the face id only had for part of a lifetime he was shaking his head over and over again please damian just look its good not bad i promise he opened his eyes a little at a time but once he saw enough his eyes went wide and he took the mirror from me he moved it around so he could see his eyes his mouth and there was some change to his nose that he could see and i couldnt like i said i hadnt made a study of his face but he had he touched his face tentatively as if he expected it to feel different than it looked he dropped the mirror and nathaniel caught it before it hit the floor what is happening to me i opened my mouth to say i dont know but micah said i think we need to call jeanclaude we know hes up good idea i thought yeah i think so i actually got up to go for the phone but richard was at the end of the island across from the phone and i suddenly didnt want to be that close to the phone his right arm was taped to his chest completely immobile like lillian had started to mummify him and stopped he wasnt looking at me he was looking lower at damian healing and a little facial reconstruction you are good he said and his tone made it not a compliment i didnt do it on purpose i know and those two words just sounded tired jeanclaude told me once that he couldnt remember what he and asher looked like before belle but hed seen others before and after belle never chose people who werent pretty but some afterward were more beautiful than before it wasnt a common thing even in her bloodline but it happened often enough to start the legend that it always happened to her blood i looked at him and when did you and jeanclaude find time for all this information sharing when you deserted us for more than half a year we had a lot of time to talk and i had a lot of questions i couldnt argue with the deserted us part so i ignored it i asked him once if his body and face were vampire tricks and he said no vampire tricks arent real richard said this and he motioned at damian with his good arm is but damians been a vampire for a long time if this kind of change was going to kick in then it should have done it by now im not of belles line damian said he was touching his face with just the tips of his fingers as if that made it less awful or something but anita is richard said through her ties to jeanclaude she is a part of belles line im not a vampire i said you feed like one he said anger was finally rearing its ugly comforting head if i could get mad id feel better and richards presence wouldnt bother me so much youre as tied to jeanclaude as i am its only luck thats kept theardeur from you richard next time we get an extra special treat maybe itll be your turn i cant heal with sex and it looks like you can did you raise the munin when you were with damian dr lillian asked i shook my head id have noticed raina being around shes sort of hard to miss i heard a distant echo in my head rainas ghost saying so glad you noticed i shut that particular metaphysical door tight locked it and bound it with silver chains all metaphorical or metaphysical but all real just the same a part of raina lived inside me and nothing i could do seemed able to rid me of her completely i could control her to a point but not exorcise her from me god knows id tried if it wasnt raina then one of you was able to heal during the sex dr lillian said she said it like it was just logical two plus two is four that kind of thing i was shaking my head long before i realized i was doing it shaking my head over and over i didnt do this then who did richard asked his face wore the arrogance of his anger when he looked like that he was both more handsome somehow and less approachable it was one of the few times i was sure that richard was aware of just how handsome he was when he was angry enough to want to strike out and cause someone pain why does anger make people pretty rage doesnt rage makes you ugly but a little anger that just seems to add spice one of natures cruelties or maybe its to keep us from killing each other more often i dont know but he didnt look like this after the sex he didnt look like this in the bathroom when mor shewhomadehim popped up he didnt look like this in the hallway i took a step closer to richard or the bedroom another step or the living room another step and i was as close to him as i could stand and still see his face comfortably he was almost a foot taller than i was there were angle issues the closest person connected to jeanclaude in this room at that moment wasnt me he looked down that perfect profile at me i didnt go near him jeanclaude might know the answer to this micah said he was behind me not too close but close enough that if id done something stupid i wondered if hed planned on interfering micah is right dr lillian said yeah micah is always right richard said and his voice held emotions the words didnt even hint at it was the first real sign of jealousy id seen part of me was happy about it and the moment that tiny glad spark reared its ugly head i knew better i was ashamed of myself and i hate that most of the time he is right but my voice wasnt angry we needed answers not temper tantrums i made a motion with both hands if youll let me get to the phone he moved but looked puzzled for a second i wondered if hed been picking a fight on purpose and if he had been why picking fights was more my thing than richards later id worry about it later i had my hand on the phone when it rang which scared me shit i picked up the receiver and must have sounded at least a little angry because jeanclaude said what has happened now ma petite i was so relieved to hear his voice i forgot to be mad you have no idea how glad i am to hear your voice i can hear the relief in your voice ma petite again i ask what else has happened how do you know anything happened i asked and was already willing to be suspicious i felt damians master flee from your and richards emotions only the two of you could turn such a simple thing as lust into something sohe seemed unable to find a word and finally settled fordisappointing youre talking to the wrong third of the triumvirate jeanclaude i can put him on if you want to talk to him non non tell me what is happening cant you read my mind everyone else seems to be able to ma petite do we have time for childishness no i said sullenly but richard tells me that some vamps in belles line turn prettier after a while is that true the change from human to vampire can bring on small changes to the appearance it is rare even for belles line butoui it does happen so you really werent this beautiful once as i told our inquisitive richard i do not know i know that many acted as if i were this beautiful but i have no paintings of my old face i have no way to remember after centuries i honestly do not know for certain belle never made much of any of us that changed because she enjoyed the false rumors that her touch beautified all if she fussed about those who did become more lovely then it would tarnish her legend you have met her ma petite she likes her legend i shivered id met belle secondhand through a metaphysical possession or two she was scary and not just because of how powerful she was she was scary because of her character flaws a certain blindness to anything she didnt understand like love friendship commitment as opposed to slavery she didnt seem to see much difference between the two yeah belle likes her legend so much shes beginning to believe it as you like ma petite but it makes it difficult to find truth in her court fine well never know if you and asher were this beautiful before asher says his hair was not the color of gold before so that we do know i was getting distracted okay fine but the point is when did the beautification take place you became a vampire and when you rose the first night you were changed due to the vicious nature of some when they experience their first blood lust it is not always easy to see beauty but it happens soon after they are brought into their new lives i didnt argue the life part id been too confused too long about what was life and what wasnt so after a thousand years you are what you are right there was silence on the other end of the phone i couldnt even hear him breathing which didnt mean anything he didnt always have to breathe has something happened to damian something more yes i said i assume the questions about belles line were not idle then not even close to idle i said tell me he said voice soft i told him he was calm asking questions getting details in his so matteroffact voice over the phone without his body posture to go by or his face and with him shielding like a son of a bitch i couldnt tell if he were truly calm or not finally he said that is most interesting dont go all mr spock on me what do you mean thats interesting i mean that it is interesting ma petite damian is not of belles line and thus it should not have happened moreover he is a millennium old and as you so succinctly put it he should have been what he was and there would be no changing it not at this late date but it happened i said may i speak with damian i guess so i turned and held the phone out jeanclaude would like to speak to you directly damian got up slowly as if he were stiff or the floor wasnt quite even the floor was even it was everything else that had gotten a little less steady he took the phone and said yes and from that moment on they stopped speaking english surprisingly it wasnt french it was german i didnt know either vampire spoke german if jeanclaude changed the language because my french was getting better then hed outsmarted himself because i could speak german not like speak it speak it but i could understand it when i heard it grandma blake had spoken german to me from the cradle up id taken it in high school as my language because i was lazy and wanted a leg up i couldnt catch every word it had just been too long since id used my german and damians accent was different from any id ever heard and id grown up around at least two but i caught enough to know that jeanclaude was asking him if the changes to his face had happened during sex or just after because damian said something in german about it not happening just after the sex no about an hour or so later i could understand jeanclaude wanting to save my delicate sensibilities i did have a tendency to get pissy about sex i didnt choose myself then i caught the word for power and belle mortes name then damian saying a lot of nein or not that ive seen in german he hadnt seen me exhibit any of the powers that jeanclaude was asking about on his end of the phone i didnt get it all one i was privy to just half the conversation and two my grandmother hadnt used some of these words a lot she and i hadnt had a lot of talks about vampires sex and metaphysical powers funny that when the conversation seemed to be winding down i told damian that i wanted to talk to jeanclaude before he hung up he handed me the phone not long after and i got to say hi ich kann deutsch sprechen the silence on the other end of the phone was long if you didnt want me to understand you should have stuck to french damian does not speak french he said in a very careful voice well then you are shit out of luck arent you ma petite dontma petite me just tell me the truth what other vampire powers can i expect to come online in all honesty i am not sure right truly ma petite i am not even belle has never transformed a vampire from another line the age of damian if you had asked me i would have said it was impossible that sounded like the truth fine but what powers were you asking damian whether i had or not and dont lie if i order him to tell me everything you said verbatim hell do it hell have to do it you might be surprised there ma petite with your greater commitment to him as your servant he may not be as much slave to your will i do not know that this is true but i know that the more marks you carried of mine the less pliable to my will you became that was true id always been sort of creeped out by the fact that damian had to do everything i told him just because i said so but it had moments of usefulness and now it might be gone well hell fine then just tell me yourself you do not understand ma petite that you could gain my abilities is unusual but this is an ability that i do not possess have never possessed what has happened to damian is something only belle could have done and only if he were a new vampire so is this a new ability altogether one i have never heard of and if so then what could that mean for you ma petite for us and all those connected to you what if you have gained abilities through your necromancy that we cannot begin to guess at i sighed and was suddenly tired not scared just tired you know i am way tired of this metaphysical shit you also healed wounds with sex without calling on rainas munin is that so horrible when i didnt do it on purpose maybe think about that jeanclaude i didnt concentrate and do it on purpose what else might i do accidentally you dont even know it was his turn to sigh the only other triumvirate that included a necromancer as their human servant did not exhibit this level of power you hesitated what were you going to say before power you know me too well ma petite just answer the question i was going to say unpredictableness i wasnt sure that had really been what hed meant to say but i let it go hed answered the question the only way he was willing to i knew by now when hed given me everything he was going to id learned to let it go after that because anything else was just frustrating and rarely gained me anything fine i believe that you dont know what the hell were doing either is there anyone that would have a clue about what might be happening to us i will think upon that ma petite there is no one that i know that has ever managed to form two triumvirates that intersect as ours seem to but there may be those who could provide some more general information on triumvirates or necromancy or in truth ma petite i dont even know where to begin to ask an intelligent question i cannot go to most master vampires in the world with these questions they would see it as weakness i will think upon it and see if there is anyone we can ask he sounded perplexed which i didnt hear often in his voice alright ill call marianne and see if she or her coven have any insights i might even ask tammy when she and larry get back from their honeymoon she is a witch and her branch of the church has been dealing with supernatural talents for centuries who knows maybe they have archives that is a good thought he said damian seems most distressed you could say that i do not know for certain but if he were to go to his coffin and you not be near i think he might sleep as he is meant to during the day what if he just goes buggers again put someone downstairs to watch him someone not you or nathaniel or richard someone that is not part of either triumvirate if your watcher does not see him sleep then they can yell for you to come and comfort him it wasnt a bad idea as ideas went and i had nothing better also i didnt want to spend the day babysitting damian or anybody for that matter ill talk it over with him and see if he wants to try it if he refuses then you will what hold his hand all day there was the tiniest edge of jealousy i hadnt expected that i spoke before i had time to think which id tried to stop doing youre not mad at damian about the sex are you it wasnt planned now ma petite not the sex though i do not lightly share you no matter how reasonable i seem no it is that the three of you seem to have shared all four marks though until i see you all together in the flesh i will not be able to check that for certain but if you share four marks and suddenly damian is able to walk about in the sunlight i must ask myself if i had completed our triumvirate would i now be a daywalker oh i guess i can see that but youve been as reluctant as i am to finish the fourth mark you said you were no longer certain who would be master and who would be slave because of my necromancy and i am even less certain of it now but to walk about in daylight as easily as moonlight might be worth the risk if you have lost the ability to order damian about then that might be a telling thing ill try to order him around later and let you know thank you but there is also that immortality thing not aging neither richard nor i were sure we wanted to give up being mortal and if you have bound yourself to damian with the fourth mark might it already be a moot point ma petite i stood there in my kitchen and was suddenly scared shit i whispered oui if you have truly completed all the marks then your mortality may be a thing of the past if that were true then taking the fourth mark with me would lose you nothing and gain you the ability to walk in the day i said and my voice wasnt friendly when i said it because id heard the tiniest bit of eagerness when he talked about walking in the daylight i couldnt blame him but jeanclaude had been working on his power base for too long not to see the advantages of things i couldnt blame him but part of me wanted to part of me still wondered if i was more important to him for the power or love most of me knew that i would never know for certain and truthfully probably neither would jeanclaude love was not the nice neat linear thing id wanted it to be it was not just one thing but many things i could admit that one of the reasons i loved him was that he was hard to kill his chances of up and dying on me were smaller than if hed been human a large part of me really liked that id seen enough of what death could do and at too young an age not to appreciate it perhaps or perhaps not ma petite this is more art than science or so it would seem his voice held a thread of anger in it what are you pissy about im not the one trying to pick a language you cant understand so i can hide things from you and i am not the one ma petite that has fucked another vampire a lesser vampire one of my own underlings put that way it did sound like he had grounds to be pissed am i supposed to apologize non but i do not have to like it he has come to your body and now he is free of the tyranny of the dark one i could forgive but not both both is a bitter thing ma petite i am sorry i said i didnt plan any of this of that i am certain i am even certain that damian planned none of it only you ma petite could keep having such accidental sex accidental sex he made it sound like i fell down and there just happened to be an erection in the way i kept that observation to myself see i am getting smarter out loud i said accidental sex thats one way of putting it am i ever going to inherit a vampire power that doesnt have sex involved somewhere in it i would never say for certain with you ma petite your necromancy makes you too much the wild card but it is doubtful so far you have inherited my powers or belles or some version thereof to my knowledge belles powers revolve around sex as do mine great can you at least give me a list so ill have some idea what to expect i could if you truly desire one i sighed no just tell me in person when we see you tonight tonight i was hoping that you might come earlier we cant transport damian in full daylight his body might be fine but i dont think his sanity would be besides ive got to work this afternoon always the work no matter what else is happening around you look jeanclaude youve never seen what happens around me when ive gone too long between zombie raisings lets just say that i dont want a line of roadkill trailing after me or worse yet some accidental zombie come shambling into my room are you saying that unused your power raises the dead even if you do not wish to yeah i thought id told you that you have told me of raising the dead by accident when you were a child i assumed that was merely from lack of training and discipline no i said it took me years to admit it but no if i dont raise the dead on purpose then it happens accidentally or i start getting followed around by ghosts or the spirits of the newly dead i hate that last one they always want me to take messages to their nearest and dearest and its always stupid messages im fine im happy dont worry about me what kind of message is that to knock on someones door with im this complete stranger but your dead son told me to hunt you down and say hes fine nothing else nothing urgent just im fine dont worry i shook my head it had been years since id thought about that i raise zombies and the dead leave me alone do they do they really ma petite there was an edge of humor but it held darker things you arent dead jeanclaude ive seen dead and whatever you guys are when youre up and running dead isnt it there was a time when you did not believe that i believe you once called me a handsome corpse look i was young and i didnt know any better are you certain at last ma petite that i am not just a cute dead guy again he was quoting me yeah im certain he laughed then that touchable raisegoosebumpsalloveryourbody sound i am glad of that do you speak italian ma petite no why nothing he said i will see you tonight then ma petite you and your new friends i started to say they werent new friends but hed already hung up i realized as i hung up i should have lied about speaking italian but hell as good as id gotten at lying my first reaction was still to tell the truth i guess you cant undo all your upbringing no matter how hard you try we sent gregory in his kittycat fur down to watch damian gregory was about the only one in the house not tied to me metaphysically well okay fredo and dr lillian but fredo wouldnt leave her alone and dr lillian said she wasnt finished with richards arm so process of elimination made it gregorys job he informed me as he glided toward the basement with his spotted tail swishing behind a very humanlooking backside im supposed to be on stage tonight at guilty pleasures i cant go on like this jeanclaude will need to find a sub he gave that kittycat grin of bared teeth and vanished around the corner what does he mean hes supposed to be on stage clair asked hes a stripper at guilty pleasures i said she made a littleo with her mouth i wasnt sure why unless her world was so protected that just being in the car with a stripper was a big deal for her sanitys sake i hoped her world was bigger than that but i dont understand why cant heshe made a waffling motion with her handsperform tonight richard saved me the lecture remember that once in animal form you have to stay that way for six to eight hours i thought that was just because i was new richard shook his head winced as if it hurt and said no most shapeshifters spend their lives tied to a cycle of six to eight hours in animal form then two to four hours of being passed out once they shift back to human form sit down dr lillian said and her voice indicated she expected to be obeyed he eased himself into the same chair hed vacated there were lines at his eyes and mouth those tight pain lines you get sometimes if something really hurts how much damage had damian done to him clair tried to help him into the chair but seemed unsure where to grab him since he used his good arm on the table to brace himself she sort of hovered uncertainly by him as if she wanted to help but wasnt quite sure how butyou dont have to stay in animal form for eight hours andyou dont pass out when you shift back he is your ulfric fredo said no ones king is that weak his voice was deeper than his chest was wide clair gave him quick eye flicks as if he made her nervous maybe it was the knives do you pass out when you come back into human form she asked in a voice that matched the nervous eyes no he said i do nathaniel said he smiled at her dont ask the rest of them theyll all make you feel bad because they dont pass out either how long have you been her voice trailed off a wereleopard he finished for her she nodded three years he said i did quick math in my head that means that gabriel brought you over when you were seventeen he nodded yes thats illegal i said its illegal in most states to contaminate anyone willingly with a potential fatal disease regardless of age richard said i shook my head i guess im starting to treat lycanthropy the way the law treats vampirism if youre eighteen you can choose the law doesnt treat it the same he said i knew that but id spent so much time among the shapeshifters that i just sort of forgot careless of me i guess i forgot and you a federal marshal he said but the biting comment lacked snap because he hunched with pain at the same time how hurt are you i asked ill answer that dr lillian said she smiled but her eyes were serious if he were human hed stand a very good chance of losing the use of that arm maybe hed regain percent maybe less mobility your vampire severed muscles and ligaments all through the shoulder and upper chest region but hes not human i said so hell heal i let the your vampire comment go i liked the doc and i didnt want to fight hell heal but it will take days maybe weeks if he refuses to shift i promise that i will shift to wolf form when i get home she looked at him like she didnt believe him just because i can shift back to human form almost immediately doesnt mean that it doesnt come with a price id rather not be exhausted for the rest of the day if i shift and stay in animal form for a couple of hours it will be less of a drain when i go back to human form i think he was lecturing more for clairs sake than anyone elses she really was new so ill wait until i get home so clair wont have to explain why shes driving around with a werewolf in the car that last sounded a tad bitter he wont say it so i will im new enough that if one of my pack switches form sometimes it brings on my change too and im not trustworthy when i first turn animal she looked down not meeting anyones eyes richard took her hand its alright clair everyone has problems at first everyone nodded some said yes that seemed to cheer her a little she looked younger than id thought at first maybe twentyfour twentyfive maybe a little younger if she hadnt been richards new girlfriend i would have asked but it seemed like prying and none of my business even if you shift at home ive never seen you heal this much damage in fortyeight hours dr lillian said so he said sounding defensive had i missed something if you go to school on monday with your arm useless and then by friday its usable dont you think some of your fellow teachers might wonder about your remarkable recovery ill make up a less traumatic injury something that could heal that fast she shook her head if they find out youre a werewolf they wont let you teach children i know that he said voice fierce and the first thread of his power trickled through the air like a line of heat clairs breath came out in a quiver she looked dizzy micah put a chair under her and helped richard ease her into it how long has she been a werewolf i asked three months he said i looked at him and he wouldnt meet my eyes three months and you took her outside a safe house less than a week before the full moon doesnt your house qualify as a safe house he asked you can come here to shift form but i dont have a reinforced room most true safe houses had a room with a steel door and reinforced concrete walls most people put the rooms down in their basements and just told those who asked it was storage we were supposed to have a picnic today clair said in her small uncertain voice i had to turn around so richard wouldnt see my face you did not take a brandnew shifter out for a picnic if she was having this kind of trouble she was fine this morning he said i turned around when i was sure my face would be blank enough shes responding to your anger and your beast micah said i know that richard said a hint of a growl in his voice she swayed in her chair richard dr lillian said you have better control than this he just nodded lillian sighed if there was a way to heal your arm before monday your secret would be safe no richard said it took me a moment to get the hint if youre suggesting what i think youre suggesting not only no but hell no she put her hands on her hips and actually stamped her foot you are both being childish we said no simultaneously fine then ive done all i can for your arm i will stay until we are certain that the vampire isnt going to rise and cause more havoc his name is damian i said she nodded damian then but if you wont let her help you then i think you and clair need to go to your house i would suggest that you take her to the room in your basement before you shift she seems very swayed by your power she said the last as if she wanted to say something different but thought better of it ill stay until damian is down for the day i think youve done your part lillian said they needed my help before he said i couldnt argue that but how did you happen to be johnnyonthespot this morning gregory couldnt get anyone here to pick him up he got worried on his way over his car broke down i was next on the list at the coalition help line i hadnt actually known richard was helping staff the emergency calls why didnt he call aaa he was more worried about why no one was answering your phone than his car i didnt think gregory cared that much fredo said all your leopards are very serious about your and micahs safety i looked at him i wasnt aware of that he grinned a brief flash of teeth in his dark face you dont like being babied they know that the smile faded you are their safe harbor they value that i dont know what i would have said to that but lillian interrupted and saved me you need to go home richard micah is here now and fredo she said i think you can leave it to us he started to shake his head again and stopped in midmotion ill stay until were sure she sighed and shrugged you are a very stubborn man fine stay stay and be in pain then she turned to me is there coffee to spare i had to smile i think nathaniel can fix you up ill just bet he can she said and did a polite leer nathaniel took it in stride with a laugh i dont know what the look on my face was but it caused lillian to say im over fifty anita not dead no it wasnt that i wasnt sure how to put it into words but it was more like you didnt say things like that about someones boyfriend not in front of them anyway there was that wordboyfriend again in my head with nathaniel attached to it she was looking at me sort of narrowly by the look on your face i stepped in something is he more than just a member of your pard i said yes and richard said no which left the two of us looking at each other i dont think you get to answer questions like that for me richard youre right im sorry but hes not your lover or your boyfriend no hes mypomme de sang richard shook his head and had to stop again i dont think he knew how often he made that motion until today i thought weall thought he was your livein but now i know hes not he does live with me i said richard started to shake his head but actually caught himself before hed begun the movement i know that but hes not your livein lover and that matters how alright children doc lillian said i made a careless remark i didnt understand what apomme de sang means to its his owner master she sighed i didnt mean to offend anyone lets just leave it at that you didnt offend me nathaniel said and handed her coffee in one of the colored mugs hed purchased for furry coalition meetings hed thought it would be nice if we had enough matching mugs to serve our guests id agreed if i didnt have to shop for them so he shopped for them they were all either a deep rich blue or a dark forest green nice he handed me my baby penguin mug with coffee nearly to the brim just the color i liked it pale brown by the color alone i knew it would be perfect drink he said youll feel better once youve had some coffee i feel fine i said but i sipped the coffee perfect hed also already plugged in the coffeemaker i was right about the french press not making enough coffee at a time to satisfy this many people hell it barely made enough for my early morning needs weve got enough for one more cup who wants it therell be more in a few minutes he smiled at the room in general getting more of the blue and green mugs out of the cabinet he acts like its his kitchen richard said he cooks in it more than i do i said richard made a visible effort not to shake his head though he wanted to no i mean jason is jeanclaudespomme de sang but he doesnt move around the circus of the damned like he owns it nathaniel acts like this is his home nathaniel had his back to the room but he was close enough to me that i felt his sudden stillness as he poured coffee and tried to pretend he couldnt hear it is his home i said i was standing close enough to him to hear the slight sigh of his breath as if hed held it waiting to hear what id say he was careful not to look at me but he was smiling as he puttered with the coffee jason lives with jeanclaude but he isnt richard seemed at a loss for words lillian helped him out jeanclaude wouldnt have minded me remarking how cute jason was you minded when i said something about nathaniel if theyre bothpomme de sangs then i think richard and i are both confused about how were supposed to act around them not boyfriend not lover it can get a little confusing nathaniel was very carefully not looking at me or anyone but especially not me i dont know how i knew that he wasnt just busy getting real cream out of the fridge to pour into an honesttogod cream pitcher the little pitcher was blue and the sugar bowl was green so the mugs matched everything i knew his favorite color was purple and had asked him why blue and green and not purple his reply was that blue was my favorite color and green was micahs favorite color the answer seemed to make sense to him it didnt really make sense to me but i was beginning to learn that things didnt have to make sense to me if it made the people around me happy and the new dishes seemed to make nathaniel very happy he set the creamer and pitcher on a little tray along with little tongs for the sugar cubes why sugar cubes because nathaniel seemed to get a kick out of asking how many lumps people wanted he was like a kid playing house no that wasnt fair he was like a new bride that had never had a house or a kitchen of her own and was really enjoying the hostess stuff but it was like he didnt know what real people did in a house so he was taking it from movies books or magazines i mean nobody serves cream and sugar anymore on a little tray with little tongs right nathaniel was wearing one of his favorite pairs of blue jeans so faded that they were turning white in places they fit his lower body like they were painted on and it was a nice paint job his shoulders had broadened since he moved in with me he was filling out developing the body hed have for the rest of his life if he took care of it a late bloomer my grandmother would have called him hed looked younger than he was for years a delicate body to match the eyes and hair it had made him popular with a certain kind of clientele that his old nimirraj had pimped him out to muscles moved in his arms shoulders and back as he set the tray on the table and began to pass out mugs of coffee i watched him asking how many lumps and do you want cream he moved gracefully around the table on his bare feet hed thrown his hair over one shoulder like a cape so that it was out of the way id have never been able to keep that much hair out of the way without help nathaniel made it look effortless i sipped coffee out of my penguin mug and watched him play suzy homemaker i waited to be irritated but i wasnt in fact i was somewhere in the middle of amused proud and pleased he was so cute when he did this richard tensed whenever nathaniel got close to him as if hed have moved back if it hadnt hurt he didnt take coffee because he didnt drink coffee nathaniel offered to fix tea but richard said he didnt want any richard looked at me jason never does this for jeanclaude does what i asked play hostess nathaniel isnt playing i said hes the closest thing weve got to a hostess its not really my gig richard looked down at the floor as if looking for inspiration or counting to ten since i hadnt done anything to piss him off in the last five minutes i wasnt sure where all the tension was coming from he looked at me with those solid brown eyes and i still missed his hair the sad remnants of curls were beginning to grace his head but it wasnt even close to what hed had before he got mad at himself and butchered his own hair he acts like your wife nathaniel moved back to the coffeemaker and since i was still leaning nearly in front of it that put him beside me he was very careful not to meet my eyes almost as if he were afraid where the conversation would go and that seems to bother you why youre not sleeping with him yeah i am almost every damn night fine you want to split hairs we can do that you arent fucking him i shook my head you always were a sweettalker when you got pissed im not pissed im trying to understand understand what i asked micah wasnt watching nathaniel or richard he was watching me his chartreuse eyes were very serious as if he were afraid of what i was going to do i tried to give him a reassuring smile that i wasnt going to blow this but im not really good at reassuring smiles so his eyes went from serious to a little worried you and nathaniel and micah what i wanted to say was why do you need to understand it but i was trying to be nice or nicer whats to understand richard nathaniel began to pile his hair up into a high tight ponytail it was a style women wore more than men that high bouncy ponytail that moves when you walk but his hair was long enough that to keep it out of the way for cooking he had to either braid it or do the bouncy ponytail once he figured out that i actually thought the bouncy ponytail thing was cute hed started doing it more he washed his hands and went for the fridge how can you watch him like that when you arent fucking him richard asked by the time i looked fully at him i knew my face wasnt friendly if you want to play rough we can richard but you wont like it what are you talking about fine i said well play it your way why dont you watch clair the way i watch nathaniel if youve fucked her his face darkened dont talk about clair like that then dont talk about nathaniel i said nathaniel seemed to be blissfully unaware of us he got the big marble board out of the cabinet and put it down beside the sink the marble was only used for one thingbaking of some sort he moved to the fridge getting out the dough that hed made yesterday before we had to get ready for the wedding apparently we were still going to have homemade biscuits as planned what is he doing richard asked i think hes making biscuits micah said nathaniel nodded making the long fall of auburn hair bounce like it was on a string whos having biscuits so ill know how many to make he turned peaceful eyes to the kitchen as if we werent fighting of course id seen what his memory of fighting entailed so maybe by his childhood standards this wasnt a fight i want some fredo said homemade biscuits doc lillian asked from scratch nathaniel said with a smile in that case yes please nathaniel looked at richard and clair do you want some i know gregory will were only staying until were sure damian is safe richard said he turned his lavender gaze to clair do you want a biscuit she looked at richard sort of nervously then nodded yes please she patted his shoulder we didnt get breakfast richard scowled i was willing to let the fight go nathaniel was right without saying a word he was right it hadnt been much of a fight of course just as it takes two people to fight it takes two sides to call a ceasefire why do you care what i say about him hes nothing to you i sipped the last of my coffee put the mug down carefully on the cabinet and smiled i knew without a mirror that it wasnt a good smile it was the smile i got when i finally got to do something violent when people had been making me behave if id had any doubts about the smile fredo pushing himself upright hands loose at his sides clinched it he knew it was trouble the look on micahs face said he knew it was trouble too even clair looked worried nathaniel had gone back to smoothing out biscuit dough no matter what happened wed need breakfast so he was going to make breakfast in his own way nathaniel could be as practical as i was richard scowled up at me and i knew in that moment that he wanted to fight and strangely i didnt even if he was only mypomme de sang he wouldnt benothing to me richard micah had moved around to stand beside me i dont think he was sure what id do but for once i was okay i took his hand partly to reassure him and partly because he was close enough to touch if hes more than just food to you why again he seemed at a loss for words why arent i fucking him micah moved me in against his body so that he was spooning me and had his arms around me almost as if he thought hed have to restrain me and give richard time to get to a door my temper wasnt that bad honest well most of the time well some of the time oh hell i guess i couldnt blame him for being nervous i leaned in against micah let his body hold me like it was a favorite chair i could feel tension i hadnt even known i was carrying seep out of my muscles i thought you were screwing them both richard said such a nice turn of phrase i said and the tension just seeped right back in you wont let me saysleep im trying to avoid sayingfuck how about sex or intercourse those are nice technical terms alright he said i thought you were having intercourse with both of them now you know different i said yes he said it and his voice was softer less angry i felt like i was missing something here what difference does it make whether i was having sex with one or both he looked down then and wouldnt meet my eyes could everybody leave us alone for a few minutes please clair got up a little uncertainly dr lillian got up and fredo moved to follow her nathaniel had rolled out the dough enough that he was shaping the individual biscuits the oven dinged indicating it was preheated he looked a question at me i wrapped my arms around micahs arms pulling him around me like a coat you cant kick nathaniel out of his own kitchen richard and i dont want micah to go either its not his kitchen richard said and he was angry again yes i said it is nathaniel turned back to his baking with a small smile on his lips hed already greased up the pans so he began to arrange the thick doughy circles on them ignoring us again richard stood and even though he had one arm bandaged up i was suddenly aware of how tall he was how broad his shoulders were he was one of those men that never seemed as big as they are until they got angry no it isnt it isnt even micahs house its yours they live with me richard he shook his head and grimaced and made a low sound not a growl just frustration micah is your nimirraj you had the same reaction to each other that marcus and raina had instantaneous melding but marcus didnt move into rainas house they couldnt help being attracted to each other but raina saw other people they werent a couple not in that way raina wouldnt have known what monogamy was if it bit her on the ass i said dr lillian and fredo were making for the door lillian grabbed clairs arm as she went past and took her with them richard didnt even seem to notice dont you dare talk about monogamy to me richard said you may have gotten a peek inside my head richard but i saw into yours too im not having sex with everyone you thought but youre having sex with almost anyone that will have you im looking for a new lupa richard said bullshit i said micahs arms were tense against my body he laid his cheek against the side of my face but he didnt say anything he knew better you always screw around when we arent dating i said at least i wait until we arent dating to do it you always manage to fuck someone else while were still an item i started to move away from micah but his arms tightened just enough he was right i didnt trust myself not to get more physical than was wise slapping richard right that moment sounded so good i stayed where i was but it wasnt relaxing anymore i cant argue that i said i dont mean jeanclaude he said you broke up with me before i was with micah the first time i said he shook his head and then screamed partly pain and partly anger i think once i calmed down i could have forgiven you about micah id seen it with raina and marcus but you moved him in here even that i would have let go or tried to but i thought you were screwing nathaniel i thought you were fucking him before you broke up with me one you broke up with me i needed not to be held when i was this angry let me go micah anita let me go ill try not to do anything stupid he sighed but he let his arms fall to his sides i walked out just far enough not to be pressed to his body like i said you broke up with me richard not the other way around you broke up with me because quote you didnt want to love someone who was more comfortable with the monsters than you were unquote he actually looked embarrassed that was really unfair of me and im sorry hed finally got me in the mood for a good fight and he was apologizing what kind of a fight was that sorry about what that you said it or that you believe it id really rather this was just the two of us anita please i shook my head you had your chance to be alone with me and you didnt want it these are the hands that held me while i cried over you theyve earned the right to stay he nodded i guess fair is fair he said but there are some things that you deserve to hear that they dont if you ever let me be alone with you again i have things you need to hear but today in front of them this is all you get i thought you were cheating on me with nathaniel before micah ever came along now i know that wasnt true what on gods green earth made you think i was doing nathaniel that far back the way you looked at him the way you reacted to him he looked at me and his expression asked why wouldnt i think that im attracted to a lot of men it doesnt mean im having sex with them in my head i added just because you never pass up a piece of tail doesnt mean i dont but i didnt say it out loud first it wasnt entirely true and second the fight was winding down i didnt want to wind it back up i know that now and im sorry he glanced at nathaniel who must have put the biscuits in the oven while we were arguing because he was starting to get plates down and the pans of biscuits were nowhere in sight you asked me why if im having sex with clair i dont look at her the way you look at nathaniel im sorry i had no right to say that especially not in front of her i started it he said but the answer is simple i dont feel for her what you feel for him i shook my head why is everyone so determined that were a couple he smiled and it was sort of sad wistful and bitter all at once it reminded me of micahs smile when hed first come to me because youre more of a couple right now without the sex than i have been with anyone that ive been sleeping with i didnt say including clair because it was none of my business and it would have been mean i didnt want to be mean sex doesnt make you a couple richard love makes you a couple the moment it left my mouth i would have taken it back i was just sort of frozen there afraid to look anywhere but at richards face because i didnt know what my own face looked like i didnt want to show shock to nathaniel but i didnt know what else to show i hadnt meant to say it you always do that richard said what i asked in a small voice that didnt sound like me at all fight rail against it against what love anita you dont like being in love i dont know why but you dont i had no idea what to say to that im going to check on gregory either damians asleep or he ate him his words tried to make light of it but his face and eyes couldnt pull it off but he turned and left vanishing into the dimness of the living room beyond the kitchen was suddenly very very quiet if micah was still standing behind me no noise betrayed it i knew he was still there but he must have been holding his breath waiting for me to say something do something the trouble was i didnt know what to do nathaniel walked past me without a word he had an armful of plates green glass blue glass he started laying them out on the table in front of the chairs first a green then a blue he went around the table away from me then laid the last one back at the head of the table within touching distance of me id stayed like some kind of idiot rooted to the spot not sure what to say i couldnt declare undying love because its not what i felt it wasnt he moved that small step from the table and he was suddenly standing right in front of me close enough that i got a faint whiff of vanilla and it wasnt the baking his face was serious but his eyes held a hint of a smile he leaned in and laid a kiss on my cheek while i stood there like an idiot i was afraid afraid that hed demand that i tell him i loved him or something equally ridiculous or equally impossible but he didnt he just kissed me then leaned back with a smile ive had hundreds of people tell me they love me but they didnt mean it they just wanted to use me you may never say the words out loud but you mean them the timer buzzed on the oven and he turned with a smile biscuits are ready he used a dish towel for a pot holder and took the biscuits out they were golden brown and the smell of them filled the kitchen he took out the second pan closed the oven turned it off and looked at me i know how you feel about me now because youd have died before saying it in front of richard unless it was true if you never say it again ill always value that i heard it once he started toward the darkened living room ill tell everybody that breakfast is ready he stopped at the door and turned back with a grin on his face that id never seen before one accidental confession and he was suddenly cocky but i still want intercourse he vanished around the doorframe trailing a sound of masculine laughter micah came to stand beside me anita are you alright when i didnt answer he gripped my upper arms and said look at me i blinked too fast and too often but i looked at him things were moving too fast for me i grabbed his arms and said the first thing that occurred to me if i faint richard will think i did it because of him youre not going to faint you never faint he started easing me into a chair as he finished saying it i let him because i was feeling fuzzy around the edges i didnt want to sit here and have breakfast with these people i needed some time to think and the only way to get it was to hide in my bedroom i couldnt bear to hide damn it for the first time in my life i wished i was a little less stubborn a little less brave my head was between my knees when everyone trooped back in i didnt faint but i dont know how because sitting across from richard and watching clair butter his biscuits made me wish i had nathaniel laid out silverware fetched more coffee made sure we had at least six kinds of jam jelly and preserves when had there ever been red currant jelly in my refrigerator i looked at this man bustling about my kitchen and knew the answer since nathaniel had been doing the grocery shopping part of me wanted to run away but the other small part of me that usually saves me from being a total pain in the ass was wondering if they made those white frilly aprons wide enough to fit over nathaniels shoulders i mean if he was going to play suzy homemaker didnt he need an apron and maybe a string of pearls the thought made me giggle and i couldnt stop it and i couldnt share it i ended up having to excuse myself from the table to let the laughter have its way with me by the time micah found me the laughter had given way to tears again nathaniel didnt come looking for us i was glad except for a small part of me that kept expecting him to come through the door i was ready to be angry if he came and disappointed if he didnt some days i dont make sense not even to me micah tried to lure me out of the bedroom with the promise of breakfast and claiming that i couldnt hide in there all day i think it was the hiding comment that got me i accused him of saying it deliberately and he said of course i did nathaniel isnt expecting you to fall on your knees and propose hes happy the way things are no hes not he wants sex micah offered me his hand and looked way too serious i dont understand why you hold that last part back from him i didnt take his hand in fact i crossed my arms over my stomach and frowned at him that last part you make it sound like its nothing he knelt in front of me anita i love you you know that actually i didnt know that people act like they love you but how do you ever know its real i didnt say it out loud but something about the look i gave him or my body language must have said it for me because he moved in close close and closer until he was sitting in my lap with his legs wrapped around my waist it made me laugh which was probably why hed done it we ended up with my arms around his waist and he put his hands on my shoulders his legs locked behind my back pressing him up against me about as close as he could get you do realize that from this position sex wont work unless we trade equipment its not always about sex anita sometimes its just about being close now isnt that the girl line i said not if youre the girl and im the boy i felt my face going all serious and unhappy i dont know how to do this what he asked richards right i dont know how to be in love im not good at it youre great at everything but admitting it he said he wiggled himself in even tighter against me so that i could feel that he was getting happy to be there youre trying to distract me no im trying to keep you from getting angry angry about what i asked and my hands were sliding down his back as i said it it was hard to be this close to him and not have my hands wander just angry you get angry whenever youre uncomfortable and what happened in the kitchen is going to hit a lot of buttons for you my hands slid past his belt to touch the top of his jeans id once thought you had to be in love to be able to touch someone like this it had been a nice thought id liked it and it had made me feel safe my hands traveled down the rough fabric of his new jeans but underneath was the solid swell of his ass he had a good ass round and tight smaller than i liked but definitely there id told him he needed some ass just to balance out the front of him truthfully nathaniel had a rounder fuller ass more like a womans tight and firm but round i liked men with booty my least favorite thing was a man who had severe whitemans ass where the jeans just bagged over the butt i wanted something to hold on to something to sink my teeth into when i said i liked meat on my men i didnt just mean one thing id buried my head against his chest my hands cupping his ass he rocked himself against me just a little was this love was the fact that i could touch every part of him and he could touch every part of me love or was it just lust i raised my face up enough to touch the skin of his neck so warm so sweet id been raised that you only loved one person at a time if i loved jeanclaude i couldnt love micah if i loved micah i couldnt love anyone else the only person i was really able to say i love you to without hesitating was strangely asher i was beginning to suspect that was because jeanclaude loved him had loved him for centuries when they werent hating each other in jeanclaudes arms channeling feelings back and forth for him and asher then i could saylove and mean it but here and now without jeanclaude to push me the word stuck in my throat like it would choke me to death sometimes i thought i loved micah but thats not the way a person wants to hear love declared sometimes is worse than not i put one hand in the middle of his ass so that one finger could rub back and forth even through the jeans but my other hand slid up his back got tangled for a moment in the thick curls of his ponytail then touched the warmth of his neck i knew who was inside my head even as i put a hand in micahs hair and pulled his head to one side so his neck stretched long and clean because we were almost the same height his neck was just in the right position for me to lick along the meat of it so warm so incredibly warm i wrapped my mouth around his neck felt the pulse of his blood under his skin and set teeth into that warmth micah cried out but not in pain he ground himself against me tighter giving me more of his neck like an eager woman would press against a man i set my teeth into his skin and fought the urge to bite down to draw blood jeanclaude filled my head with images images of him and asher and julianna ashers longdead human servant there was sex but there was more laughter more games of chess and her doing needlework by the fire there was more holding than fucking images of him and me and asher but also of micah micahs neck under his fangs while i watched them both jeanclaude coming to find both of us asleep in his big bed curled on the silk sheets micahs brown curls lying so close to my black curls that he could not tell where one ended and the other began jeanclaude let me feel his emotions as he drew back the sheets and felt the first breath of our warmth the sensation of him sliding his cold body between us and how we moved in our sleep waking slowly to his hands on our bodies how much he valued that micah would simply give him blood and not argue or make less of the gift and the need than it was of how much it meant to him that he could turn from micahs willing still bleeding body to my body and pierce me in a different way while micah watched or helped seeing it from jeanclaudes point of view was uncomfortable and made me want to slide away but he whispered through my mind while my mouth tasted micahs skin if this is not love ma petite then i know nothing of it if this is not love then no one since time began has ever loved you ask yourself what is love am i in love when what you should be asking is what is not love ma petite what is it that this man does for you that is not done out of love i wanted to argue but jeanclaude was too close in my head and micahs neck was between my teeth so many hungers could be fed off this flesh so many needs so much so much the sweet tang of blood trailed across my tongue and it brought me back into myself helped me pull back before i hurt him but he collapsed around my body as if wed finished sex he shuddered against me and let his breath out with a sigh i held him with my arms at his back or i think hed have fallen hed given himself completely to me he hadnt tried to protect himself or worried that id eat his throat out and he should have but hed trusted me trusted me not to hurt him more than he enjoyed id never bloodied him before never gone past teeth marks and hickeys it had felt so good to hold his flesh between my teeth and not to stop until i tasted that first blood he gave a shaky laugh and said in a hoarse voice nathaniels going to be jealous yeah i whispered hes always wanting me to mark him the thought that came was would it kill me to give nathaniel some of what he wanted not kill me no the question was would it break me and if so how much jeanclaudes echo in my head was perhaps it will not break you ma petite perhaps it will heal you and him get out of my head i said what micah asked sorry nothing just babbling to myself jeanclaude did what i asked but his laughter trailed inside my head like an echo for the rest of the morning i was in the kitchen eating biscuits with butter and honey slathered all over them the biscuits were good but the show was gregory he was still in leopardman form but he was eating biscuits have you ever watched someone eat bread with teeth that are designed for tearing out the throats of gazelles it was interesting if hed just put the whole biscuit in his mouth at once it would have been okay but he didnt he ate the rounds of bread dripping with butter and red currant jelly in pieces delicately except that his jaws werent made for delicate so his fur was spotted with jelly and he kept licking it off with an impossibly long tongue it was disturbing distracting and vaguely fascinating like a combination of animal planet and food network it was good that i had something to amuse me because nathaniel was being very unamused id known he might be upset about me marking micahs neck when hed practically begged for me to do it to him and id refused but i had no real clue how upset hed been banging things around the kitchen a cabinet door didnt just close it slammed opening the refrigerator was a chorus of bangs slaps and the like i didnt even know that plastic food containers could make that much noise in between slamming things around he was agreeing with everything gregory said but his tone of voice sounded like he was fighting weve been advertising a leopard for tonight if they cant have me youre it gregory said then licked that long pink tongue all the way around his muzzle fine its not like ill be doing anything else tonight somehow i thought that last was directed at me micah was giving me the look the one that said as clearly as if hed spoken fix this why was it always me that had to fix it because i was usually the one who screwed it up in the first place oh that was why my teeth marks were imprinted into micahs neck the marks had been smeared with neosporin but he hadnt had to bandage them good for him and for me id stopped before id hurt him too badly it was actually less blood than the one and only time id let myself mark nathaniel it had been when theardeur was new and i was still trying to find ways to feed it that didnt involve intercourse silly me the last straw was when he took the butter dish off the table before everybody was finished with it gregory grabbed for it and claws were wrong for grabbing china the plate fell and broke all over the floor the butter slid across the floor in a long yellow line like a really nasty snail trail i dont know what i would have saidprobably something not helpfulbut just then the phone rang someone else get that nathaniel said from the floor where he was wiping up the mess im a little busy micah just kept eating his breakfast i think because he was upset with me for not saying something to help nathaniel feel better problem was i didnt know what to say so i got the phone anita its ronnie ronnie hi and i was thinking furiously oh yeah i wasnt the only one having personal problems i still couldnt believe that shed turned down louies proposal out loud i said how ya doing louie left a message on my phone so i know you know she sounded defensive okay you want to talk about it i didnt take offense it wasnt me she was mad at she blew out a loud breath yes no i dont know you can come here or ill meet you somewhere i was using that careful voice like the one micah used so much on me ill bring bagels she said you could have homemade biscuits when you get here instead i said homemade biscuits you didnt make them did you no nathaniel did can he cook actually yes i could almost feel her doubt wafting over the phone honest hes really good at the baking stuff if you say so well wed starve if they waited for me to cook she laughed then that is the gods honest truth okay ill be there soon save some biscuits for me sure thing we hung up i stayed by the phone for a second or two watching nathaniels angry back at the garbage can where he was depositing the broken dish and dead butter id never realized that a ponytail could bob angrily micah looked at me and the look was eloquent it said fix this fix this or ill be mad at you too there are a few downsides to having two men living with you when they both get pissed at you at the same time is one of them nathaniel stayed by the cabinet hands on the edge of it and his entire body radiated his anger id never seen him this angry it should have made me mad but it didnt he could be angry if he wanted to be i guess i tried to think of something useful to say hed gone from being happy as a domestic lark to being as pissed as id ever seen him the only thing that had changed was the mark on micahs neck hed lived through micah getting intercourse and orgasm while he nathaniel got almost nothing so why was that one overenthusiastic hickey the breaking point for him i thought and thought until i could feel a headache beginning just between my eyes then i had a good thoughtit was almost insightful i dont usually get too insightful without talking to smarter and wiser friends but suddenly there it was the truth i think i walked over to him and touched his shoulder he jerked away from me hed never done that before it scared me i didnt want him that angry at me ever micah was right i had to fix this but how nathaniel it was as if saying his name opened the floodgates i cant live like this you give me an inch and then you take it away orgasm today but only because of some metaphysical shit youll find an excuse not to do it again you always do he gets intercourse and orgasm and i get nothing but you marked me me not him me he was still staring at the cabinet while he ranted louder and louder it was all i had all i had he had to pause to take a breath and i rushed into that small silence im sorry i said it fast before he could catch his breath i dont know why i keep hoping he hesitated stopped then turned to me slowly what did you say i said im sorry his face softened for a second then hardened and he narrowed his eyes at me he looked positively suspicious what exactly are you sorry about im sorry youre upset oh and he was off again ranting i touched his arm and he didnt jerk away this time but he kept listing all the things i wouldnt do for him or with him it might have been embarrassing if i hadnt been more worried about stopping the fight than almost anything else you have to go to work tonight i said that stopped him because i think it made no sense with his train of grievances what yes what about it if you didnt have to work tonight id take you into the bedroom now and mark you if thats what you wanted he pulled away again i dont want you to do it just because im mad i want you to do it because you want to because youd enjoy it too god he could be so demanding i actually had to stop and count slowly in my head because this whole dominantsubmission thing hit my buttons badly id done enough research to understand that the world of dom and sub was a lot bigger and more varied than id believed that there were people out there that considered my love of nails and teeth during foreplay and sex to be perverted that they considered even that bondage i liked teeth and nails during foreplay and sex i really did it wasnt pretend and it wasnt just for nathaniels sake once i thought it through to that point i wasnt angry with him i wasnt mad about what he wanted i was uncomfortable because i enjoyed it i knew that now and i embraced it all the way through my head well i wasnt quite there yet i tried for honesty with him and myself id love the feel of your neck under my teeth id love to sink my mouth around all the meaty parts of you and bite down until i was afraid id hurt you i felt heat rush up my face and i had to close my eyes to finish it i loved the feel of you in my mouth i loved marking you but i wasnt ready to admit it and it still makes me uncomfortable but its not because its you its because it just seems so so i dont know perverted gregory suggested i opened my eyes to glare at him dont help me gregory okay sorry do you mean what you just said nathaniel asked and his voice was oddly empty as if he were trying very hard not to be angry or hopeful i met his face and even his eyes were being careful i hated to see him managing me that hard as if he were afraid if he appeared too eager id run problem was he might have been right i realized id been doing my own version of what richard was doing i wasnt running from as much of myself as he was but if i hadnt had theardeur to push me i might have been if i could have pretended as cleanly as richard could i would have that i could at least admit to myself theardeur had made that impossible but this wasnt about theardeur this was about nathaniel and me and the happy little domestic arrangement that we had id waited too long to answer nathaniels eyes filled with such sorrow and he turned away oh hell i grabbed his face between my hands and went up on tiptoes to make up for that threeinch height difference id startled him so that he stumbled back into the cabinets i plastered myself against the front of his body and kissed him i kissed him as if i were eating him i set my teeth into that lovely lower lip and bit down not enough to mark but enough to draw a small sound from his throat i leaned back from the kiss enough to see his eyes wide and unfocused his hands gripped the cabinet behind him so tight they were mottled it was almost as if he was afraid hed fall i was breathing a little hard myself my voice was shaky when i said that wasnt metaphysical shit that was just me just you his eyes closed and a shudder ran through him from the top of his head to the bottom of his feet he swayed and if i hadnt caught him around the waist i think hed have fallen his arms slid around me and he laid his head on my shoulder he hadnt exactly fainted but he was limp in my arms i realized he was totally passive i knew in that moment i could do anything i wanted to him the thought didnt excite me it scared me i had enough trouble running my own life i didnt want someone elses but i kept my doubts to myself he had enough of his own without me sharing you promise he whispered promise youll mark me tonight hed said the p word shit i promise i whispered it into the vanilla warmth of his hair he drew a deep breath that moved his bare chest up and down along my clothed one my body reacted to it whether i wanted it to or not nipples hardening from the brush of him he drew back enough to see my face and the look in his eyes was all male and brought heat in a rush up my face it sped my pulse in my throat he was submissive but underneath all that was something that could have been very dangerous and it was there in his eyes now that promise of disaster come to the club tonight see my act please i shook my head i work tonight please the please was more than just a word it filled his eyes he wanted me to see him on stage surrounded by screaming fans maybe he wanted to impress on me that even if i didnt want him others did i guess id earned having my face rubbed in it what time do you go on he told me i can catch some of it but probably not all of it he kissed me hard and strangely chaste and bounced toward the door ill need to see if my costume is ready for tonight he turned at the door with that eager look still on his face what if i turn furry will you still mark me i dont do furry i said he poked his lip out at me like a spoiled child you are so damn pushy you do know that right he smiled i dont do furry but if im not furry youll do it something about the way he asked it made me suspicious but i nodded yes he vanished into the dimness of the living room ill see you tonight at the club i yelled after him if theres another murder all bets are off murder takes precedence over watching my boyfriend strip there was that word again boyfriend i heard nathaniels laugh trail down the stairs it reminded me of another man in my life whod left me with a laugh this morning i was just amusing the hell out of everybody today micahs kiss was still warm on my lips when ronnie rang the doorbell having had no sleep last night was finally catching up with micah so hed gone to bed besides ronnie wouldnt want an audience she was eyeing the door as i dragged it open what happened here i tried to think of a short version couldnt come up with one and said lets get coffee first her eyebrows went up but it was all i could see of her eyes behind the dark sunglasses she shrugged she was wearing the brown leather jacket that had become her latest favorite coat she had it zipped up more than halfway and a cableknit sweater peeked out from under it i hid my frown it had to be seventy outside i eased the door back into its frame is it cold outside or am i missing something her shoulders hunched ive been cold since i left the wedding last night i just cant seem to get warm i did not remark that most shapeshifters have a slightly higher body temperature than we mere humans and that maybe the warmth she was missing went by the name of louie i didnt say it because it would have been too obvious and too cruel she walked through the darkened living room to the opened curtains of the kitchen beyond when id been sure that damian was down for the day id opened the drapes she hesitated just inside the kitchen where is everybody micah had to get some sleep gregory and nathaniel are upstairs working on an outfit for work something about some straps breaking she sat in the chair that richard had been in so she could keep an eye on most of the doors and still look outside at the view or maybe it had been an accident and i was projecting why i doubted richard had thought about safety considerations when he chose the seat but again maybe i wasnt being fair oh well she kept the dark glasses on though it wasnt that bright anymore her blond hair was straight but thick and looked like shed combed it but nothing else so the ends didnt do the curl up that she liked she almost never went out without more done to it than this in fact she sat hunched at the table over the coffee mug like a hangover victim you ready for biscuits i asked does he actually cook i almost said if you were around more youd know but i was good yeah he cooks he does the grocery shopping most of the menu planning and most of the housework my isnt he a regular domestic goddess her voice was ugly when she said it id be nice because she was hurting but that would only cover so much then shed piss me off and i really didnt want to fight with ronnie this morning i needed a wife i said and managed to keep my voice neutral dont we all she said and there was no malice now she took the tiniest sip of coffee i dont think i could eat right now i took a much bigger sip of coffee and said okay do you have a plan for how this talk will go she looked up at me still wearing the glasses so i couldnt see her eyes what do you mean you wanted to talk i assume about louie and what happened last night right yeah then talk i said its not that simple she said okay then can i ask a question depends on the question she said i took a big breath and plunged into the deep end why did you say no to louies proposal oh not you too what i asked dont tell me you expected me to just say yes i wanted her to take off the glasses so i could see her eyes see what she was thinking actually yeah why for gods sake because ive never seen you happier for longer with anyone i said she pushed her coffee away as if she was angry at it too happy the way thingsare anita why does he have to go and change everything you spend more nights at each others places together than alone right she just nodded he said he offered to move in together first why not try it because i want my stuff i love louie but i hate how hes taken over my closet my medicine cabinet hes taken two of the dresser drawers over for his clothes the bastard i said its not funny she said no i know did you tell him you didnt like him moving his stuff in i tried do you want him gone poof out of your life she shook her head no but i want my apartment back the way it was i dont like coming home and finding that hes rearranged everything in my cabinets so its easier to find if i want to dig through every cabinet to find tomato paste then it was my choice he didnt even ask i just came home one night and hed organized everything in the kitchen i couldnt find anything she must have sounded pouty even to herself because she jerked off the glasses and gave the full force of those painfilled gray eyes you think im being silly dont you no he should have probably asked you before rearranging everything the fact that nathaniel had not only rearranged everything in my kitchen but also thrown out the nonmatching stuff was probably best kept to myself i love dating louie but i dont want to marry anybody okay just okay youre not going to try talking me into it hey im not headed for wedded bliss either who am i to force you into it she looked at me as if searching my face for a lie she was pale and holloweyed as if she hadnt gotten much more sleep than micah but youve let micah move in with you i nodded and drank coffee yes why why what why did you want him to move in with you i thought you liked your independence as much as i do im still independent ronnie micah moving in didnt change that he doesnt try to order you around i just looked at her im sorry anita but my dad was such a bastard to my mother ive seen pictures of her on stage in college she wanted so much but he wouldnt have a wife that worked she had to be the perfect little homemaker she hated it and she hated him you arent your mother i said and louie isnt your father sometimes in these hearttoheart talks you have to state the obvious you werent there anita you didnt see it she fell into a bottle and he never noticed because on the outside she was perfect she never got roaring drunk or falling down drunk it was just like she needed this constant buzz to see her through the day and the night a functioning alcoholic is what they call it i didnt know what to say to that wed both told each other our sad stories years ago she knew all about my mothers death my father marrying the ice princess stepmother and my perfect stepsister wed shared our bitterness toward our families long ago i knew all this so why tell it again because something about the proposal had brought it up you told me months ago that louie is nothing like your dad yeah but he still wants to own me own you i said what does that mean own you we date we have great sex we enjoy each others company why does he have to move in or make me marry him there was something like real fear in her face i touched her hand where it lay clenched on the tabletop ronnie he cant make you marry him but if i dont agree to something hell leave we either move forward or hes gone thats him trying to force me to marry him i felt like i wasnt qualified for this talk because her logic wasnt bad but it wasnt like that i knew louie and hed have been horrified that she saw his proposal and his need to finalize things as ownership i was almost a hundredpercent certain he didnt mean it that way i squeezed her hand and tried to think of what to say that would help things instead of hurt nothing came to mind i dont know what to say ronnie except that i dont believe louie meant to hurt you like this he loves you and thought you loved him and when people love each other they tend to want to get married she took her hand back how do i know this is love i meanthe love like tilldeathdoyoupart love finally something i could answer you dont what do you mean you dont isnt there supposed to be a test or a sign or something i thought if i ever fell in love that this panic wouldnt be here that i would be totally sure and unafraid but im not im terrified doesnt that mean that louie isnt the one that it would be a terrible mistake arent you supposed to be sure now i knew i was unqualified for this conversation i needed like a pinch hitter to offer better advice than i had i dont know were you sure when you let micah move in sure that it was the right thing to do i thought about it then shrugged it wasnt like that he moved in almost before wed dated i how do you put into words things that you only feel things that have no words attached to them i dont know why i didnt panic when he moved in it just happened one day i walk into the bathroom and theres a razor and a shaving kit then when the clean clothes got put away his tshirts got mixed in with mine and since theyre the same size we left it that way ive never dated anyone before who can wear the same clothes i can its kind of neat to wear his jeans sometimes or his shirt especially if it smells like his cologne god you love him she said in despair almost a wail i shrugged and drank coffee because talking was making it worse maybe i said she shook her head no no your face goes all soft when you talk about him you love him she crossed her arms over her chest and looked at me like id betrayed her somehow look micah moved in gradually but i didnt feel crowded the way you did with louie i like having his things in the bathroom i like having a his and her side of the closet seeing his stuff with my stuff gives me a full cupboard feeling a what she asked getting a tshirt out and realizing that its one i bought for him because it brings out the green in his eyes gives me that ive got my favorite foods in the cupboard and its a winter night and i dont have to go out in it feeling ive got everything i need at home she looked at me in soft horror hearing myself say it out loud was a little frightening but mostly it was thrilling because id answered my question in trying to answer hers id answered my own i was smiling even as she looked at me in shock i couldnt help the smile i was feeling better than id felt in days but another thought occurred to me i wasnt smiling when i said remember how you couldnt understand why i didnt just jump at richard when he asked me to marry him i didnt say marry him i just said dump the vampire and keep the werewolf that made me smile i remember coming home and richard had used his key to get in to cook me dinner without asking and i hated it i felt all grumpy and like my privacy had been invaded she nodded thats it its like putting on a new sweater thats just the right color and fits perfectly but the next time you wear it you realize its scratchy and unless you wear a shirt under it it itches you its a great sweater but you need a little distance between it and your skin i thought about it and had to agree thats pretty good scratchy yeah but you didnt feel that way when micah moved in she asked in a voice that had gone soft and small i shook my head it was very weird i knew nothing about him really but it just clicked love at first sight she said softly marry in haste repent at leisure they say but you didnt marry him she said why not one neither of us has asked and two i dont think either of us feels the need there was also the matter of jeanclaude and asher and nathaniel but i didnt want to muddy the waters so i didnt bring them up then why does louie want to get married youd have to ask him ronnie he did say hed offered to just live together but you didnt want that either i like my space she said then tell him that i said ill lose him if i tell him that then youve got to decide whether you like your space or him more just like that she said i nodded just like that you make it sound simple i dont mean to i said but louie wants the two of you to go to bed together every night and to wake up beside you every morning that doesnt sound so bad she laid her head on her arms so that all i could see was the back of her head as far as i could tell she wasnt crying but ronnie did i say something wrong she said something i couldnt understand sorry i didnt hear that she raised her head enough to say i dont want to go to bed every night and wake up every morning with him you want separate bedrooms i asked before my brain could tell me it was a stupid question no she said and sat up brushing at the tears that had just started she seemed more angry or impatient than tearful what if i meet a cute guy what if i meet someone i want to sleep with and it isnt louie the tears were gone she was just looking at me with that appeal on her face that dont you understand look you mean you dont want to be monogamous i said no i mean im not sure im ready to be monogamous i wasnt sure what to say to that one because it wasnt something id had to give up most people want to be monogamous ronnie i mean how would you feel if louie slept with someone else relieved she said because then i could be mad and kick his ass out itd be over do you mean that i asked and i tried to see past the pain and confusion but there was too much of it yes she said no oh hell anita i dont know i thought we had a good thing going if i could get him to slow down a little then he suddenly puts it into high gear how long have you guys been dating almost two years she said you never told me about feeling crowded before i said how could i you were drowning in domestic bliss all the things that i didnt want you were enjoying i remembered that louie had said maybe ronnie hadnt distanced herself because i was dating jeanclaude but because she had problems with me not having problems with micah id thought he was wrong now i wasnt so sure im always willing to listen ronnie i couldnt anita you fuck this guy youve just met and suddenly hes living with you i mean it was everything i hated someone moving in and taking your space and losing your privacy and you just lapped it up again there was that feeling in her voice that id betrayed her am i suppose to apologize for being happy are you happy really happy i sighed why do i think youd be happier if i said no she shook her head no i dont mean it like that but anita she took my hand how can you let all these people in your house all the time youre never alone anymore dont you miss that i thought about it then said no i spent my childhood alone in a crowd of family that didnt understand me or didnt want to understand me im finally with people that dont think im the weird one no because theyre weirder i took my hand back this time that was mean i said i didnt mean it that way but isnt jeanclaude jealous of micah the way he was of richard no i said and left it at that because ronnie wasnt ready to hear the arrangements among the three of us she thought we were weird already if she only knew why isnt he i just shook my head and got up to get more coffee she thought my lover was weird she had always hated jeanclaude i wasnt about to share intimacies about them with her shed just lost her privileges and that made me sad id thought this crisis with louie might help ronnie and me rebuild our friendship but it wasnt working out that way shit i poured coffee and tried to think of something useful to say i finally realized that if i let her last remarks go then wed never be friends again it was truth or nothing i leaned against the cabinet and looked at her something must have shown on my face because she said youre mad do you realize by saying that my lover is weirder than i am it says you think im weird you dont think your friends are weird ronnie i didnt mean it that way then how did you mean it i didnt mean it anita im sorry but i am weirded out i mean i didnt like micah coming out of nowhere and that nathaniel is living here cooking and cleaning what is he like a maid hes mypomme de sang i said and my voice was as cold as my face doesnt that mean hes like food sometimes i said and i tried to tell her with my eyes that she should be careful i dont take my steak to bed with me anita i dont read bedtime stories to my milkshake id told ronnie just enough of my personal arrangements for her to throw them back into my face and belittle them great ronnie you need to be very careful what you say right now very careful youre insulted arent you she asked yes i said i came to you with very personal stuff back when it bothered me that nathaniel was sharing the bed with micah and me and i told you we were reading to each other that wasnt a complaint has something changed between you and nathaniel last i heard he was food and one of your leopards but that was all yeah things have changed you have two men living with you i nodded yep two men two lovers i took a deep breath and just said yes then how can you encourage me to say yes to louie i didnt encourage you i just asked which you value more louie or your privacy its him thats made it a choice not me but you didnt have to choose not yet i said whats that mean she asked it means that i never underestimate the power of the men in my life to complicate things so far so good so far so good how can you let that be enough dont you want a guarantee that they arent going to cut your heart out and stomp on it id love a guarantee but it doesnt work that way youve just got to take the plunge and hope for the best marry him you mean ronnie the only one here obsessed with marriage is you you and maybe louie ive got no plans in that direction so what you just keep living with both of them for now yes i sipped coffee and tried not to let my eyes be as unfriendly as i felt but what about later later will take care of itself i said thats not enough for me anita i want to know that im making the right decision i dont think you ever know ronnie most of the people i know that are absolutely certain theyre right are the most wrong people i know what the hell does that mean that means marry him or dont marry him but dont take your issues out on my relationships and what does that mean it means dont ever call my boyfriends weird again and you dont think that living with two men is a little unusual it works for us ronnie and how does jeanclaude feel about you sleeping with micah and nathaniel hes okay with it she frowned so youre what sleeping withand she started counting fingersthree men hmm four hmm nope five five jeanclaude nathaniel micah and who asher and damian i said and my face was nicely empty when i said it her face wasnt she was left openmouthed astonished apparently so shocked she was speechless if she hadnt been picking at me id have broken it to her gently or not at all ronnie had started by not being able to handle me dating a vampire then hadnt been able to handle my being comfortable cohabitating with a man and less able to handle me living with two men and enjoying it two extra vampires to hate well that was nothing let me get this straight you are fucking all of them i knew she meant was i having intercourse with all of them technically no but since it was only nathaniel who was on the no list after today i said yes when did all this happen asher happened after youd made it very clear you hated me dating jeanclaude because hes a vampire so i stopped talking to you about vampires as boyfriends and nathaniel moved from food to sex when recently and damian i mean damian wasnt even on the radar its been a busy day she goggled at me again are you serious just today i nodded and almost enjoyed her astonishment all this has been happening and you didnt tell me you havent wanted to hear it you just get mad about jeanclaude and i think you hated hearing how much i enjoyed the very things with micah that you were hating with louie you said yourself that it made it hard to talk to me because i seemed so happy with the things that were driving you crazy she let out a long long breath im sorry ive cut you out of so much ive missed us talking i said we talked she said but we both started editing ourselves to each other you cant stay friends like that she looked sad no i said you cant you dont have to tell each other everything but you cant hold back this much i still dont trust jeanclaude and youre the one that taught me that vampires are just dead guys no matter how cute they are ive changed my mind i havent she said so no talking about the vampires in my life that still leaves you with two men to talk about not if you compare one of them to steaks and milkshakes look last time you talked about nathaniel it was to complain that you were so uncomfortable around him you talked about nathaniel the way i felt about louie then about the time i thought we had common complaints you started to change you started getting all soft when you talked about nathaniel too did i she nodded yes you did everyone noticed nathaniel and me before i did even richard what i shook my head i do not want to talk about richard other than to say i met his new girlfriend clair jesus when i shook my head because there was no way to tell the story without sharing more than ronnie wanted to know about vampires the very fact that she got angry when i talked about the vampires in my life made it almost impossible to share my life with her how did i explain what had happened between richard and me today without including theardeur jeanclaude damian and damians old master and if i did share it all then shed give me another lecture about how jeanclaude was ruining my life or had ulterior motives i wouldnt even be able to argue about the ulterior motives jeanclaude was what jeanclaude was id made peace with that a while back i finally said some of what i was thinking out loud id learned lately that truth is really the only way for relationships to survive let alone grow i wanted to be friends with ronnie again really friends if it was still possible most of what happened today revolves around vampire stuff ronnie if i cant talk to you about vampires then i cant even begin to tell you what happened jeanclaude fucking up your life some more i shook my head i dont think jeanclaude could have planned some of this in his wildest imagination besides hes pissed that damian got to me first she frowned first you mean hes upset that you and damian are lovers im not sure were lovers so much as we had sex i havent decided about the rest youve always treated intercourse like its a commitment anita i never understood that its just sex sometimes its good sometimes its not so good but its just sex not a vow of honor i shrugged we agreed to disagree on that topic a long time ago yeah we did youve been monogamous as long as ive known you one date and thats it until you either dont want to date him anymore or youve decided that he didnt deserve the one date he got until jeanclaude came into your life you were the most straitlaced person i knew i mean i didnt think i slept around until i had you to compare me to you made everybody else seem like sluts to your nun that sounded sort of bitter too i didnt know you felt that way i said it never bothered me in fact you probably saved me from some bad decisions id think okay what would anita say and id wait a while and see if a guy was more than just cute gee ive never been the angel on someones shoulder before she shrugged im not mad about your moral values as opposed to my moral values i just dont understand how i ended up headed for a life of monotonous monogamy and you ended up with a harem it just seems wrong on that we could agree wait a minute monogamous maybe but you told me louie was the best sex youd ever had no the best sex i ever had was that guy i finished the story for her with the really big tonker who knew how to use it he was gorgeous blond curly hair big blue eyes shoulders she laughed i take it ive told this story too often it was a onenight stand and he vanished before you woke up the next day you tried to find him and hed lied about who he was so you couldnt find him no sex is good enough to overcome that spoken like someone whos never had a onenight stand in her life ronnie said my turn to shrug cant say that i have if youve never had one then you dont know what youve been missing i let it go wed learned years ago that we had philosophical differences about men sex and relationships fine have it your way but louie is the best repeatable sex that youve ever had she seemed to think about that for a moment then nodded ill agree to that yes he is the best steady sex ive ever had how are you going to feel without it i asked horny she said and laughed but when i didnt laugh with her she looked sad jesus anita dont go all serious on me i need one friend who just tells me that marriage isnt for me and that its okay to dump him when he starts giving ultimatums if you arent in love with louie then dump him but i wouldnt be your friend if i didnt ask is it that you dont lovehim or your fear is too great to allow you to loveanybody she frowned up at me great then ill die alone and old with a bunch of cats and guns what i meant was maybe therapy isnt a bad idea she looked at me in amazement youre giving me the youneedtherapy talk i thought you hated all those therapists that stand by the graveside and ask people what theyre feeling as their longdead abusive parent rises from the grave god what a nightmare there are good therapists out there ronnie i just dont get to meet many on the job have you gone to see a therapist behind my back i thought about that then said i finally realized that what i was going to marianne for was only partially to learn how to control my psychic abilities people in new york go to see their witches instead of their therapists ive just decided to be ahead of the crowd who do you know in new york another animator and vampire executioner she said that going to a therapist who was a witch meant she didnt have to spend time explaining magic or psychic stuff to them because they already knew it shed had some of the same problems id had over the years with going to my priest or a regular therapist i mean my dad took me to one when i was in my early teens the therapist tried to help me with my latent issues with my mothers death and my dads remarriage but he wouldnt believe that i could raise the dead by accident he kept trying to tell me that i was doing it on purpose to get back at judith and my father you never told me that she said it was after the therapist told my dad that i was evil that he contacted grandma flores and got some help that at least understood what i was going through so you knew when you started with marianne it was therapy no of course not id never have done it that way she smiled thats the anita ive come to love and know i smiled back even now it makes me grumpy to admit it out loud and youre the only person ive told though i think micah suspects im getting easier to live with something has to be responsible its really helped she asked i nodded you think i should go down to tennessee i think you should try something closer to home you dont have the same issues that i do a therapist isnt going to tell you that youre wrong or evil or simply not believe you are you telling me my problems are mundane unless you have a problem with louie being furry once a month yeah theyre mundane she frowned and dragged her coffee cup back toward her not really i mean ive seen the whole show and i dont do animals hes okay with that because most nonshifters draw the line at doing their significant others in animal form you know it can be transferred via sex in animal form if the sex is rough and you get some fluid in an abrasion she said it like a lecture or a warning without thinking about it i did know that oh sorry youre the preternatural expert not me again that trace of bitterness when had she first gotten mad at me how far back did it go no really ronnie its good to share information when you know someone else is dating the lunarly challenged she looked up then did you just say lunarly challenged i nodded the latest pc phrase since when have you been pc since i heard the phrase and thought it was funny as hell i was still leaning against the cabinet because there was way more anger in her toward me than i understood the vampire thing i could sort of understand but her problems with me letting men into my life that seemed harder to work around lunarly challenged ill have to tell louie hell get a kick out of it the moment she said it her face fell and the weight of it all came crashing down on her oh shit anita what am i going to do i dont know i came back to sit at the table and patted her hand if it had been catherine shed probably be clinging to me for support but ronnie had my issues on closeness so we didnt hug as much alright ronnie had my old issues on closeness except about sex id never understood why if you dont want someone hugging you for comfort that youd be okay with fucking them but that was just me i dont want him just gone from my life but im not ready to get married i may never be ready to get married she looked at me and there was such anguish in her eyes he wants children he said one of the reasons hes happy that im not a shapeshifter is so we could have children anita i dont want children i squeezed her hand and didnt know what to say im a private detective and im thirty if we got married wed have to start thinking about kids right away im not ready do you want kids ever i asked she shook her head i grew out of wanting two kids and a white picket fence about five years ago i dont think i ever really wanted it but its what youre supposed to want you know i know she looked at me with her serious sad eyes and asked do you want kids no i said my life doesnt have that kind of room no if you had a different job would you want to be a mother once upon a time i thought id get married and have a kid or two but that was before before what jeanclaude no before i became a vampire executioner and a federal marshal before i realized that im probably never going to get married my life works for me right now but it wouldnt work for a child why because you dont have a husband no because people try to kill me on a semiregular basis speaking of violence what happened to your door she asked gregory broke it down because i wasnt answering the phone and he heard screams why did he hear screams without mentioning vampires i cant tell you the story she sighed i thought jeanclaude was a passing thing your one big fling you know hes the bad guy that you have this great sex with then you wise up and move on she looked at me and she really looked at me searching my face hes not a fling for you is he no i said she took in a lot of air then let it out slowly im not saying i want or could handle all the details but tell me enough so i know what happened to your door even edited down the story took a while we were just past the point where richard dumped me royally when nathaniel and gregory came into the room ronnie had her face all set for massive sympathy and was actually reaching out to offer a hug when she saw them her face froze and her arms just stopped moving as if she was suddenly a statue in that kids game nathaniel was nearly naked wearing only a leather thong and a whole bunch of straps across his upper body so many straps that for a moment it gave the illusion that he was bound in some way he padded into the room looking totally comfortable in his nearly nothing bondage gear that might have been what stopped ronnie in her tracks or then again it might have been gregory he was still in leopardman form and still totally nude he wasnt happy to be nude anymore but he was still naked except for his very natural fur coat from the look on her face i wasnt sure ronnie had really seen that much of louie in ratman form or if she had hed been more discrete than gregory was being he had three straps in his clawed hands and was looking at the rivet on the end of one of them as he glided through the door hi ronnie nathaniel said as if she wasnt staring at him openmouthed anita have you seen my punch your what i asked its a punch for reattaching leather rivets i forgot that two of the straps came loose last time i wore this i dont even know what a leather punch looks like i said i sipped coffee and watched both the men and ronnies face she was trying to recover her cool but the effort was visible and near painful to watch sort of like a big stapler with one of those round things on the top he knelt down to open up the tool drawer this flashed the back of his body to us and there was a lot of back to flash the thin black stripe that was all that covered his ass didnt exactly cover anything as much as it emphasized what was there if i hadnt had ronnies reaction to watch id have been more distracted myself but i was enjoying her total failure to hide what she was thinking thered been a time when ronnie had been the more sophisticated of the two of us and id been the one who blushed all the time she wasnt blushing shed actually paled but the shoe was very firmly on the other foot she hadnt been around much so she hadnt seen nathaniel in maybe six months her reaction told me that it wasnt just me whod noticed the shoulders and the extra muscle development to someone who hadnt seen him in half a year the changes must have been even more impressive what makes you think a piece of sewing equipment would be in the kitchen i asked and my voice held that first hint of amusement that i was trying to hide from ronnie it was kind of nice not to be the one who was embarrassed for a change nathaniel moved from drawer to drawer talking without turning around his hair still up in its high springy ponytail zane borrowed it to fix his leather jacket and never put it back you know how zane is he doesnt think hes got to stop borrowing my stuff if he cant put things back where they belong zane was one of my wereleopards and he tried to play dominant but he really wasnt and nathaniel was right zane never seemed to put anything back where it was supposed to go i dont think youll ever teach him to put things back i said you could wear it without these three straps gregory said most people wouldnt notice he touched one of the straps on nathaniels back gave it a little flick i mean there must be over a dozen of them ill notice nathaniel said and he kept opening drawers if you were zane where would you put a punch i think he was asking it of no one in particular ronnie had managed to stop gaping shed closed her mouth and was trying to look like it was no big deal that two nudish wereleopards were wandering around my kitchen she watched them covertly out of the corners of her eyes i dont know if it was because she was embarrassed or because id called one of them my boyfriend girlfriend rule number one you dont lust after your best buds boyfriend i got up to help them look nathaniel had said it looked like a stapler even i could recognize a stapler so i started opening drawers too nathaniel found it in the drawer that was supposed to hold only big spoons and oversized cookware why here he asked it does look like a really big stapler maybe thats why i offered it up as the best idea i had nathaniel was shaking his head making his hair dance around his shoulders in a way it never did except in that very high tight ponytail whatever the reason he is not allowed in my stuff anymore sounds fair i said i was looking at all the straps you look pretty secured into that outfit how do you strip out of it he smiled at me are you trying to get me out of my clothes he made it sound like teasing but underneath was something that wasnt teasing at all i wished i hadnt said it because he wanted me to want him so badly i didnt know how this game worked and id never been good at flirting not really i ended up blushing which i hated no i said and it sounded whiny even to me he could have said a halfdozen things that would have made it worse but he had mercy on me you get it off the same way you get it on he slid his left arm through the front of all those straps then raised his arm up his chest along side his neck and did something with his shoulder that i couldnt see from where i was standing the straps just peeled down and suddenly he was nude from the waist up with the straps hanging around him like the petals of a black leather flower the straps come off completely but it takes time to reattach them so youll have to come tonight if you want to see the whole show he smiled gently to take some of the sting out of my embarrassment i wasnt sure why i was embarrassed unless it was because ronnie was there or i was worried about having to come across soon who knew pick one your shoulder ronnie said in a strained voice didnt that hurt what you did to your shoulder he shook his head sending all that shining auburn hair flying no im doublejointed ronnie was having trouble with her face like the expression that was wanting to come there wasnt one she was willing to have how doublejointed are you ronnie i said she shrugged and gave me a look like sue me i couldnt help it well you wont tell me you just told me today that hes moved from food to boyfriend ronnie i said again a little more urgently she made a face sorry sorry im not myself today im babbling more like you usually do oh thanks a lot i said you do babble when youre nervous or horny gregory said stop helping me gregory he shrugged which looked odd on the leopardman shoulders not bad just odd sorry do you want me to answer her question nathaniel asked in a careful voice answer the question dont answer the question i dont care he cocked his head to one side the expression on his face clearly said that he knew that wasnt true he was right id have preferred him to not answer the question hed given me the opportunity to be his master and tell him not to answer but id blown it id abdicated the throne he seemed to want me to take and if youre not in charge you cant control what happens he walked over toward ronnie and he made sure he swayed that luscious ass at me as he moved sometimes i wondered if nathaniel knew how beautiful he was then hed do something that let me know he knew exactly what he looked like like now heat crept up my face just watching him walk and i finally decided why the embarrassment id promised to mark him but what he wanted was intercourse and watching him move across the room like an ad for a wet dream made me all squirmy and uncomfortable like being a teenager again and having those feelings for the first time and having no one to talk to about them because good girls werent supposed to have feelings like that he flicked his head and sent all that hair spilling over ronnie and away like a curtain that shed walked through except she was sitting still it looked as if hed slapped her instead of teased he stood up very straight very tall beside her chair and clasped his hands behind his back to answer your question i he began to raise his arms backward am his arms went to the middle of his back and kept on moving upward very until his straining clasped fingers were even with his shoulder blades very his arms rotated all the way up so they pointed at the ceiling doublejointed then he slowly put his arms back down but it wasnt ronnie he was looking at when he finished i didnt blush i paled i felt trapped trapped by what that was the tenthousanddollar question even to myself i wasnt sure i had an answer they left to repair nathaniels costume the silence in the kitchen after they left was deep long and uncomfortable at least for me i didnt look at ronnie because i was trying to think of something to say i shouldnt have worried she found just the right thing to say damn anita i mean damn i did look at her then whats that supposed to mean my voice was a little shaky to come off as indignation but it was worth the effort ronnie had a look in her eyes that i didnt like it was way too discerning wed been best friends for years just because wed drifted apart didnt mean she still couldnt read me you havent had sex with him yet she sounded sure and amazed what makes you say that oh come anita youre never quite this uncomfortable once that bridge has been crossed for you intercourse is permission to have a relationship until that happens you never really relax around them i was blushing again arms crossed over my stomach leaning against the island using my hair to try to hide the blush and failing so youve always known every time i made love to someone most of the time yeah except with jeanclaude he messed up your radar and mine i glanced up then how so you stayed uncomfortable around him even after the two of you were having sex together i think its one of the reasons i didnt like him i guess i thought if you were that conflicted then it wouldnt last i shrugged i dont remember being uncomfortable around him afterward she just looked at me i had the decency to squirm okay maybe i was but its not true that i stop being uncomfortable after having sex just once it takes a few sessions a little monotonous monogamy for me to truly relax she smiled point taken the best sex is after youve learned a few things about each other she looked at me very serious again you really havent had sex with him have you i shook my head why not she asked i looked at her anita after the little show he just put on id do him i looked at her harder you say hes been sleeping in your bed with you and micah right i nodded for how long about four months i said four months of climbing between your sheets and you havent fucked him pick a different word okay if were going to have this talk pick a different word sorry okay you haventmade love to him that better i nodded why havent you made love to him he obviously wants you to i shrugged no i want an answer on this one has jeanclaude decided to draw the line at sharing you with this many men no i said micah has a problem with it no then why not i sighed because when i first let nathaniel move in he was like a wounded puppy something to take care of and help heal he was so submissive that he wanted someone to run his life and order him around ive got enough to do to run my own life so i sort of demanded he change become more independent he did it hes doing really well hes a lot more confident than the last time i saw him ronnie said i mean hes almost like a different person i shook my head hes a stripper he has to have a certain level of confidence in himself she shook her head nope had a roommate in college that stripped her way through school on the weekends she had a terrible selfimage then why did she strip it made her feel like someone wanted her her childhood makes yours and mine read likerebecca of sunnybrook farm ouch i said yeah stripping made her feel good and bad all at the same time what happened to her i asked she graduated found a job found religion and is now married with two kids and an attitude so holy that you cant have a conversation with her without her trying to convert you they say that no one is as holy as a reformed sinner stripping isnt a sin anita being naked isnt a sin its the way god sends us into the world how bad can it be i shrugged sex isnt a sin either anita intellectually i know that ronnie but part of me just cant shake my grandmothers voice sex was evil men that wanted to touch you were evil your body was dirty it was all bad and the nuns didnt help change that attitude i guess once a catholic always a catholic she said i sighed i guess truthfully i thought a lot of the damage had been my grandmothers doing and my stepmother judith who made every touch some sort of favor physical touch was not a big thing in my family after my mother died you feel guilty about nathaniel why im supposed to take care of him ronnie not screw him anita you can take care of someone and still have sex with them married couples do it every day i sighed again i dont know why he weirds me out but he does you want him i covered my face with my hands and almost yelled yes yes i want him and just saying it out loud like that made me cringe inside he started life with me on the illtakecareofhim list not the future boyfriend list dont you and your boyfriends take care of each other i thought about that i guess so i mean i hadnt thought about it why are you so busy trying to find reasons to talk yourself out of nathaniel i frowned at her jason told me that its because nathaniel wont be aggressive enough that if a mans just a little commanding i feel like the choice isnt all mine and the guilt isnt all mine either nathaniels sort of forcing me to make the move to be in charge to be the one to blame she offered maybe anita i am terrified of spending the rest of my life with one man i mean what if a body like nathaniels comes walking up to me the day after i say yes to louie im going to turn it down yeah i said thats what being in love means doesnt it spoken by the girl whos sleeping with more men than ive dated in the last three years i was raised that marriage would make everything that was dirty okay suddenly all those feelings were legal holy part of me has trouble letting that go letting what go she asked that im never going to get married that im never going to do anything to make how i feel about jeanclaude or micah or nathaniel or asher or hell damian okay that no matter what happens i am going to be living in sin you mean that youd like to be in love with just one man and do the marriage thing i used to think so now i sat down at the table oh ronnie i dont know i cant see being with just one person anymore my life wouldnt work with just one of them in it and that bothers you she said yes it does why because this isnt the way its supposed to be anita supposed to be is for children grownups know that its what you make of it my life is working ronnie nathaniel is like my wife and micah is the other husband he works for the coalition and helps me take care of the leopards and all the other shapeshifters its partnership the way i always thought marriage could be but never seems to be and where does jeanclaude fit into this little domestic scene wherever he wants i guess he runs his business and polices his territory and we date you him and asher date sometimes she shook her head and damian i dont know yet she looked down at her hands on the tabletop i guess weve both been having some interesting personal choices to make she looked at me and frowneda little frown why is it that your choices seem so much more fun than mine i smiled you have issues with commitment marriage and being tied to just one man i have issues that anything short of that monogamous setup means youre a slut were both being set up to deal with our issues you do sound like youve been to therapy glad to hear it shows i said so youre saying that weve fallen into the love lives we have so that we can face our demons and slay them or realize that what we thought were monsters arent that much different from us you really did think that vampires were walking corpses once didnt you down to my toes that must make it really hard to be in love with one of them i nodded yes she took my hands in hers im sorry ive been pissy about jeanclaude ill try to do better i smiled and squeezed her hands apology accepted im thirty and ive never been this happy with anyone ill talk to louie about giving me a little space and maybe finding a premarriage counselor can i say im happy to hear that without you accusing me of wanting you to marry him she smiled and had the grace to look embarrassed yeah and sorry about that too its alright ronnie we all have our hangups trust you to find a witch for a counselor but if you can do therapy i guess its not too late for the rest of us i was talking to marianne for months before i realized what it was youre saying that you went to therapy by accident i shrugged squeezed her hands and got up please god let some of the coffee still be warm so you went to therapy by accident you became the lover of the master of the city kicking and screaming that you wouldnt do it now youve fallen into one or is it two ménage а trois when your goal in life was monogamous marriage the french press was cold but the coffeemaker was not yeah that about sums it up i said and my goal was to never tie myself down to any one person and never to marry now here we are each getting what the other one thought she wanted i couldnt have said it better myself so i didnt try id never gotten the impression that god had a sadistic sense of irony but someone sure did was there an angel in charge of relationships if so that particular winged messenger of deity had a lot to answer for i got that tiny pulse in my head that i sometimes got when i prayed it was more feeling than words be happy just be happy easy to say so very hard to do at that afternoon i was at work right on time neither sex vampires shapeshifters nor metaphysical meltdowns will deter this animator from her appointed rounds at least not today i was sitting in bert vaughns office hed been the boss at animators inc once but recently wed had a sort of palace coup he was still office and business manager but he was more like our agent than our boss it hadnt lost him any money so he was happy but it had meant that most of the animators here were like partners in a law firm once you made partner you almost had to kill someone to lose your job well kill someone and get caught so bert wasnt the boss anymore which meant he didnt get to treat us like the hired help he hadnt liked that part but it was either agree to our terms or we all walked and since he cant raise the dead that would pretty much put him out of business especially if we opened another firm in direct competition with him so we had a new power structure and we hadnt worked all the kinks out of it yet berts office was now a warm yellow with orange undertones it was cozier than the pale blue cubicle it had once been but not by much the entire office had gotten a facelift along with buying out the offices next door so that most of the animators at animators inc no longer had to share their office space since most of our time was spent out in the field or cemetery as it were i thought the new offices were a waste of money but id been outvoted charles jamison and manny had wanted bigger offices larry and i had been fine sharing but bert voted with the other three so theyd taken out a wall and voilа we were suddenly twice as big the reason that most of the offices had gone to warmer tones earth tones comforting tones of yellows browns tans ecru was that bert was dating an interior designer her name was lana and though i thought she was far too good for him she irritated me she constantly went around talking about the science of color and how with a business like ours we needed to make people feel loved and cared for id told her that it wasnt my job to love my clients that i wasnt in that business shed taken it wrong and hadnt really liked me since that was fine as long as she stayed the hell away from my office mary our daytime secretary had asked me to wait in mr vaughns office as soon as i hit the door not a good sign to my knowledge i hadnt done anything wrong at work so i had no clue what the meeting was about once it would have bugged me but not now i was used to not knowing things bert came in and shut the door behind him shutting the door was not a good sign either bert is and played football in college hed started to gain that pastforty nearingfifty extra around the middle but lana had put him on a diet and an exercise program he looked better than he had for most of the time id known him shed even persuaded him that tanning cocoa brown every summer was not healthy for anyone so he looked pale but healthy it also meant that his hair hadnt gone that whiteblond that it used to in the summer his hair was actually a pale yellow with a little white creeping in but the white was so close to the way his hair used to look with his tan that it had taken me days to figure out it was his way of going gray i was sitting in one of the two dark brown nicely upholstered client chairs that had been another of lanas ideas they were more comfortable than the straightbacks hed had before my legs were politely crossed my hands folded in my lap i was the epitome of ladylike that skirt is too short for business hours anita he said as he rounded his big desk and eased into a chair even bigger and browner and more leathery than the one i was sitting in i slumped down in the chair and put my boots up on his desk with my ankles crossed the movement raised my skirt up high enough to flash every last inch of the lace tops of my thighhigh hose i was a little short for the movement to be comfortable but i doubted bert could tell i was uncomfortable i looked at him around the heels of my kneehigh black boots the skirt is also black we all agreed that we dont wear black to work its too depressing no you think its too depressing besides the skirt has flowers embroidered on the side by the slit blue green and turquoise which matches exactly the shade of turquoise of the jacket and the blue of the top its like an outfit i said i was also wearing a gold chain with an antique locket on the end of it it had two tiny paintings one in either side of it they were tiny oil paintings of jeanclaude and asher the locket had once belonged to julianna and was more than three hundred years old it was handwrought gold heavy and solid and very antiquelooking tiny sapphires traced its edges with one larger one in the middle id thought it looked great with the outfit apparently not the short little turquoise jacket also covered the black shoulder holster and the browning hipower under my left arm id have put on the wrist sheaths but with the jacket off the knives showed under the thin material of the top i could just take off the gun if it got hot enough in the office but to remove the wrist sheaths id have to strip off the shirt it didnt seem worth it they were in the car just in case i started to feel insecure bert didnt have any weapons under his rich chocolate brown suit which had been tailored to fit his body as hed lost weight the athletic cut to his suits had emphasized his broad shoulders which had sort of appeared as his waistline had decreased his shirt was pale yellow and his tie was a paler brown with tiny gold and blue figures on it all the colors suited him they even brought a little warmth into his gray eyes i slumped down further into the chair using the padded corner to brace my back and head the skirt had scooted up far enough that the black silk of my underwear was peeking out though it probably couldnt be seen from where bert was sitting if i tell you the skirt is too short youll wear something even shorter tomorrow wont you yep and if i complain about the black ive got black dresses i said ive even got short black dresses why do i even bother arguing with me i said he nodded i have no idea at least youre wearing makeup i appreciate that ive got a date after work i said that brings me to another problem he said he leaned forward and folded his hands on his desk he was trying for fatherly but he never quite made it it came off more as pretentious i did straighten up in my chair because i simply wasnt comfortable i straightened the skirt as i sat up there was enough skirt to smooth down the back of my thighs my rule for skirts was that it was too short if there was no skirt to smooth over your ass this skirt passed the test so i was glad bert had given up i really wasnt comfortable in skirts much shorter than this one wearing them just to spite bert wouldnt have been as fun as it once would have been and what problem would that be bert mary tells me that the young man in our waiting room is your boyfriend i nodded he is strangely theardeur hadnt risen today at all not a quiver not a shake but wed all been a little concerned about what might happen if it suddenly sprang to life at work there was nobody at work that i wanted to have sex with so that meant i needed someone nearby just in case nathaniel was sitting outside in the warm sienna orange waiting room looking very decorative in one of the brown leather chairs he was wearing street clothesblack slacks a violet business shirt that was almost a match to the one hed worn to the wedding and black overtheankle boots hed braided his hair so it looked as professional as anklelength hair can and he was reading back issues of some music magazine that he had a subscription to and had fallen behind on reading hed brought a messenger bag full of magazines from home and was prepared to wait until i dropped him off at work or until he was needed whichever came first why is your boyfriend out in our waiting room when youre supposed to be working im dropping him at work later i said and my voice was much more neutral than his had managed to be doesnt he have a car we only have two cars at the house and micah may need the other one if he gets called into work bert did the slow blink and what little warmth hed managed to get into his gray eyes faded i thought the one in the other room was your boyfriend he is doesnt that mean that youve broken up with micah your assumption is your problem bert he gave another long blink and leaned back in his chair looking puzzled id always puzzled bert but just not in the personal department does micah know youre dating nathaniel i said nathaniel bert said he knows i said he licked his thin lips and tried a different tact would you think it was professional if charles or manny brought their wives into sit in our waiting room i shrugged not my business he sighed and started rubbing his temples anita your boyfriend cannot sit out there the entire time youre in the office why not i asked because if i let you start bringing in people everybody else will want to and it would be a mess it would disrupt business i sighed i dont think anyone else will be bringing their sweeties to work i said charless wife is a fulltime registered nurse shes a little busy and rosita hates mannys job she wouldnt darken the door jamison might bring a girl around if he thought it would impress her he sighed again anita youre being deliberately difficult about this me deliberately difficult why bert you know me better than that he gave a surprised burst of laughter and sat back in his chair and stopped trying to treat me like a client he looked instantly more comfortable and less trustworthy why did you bring your new boyfriend to work none of your business it is if hes sitting in the waiting room that we all share it is if youre going to let him sit in on clients he wont sit in on clients i said then hes going to be in our waiting room for how long a few hours i said why he asked again i told you none of your business it is if you bring him to work anita i may not be the boss anymore but were also a democracy you really think that jamison wont kick a fuss he had a point i couldnt think of a lie that came close to explaining it so i tried for partial truth you know that im the human servant to jeanclaude master of the city right he nodded eyes uncertain as if this was not the start of the conversation hed expected well theres been an interesting side effect trust me when i say that youll want nathaniel here if things go wrong how wrong are they going to go he asked if i take him into my office just lock the door and make sure we arent disturbed no harm no foul why would you need privacy with him what side effect is it dangerous none of your business you wouldnt understand even if i told you and its only dangerous if i dont have someone with me when it happens when what happens see first answer i said if its going to disrupt the office then as manager i need to know he had a point but i wasnt sure how to tell him without telling him it wont disrupt anything if mary keeps everyone away from the door until were finished finished he said finished what i looked at him i tried to make it an eloquent look you dont mean he said mean what i asked he closed his eyes opened them and said if i dont want your boyfriend sitting in the waiting room i sure as hell dont want you fucking him in your office he sounded outraged which was rare for bert im hoping it wont come to that i said why is this a side effect of being a human servant to the master of st louis it was a good question but i was so not willing to share that much with bert just lucky i guess i would say youre making it up but if you were going to pull some elaborate joke on me it wouldnt be this that one comment proved bert knew me better than i thought no i said it wouldnt so youve become like a what a nympho trust bert to find just the right thing to say yes bert thats it ive become a nymphomaniac i need sex so often that i have to take a lover with me wherever i go now his eyes went wide calm down boss man im hoping today will be the exception not the rule what made today different he asked you know mary told me to report to your office as soon as i hit the door before you could have possibly known that id brought my boyfriend with me or worn a black skirt that is shorter than you would like so you didnt call me in here to discuss my wardrobe or my love life why did you want this little meeting did anyone ever tell you that you can be very abrupt yes now whats up he sat up straighter all professional and clientworthy again i need you to hear me out before you get upset wow bert i can hardly wait for the rest of this little talk he frowned at me i turned the job down because i knew you wouldnt take it if you turned it down why are we discussing it they doubled your consultation fee bert i said no he put a hand up i turned it down i looked at him and knew my face said clearly i didnt believe him ive never known you to turn down that much bert you gave me a list of cases that you wouldnt handle since you gave me the list have i sent anything your way that was on it i thought about it for a second then shook my head no but youre about to they wont believe me they wont believe what i said they insist that if youd only see them youd do what they want i told them you wouldnt but they offered fifteen thousand dollars for an hour of your time even if you refuse the money belongs to animators inc when i said we worked like a law firm i meant it that meant that this money went into the kitty for everybody the more we made the more everyone made though some of us got a higher or lower percentage of our fees wed based it on seniority so my turning down money didnt just hurt me or insult bert anymore it affected the bottom line for everybody most of those everybodys had families kids theyd actually come to me en masse and asked for me to be more flexible on my consulting fees ie take more of them manny had a daughter about to enter a very expensive college and jamison was paying alimony to three exwives sob stories but most of them except for larry had more overhead than i did so id started being nicer about at least talking to people when they offered outrageous sums of money sometimes whats the job i asked i didnt sound happy but i asked bert was all smiles sometimes i suspected that hed been behind that en masse meeting but manny and charles swore up and down he hadnt been jamison i wouldnt have believed either way so i didnt ask the browns son died about three years ago they want you to raise him and ask some questions my eyes were unfriendly slits tell me all of it bert so far i wouldnt have turned it down he cleared his throat and fidgeted bert didnt fidget much well the son was murdered i threw my hands into the air damn it bert i cant raise a murder victim none of us here can i gave you a list that you were supposed to refuse for all of us for legal reasons and that was one of them you used to do it yeah before i found out what happens when you raise a murder vic as a zombie and that was before the new laws went into effect a murdered person rises from the grave and goes after their murderer no ifs ands or buts they will tear through anyone and anything that tries to stop them i had it happen twice bert the zombies dont answer questions about who killed them they just go rampaging off and try to find who did it couldnt the police just follow them sort of like they do bloodhounds these bloodhounds will tear peoples arms off and crash through houses zombies do a very straight line to their murderers and the way the law reads now the animator that raised the zombie would be liable for all the damage including the deaths if one of us raised this boy and he killed anyone even his own murderer wed be charged with murder murder with magical malfeasance thats an automatic death sentence so no i cant do it and neither can anybody else he looked sad probably about the money i told them youd explain it to them you should have explained it to them yourself bert ive told you all this before they asked me if i was an animator when i said no they wouldnt believe me they said if they could just meet with ms blake theyre sure they could change your mind jesus bert this is really unfair it cant be done and watching their son rise from the grave as a shambling murderous zombie is not going to help them heal he raised eyebrows at that well i cant say i put it as well as you just did but i swear to you that i did tell them no but im meeting with them anyway because they offered fifteen grand for an hour of my time i could have gotten them to twenty grand theyre desperate i could smell it on them if we turn them down flat theyre going to try to find someone less reputable less legal i closed my eyes and let the air out in a long slow sigh i hated that he was right but he was when people get to a certain level of desperation theyll do stupid things stupid foolish horrible things we were the only animating firm in the midwest there was one in new orleans and one in california but they wouldnt take this job for the same reason we wouldnt the new laws i could say it was to save the clients pain but in all honesty the idea that you could raise a murder victim from the grave and just ask them who killed them was so tempting that several of us had tried to do it wed thought it hadnt worked because of the trauma of the murder or that the animators doing it werent powerful enough but that wasnt it if you were murdered you rose with only one thought in your dead brain revenge until you got that revenge you wouldnt listen to anyones orders not even the animator or voodoo priest or priestess that raised you from the grave but just because none of the reputable people would do it didnt mean that a disreputable person wouldnt do it there were people here and there across the country that had the talent without the morals none of them worked for the professional companies because theyd either been fired as a liability or theyd never been hired some because they didnt want to be hired but most because what they did was secret and rarely something they wanted the authorities to know about they kept a low profile and didnt advertise much but if you started waving twenty grand around theyd come out of the woodwork the browns would find someone willing to do what they asked if they were willing to pay for it someone who would give them a false name raise the kid and run with their money and leave the bereaved parents to clean up the mess and explain things to the police there was a test case in new england at state supreme court level that was seeking the death penalty for the person who paid a magical practitioner to kill someone by magic i didnt know how it would go and it would probably get to the supreme court before all was said and done id never forgive myself if the browns found someone less reputable and ended up on death row for it i mean that would just suck especially if i could prevent it here and now i gave bert the look he deserved the one that said he was a greedy son of a bitch and i knew hed turned down their money for something other than humanitarian reasons he just sat back and smiled at me because he knew what that particular look meant it meant i would do it even if i hated it mrs barbara brown was blond and mr steve brown was brunette with gray coming in at the temples hes was taller than she was by about five inches but other than that they matched you could still see the pretty roundfaced cheerleader shed been in high school the handsome football player was still there in his shoulders and the edges of his face but the extra weight and the extra years and the grief had covered over who theyd been their eyes were bright but it was an unnatural brightness almost shocky she spoke too fast and he spoke too slowly as if he had to think about each word before he said it she spoke as if talking about her son was something she had to do or shed explode or break down he was a straight a student ms blake and heres the last picture he painted it was a water color of his youngest sister he had such talent she held up the picture which theyd brought in one of those art carriers that looks like a thin briefcase i dutifully looked at the painting it was a very soft picture all watery blues and delicate yellows and the childs curls were almost white the little girl was laughing and the artist had caught a shine in her eyes that usually required a camera to capture it was good for a junior in high school it was spectacular its a wonderful painting mrs brown steve didnt want me to bring it he said that you didnt need to see it but i thought if you saw what kind of person he was that youd be willing to do what we want i dont think that seeing steves paintings will influence ms blake thats all barbara he patted her hand as he finished and she didnt react to it at all it was almost as if he hadnt touched her i began to understand who was the driving force behind this tragic farce because it was a farce she wasnt talking like she wanted her son brought back as a zombie so he could say whod murdered him she was talking like she was trying to persuade me to do a lazarus on him to really bring him back had bert heard that in her voice and ignored it or had she saved it for me he was a track star and on the football team she opened the yearbook to appropriate places and i looked at stevie brown running in shorts with a baton in his hand head thrown back a look of utter concentration on his face his hair was dark and not long stevie brown kneeling on the ground in full football gear helmet on the ground by his hand he was grinning out at the camera his bangs spilling over his eyes he had his fathers hair and a thinner younger brighter version of his mothers face except for the lips and the eyes which again were his fathers i saw a picture of him on the yearbook staff bent over a layout table face very serious he looked like someone that would run track thin muscled but not much bulk i wouldnt have picked him for football not beefy enough but who knew if he might have filled out in the summer between junior and senior year but he never got the chance prom night he and his senior girlfriend had been crowned king and queen there was a picture of them in front of a background of fake silver stars and too many sequins he was beaming into the camera hed cut his hair and styled it so it was neat and thick and flattered his face more than the way it had when he ran track his shoulders were a little broader than in the yearbook or track photos he looked taller in his white tux the girl was blond and looked like a thinner taller version of his mother the girl looked confident and lovely with a smile that was more mysterious than stevies had been looking at their pictures it was obvious they didnt know that in less than six hours theyd be dead cathy and stevie had been dating for almost two years high school sweethearts just like steve and me she leaned forward as she said it her lips half parted her tongue moistened them as if she was having trouble keeping her mouth from drying out her husband kept patting her hand and looked at me out of his fine dark eyes which were so like his dead sons he told me with those eyes and his sotired face that he was sorry sorry i had to see this hear this be here now i wasnt up to the subtle eye message thing the best i could do was nod sympathetically and give him more eye contact than i gave her he gave a small nod where barbara couldnt see him there wed had our moment a very guy moment i see you i see you too i understand what you mean i understand what you mean too if id been a better girl id have said something out loud to be sure he sounds like he was a wonderful person i said she leaned forward a little more she had a small photo album in her hands one of those thick ones that grandmothers carry in their purses she fumbled it open and i was staring at pictures of a darkhaired baby toddler gradeschooler i put my hand over hers stopped her from turning the pages mrs brown barbara she wouldnt look at me her eyes were getting shinier mrs brown you dont need to prove to me that your son was a good kid i believe you mr brown stood up and tried to help her put the photo album back in her purse she didnt want to do it and he wouldnt fight her he stood there sort of helplessly with his big hands hanging at his sides she leaned into the desk again and turned a page here he is winning the fifth grade science fair i didnt know how to stop this without being cruel i leaned back in my chair and stopped looking at the pictures i made eye contact with steve and his eyes had grown shinier too if they both started crying i was going to leave if i could have helped them i would have but i couldnt and truthfully i didnt think barbara brown had come to me to produce a zombie i looked back down at a picture of stevie in eighth grade his first year on the football team that surprised me id have thought his father would have put him in peewee league it made me think better of steve that hed waited until his son wanted to play i covered her hands and the book with my hands i pressed down enough that she had to finally look up at me her eyes were wild as if tears were the least of our worries there was something almost violent in that look i changed what id been going to say because she wasnt ready to hear me say leave i cant help you you told me that it happened on prom night but you didnt give me any details i didnt really want details but anything to stop the pictures and the desperate flow of memories murder i could handle the trip down memory lane was getting on my nerves her eyes flicked right then left and she leaned back leaving the album in my hands i left it open to his thirteenth birthday party the smiling faces of him and his friends clustered around a cake her breath came out in a long slow rattle not a sound that you hear out of the living much she swallowed convulsively and reached for her husbands hand he was still standing his face relaxed a little just because shed reached for him they found stevies car off the road as if theyd been run into the ditch the police think that they were picked up trying to hitchhike he said stevie wouldnt have gotten into a car with strangers barbara said firmly and neither would cathy her eyes were a little less wild they were good kids im sure they were mrs brown people seemed to want to make saints of the dead as if their very goodness should have protected them purity was not a shield against violence in fact sometimes ignorance got you killed faster im not saying they werent good kids steve said she ignored him and shed taken her hand back both her hands were clasped around her purse clutching it in her lap as if she had to hold on to something and his hand wasnt enough they wouldnt have gotten in a car with strangers stevie was very protective of cathy he wouldnt have done it she was so certain that there was nothing else to say about that particular speculation then did they know the people that gave them a ride i asked that seemed to throw her she frowned and her eyes darted from side to side like something trapped no one we know would have harmed stevie or cathy shed been sure about the stranger thing but she wasnt really sure about this one somewhere in her was enough logic to know that either they got into a car with strangers or they got into a car with people they knew there were no other choices the police think that they might have been forced into another car maybe with a weapon steve said she was shaking her head over and over i cant bear the thought of someone pointing a gun at them i just cant think who would have done such a thing he patted her shoulder barb maybe you better wait out in the other room while i finish talking to ms blake here she was still shaking her head no no shes going to help us shes going to bring stevie back and he can tell us who did this to him and to cathy and itll be all better we need to know who could do such a horrible thing she looked up at me and her eyes cleared for a moment stevie and cathy would not have gotten into a car with strangers wed talked about it he knew that if someone pointed a gun at him and tried to force him into a car that they wouldnt let him live weve talked about that since he was a little boy her breath caught but she didnt cry not yet i know he would have done what id told him to do he would have grabbed cathy and run into the woods the car was parked right next to the woods they could have hidden in there it had to be someone he knew or she knew it had to be someone we know ms blake she said changing her tune from a minute ago our beautiful boy was taken away by one of the people that have been over to our house eating our food giving us flowers someone we know is a monster and we didnt know it there that was the true horror not just that her son and his girlfriend had been murdered but the murderer had to be someone barbara and steve brown knew what must it be like to stare into the faces of your friends your childrens friends and wonder was it you or you which one of you did it i couldnt even argue with her because you are more than percent more likely to be killed by someone you know than by a stranger an ugly statistic but true you say monster do you mean just that they could kill your son or something about how it was done maybe it had been something supernatural maybe there was more than one reason theyd come to me i could hope there was something i could do for them she put her hands over her face and started to cry not quietly either steve brown spoke over her sobs as if hed heard them before what was done to them ms blake what was done to them was monstrous he didnt look like a man whod had to say monstrous a lot in his life i didnt think it was a word hed chosen lightly barbara brown was rocking back and forth back and forth while she wept her sobs must have been as loud as i thought they were because the phone on my desk rang i jumped but got it it was mary our very good secretary is everything alright no i said do you need me to pretend you have another client fifteen minutes i said or sooner if it gets louder mary asked yes that would be fine i hung up promising myself to send mary flowers or chocolates or both steve brown was trying to calm his wife shed stopped rocking and was leaning in against him the sobs had quieted a little when her blue eyes turned to me again they contained that promise of violence again if she knew who had done it i wasnt sure what shed do to them looking into her eyes i wasnt at all certain that shed wait for a judge and jury she spoke very fast her words almost sliding into one another they raped cathy raped her and they mutilated stevie they cut she just stopped talking her hands pressed over her mouth eyes impossibly wide there wasnt a lot of sanity left in that look i kept my eyes on her while i asked steve brown so someone gave them a lift after they had car trouble and then they found them in a shed in the woods he said and theyd raped them both he said in such a quiet voice no change of inflection as if he felt nothing when he said it and maybe he didnt not up where he was aware of it anyway hed had to push his pain underground as far as he could shove it because barbaras pain was more important than his more allconsuming they cut him he almost broke then but he rallied and i watched him fight his face to hold it all together they castrated him one of his eyes gave an involuntary flutter while he was still alive his voice had gotten softer the police never found it she said and her voice was shrill they cant find it the monsters took a piece of him away and the police cant find it we had to bury him without it they took it and we couldnt get it back for him her voice was growing louder and louder not exactly a scream but not far from it the shrill edge of hysteria was in full cry they didnt take anything from cathy why didnt they cut her up why just stevie why that why did they take that why that if id had a dart gun full of valium id have used it but i didnt it was awful horrible but i couldnt fix this for them and i really didnt need another nightmare to add to my list i couldnt help them it was a human monster and i wasnt an expert on that kind of monster i finally went with that mrs brown mrs brown barbara i yelled it and it didnt phase her she was gone gone into her pain her sorrow her loss i was yelling but there was no one home to hear me mary opened the door and said something twice before i could hear it over mrs browns voice your next client is here anita youve gone fifteen minutes over already mary was looking at me but her eyes were a little wide shed been a secretary and law clerk once for a criminal attorney so shed seen grieving and hysterical clients before but either this was a new variety or mary didnt like it any better than i did ill use one of the other offices mr brown ill give you and your wife a few minutes to collect yourselves barbara brown ran to me please ms blake please please help us she grabbed the front of my jacket her hand brushed the butt of my gun and that made her pause but only for a second then she wadded her hands tight in the cloth of my jacket if shed been a man she might have jerked me into her but she didnt she just clung to me and begged please steve show her the check barbara shes not going to help us she dug her hands tighter into my jacket making fists of the cloth it was a girls jacket not a mans and there just wasnt enough material to treat it that roughly it pulled my shoulders forward and was limiting my mobility and shed made it impossible for me to go for my gun i didnt believe she was going to get so out of hand that id need the gun but it was standard policy for me no one got to compromise my gun no one the trouble was i couldnt figure a way to get free of her without hurting her physically and i didnt want to do that steve show her the check she was so close to me that it was strangely intimate close enough to kiss too close to fight show me whatever she wants me to see mr brown i kept my voice calm no anger no hint of what i was thinking which was get her the fuck off me i wasnt unsympathetic but a stranger had breached my personal space and i never liked that his face was all apology as he drew something out of the inner breast pocket of his suit coat it was one of those oversized checks a cashiers check he held it up so i could see it clearly the check was for a hundred and thirty thousand dollars payable to cash take the check ms blake well sign it over to you now today right now i shook my head and put my hands gently over hers i was going to have to get her off me i cant take your money mrs brown i tried to pry her hands away but she gripped them tighter the jacket was going to be permanently wrinkled its our life savings but we could refinance the house we could get you more her eyes were so bright right next to mine again that unnatural brightness and i wondered if she was on something something prescribed if it was prescribed then it was the wrong medication i couldnt get her hands off of me without hurting her and i still wasnt willing to do that i patted her hands id try to be friendly it isnt a matter of money mrs brown if i could raise your son and find out who did this i would honest to god i would but it doesnt work like that nathaniel was at the door he gave me a look like is there anything i can do i couldnt think of anything so i gave a small shake of my head mary must have gone for bert because he appeared in the doorway with her behind him mrs brown you need to let anita go i told you before you had the meeting how it would go his voice was even almost singsong as if hed done this before he hadnt done it much for me but not everyone had my charm and ability to scare people usually the gun made most clients nervous but barbara brown didnt give a fuck about my gun she glanced at bert but then turned immediately back to me her hands still strangling my jacket you cant say no ms blake if you say no then its over and it cant be over she began to give me a little shake with every other word and it shake cant be shake over shake mother of god how do i help her and how do i get her off me without making it all worse we had grief counselors on file but i doubted shed go to one she wasnt at that therapywillbehelpful stage she was at that imgoingcrazy stage i stopped trying to pry her off me but i was tired of being shaken i decided for truth a murdered zombie kills its killer i want them dead she almost screamed it and tightened her grip so that she spit in my face just a little accidentally the zombie cuts a path of destruction through everything and everyone in its way until it kills its killer ive seen zombies kill innocent bystanders by accident stevie wouldnt do that she said and her face was so close to mine i wanted to draw my face back to focus on her but she had too much of my jacket in her hands so that i was effectively trapped stevie was such a gentle person hed never hurt anyone hed just tell us who did this awful thing mrs brown barbara i said and she looked at me there was a hint of sanity in there somewhere it wont be stevie barbara it will be the walking dead he wont be your son hell just be an animated corpse she lowered her face so that i was looking down at the top of her blond head her shoulders slumped and i thought id gotten through to her bert said mrs brown if youd come into my office for a few minutes so we can all calm down so we can all get on with our day i think it was the get on with our day she stiffened and i had a second to decide whether i was willing to really hurt her or not i hesitated and that was enough she had me held too close with the jacket i couldnt move back and i couldnt raise a hand until she let me go she scratched my face but to do it she let go with one hand i raised the freed arm up and blocked her next attempt to scratch my eyes out she let go with the other arm but i grabbed her wrist and stepped away pulling on the wrist at the same time and used her own momentum to turn her around and she ended up on her knees with one of her arms behind her back and my other arm across her shoulders i didnt make it a true choke hold because i was hoping that someone might drag her off me before it got that far my face was burning sharply from just below my left eye to midcheek even before i felt the first trickle i knew it was going to bleed it just had that feel to it she was screaming loud ragged screams steve brown was closest to us and he said youre hurting her im hurtingher i said she tried to take out my eye i didnt have as good a hold on her as i should have i was still trying to be nice to the poor bereaved crazy woman she twisted in my grip and dug her nails across my hand i tucked my elbow tight across her throat and pulled up sharp on her arm behind her back she cried out but it stopped abruptly because i was applying pressure to her neck i knew how to do a choke hold so that all it did was make you pass out i knew not to crush the adams apple or anything stupid and i admit i was pissed by this point but mr brown shouldnt have done what he did he yelled let her go i said calmly i thought if you cant control her i will she struggled and i tucked my head down tight to her then two things happened at once nathaniel said anita look out and mary screamed i looked up in time to see steve brown hit me in the face it rocked my head back and made reality shift just a little to the side like a television that isnt quite in focus it didnt really hurt immediately not like the scratches at all you can usually judge how bad an injury is by how long it takes for you to feel the pain quick pain small to medium injury long pain not good it was a good hit nice and solid i think hed expected me to go down because he had this surprised look on his face or maybe he hadnt ever hit a woman that hard before or maybe at all we had one of those long seconds that seem to last forever but are really just the blink of an eye to look at each other over his wifes head i saw his lips move but couldnt hear what he said the only sound was a high white buzzing static and the taste of blood in my mouth it didnt matter that it was my own blood it only mattered that it was blood and i was angry i had a moment a heartbeat where i smelled barbara browns skin underneath the sweetness of her perfume a moment where i could smell her skin salty sick almost sick with her grief like some poison coming out of her skin she was wounded she was hurt i could end that suffering i tucked myself tight in against her body tight enough that her husband couldnt hit me without risking her i still couldnt hear his voice but i could hear something else i could hear her heartbeat so loud so very loud it was a thick meaty sound not like that fragile tinny sound you get through a stethoscope this was what a heart would sound like if you could put your ear inside someones chest this was what someones life sounded like beating inside their body beating fast and faster barbara brown had smelled like food before but now that first flush of adrenaline kicked through her system some part of her that she couldnt even name knew something was wrong knew that danger was very very close i must have closed my eyes because i felt him looming over me i opened my eyes to see steve brown about to touch me i think he was going for my hair to pull me off his wife but i saw the hand and i grabbed it just stopped it with my hand my hand looked small around his bigger one but my arm was solid and when he tried to pull away he couldnt do it i still had his wife on her knees with my other hand around her wrist and her arm up almost to her shoulders distantly i thought if i kept pulling id dislocate her shoulder but another part of me which felt much closer thought thats alright wed have to pull her apart to eat her anyway true if we were going to eat her were we id always thought that the beast was a thing of passion because passionate emotions could bring it on this wasnt passionate this was passionless there was no right or wrong in my head no sympathy no sense that these two people were fellow human beings and it would be wrong to hurt them that wasnt even in my head theyd hurt me and i was hungry and she smelled so good and so bad at the same time she smelled of sickness and i realized it was drugs i could smell them in her sweatacrid bitter i let her go so abruptly she fell forward on the carpet but i kept my hand on steve brown and i drew him past his wife because he had bent to see to her and id pulled him off balance he smelled of fear and anger but nothing else he was clean he stumbled and i put a hand in his shirt while the other used his arm to bring him in closer i could hear his heart now thudding thudding so thick so meaty so so good i felt movement behind me and i whirled taking steve brown with me tripping him without thinking about it so that he was on the ground at my feet with me still gripping his arm food should be on the ground nathaniel was there touching my face i jerked back as if hed hit me but with that one touch sound roared back into my head a woman was screaming mary was asking should i call the police no bert was saying no we can handle this i doubted that but the moment i thought that i looked down at mr brown he was staring up at me eyes wide and he was afraid i let him go as if his skin burned mine i backed up until i bumped into nathaniel i grabbed for his hand without looking and clung to it just touching him helped me think usually all touching nathaniel made me think about was sex or food but today it helped me remember that i was human and what that meant help me i whispered everybody out he said everyone stared at him i screamed it out get out all of you out i started to rush at them but nathaniel caught me around the waist and i let him pick me up i fought not to struggle but i kept screaming get them out get them out steve brown grabbed his wifes arm and started dragging her toward the door bert finally moved taking her other arm and helping he was looking at me as if hed never seen me before and maybe he hadnt bert had a gift for only seeing what he wanted to see marys pale face was the last thing i saw before the door shut and the words get them out changed to a wordless formless scream one ragged scream after another until my throat went raw and i sagged in nathaniels arms before id only felt the beast like it was some huge pet that rubbed itself against my body and my mind but today i knew that that wasnt the most dangerous part of the beast the most dangerous part was that it was an animal and true animals have absolutely no sense of right and wrong i screamed because to stop and do anything else was to risk that mind coming back up through me and i wasnt sure i could stop it again nathaniel called my name but i couldnt answer i was afraid to answer afraid if i took even a moment to think that that other colder mind would take over again nathaniel dropped to his knees with his arms still around my waist the sudden movement startled me stopped the screams like a switch had been thrown that other mind spilled into the silence but it wasnt cold anymore it was frightened leopards are solitary there are only three reasons to meet another leopard in the wild fighting fucking or eating he was either something that would hurt us something that would fuck us or something that would eat us there were no other choices in the fear that roared through my brain i thought id understood what the fight or flight response was but id been wrong this made anything id ever felt as a human being pale by comparison the need to strike out or run away thrilled all the way down to the tips of my fingers and toes it was a rush of adrenaline like id never known my entire body was thick with it stronger faster because i was about to fight to the death i fought that panic fought not to struggle not to fight nathaniel i could get away i knew it and that other mind knew it we could get away we could be safe but that small part that was still human knew that nathaniel wouldnt hurt us we had to let him pin us had to because i knew i could escape what i didnt know was what would happen if i got away what would happen if nathaniel couldnt pin me and hold me down until i could think like a person again i didnt want to find out because it would be something bad something i wouldnt want to live with afterward i struggled to be still to let nathaniel take me down to be limp in his arms as he pressed me to the floor that other mind shrieked through me as my body touched the carpet it shrieked that we would die and it believed that it had no friends here id always thought that at least part of my beast was richards wolf but in that moment i knew it wasnt so what fought me wasnt anything that recognized the larger social order of the pack there was only prey rivals mates and young no part of me saw nathaniel as a child i let him pin me facedown on the carpet my skirt was too short for being flat on the ground and it began to ride up his body molded to my back his hands on my wrists i fought that screaming voice in my head to lay still to let nathaniel get as good a hold on me as he could he had no training in how to pin someone he did it the only way he knew how by forcing my legs apart with his hips so i couldnt just go to my knees and lift him off the skirt rode up my hips until it was bunched so high that there was nothing between him and me but the silk of my panties and his pants it was a horribly vulnerable position even the part of me that was still me didnt like it because once youre pinned under someone like that your options vanish i like options options keep you safe nathaniel wont hurt me nathaniel wont hurt me i kept repeating that over and over and over as he settled his body tighter against mine the part that was beast knew he could break our spines from this position the part that was me felt like it was a prelim to rape i knew that nathaniel wouldnt do that and i also knew that truthfully if youre intent on rape you want some clothes off before you get here because once youve pinned someone like this your hands are busy and mens pants dont unzip themselves logically i was safe but logic isnt always what wins when youre scared the beast was scared because it couldnt trust another leopard i was scared of what would happen if the least dominant person in my life couldnt dominate me enough to keep me from tearing out his throat or breaking through that thin office door and slaughtering everyone outside i trusted nathaniel not to hurt me i did not trust him to control me and keep everybody else safe i especially didnt trust him to keep himself safe hadnt he begged me just this morning to set my teeth in his throat and draw blood i didnt trust him to be enough enough leopard enough man enough person just enough and that doubt fed my fear fed all the fears and i lost lost myself lost control lost the last clear thought i had before panic set in was i have to get up off the floor i had to get up i forgot everything id ever known about how to use my body how to fight panic was all i felt and panic does not plan it reacts i went from that limp stillness that i had fought for to bucking writhing throwing my body from side to side i struggled with my whole body with every muscle i literally threw everything i had into simply trying to get up nathaniels body rocked with me he fought to keep my wrists pinned to the carpet my hips pressed down my legs apart so i couldnt just get to my knees and throw him off i felt him struggling above me but he wasnt used to being the one on top i threw my body to the left and lifted us both half off the ground he shoved us back down and i had a moment to feel the potential strength so terribly strong as he forced us back to the floor if hed been willing to let go of one wrist and used his other arm for something else but he kept my wrists and maybe i couldnt get up but he couldnt control me either not enough he was saying something i dont know how long hed been repeating it before i understood it dont make me hurt you anita please please please he almost screamed the last word the panic in his voice told the leopard that we were winning make him afraid of us and hell let us go it spurred the cat and we threw ourselves to the left again if his back hadnt hit the desk wed have rolled him i screamed but it wasnt fear this time it was triumph we ended sitting with his back propped against the desk his legs encircled my waist i scratched at them and part of me didnt understand why the cloth did not part in bloody strips one arm went across my chest and only later would i realize that hed covered my gun butt with his hand his other hand balled into my hair jerking hard enough that it tore a scream from my throat i had a moment to feel his breath like heat on the back of my neck the leopard screamed that he would snap our neck the other part of me was just confused nathaniel bit me he sank his teeth into my skin into my flesh i felt his teeth slide inside me and i stopped fighting it was as if hed hit a switch i didnt know i had at first i simply stopped fighting my hands fell limp to my sides my body relaxed and what should have been pain felt warm and comforting nathaniel growled with his mouth still locked against my body and it drew a moan from my throat the growl turned to a purr a deep vibrating sound and because his mouth was locked over the top of my spine that deep pulsing rhythm played down my spine as if my body were a tuning fork for his voice i cried out but it wasnt fear or triumph now he loosened his legs around my waist i stayed limp and easy against his body he uncurled his legs slowly body tense as he waited for me to react but i was past reacting i was waiting waiting for him to master me it was the only word i had for it it was the most wonderful feeling so peaceful so safe he kept his teeth around my neck his hand in my hair but the other hand he took slowly away i sank into him my body sliding along the front of his held in place only by teeth and hair my skirt had bunched like a belt at my waist and rode higher behind from my body sliding against his nathaniel slid his arm around my waist pulling the bunched skirt even higher i think by accident he drew us both to our knees with his arm around my waist he moved his arm away from my waist slowly i stayed on my knees swaying a little because every muscle was loose and calm i actually had to concentrate to stay kneeling and not simply fall to the ground but his hand in my hair and his mouth at my neck kept me upright made me want to stay on my knees but that little bit of effort on my part started to help me climb back into my own head a little not a lot but a little more of me was here enough to both worry and enjoy his bite on my neck worry because what would happen when he let go would i revert back to that cold mind enjoy because part of me that wasnt just cat liked that firm grip that pull of teeth in flesh i knew i was feeling better because faintly i could hear what nathaniel was feeling not a sound but i had no word for sensing another persons feelings he was scared excited frustrated confused unsure scared unhappy worried i felt each emotion like a cobweb blown across my body in the dark nothing to see and when you brush at it it breaks apart and blows away as if it wasnt there at all animals didnt have this many emotions all at once confused and scared yes but not the rest the rest was still too much for my beast nathaniels free hand fumbled at the waistband of my panties my skirt was already pushed up around my waist on its own without any help from him he pulled my panties down to my knees but since he was working onehanded they came down in fits and starts and it was anything but smooth he growled his frustration against my skin and it caught my breath in my throat made me go weak at the knees he used my hair like a handle making it clear that if i went down on the floor it would hurt it helped me stay on my knees helped me concentrate and that helped me slide a little more inside my own skull i wanted to say his name it seemed like that would help but i couldnt think of his name couldnt say it out loud it was as ifname were an alien concept smell his smell that i knew i tried to say it and it took me three tries before i whispered vanilla hed wrestled my panties down almost to my knees but at that one word he stopped he kept his hand on my hair but he lifted his mouth from my neck just enough so that his breath caressed like heat on the wound hed made anita can you hear me are you in there was i in there it seemed like too hard a question for me was i in there i think i took too long to answer because the next thing i felt was his belt smacking against my bare butt his pants fluttered against me the beast ground my hips against him but not to slow him down the thoughts werent this clear but it amounted to hed bested us in a fight hed earned the right to mate i knew now why the big cats fought before they mated you had to prove you were strong enough that old biology imperative to only breed with the best with the male that can give your offspring the genes they need to survive the leopard didnt mind she was ready i on the other hand had a problem of course i couldnt remember what it was couldnt think because the human part of me agreed that nathaniel had earned his right to be here hed saved us saved all the nice people outside the office door office that was it i didnt want to fuck at work that was it i moved away from nathaniels body i pulled away from him and his fear skyrocketed he had no way of knowing that it was the human me that was wanting to pull away the beast smelled that rush of fear and let out a sound in my throat that id never heard come out of me it wasnt a human sound he pulled on my hair so hard that it brought a gasp from my throat but strangely made me relax it hurt but it felt good too and gave an echo of that wonderful peacefulness that had happened when he bit the back of my neck he brushed the head of himself against my body and the beast writhed for him he whispered the angles wrong then he used my hair like a handle and his other hand to put me on all fours on the floor the leopard crouched down in front of him giving him my ass like we were in heat he pulled my panties the rest of the way down my legs got them tangled on the boots heels then they were gone maybe the beast was in heat but i wasnt maybe it was losing my underwear but the assinair position was a little too undignified for me i raised back up enough to be on all fours so i didnt look like i was offering myself to him i opened my mouth to say something and he pushed himself inside me and i forgot that i could talk the beast had been willing but there had been almost no foreplay and i was tight so terribly tight nathaniel had to work himself inside me he used his hand and my hair to spill me back to the carpet so that i was back where i started it was just as undignified but i didnt seem to care for the first time the beast and i were in agreement id slept with nathaniel but id put very firm rules in place id never touched him between the legs not on purpose to go from having deprived myself of even a caress to the sensation of him pushing his way inside my body was overwhelming it wasnt just that it felt good though it did it was that it was nathaniel part of me though i might never say out loud had been wanting to cross this barrier to shove it aside to bend it break it ignore it he worked until he was sheathed inside me as far as he could go then he hesitated stopped moving frozen against me anita can you hear me hear him hear him the cat screamed through my head and that scream spilled out my mouth i lost some of the ground id gained because the beast wasnt conflicted not in the least it she began to work our hips so that nathaniel stayed still but we drew him out of our body out and out and then when the tip of him seemed about to spill out we drove ourselves upon him his voice came oh god we moved over him against him shoving as hard and fast and deep as we could it was as if nothing would be enough i wasnt open enough to be this rough i felt him almost catching on the sides because i hadnt given myself time to grow wider but i felt frantic there was no thought about waiting just the need i wanted him to fuck me sex was too mild a word for it i couldnt make him do what i wanted i wanted deeper i wanted more and i needed him to help for that he let go of my hair and his hands touched my hips and he began to ride our rhythm the cats and mine we pushed and he shoved and just like on the dance floor where id followed his body now he followed mine it was a dance of flesh his into mine until i was wet and warm and he moved easily inside me out and in out and in when he could glide inside of me he shoved himself deeper harder as if he understood what my body was asking without words he used his hands to move me just a little until he found the spot he wanted and then he plunged inside me as if he meant to come out the other side and i screamed for him i looked back over my shoulder and his eyes werent lavender they were blue with hints of gray and they werent human anymore his shirt was open so i could see his stomach and chest he did a movement with his stomach like a belly dancer and his rhythm changed grew more urgent and somehow smoother or cyclical as if he were doing a circle inside me and out of me a circle that went lower going in and higher coming out so that he touched all of me but not all at the same time hed worked me larger by being rough making me take all of him and more and now that he had a hairs breadth of room he used it he used it in that circular rhythm to caress along the walls of me it was one of the most delicate things id ever felt when a man was inside me so careful and yet the push of his hips was so strong the control took more strength than just shoving himself inside me strength of so many different kinds it was the upper stroke as he was pulling out that found that spot id had the spot manipulated by hand and had it included in intercourse but never quite like this every time he slid over that one spot my breathing changed and he heard it because he changed his rhythm again sliding himself over and over that small spot not just the tip of him but the head and as much of the shaft as he could manage he used himself to stroke me in a way that id only had done with fingers and hands before as always when that place inside was touched just right the sensation of pressure was just this side of unpleasant my body felt as if when he brought me all the fluids in my body would fly and not just the ones we wanted it was always like that that pressure more pressure than any other kind of orgasm as if you would lose control of your body completely jeanclaude had had to ease me through it the first few times reassure me that whatever happened it would be fine it would be wonderful the pressure built and built dancing along that line of too much a pleasure so large it was almost pain a pleasure that grew and grew inside me like some warm expanding thing as if the orgasm were something separate from me something that grew inside me and would burst out of my body i managed to whisperalmost hisshis name nathaniel he hesitated a fraction anita are you dont stop please dont stop he didnt ask again he shifted his position a fraction then closed his eyes and gave himself to the rhythm of his body i tried to move my hips but his hands clamped tight on my hips keeping me still holding me in place the pressure built built until my body was thick with it full of it and then it spilled out out in a burst of liquid between my legs out in shrieks out in my hands clawing the carpet i had to claw at something had to do something with the pleasure it was as if it were too much pleasure for my skin to hold if id had a beast inside me it would have spilled out along with that thick liquid between my thighs he eased himself out of me and i lay on the carpet unable to move hell i was having trouble focusing my eyes let alone moving anything else he crawled to my head stroking my hair back from my face are you alright i started to laugh then blinked and tried to see better he was still spilling out of his pants and he was still hard and firm and though there was liquid on him it wasnt white enough or heavy enough to be his i swallowed the laugh and said in a voice that was still breathy you didnt go you werent in a head space where you could give me permission i closed my eyes and willed myself to sober up when i opened them i could see again no bleary edges good what do you mean give you permission i asked i dont get to have orgasm unless you tell me i can the look on my face must have been eloquent because he said with a smile i knew that would weird you out but look at the benefits anita i can go for a very long time because thats the way i was trained trained i said he nodded i closed my eyes again youve been begging for orgasm for intercourse you had the perfect excuse and you dont take it i opened my eyes and stared at him why didnt you take it i want you to want me anita not just use me for a metaphysical emergency i sat up and was reminded that i had no underwear on i glanced at the carpet and for the first time was glad it was a dark woodsy brown the wet spot didnt show as badly where are my underwear i asked he started looking around as if he werent sure either great he was also still perfectly erect and it was distracting if youre not going to i started to make a gesture but stopped then can you put that away he turned with a smile that was perilously close to a grin why does it bother you yes i said with as much dignity as i could muster pulling my skirt down over my hips he held my underwear out toward me he was fighting a smile but it filled his lavender eyes with suppressed laughter i snatched them from his hand but couldnt think of a slick way of getting them on truthfully i was wet enough that i needed towels before i got back into my panties i walked a little wobbly around my desk i had baby wipes in the desk drawer they helped with cleanup when i came into work with a spot of blood id missed i was debating whether i could sacrifice my extra tshirt that i kept in a drawer for blood emergencies too when nathaniel started talking again and not about anything i was comfortable hearing you know its rare for a woman to be able to do that i had the drawer open and the moist towelettes in hand whats rare youre a rainmaker he was kneeling on the other side of the desk with his arms on the desktop and his chin resting on them it was a strangely childlike gesture and it did nothing to make me feel better the only definition i know for that term is a lawyer who brings in big bucks for their law firm im assuming thatrainmaker has a meaning that i dont know i made sure my unhappiness about the whole topic showed in my voice i was uncomfortable enough just cleaning myself up i was wet down to my knees and beyond jesus what a mess its a term for a woman who can ejaculate i took in a lot of air and let it out slowly can we not talk about this why are you mad that was a fair question why was i mad i had to think about it to be honest even with myself i got the spare tshirt from the bottom drawer and dried off with it so much for extra clothes i slipped my underwear back on and felt better i always felt better dressed why was i mad i sat down in my chair getting out the spare hose that i also kept in a drawer i went through a lot of hose in my line of work they just werent meant to be worn to animal sacrifices bad guy chases or vampire slayings nope nylons were just not made for my lifestyle i started unzipping my boots so i could take off the hose wed shredded struggling on the carpet why am i mad i said almost to myself my fingertips hurt a sharp immediate pain as the last of the endorphins left id torn off half my nails down to bloody quick once i saw the blood it hurt worse why did it always hurt worse when you saw the blood he stood up and zipped himself back into the dress slacks there were stains on the legs of the trousers that werent going to be fixed by baby wipes and a tshirt i didnt have extra clothes for nathaniel yes he said when he got himself safely inside still hard still thick still ready why are you mad you didnt go i said and started peeling off the hose it gave me something useful to do instead of meet his eyes youre mad because i didnt go im mad because if youd gone wed have that barrier crossed and now we dont and he said i sighed and if wed crossed it it would be easier to cross it again but doing it this way makes it more important he said i nodded yes he came around the desk and went to his knees at my feet i want it to be important to you anita i dont just want to be someone you take because you have to take someone anyone i want you to want me you said that before he touched my hands where they held the new hose and he moved them gently out of my hands and laid them on the desk he took both my hands in his and there was such a serious look in his eyes that i was afraid afraid of what hed say you loved me before today you loved me without sex no ones ever loved me or even wanted me without fucking me first no one since my mother died and nicholas he bowed his head for a second and i squeezed his hands id seen that memory and i didnt want him thinking about it so horrible and hed been so little i wanted to protect him from things like that i wanted to keep him safe he smiled up at me gabriel and raina taught me that i could be worth something but that worth was all about my body the way i looked and how good i could fuck he squeezed my hands tighter you taught me that i was worth more than just fucking you taught me that i was worth more than just being used i started to say something but he put his fingertips against my lips i know what youre going to say you think you use me with theardeur because im yourpomme de sang you dont know what using somebody is anita you just dont know there was that look in his eyes that he got sometimes that made his eyes look so much older than he was a look of murdered hopes and more pain than anyone his age should have had to experience i kissed his fingers then rested my face against his hand someday i want you to stop getting that look in your eyes i want there to be enough good in your life to balance that out he smiled and there was a tenderness in his eyes that made me have to look away see anita you think youre hard and that you use people but you arent and you dont i pulled away a little i can be hard when i need to be but not to me and not to micah not to anyone that will let you be nice to them if theyre shitty youre shitty back but you give them the chance first i shook my head im not that good a person nathaniel he smiled and touched my face where barbara brown had scratched me i winced yes you are you just dont like admitting it we better get dressed and out there before someone calls the cops bert wont call the police hes too afraid of bad publicity i laughed you havent met bert often enough to know him that well ive known a lot of people like bert hes not as bad as they were but its the same kind of thinking he wants his moneymaker to keep on making money more than he wants anyone to be safe or happy i looked into that terribly young face and there was no one young looking back at me as much as id seen of life nathaniel had seen things that would have broken me or at least bent me all to hell i cupped his face in my hands and said what am i going to do with you i want you to make love to me his voice was soft but oh so serious i tried to make a joke of it not right now i hope he gave me his gentle smile the one that said he wasnt going to let me get away with it no not right now but soon i drew back from him and i was almost afraid of him afraid in a way that guns cant help with why are you making this so hard love should be hard anita or what is it worth you taught me that all these months in your bed with your body against mine and no release you taught me how hard love can be im sorry i said i didnt understand until yesterday he leaned up on his knees and got close enough to kiss my mouth dont be sorry make love to me my voice was shaky as i said not right now no and he breathed against my lips but soon he kissed me one chaste touch of lips then he stood and moved away to give me some room i watched him move across the room toward the door ill tell them were alright i nodded because i didnt trust my voice hed given me room physically but emotionally emotionally he was giving me no room at all i waited for the panic to set in but it didnt what came was the memory of him inside my body and the thought of what it might be like to have him spill himself inside me id been loud enough and it had taken long enough that part of me wished there was a back door to my office but there wasnt so i couldnt slink off even if id been willing to do it besides if bert ever suspected that i was that bothered by it hed use it against me try for some kind of leverage in the ongoing game of oneupmanship that bert and i had played for years the only cure for it was a bold face sigh i ran my fingers through my hair which is all youre supposed to do when your hair is as curly as mine brushing just makes it frizz i checked my makeup in the little mirror that id started having to keep in the desk the problem with dressing more like a girl was that it forced you to have to care once you put on the lipstick you had to look at it periodically to make sure it hadnt smeared like clown makeup i liked the way lipstick looked on me but i hated having to think about it the eye shadow had survived pretty well but the lipstick was pretty much smeared all over my mouth again i was grateful that the carpet was dark red lipstick on a pale carpet would have looked awkward on the deep brown you couldnt see it i used some makeup remover that was supposed to be used to take off eye makeup but id found it worked dandy on lipstick i used a moist wipe to get everything off and then had to reapply the lipstick see so much trouble i was just happy that i almost never wore base makeup that would have been a bitch to get off the carpet when my mouth was as red as when i started i put everything back into the desk drawer got up straightened my skirt took a deep breath and went for the door with everything that had happened to me in the last twentyfour hours having to face bert down still took more courage than was pretty you do not fuck at work you just dont its déclassé to say the least shit when i stepped out into the reception area i got a surprise no one assumed wed been having sex the screams had been violent enough that everyone assumed it had been a bloody battle a near thing the fact that both nathaniel and i came out bloodier than when we started helped mary had sat him down in her very own office chair she was laying out bandages while nathaniel cleaned the wounds on his hand they were deep bloody nail marks once i would have said that it looked like a leopard ripped him up but id seen the damage that real leopards could do and i knew better now i was sort of amazed that id done that much damage though i went to stand near him im sorry i said im not mad this close i could see that the front of his knuckles on both hands were raw as well i frowned i didnt do your knuckles carpet burn he said i looked at the bloody scrapes and made a face ow i said i dont mind he said mary looked up at me that woman and man are in with bert they wouldnt leave without their sons things she looked pissed i cannot believe that they abused you like that i licked the edge of my lip where steve brown had belted me and realized that it was healed id put on lipstick and it hadnt hurt shit and wow a very positive side effect its nice that there were positive ones i touched my cheek where barbara brown had sliced me and it still hurt i hadnt seen it in a mirror but it had probably looked worse an hour ago ill help you clean that up when im finished with your friend mary said without a trace of sarcasm friend without any double meanings it wasnt just her typing skills that had kept mary on as our daytime secretary she had a real gift for taking things in stride she had nathaniel hold a gauze pad over his hand while she taped it she hadnt put plastic gloves on i couldnt remember if id told her what nathaniel was or not in human form he wasnt contagious but she probably had the right to know almost as if nathaniel read my mind he said i tried to get her to let me clean it up myself mary glanced back at me he told meshe seemed to search for a wordhe told me and i told him that you cant catch lycanthropy from a human being nathaniel looked up at me with those big eyes the look said i tried youre right mary in human form theres no contagion she smiled at nathaniel in a very motherly way see most people dont want to take the chance he said softly mary finished bandaging his hand and patted him on the shoulder most people are just silly he smiled at her but it left his eyes wounded most people are just silly she had no idea i guess i didnt either not really id just begun to get the reactions from people who thought i was a lycanthrope i hadnt lived with it for years the way nathaniel had mary turned to me touching my cheek gently she was shaking her head i wanted to call the police on them its enough to file assault charges she started dabbing at the scratches there must have been some alcohol in the stuff because it stung i took a deep breath so i wouldnt wince i dont want to press charges you feel sorry for them she asked yes youre a better woman than i am anita i smiled and the cheek was a little tight for it ive been hurt a lot worse than this mary never by a client she said i let that go there were stories that mary didnt know and we all stayed out of jail that way she was frowning at me if i didnt know better id say youre healing its clean enough mary thanks i went around her to the desk and the bandages id need a gauze pad bigger than the one on nathaniels hand of course my scratches would probably be healed by dawn and his hand wouldnt be damage that i caused seemed to heal as if another lycanthrope or vamp had cut them up wed noticed that just lately mary turned me around with a hand on my shoulder you hold the gauze in place and ill put the tape on just like i did for your friend the look in her eyes said plainly that i was being silly too i let her tape up almost the entire left side of my face just short of the eye barbara brown had done this before id have bet money on it women will try to scratch in a fight sometimes but most of them arent good at it barbara was good at it like shed had practice mary looked at my torn nails does that hurt as much as it looks like it does i never know how to answer questions like that hell yes or how should i know it hurts i said she handed me a small bottle of alcohol take this and soak your hands in the bathroom until they stop bleeding i looked at her hell no she gave me the parental look youve ripped off most of the nails on both hands do you want to get infected i thought about telling her that i couldnt get an infection but we didnt know that for sure i wasnt truly a lycanthrope and while id gained their ability to heal i had no way of knowing if id gained all their abilities to keep healthy it would be a bitch to ignore marys advice and then lose a finger to gangrene or something but damn it was going to hurt the door to berts office opened before i could run off to the bathroom his face was very solemn though there was something in his eyes some flicker that i didnt trust not suppressed laughter but something anita do you want to press assault charges on the browns he said it straightfaced in a serious voice he spent a great deal of effort making me take all kinds of shit from clients and never before suggested we press charges i studied his face trying to read where this was going no i dont think that will be necessary steve brown showed at the door first with his arm around his wife we are so sorry ms blake really i dont know what came over us it was inexcusable thank you for not pressing charges ms blake barbara brown said shed been crying and the last of her makeup had worn away she looked older than when shed entered my office and it wasnt just the lack of makeup it was as if what had happened had sucked a little more of her life away we just need our sons things and then well go he said he looked horrible too not that they shouldnt have looked horrible but something else was going on i didnt know what but something wasnt right something beyond just grief and embarrassment and fear of the cops mary will escort you into the other office for your things bert said mary couldnt keep her opinion completely off her face but she led them into my office when they were out of earshot i stepped up to bert and said quietly what are you up to he gave me innocent eyes which meant he was lying what did you do bert you know ill find out eventually so just tell me he kept giving me that innocent blank face of his with that false sincerity that was still in place for when the browns came back out i had an idea but the act was so low i didnt think even bert would have tried it you pretended to call the cops didnt you he gave me a whome look which meant i was right you took their check the house check anita even i wouldnt do that yeah you would if you thought you could get away with it his eyes thawed to their usually level of insincerity theyre coming back just smile and agree with me bert either you tell me what you did or ill blow it all to hell he took hold of my arm which he never does and smiled over my head ms blake needs a little more persuasion to agree to our deal oh please ms blake please dont press charges i dont want it in the papers that im crazy our daughters have seen enough bad publicity about us i turned and would have said something but bert whisked me into his office and closed the door unless i was going to put up a fight i had no choice but to let him manhandle me a little he stayed by the door with his back against it as if he were afraid id bolt anita this is fair what is fair i said and my voice was already warming up ready to be pissed we could press charges against them he said but were not going to i said but we could bert either tell me the truth or get away from the door a bonus anita for them beating the hell out of you whats wrong with that how much i said he looked uncomfortable how much ten grand he said and then went on hastily he owns his own construction firm he can afford it and they did go way over the line i shook my head bert you bastard the wife offered me the check for the refinancing of the house when i started to talk about pressing charges i didnt take it so im not quite as much of a bastard as you think i am you cant take money not to press charges thats illegal i didnt say outright that that was what the money was for hinted at it maybe but i know better than to say something specifically give me a little credit i stared up at him you get as much credit from me as you deserve bert if they calm down and tell the cops what you did what will you say the money is for a retainer he said i cant raise their son bert or his girlfriend can you at least talk to the detective in charge of their case so you can keep the money i was thinking more that you might offer your expertise to the police i am not a specialist in murder bert not unless there are monsters involved does a serial killer count as a monster he asked what are you talking about their son and his date were the first but not the last he killed a couple the year after are they sure it was the same person i asked he shrugged youd need to talk to the police on the case and for that youll need the permission of the parents since as you pointed out its not a crime that you have jurisdiction over he almost smiled ill make you a deal boss man ill talk to the cop in charge if they think they know who it is but dont have proof then i cant help but if theyre lost then i have one idea bert smiled full out i knew you would but if my idea tanks and they get nothing out of it you will write them a personal check for ten grand anita ill just give back the money i shook my head no your personal check for ten grand you cant make me he said but i can start a vote to kick your ass out of here you dont know shit about raising the dead or crime or vampires youre the money man but youre not the only money man in the world are you anita you really mean it he said and he sounded surprised you just cheated these people out of ten thousand dollars bert it makes me wonder what else youve done makes me wonder if we need an audit of the books he was getting angry it showed in his eyes and the tight line of his mouth that is out of bounds i have never cheated anyone in this company maybe but if a man will cheat in one way hell cheat in another i cannot believe you would accuse me of that i cant believe i havent wondered about it before i said his face was darkening with his effort not to explode you could watch his blood pressure rise audit and be damned ill make you a deal bert ill settle for you giving them back their check instead of a personal check from you but you have to stop this shit we make enough money bert you dont have to cheat people they offered the money i didnt ask for it no but i bet you made it so theyd think of it nothing said outright like you said but you put it out there somehow you made them think of it he opened his mouth closed it then leaned back against the door maybe i did but anita they made it so easy you just couldnt resist could you he let out his breath in a long shoulder moving sigh i lost my head a little i shook my head and almost laughed no more losing your head bert okay ill try but i cant promise you wouldnt believe me i did laugh i cant argue that do you want me to tear up the check now i watched his face for the signs of pain that parting with money usually cost him but all i saw was a resignedness as if hed already given the money up for lost not yet he looked up hope showing momentarily in his pale eyes dont get excited its a slender little hope but if it helps lead to something that can help the police then well have earned some money if it doesnt then we can return the money do i want to know what your plan is what he was asking was was it illegal and did he not want to know so hed be able to deny it later bert knew that i stepped over lines that wouldnt just get jail time but an execution notice i knew that he was just this side of a conman a swindler but he knew or suspected that i was just this side of a coldblooded killer there were bosses that couldnt have handled that doubt or that almost knowledge we stood and met each others eyes and we had an understanding bert and i im going to see if the cops will bring down some of the boys clothes for evans to look at the touch clairvoyant that tried to cut his own hands off he made a face when he said it hes out of the hospital i said he frowned but didnt the paper say that he tried to cut off his hands so he wouldnt see murders and violence every time he touched something i nodded anita i never thought id say this but leave the poor guy alone ill give back the money i narrowed my eyes at him was he being nice to fool me did he mean it out loud i said evans is feeling better than he has in years hes taking active clients again bert looked at me and it wasnt an entirely friendly look this man has tried to kill himself to keep from seeing these things and you want to take items from a serial killer case where he cut up a nice teenage couple thats cold anita thats truly cold evans put himself back on the market bert i didnt hes married now and hes a lot more relaxed than he ever was before love may be grand anita but it doesnt cure everything nope i said it doesnt what i didnt try to explain to bert was that evanss new wife was a projective psychic null she negated most psychic abilities within yards of her evans was a lot calmer around her she truly had saved him his small pale eyes narrowed at me that man out there the boy hes your boyfriend i nodded just your boyfriend he made it a question what else could he be bert and it was my turn to have the innocent face he shook his head i dont know but the noises from your office were a hell of a show and that was without any visuals i didnt blush because i was working too hard at keeping control of my face and eyes do you really want to know bert or do you want deniability later he stood there for a moment thinking then shook his head i dont need to know no i said you dont but youd tell me the truth if i wanted to know he asked i nodded why why would you tell me to watch your face i said and my voice was soft and not altogether pleasant he swallowed hard and looked just a little paler than his untanned face had a moment before it would be something bad wouldnt it i shrugged ask and find out he shook his head again no he said no then dont ask questions you dont want the answers to i said dont ask dont tell he said i nodded again exactly he gave that roguish iknowsomethingyoudont smile but we get to keep the ten grand for now if evans agrees to see the evidence well need a bankroll is he that expensive he risks his sanity and his life every time he touches another clue id make people pay for that wouldnt you a light came into berts eyes does he have a business agent bert i said just asking just asking i had to shake my head and give up bert had a real genius for making money from psychic gifts that other people thought of as curses would it be so bad if he could help evans make more money no but i wondered if bert understood that evans was one of the most powerful touch clairvoyants in the world that to brush against another person with his fingertip told him more about that person than most people would ever know bert would probably offer to shake hands and the deal would be off i only suspected what bert was one touch and evans would know for sure in a way if evans didnt run screaming it would be reassuring for me i would never offer to shake hands with evans one you never offer your hand to a touch clairvoyant just bad form two evans had brushed up against me before by accident and he hadnt liked what he saw who was i to throw stones at bert when he might pass evanss radar unscathed and i knew that i would go down in bloody flames the rest of the afternoon appointments were damned boring compared to the browns thank god nathaniel sat quietly in a corner of my office through all of them just in case bert didnt argue now id had two appointments with lawyers to discuss wills and other privileged material theyd objected to nathaniel but id told them that legally the conversation with me wasnt privileged so why did they care legally i was right and lawyers hate for a nonlawyer to be right or at least the ones i meet get cranky about it so then theyd wanted to know who he was and why he got to sit in on their meetings i told the first one do you want this meeting or dont you and he let it go the second one didnt let it go my fingers hurt where id torn off the nails my face hurt even if it was healing my pride was hurt from having sex in the office i was not happy so i told the truth hes here in case i have to have sex i smiled when i said it and knew that it didnt reach my eyes but i didnt care nathaniel had laughed and done his best to turn it into a cough the lawyer of course didnt believe me it was a perfectly legitimate question ms blake i have every right to protect my client and his interests you dont have to insult us with ridiculous lies so i stopped insulting him with lies and we got down to business every client or group of clients had to ask about nathaniel i told them he was everything from domestic help to lover to office boy to personal assistant nobody liked any of my answers i stopped caring long before i stopped seeing clients i actually started telling the truth again and the two new groups that i told it to got insulted insulting lies they called it try to tell the truth and no one believes you what id wanted to talk about all afternoon had been my beast i had a lycanthrope right there and we didnt get five minutes of peace to even begin the discussion i had so many questions and no time to ask them maybe that was why i was so grumpy to the clients maybe or maybe im just grumpy even i wasnt sure sometimes it was seven oclock by the time we climbed into the jeep bert had passed my cemetery appointment on to manny without me having to ask he even apologized for overbooking me he always overbooked me and hed never apologized before i think the realization that i could call a vote and get his ass kicked out had made him a better boy or maybe it was just the realization that i knew that any one of us could call a vote and kick him out if bert had any weakness in business it was assuming that those of us without a business degree didnt understand business a little fear isnt always a bad thing in fact it can be downright therapeutic for some people i didnt expect for the nicer version of bert to last but id enjoy it while i had it id actually turned off onto olive in the direction of the city i had just enough time to drop nathaniel off at guilty pleasures and be only about fifteen minutes late for what was now my first outside appointment of the evening where are you going nathaniel asked guilty pleasures i said you need to eat first i glanced at him as i slowed for a stoplight i dont have time to eat you know how when you dont feed one hunger the other hungers get worse his voice was so gentle when he asked but id begun to mistrust that particular gentle tone it usually meant he had a point to make and he was right and if id only accept it id see that he was right too it usually meant that the argument was lost before it had begun but i never considered defeat a reason not to put up a fight yeah i know if i deny theardeur the beast wants meat more or the vampire wants blood i know all that so what happens if you dont feed your human stomach you get hungry right the light changed and i eased forward saturday night traffic on olive was always fun yeah i said i was looking for the trick and didnt see it so if your body gets hungry for normal feeding then doesnt that make all the other hungers worse i almost hit the car in front of me because i was staring at him i had to slam on my brakes and endure much horn blowing and if it hadnt been so dark im sure id have seen some hand gestures what did you say you heard me anita i sighed and started paying better attention to the traffic but inside i was kicking myself because it was so simple so terribly simple i dont eat regularly when im working and that usually means that im running home with theardeur riding me every night sometimes twice a night he said how much do you eat on those nights real food i mean i tried to think and finally had to say sometimes nothing it would be interesting if you kept a food diary to see if there was a correlation between starving your human body and the other hungers rising you talk like you know this already i said havent you noticed that lycanthropes cook and eat i shrugged i dont know i thought about it richard cooked and had always been either taking me out to dinner or wanting to cook for me micah cooked though nathaniel did more of it we usually had a house full of wereleopards for at least one meal a day you mean theres a reason that all the lycanthrope men ive dated have been domestically talented he nodded we need to eat a nice balanced diet heavy on protein it helps keep the beast at bay i glanced at him and in the near dark of the streetlights he was mostly in shadow his lavender shirt was the palest thing about him why didnt someone mention this to me before weve been treating you like youre mostly human anita but what i saw today he seemed to be searching for words finally he said if i didnt know that you were human and couldnt slip your skin and be a leopard for real id think you were one of us the way you felt the way you fought the way you smelled everything was shapeshifter you did not come off like a human turn into the parking lot here he said why i asked because we need to talk i did not like the sound of that but i turned in to the strip mall that had culpeppers at one end i parked in the first space i found which was far away from any restaurant most of the stores were dark and closed when i turned off the engine the world was suddenly very quiet the traffic on olive was still snarling by and in the distance was music from one of the restaurants but inside the jeep it was quiet that silence that you get inside cars after dark with one switch of a key the space inside a car becomes private intimate i turned to face him having to work against the seat belt but i wasnt comfortable taking if off until i was ready to get out of a car so talk i said and my voice sounded almost normal he turned in his seat as far as his seat belt would allow he knew my thing about seat belts he faced me putting one knee up to prop himself against the center panel weve been treating you like youre human and now im wondering if we were right you mean im going to shift because im in a new triumvirate he shook his head and his long braid slid across his lap like a heavy pet maybe what happened with that has made it worse but i think one of the reasons you havent been able to get a handle on theardeur is because youve been taking almost all your advice from a vampire he doesnt need to eat anita there is only blood lust and theardeur for jeanclaude thats it a lycanthrope doesnt stop being human you still have to eat like a person you just add the hunger of the beast but you dont lose a hunger you just add on to it i thought about it so you mean that since im already fighting off normal hunger pangs that it makes it harder to fight theardeur he nodded and his hair slid across his lap again as if the braid were moving closer to me yes i thought about it and it seemed utterly logical okay say youre right what do i do im still running late tonight im usually running late tonight we go through a driveup you get something easy to eat behind the wheel and i get a salad i frowned at him a salad why most driveup salads suck i have to eat before i go on tonight so youll be able to control your beast better i said yes but why a salad i thought you needed protein if you were going to take off all your clothes in front of strangers youd get a salad too one burger a few hours before you go on wont make you gain weight no but it might make me bloat i thought only girls did that nope so youre eating a salad so youll look good tonight i said he nodded and his hair slithered over the edge of his leg and across the gear shift i had this horrible urge to touch that heavy band of hair a little voice in my head said why not after what wed done this afternoon whats a little hair touching logical but logic didnt have much to do with how i acted around nathaniel i clasped my hands together in my lap to keep from touching him then felt silly what the hell was i doing anymore i reached out to that heavy curl of hair and pet it like it was more intimate to him than it was the hair was soft and warm i petted his hair while i talked the beast isnt conflicted about anything is it no he said and his voice was both loud and soft in the quiet dark i began to pull his braid gently up from around his body where the end had slid its not just the hunger for flesh and blood that you fight is it no he said i got to the end of his braid and spilled it into my hands i thought that the hunger was the beast that desire to chase and feed i thought that was all of it and now he asked i stroked the tip of his braid across my palm and just that made me shiver my voice was shaky when i said richard always talked about his beast like it was all his baser impulses you know lust sloth the traditional sins but to sin implies a knowledge of good and evil there was no good or evil there was nothing like normal thought i hadnt really understood how all my thoughts are based on things im always thinking about how one thing affects another the consequences of your actions i lifted more of his braid in my arms and it was like holding a snake a soft thick serpent i gathered his hair into my arms and let myself cuddle it against my body i was about at the limit for the seat belt and i wanted to be closer to him the seat belt stayed i hugged an armful of his braid to my chest as i said i stopped thinking about the browns grief their dead son it wasnt that i chose to ignore it i wasnt being callous it just never entered my mind it was just that they hurt me and i got mad but mad translated directly to food if i killed them and ate them then they couldnt hurt me anymore and i was hungry i met his eyes on that last word some trick of reflected light made his eyes shine for a moment like the eyes of a cat in a flashlights beam he turned his head and it was gone his eyes lost in shadow again the turn of his head tugged on his hair and i had a second to decide whether i would let it go or keep it i kept it and it put a strain down the line of his hair a strain like pulling on a rope and knowing it was tied tight his voice was a little breathy when he said youre always hungry when you first change shape especially if youre new at it how do you keep from tearing into the crowd at the club i asked and my voice was a little shaky too he leaned back away from me and it made the pull on his hair tighter harder by channeling the hunger into sex instead of food you dont eat your mate if you can fuck it its not food his voice was lower not deeper exactly but lower so how did i not eat anybody i wasnt thinking about sex with the browns at first you are just the hunger but after a few full moons you can think but you dont think like a person you think like your animal a few more full moons after that and you can choose to think like yourself in animal form choose i said and began to pull him toward me using his braid like a rope but this rope was attached to his skull and he didnt come easily he began to pull against me and i knew that it had to hurt just a little his voice was low and soft some people enjoy the purity of the animal like you said no conflicts no inner struggles just decide what you want and do it undo your seat belt i said he undid his seat belt i pulled him to me with his hair tangled around my arms like youd coil a rope or a strings of lights does anyone use the animal for a patsy you know crime a lot of what keeps some people good is their conscience the beast doesnt have one of those he was close enough to kiss his face lower than mine because of his braid holding him just a little to one side the animal is very practical he whispered its why so few people use their animal form when they commit murder i dont mean accidental kills because they dont have the control but deliberate murder i leaned over him example say your uncle will leave you a fortune but he needs to be dead so you can inherit it unless your beast is hungry it wont kill your uncle for money because the beast doesnt understand money i leaned close enough to almost kiss him what does the beast understand he spoke with his lips almost against mine it will kill someone you truly fear or someone whos hurt you especially physically the beast understands being hit being injured i almost asked if hed hunted down the man who beat him and his brother but i didnt id seen his memories if someone had done that to me what would i have done bad things most likely and i didnt want to fill the car with hurt and bad memories id had enough of those i laid a kiss on his mouth and he pressed me back against my seat i found that still being seatbelted i couldnt move well my arms were tangled in his braid so that it felt like i was being bound i had a moment of panic then i relaxed into it nathaniel would not hurt me and it was my own fault about the hair being where it was he hadnt wrapped me up id done that he drew back just enough to talk his lips brushing mine what about your clients i drew my head back as far as i could which wasnt far and said im not offering to fuck you here and now youre not that made me mad though i wasnt exactly sure why no im not i started trying to untangle myself from his hair he drew back with a smile that showed for an instant in the lights i want to encourage you to touch me god knows i do but if you do too much with theardeur not fed and neither of us fed then the night is over youll be pissed with yourself and me and i dont want that i got most of me free from his braid except for the part that was caught on the back of the browning if it hadnt been a gun id have jerked but even with the safety on i didnt trust it enough stupider accidents have gotten people shot neither zerbrowski nor edward would ever let me live it down so i took a deep breath and forced myself to carefully untwine nathaniels hair from my gun nathaniel had buckled himself back into his seat i would love to repeat this some time and place where we didnt have to stop i was still trying to get his hair off my gun the fact that he was in his seat but his hair wasnt told you just how long his braid was you had your chance i said and i sounded mad dont be grumpy at me he said i wasnt the one who pulled you into my lap i had the last of his hair free of my gun i started to fling the end of his braid back at him but stopped myself he was right right about who started it right about how mad i would have been if theardeur had risen before i got my work done he was right when people are right you shouldnt get pissed at them or that was the new theory fine ill go through a driveup ill eat a burger you can have your salad will that make you happy i turned on the engine and started pulling out of the parking space no but itll get us both to work tonight he sounded sad i glanced at him as i maneuvered may way through the parked cars dont be sad im not sad he said but he sounded it whats wrong its just that you reached for me there wasnt a metaphysical emergency theardeur hadnt risen yet the beast was nowhere in sight blood lust wasnt anywhere and i had to say stop but theardeur will rise tonight anita and having sex with it not being fed yet is just inviting trouble he leaned his head against the window his shoulders were rounded as if hed hunched in upon himself youre right about the schedule and theardeur and needing to eat nathaniel i dont know what came over me just now he turned to look at me and we were in the bright halogen lights of the street so i could see his face clearly he looked almost in pain couldnt it just have been that you wanted to touch me is that so wrong i sighed and concentrated on the road because i had to but also it gave me time to think i turned us back the way wed started but this time i knew wed go through the driveup at mcdonalds honest i finally did the only thing i could think of to take that miserable look off his face i touched his thigh because it was the only part of him i could reach easily hed pulled so far away in his seat that i couldnt reach anything else without straining i was driving and that had to take priority over offering comfort even when it was my fault for saying stupid things i touched his leg gently tentatively i wasnt always good at touching when sex wasnt involved i was trying to get better at it but the learning curve seemed to rise and fall depending on my mood or someone elses he touched my hand with his fingers i held my hand up to him eyes still on the road he laid his hand in mine im sorry nathaniel im sorry that im such an ass sometimes he squeezed my hand and when i glanced at him he was smiling at me that one smile was worth a lot more than handholding to me its alright he said i notice you dont disagree that im being an ass he laughed you dont like it when i lie i stared at him for a second mouth open then i went back to staring at traffic i cant believe you said that he was laughing so hard that our hands jiggled up and down on his leg neither can i he said but i didnt get mad when youve been an ass to someone you care about you should just admit it move on and try not to do it again there is almost no parking on the landing the streets are narrow and most of them are cobblestoned its very quaint but the streets were originally planned for horses not cars and it shows there is no employee parking at guilty pleasures because there isnt room so i had to park the jeep down a ways and we got to walk but nathaniel touched my arm before i got too close to the bloodred neon sign and the front entrance he took me down an alley that i hadnt even known was there i mean i knew it was there but not where it went id never really thought that there must be a performers entrance just like for circus of the damned the alley was an alley which meant it was narrow cramped not as clean as youd like not as well lit as youd prefer and made my claustrophobia complain not badly but enough to let me know that any alley that i could touch both sides of was too damn narrow for comfort id meant to simply drop nathaniel at the club and run to my next appointment but a call on my cell phone had taken a lot of the angst out of my schedule my second appointment for the night now my first had to cancel mary said that the lawyer had told her that he had to tend to the needs of another client unexpectedly translation he needed to bail someone out it didnt have to be that but it probably was id gotten better at translating lawyer over the years though no better at legal jargon jargon is meant to be as unclear as possible and its good at its job so suddenly my first appointment of the night was at nine oclock and i had time to escort nathaniel inside and talk to jeanclaude god knows there was enough to talk about so thats how i came to be threading my way down an alley following nathaniels broad shoulders his shoulders almost brushed the walls i dont think dolph would have fit at all nathaniel hesitated and i couldnt see around him but just his posture let me know something was wrong womens voices high and excited called brandon brandon he waved then turned sideways so i could see past his chest there was a handful of women near the steps leading up to a door with a bright light over it i leaned in to him and whispered sort of why do i think youre brandon and are they supposed to be here he whispered back smiling and waving at the women who were beginning to come down the steps as if trying to decide whether to come meet him my stage name and no security is supposed to keep this area clear he started to walk toward them i grabbed his arm shouldnt we go back the way we came they probably just want an autograph or to touch me itll probably be okay probably i said he patted my hand if i tell you im sure that they wont get bad weird then id be lying but probably they dont mean any harm id feel better if we went back i said no he said and he sounded very firm these are my fans anita and this is my job im going to smile and talk to them and you can pretend to be my bodyguard or pretend to be security but its bad business for you to be my girlfriend it hurts the illusion the illusion i made it a question he smiled that they can have me i gave him the long blink the one that means ive just received more information than i wanted and dont know what to do with it okay i said ill be security there i was cool i could handle this sure i could he let me go in front because thats what id do if i were security he didnt try to argue since he could wave and smile and call to them over my head i fought to keep my face blank and not cranky but i think i failed there were four of them two blondes one brunette and one with hair as black as mine though i could tell hers came out of a bottle because it was too solid allover black no highlights black hair isnt supposed to look like youve poured ink on your head but again maybe that was just me being cranky nathaniel alias brandon chatted the women up like a pro the two blondes were regulars apparently on a firstname basis we were so excited when we got the email that you were going to be here tonight one gushed she kept touching his arm while she talked theyd brought a friend the one with black hair who was new but had seen his pictures on the clubs web site i hadnt known that guilty pleasures had a web site of course i didnt own a computer so what did it matter to me ravenhair said in a voice that was breathy with nervousness your pictures were amazing she looked at him with little covert glances as if she was afraid to stare at him headon one of the blondes got an honesttogod autograph book out for ravenhair who was quote too shy to do it herself unquote the brunette wasnt joining in the squeal fest she was looking at me and it wasnt a friendly look whos she she asked i was standing beside the door at the top of the steps hands loose at my sides trying to look bodyguardish and probably failing my little blue and black skirt outfit complete with high heeled boots didnt look much like security detail security he said smiling and signing ravenhairs book she doesnt look like security the brunette said im new i said brunette didnt look like she believed me she crossed her arms underneath her small tight breasts and glared at me i smiled back sweetly that deepened her scowl and gave her little lines between her eyebrows i felt better nathaniel gave me a little flicker of a look that said as clearly as if hed spoken be nice i was nice i smiled and stood and let the blondes touch his arms his back but when one of them patted his ass that was it i pushed away from the wall and said ladies brandon here needs to get inside and prepare for his performance i managed to keep smiling even when one of the blondes threw her arms around his neck and kissed him on the cheek then the other blonde grabbed him and kissed him on the other cheek i grabbed his arm and moved him back far enough so i could open the door the two women were still clinging to him ravenhair was blushing and the brunette was still scowling at me i kept my smile in place though it felt more like a grimace nathaniel said beth ann patty if you dont let me go i cant get on stage stay out here with us and we wouldnt care one of them said i glanced behind me and saw a blackshirted man it was buzz the vamp that usually worked the door here he had the same black crew cut that he had always had small pale eyes and more muscles than you should need as a dead man his black shirt said guilty pleasures security in red letters i didnt usually like buzz much but tonight i was glad to see him help had arrived i could have cleared the steps if i was allowed to be mean but having to be nice at the same time i was trying to be firm was beyond me my skill set simply did not include it he forced his face into a smile before the women behind me could see him clearly he was the newly dead around twenty years which meant he looked very alive for a dead man most humans wouldnt have spotted him in a crowd most people think that vamps gain the ability to pass for human but thats never been my experience older is less human just better at the mind games so humans dont notice ladies youre not supposed to be back here buzz cajoled he moved past me and his chest was so musclebound that it looked like there wasnt room for all of us and his upper body to stand on that small landing the brunette said is she really security if thats what she said he said in the same goodfellowwellmet voice he was cheerfully extracting nathaniel from the blondes he managed to make a game of it and they spilled around buzzs muscular body as if to say if they couldnt cling to nathaniel any male would do of course from the sound of the joking conversation the blondes knew buzz too ravenhair had backed down the steps eyes a little wide she didnt want to play it made me think better of her i drew nathaniel in through the open door with the brunette giving me a murderous glare she was taking this way too personally it was sort of unnerving nathaniel and i were safely through the door but i didnt like closing it and leaving buzz out there alone i mean hed helped us what were the rules about security guards did they get protected too or just the dancers and customers if you cut a security guard did he not bleed so i stood there uncertainly with nathaniel it was nathaniel who gently closed the door buzz will be fine he knows how to talk to them what you read my mind he smiled no i just know you he helped us and now you feel obligated i fought the urge to squirm or shuffle my feet i hated when anyone figured me out that clearly was i that transparent apparently so i decided to change the subject how did they know that brandon would be here tonight when we change headliners we have an email list that we notify theres even a list just for brandon i looked at him you mean that some of these women dropped everything changed all their plans because they found out that brandon was going to be here tonight he shrugged and managed to look a little embarrassed some of them yes i shook my head i changed the subject again because i was losing again who was supposed to be keeping the fans away from this door the door in question opened buzz laughed and joked until the door closed behind him then he leaned against it and looked tired primo was it took me a second to realize that hed answered the question id asked with the door closed you heard me ask the question he nodded then he grinned flashing fangs the sign of a new vamp you didnt know i could hear you through the door hear yes but i thought you were too busy concentrating on the women outside he looked past me at nathaniel are you alright im fine buzz pushed himself away from the door and stood settling his big overdeveloped shoulders like a bird settles its feathers i better go talk to primo for what good it will do what do you mean good it will do i asked he looked at me primo is old really old he wants to be one of jeanclaudes vamps but he had his eye on like the number two or at least number three slot hes pissed that hes having to be security at a strip club hes more pissed that a baby like me is his direct boss buzz looked worried hes old school and he thinks if he keeps pushing me that ill call him out but i am not going to challenge that thing hed kill me have you told jeanclaude whats going on he nodded he told primo that if he couldnt stomach this job and obey me then he could get out of town did that help for awhile i asked buzz smiled have you heard this story before no but i know how the really old vamps can be they are proud bastards nathaniel touched my arm i need to talk to jeanclaude about tonights performance ill join you in the office in a minute nathaniel started to say something then seemed to think better of it and just went down the white hallway i watched him go into the office that was just a few doors down then i turned back to buzz is it just not doing what hes told or is there more hes started taking money to let in people we dont let in like who men i raised eyebrows you dont let in any men not a lot it makes the women uncomfortable and some of the dancers dont like it either youre either comfortable shakin your thing in front of other men or youre not i guess that makes sense but you let some in couples just like they do at most female strip clubs across the river but primo is letting in single men i said he nodded what did jeanclaude tell you to do about it he told me to deal with it that if i wasnt vampire enough to control primo that maybe i didnt deserve my job jeanclaude is old too anita i think theyre both setting me up for some kind of showdown and primo will hurt me or kill me you look like you can take care of yourself if its just strongarm stuff yeah but primo isnt a brute anita hes dripping with power i even agree with him that jeanclaude isnt using him well hes too powerful to be down here doing this and he doesnt have the temperament for it what do you mean hes more likely to start fights than stop them hell take money from men to get in then hell throw their asses out i shook my head you know buzz this doesnt sound like a problem that jeanclaude would let go this far not normally he said but its like jeanclaude is waiting to see what well do before he steps in id just as soon not be dead before he does it is it really that bad the women out there were okay but weve had one dancer that was stalked another one had an irate husband go after him with a knife because he was jealous that his wife was a member of the dancers fan club the dancers have fan clubs the headliners do nathaniel has a fan club i made it a question because it seemed like it should be brandon has a fan club yeah he looked at me and laughed you didnt know i dont really pay attention to the daytoday business here he nodded he was back to looking worried id never liked buzz i didnt exactly dislike him but he wasnt my friend but if his version of what was going on with primo was accurate he was in a bad spot a spot that i didnt understand jeanclaude was a good business vampire and this didnt sound like good business ill talk to jeanclaude buzz ill find out what his thinking is about primo buzz sighed well i cant ask for more he grinned suddenly flashing those fangs again in fact until now i thought you didnt like me it made me smile if you thought i didnt like you then why pour your problems in my ear who else do i have to go to asher is jeanclaudes second in command he shook his head i work here problems stay here all the businesses are run that way i didnt know that i said it was probably a holdover from the days when each business was run by a different vamp so because i visit all the businesses im what an ambassador he gave that fangflashing grin again kind of ill try to find out whats going on thats the best i can do if jeanclaude is really setting you up for a power struggle with primo ill tell you he looked relieved i just need to know where i stand ya know i nodded i know a blackshirted man came running through the door at the end of the hallway accompanied by a sudden blast of music and noise he was blond and looked like a college student but he ran down the hallway like he was on springs lycanthrope of some kind he was talking before he got to us we got a problem out there primo let a bunch of guys in they started heckling byron you said come get you the next time it got ugly its ugly buzz was already moving down the hall not exactly running i hesitated for a second then started trotting with them buzz glanced at me you coming along i sort of shrugged id feel funny just walking away our job is to tone things down a notch he said not make it worse are you saying you dont want me hell no the blond said the executioner on our side ill take that who are you i asked running to keep up with their fast walk clay he said offering his hand over the front of buzzs body be sociable later buzz said he hesitated at the door as if he were gathering himself there was suddenly a faint hum of energy coming off of buzz id never felt anything from him before his gray eyes glowedif gray could glow i am so tired of this shit he said and opened the door the music was still playing a pulsing beat but the man on stage wasnt dancing becausehe wasnt the show anymore the show was a small ocean of college students surrounding a man that towered above them he was like a pale tower caught in the middle of their jeans and letter jackets the tallest of them only came to his shoulder but there were a lot of them and almost all of them were wearing a jacket that indicated they did some kind of sport some of them looked almost as musclebound as the club security primo had picked a good bunch if he wanted to start trouble and he so wanted to start trouble the other blackshirted security guards didnt seem to know what to do their divided loyalties showed in the fact that they hadnt waded in to help primo they were on the fringe of the gang of college guys keeping them contained as best they could but they werent pulling them off the big vampire if i hadnt known anything about primo and what had gone on before id have learned something just by watching the other men refuse to help him it wasnt primos size that was the problem it was the waves of power that radiated off of him most vamp power and even lycanthrope power filled a room like water rising until you drowned in it primos power literally pulsed and flowed every time he smacked someone with his big open hand the power spiked and tightened along my skin his power seemed to feed off his own violence but he was keeping his big hands open just slapping them around which was of course insulting the college students manhood one of the biggest of the group jumped onto primo hanging on to his shoulder and arm primo grabbed him by the shoulder and peeled him off like he was nothing he tossed him into the coat check booth and earned a scream from the holy itemcheck girl that worked there primos power was thick enough to walk on but only for a second then down it went he couldnt sustain it enough buzz said and he sounded unhappy to have to say it he motioned and that one motion ended the security guards hesitation the other blackshirts moved in and started helping the college guys move toward the door they made some progress but the guys didnt want to leave their buddies assdeep in giant vampire i couldnt really blame them again this was outside my skill set i could have drawn badge and gun and stopped it if i was willing to arrest or kill primo but i didnt know how to tone it down as buzz had said their job was not to make it worse but to make it better i didnt know how to do that not really buzz was yelling primo primo stop fighting back we need to get this out of the club primos answer to that was to pick up two college students by the throat one in each hand as if he meant to bang their heads together but while his hands were busy another enterprising young man with short brown hair and shoulders nearly as wide as buzzs hit him in the face he knew how to throw a punch it rocked the vampires head back and blood blossomed at his mouth like a crimson flower on all that white skin the music from the stage died abruptly and into that sudden silence primo screamed a huge ragefilled battle cry he dropped the two men in his hands like they were nothing and went for the man whod hit him i expected him to throw him around like he had the others but he didnt he picked him up by the front of his jacket until his feet dangled off the ground and he was probably choking on his own collar but instead of those big pale shoulders bunching to throw the man primos hand went back and this time he closed his fist from that close up with that kind of strength he was going to snap the mans neck i drew the browning but truthfully without a court order of execution i was in the same boat as a police officer i couldnt shoot him if i thought he was only going to hurt someone how did i argue in court that i knew how strong a vampire was and how fragile the human body could be and call it a hunch but i figured once i shot primo i had to kill him i did not want that level of muscle and magic touching me i was harder to kill not immortal i aimed down my arm because court and explanations would come later and that kid was about to die i was about to take a shoulder shot because it was my best bet with this many people around when everyone else got brave too clay was closest and he jumped him primo tossed the shapeshifter into the first row of tables women screamed and scattered clay was getting to his feet but that big fist was pulling back again buzz was screaming no primo no i had the gun pointed at the floor because when youre tense your fingers are tense too if i shot someone i wanted it to be on purpose i started to move closer and to one side for a better shot when the blackshirts swarmed him and i had no shot at all if id been ready to kill his ass id have yelled for them to get away but i was still hoping to avoid it i moved closer and to one side farther away from the tables where i thought i had a better chance at getting a clear shot id never tried to shoot anyone in the middle of a bar fight just the tumble of bodies was intimidating it was like trying to hit a target with civilians flying around it primo tossed them around like they were dolls while still holding the man straightarm the more they fought him the stronger his power spiked and billowed as if every blow whether his or theirs powered him up he was lost behind a mound of blackshirts then i felt his power draw in like an atom bomb breathing and i had time to yell everybody down i wasnt sure what was coming but it was going to be bad i hit the floor like id told everybody else to do though i put myself flat to the ground i glanced at most of the women and waiters behind me and saw them crouching on the floor jesus didnt anyone know how to take cover primo didnt use his body to throw them off in a burst of black shirts he used his magic it blew them airborne in a spray of black shirts and falling bodies if id been crouched like the people id complained about i could have moved faster but flat on the ground i had a splitsecond to decide whether i was going to cover my head and hold my ground try to roll farther away or get to my knees and scramble for it flat to the ground doesnt help when things as heavy as bodies are falling i got up to scramble away and a body smashed into me i had a moment to be quietly stunned and then another one landed on top of me id been hit id been thrown id been a lot of things but id never had two adult men land on me from the air all the breath was crushed out of my body and if id been as human as i looked things would have broken i laid there for a second stunned and the two men on top of me werent moving at all the first thing i moved was my head back to look over my shoulder to where primo had been he was still there still standing hed picked up a different college student and was dangling him in his hand his big fist was cocked back again fuck i realized two things at once one i could move my hands two my gun wasnt in either of them my body was pinned underneath several hundred pounds i was strong and i could get out but it wouldnt be quick and i had no idea where my gun was no one that hed thrown off was moving primos fist started forward and there was one of those moments where the world slows down i had all the time in the world to watch him land that blow all the time in the world to watch him snap that mans neck and know i couldnt stop him i reached out toward him and screamed no i didnt expect it to help but i had to do something blood spurted from primos arm and he hesitated staring around the room as if he didnt know where the scream had come from i wasnt sure either but id spent months learning how to control what power i had and id felt something this was the second time id done something like this both times when i was desperate the question was could i do it on purpose primo raised the man upward again as if hed set his goal and nothing would turn him from it i reached out with my hands and i thought about it i thought about what it had felt like like my thoughts hit something around him formed it into glass to hurt him primo raised the man higher and seemed to be saluting someone behind me but i didnt glance back there wasnt time i reached out not just with my hands but with that power i had over the dead that link i had with two vampires and i slashed at him blood flared along his arm again more red to join the first it wasnt as much blood and i didnt know why because i really didnt understand what i was doing a few bloody cuts were not going to distract him for long you are not doing this he said his voice was a deep rumbling growl that matched the big body and held an accent that i couldnt place jeanclaudes voice floated up from behind us no but i am doing this i wanted to look backward and see him but i didnt dare take my eyes off the vampire in front of me to look at the vampire behind me but i didnt need eyes to feel his power it flowed through the room like a comforting hand it caressed the bodies that pinned me to the floor i got a whiff of musk and wolf fur and knew that both men were pack that scent of fur and home filled me too i knew that it was partly his tie to richard but it was more than that his magic was seeping down through them to me he hadnt meant for it to but i had my own ties to richard and his wolves it was hard for him to reach out to them and not touch me they both drew long shuddering breaths as if theyd come back to life though i knew that wasnt it the blond clay blinked at me from inches away he looked surprised and i couldnt blame him the one on top had hair the color of mine though it was straight as straight could be he blinked dark eyes at me as if he didnt remember seeing me before or know how he came to be lying on top of me he muttered sorry miss even as he started moving slowly stiffly off the top of the pile clay made small protesting noises as the first man began to get off him how do you think i feel im on the bottom i said clay wasted a smile on me buzz was getting stiffly to his knees from a few feet away he caught my eye and gave me a look i didnt know him that well but it seemed to say well that solves that jeanclaude was here and his power filled the room like a warm blanket it felt so good and so unlike his power in some ways i knew what was wrong it felt too alive but he was the master of the city and none of his vampires would defy him to his face i believed that was the only excuse i have for letting my guard down and looking away from primo youd think id learn that crazy is crazy dead or alive all of them could not stop me before jeanclaude three will not do the way he said it made me look back at primo he didnt sound like he was giving up that wasnt right challenging buzz was one thing challenging jeanclaude was another thing entirely they are not here to stop you primo for you are stopped i am the master of this city and i say you are stopped these humans bloodied me there was such rage in his words that they scalded along my skin he fed on his own anger as well as violence i realized in that moment that he was a master vampire of sorts at least some of his powers were masterlevel powers that was bad clay was on all fours which meant i was finally able to get out from under him id been looking around for my gun but i couldnt see it it had to be here somewhere fuck the shit was about to hit the fan and i didnt have a gun how did a vampire of your power allow a mere human to bloody you jeanclaudes voice was easy conversational but in my head his voice whispered something else i fear i have underestimated him no shit i said clay asked what did you say i shook my head my eyes still scanning the floor for my gun but i couldnt find it then i thought fuck it id cut him twice without a gun i could do it again part of me didnt believe it i told that part to shut the fuck up too i had enough problems without selfdoubt creeping in primo still had the man hed picked as his scapegoat but he was holding him sort of nonchalantly down at his side like a forgotten bag of laundry i realized that the man had passed out and got to my feet trying to see if he was breathing i didnt like the way primo had the mans jacket collar twisted around his neck had i been so worried about the fist that id let primo choke the man to death jeanclaudes voice breathed through my head he is not breathing but his heart still beats i said out loud were out of time yes he said and i think that was out loud he reached out to me not with his hand but with his power and this wasnt the warm living power of the lycanthrope the cool grace of the grave touched me and it flared that part of me that raised the dead i suddenly knew how id cut him i suddenly knew how it worked it was like a puzzle box in my head and suddenly i knew just where to press and just what it meant slashing from a distance used the beings own magical aura against them it turned their magical shielding into a slender invisible blade that could be turned against them jeanclaude had known what it was and how it worked for centuries but hed never been able to do it himself he knew the how but could not do it i could do it but didnt know the how together we suddenly had it covered my goal was not to kill primo but to make him let go of the man i held my hand out toward him and he still didnt look scared do you think your little cuts will stop me he demanded no i said and i threw power at him almost like throwing a ball and that ball caught against his aura his shielding like a burr on a piece of cloth but the ball didnt stay a ball and it didnt exactly pierce primos shielding it was as if the ball melted onto it and where it melted it invaded the shielding became one with it and turned that protective coating into something long and slender and sharp i visualized that sharpness cutting across his belly and his shirt split like a skin to show white flesh and blood it was a bigger wound than the other two and his hand went to it as if it hurt or as if he wasnt sure how hurt he was how do you like that one i asked big enough for you he snarled at me flashing fangs that looked too big for his mouth it had done exactly what i wanted it to thanks to jeanclaudes centuries of frustrated study i had a new weapon id been afraid before to hit too close to the victim all it would have taken was the vic to have a little psychic gift and i could have done more damage to him than to primo but now i had it i knew it i felt it i flicked a hand at the arm that held the man and that arm split open from elbow to wrist blood spilled down his arm in a crimson wash if his heart had been beating enough the blood would have jumped out of his open arteries but he didnt have the blood pressure for it not anymore do you seek to save this he lifted the man by his twisted collar it is dead and only meat for the animals now his heart still beats jeanclaude said but we had only moments before mouthtomouth wasnt going to save him from brain damage i threw both hands up and i cut him i tried slicing his arm like youd bone a fish but i could not break the deeper tissue i could cut his skin and meat away but the ligaments held and that was all primo needed to hold the vic until he died stubborn bastard if you do not drop the man now primo i will see this as a direct challenge to my authority see it any way you like but i will not be a whipping boy for this and he pointed not at me but at the men that lay unconscious around him at buzz who stood near but not too near we were out of his league and he knew it so be it jeanclaude said in my head he said ma petite it is not a knife it is not a single blade it is magic if you can turn one small piece of his power against him then why not all of it i started to ask what did he mean then he showed me it was like my mind was a wall and hed just plugged that bit of answer directly into my brain i understood and i didnt hesitate it wasnt in me to hesitate when lives were at stake i didnt point or throw up a hand it wasnt a game of ball i could affect his shielding and that shielding covered his entire body i thought at that skin of magic i threw power into all of it and when i felt all of his shielding as if i was caressing that invisible skin with my hands i turned it all against him i turned it all into inwardpointing blades it was as if primo were suddenly standing in the center of a reverse porcupine a porcupine with spines the size of daggers every inch of his skin i could see was just suddenly covered in blood he screamed screamed with a mouth that poured blood screamed with a throat that was pierced in a halfdozen places he screamed and he let go of the man clay and the darkhaired werewolf grabbed the man and dragged him over the bodies of his friends and away just away i wanted to watch to make sure they got him breathing but i had other problems primo started to charge us but he stumbled and fell to his hands and knees i realized in that moment that id blinded him it wasnt permanent but it was permanent enough for tonight he was blind he roared at us and yelled in a voice that sounded like he was trying to swallow broken glass damn you jeanclaude damn you you are not vampire enough to do this you were never vampire enough for this did you come to st louis to destroy me and take my place primo raised his bloodied face toward the sound of jeanclaudes voice why not why not be master of the city you cannot even be master of your own self primo that is why power alone is not enough to rule this city i wanted to look behind me and watch him speak but i didnt need to in that moment i felt closer to him than if id stood holding his hand i knew then what id known before but only in the back of my mind hed used the vampire marks between us more openly more intimately than ever before i should have been angry but i wasnt one of the waiters was bending over the man primo had tried to kill the waiter had bent back the mans head and was breathing into his mouth the man gave a sudden jolt and his first gasp of breath was loud the darkhaired werewolf that i could give no name to raised a thumbsup the man would live he would be alright no amount of muscle that we had here would have freed him in time nothing else would have freed him without killing primo though i wasnt sure that was a good thing i thought we should kill primo and do it now before he recovered jeanclaudes voice whispered in my ear if someone dies i will have much more difficulty convincing them all that nothing bad happened here i shook my head and thought there arent enough vampire mind tricks in the world to blank the mind of an audience this big not about something this traumatic do you doubt me ma petite he was suddenly standing just behind me his slender white hand appeared on my shoulder a spill of white lace around it and a flare of black velvet sleeve framing that lace i raised my hand up to touch his and found his skin cold as if he had not fed or had used a great deal of energy up there was more warmth to the velvet as it brushed my fingers than to his skin he was drained how much energy had it taken for him to talk mind to mind with me or had things been happening that i didnt know about yet the rest of the blackshirted security began to move slowly stiffly as if things hurt primo seemed to sense their movement because he said even blind i am their match he moved into a crouch on the balls of his feet the movement must have hurt like hell but he never winced he put one big bloody hand on the floor and the other in the air as if he were sensing movement it was too close to a martial arts move for comfort he was huge a vampire nearly impervious to pain crazy and trained in the martial arts it didnt seem fair nathaniel came to my side and he had my gun he held it out to me wordlessly exactly the way id taught him butt first fingers well away from the trigger i gave him half the smile he deserved because i was still keeping an eye on the bloody giant on the floor i clicked the safety off before i holstered it call it a hunch but when primo rushed us i wouldnt want to waste that second id need it but he didnt rush us no primo had a much more interesting idea in mind there was something about being this hooked up to jeanclaude that made me feel safer and that sense of safety was a type of arrogance arrogance made me forget that a really old vampire can do more than just hurt you physically jeanclaudes arrogance made me forget primo didnt move a muscle but he thrust power at us poured his rage like flinging a red hot bucket of boiling anger on us there was no time to shield against it no time to do anything but take it jeanclaude tried to let it wash over him but i felt that awful rage trying to find a place to grow inside him the master of the city consumed by rage would be a very bad thing but i understood anger and i wasnt master of the city i took that anger not to wash over me but to drink to swallow to bathe in it i drew his rage around me like a coat of fire and i opened up a part of me that i kept hidden from everyone i let primos rage meet the great seething mass of my own rage the rage id carried inside me since my mothers death the deep endless seas of my anger welcomed his angerembraced it fed on it i ate his rage and let him feel me do it i laughed laughed while i stood there and burned with our twin furies laughed while i felt his anger falter and begin to pull back laughed while i let his anger mingle with mine i already carried a bottomless pit of it what was a few more buckets he stared up at me with sightless eyes and then he did half of what id expected he moved forward but not in a mindless rush he moved forward with a speed that was breathtaking and id seen speed he was blind so he grabbed in the dark and it was nathaniel he grabbed nathaniel who was standing near us i dont know if that was who primo was aiming at or if he missed he grabbed nathaniels wrist and tried to yank him in against his body but nathaniel braced and would not go we were suddenly all moving i was aware that the security guards were moving but theyd be too late my gun was almost free of its holster but primo had started forward as soon as he felt nathaniels resistance i was closest and i moved faster than i planned i wasnt used to being more than human quick i was reaching out for nathaniels arm but i got too close to the vampires face primo sank fangs into my wrist and i knew better than to try and jerk free it would have torn my wrist open i had my gun out as i screamed screamed as his mouth fed on me screamed as i put the gun to his head my finger had started that pull on the trigger when primos mind slammed into mine it wasnt his rage it was his memories roman army the murder that got him condemned the arena where he could murder to his hearts content where he could slake that rage or feed it death after death after death and each one fed him in a way that nothing else did then one dark night a noblewoman requested he come to her bed with the blood and sweat of his victory painted on his body he went and found so much more than hed ever dreamt of she offered him freedom and a new way to feed his rage a new way to kill he did not know her real name she had simply said i am the dragon and you will serve me and he had abruptly the memories stopped it staggered me and i had a moment to fight not squeezing the trigger a moment to point the gun skyward and try to relearn how to breathe and use my body at the same time primo still had his mouth pressed to my wrist but now there was healed flesh and sight in his eyes i knew with jeanclaudes knowledge that primo could heal almost anything with a little special blood hed been aiming for a lycanthrope but my blood had done the trick i understood why jeanclaude had wanted him such a powerful soldier if you could control him the calmness in my head wasnt me primo released my wrist and his eyes rolled white with terror what are you he whispered not what primo who i said and i reached the hand hed wounded out to him i meant to touch his face but he cringed back from me as if id offered him harm who am i primo that great body cowered before me he abased himself before me and i remembered him doing it long ago for the one who had made him master he whispered and the word seemed to be forced from his lips he hated it that he would never be his own master when he took that bloody kiss he had always assumed that someday he would rule and now he knew different you are my master the moment hed tasted my blood he had been bound in a way that had nothing to do with sex or love or friendship it was a belonging that was possessive in a way that none of the others were primo simply was mine no ours the marks between jeanclaude and i were wide open and had been when primo attacked me when he bit me he wasnt just tasting me blood of my blood wasnt just a pretty phrase it was real i understood in that moment that with the marks cranked open to take blood oath to one was blood oath to both i could control the dead and jeanclaude had power over any vampire that took blood oath or that hed made primo had been overwhelmed with a double whammy because in that instant my blood had been jeanclaudes and his mine i had a moment to wonder what all this might be doing to our reluctant richard but the thought didnt last i had enough problems of my own without borrowing his i looked down at the big man at our feet and knew that jeanclaude was utterly sure of him utterly certain that primos oath to us would hold him it wasnt like reading minds i just knew that jeanclaude was no longer worried about primo he was confident of him i wasnt i turned to look at jeanclaude to try to persuade him of just how dangerous primo could still be but of course my being willing to turn away from primo said that in my way i was certain of him too and that was wrong he was like walking rage with a big muscular body to back it up that wasnt safe that could never be safe i think i would have turned back to primo but i was suddenly looking at jeanclaude and the world vanished there was nothing but jeanclaude black velvet had been made into a waistlength military jacket with silver buttons down the front and a high stiff collar to frame a white mound of cravat a silver tie tack with a sapphire in its head pierced the white at his throat the jacket fit the spread of his shoulders emphasized his slender waist and took the eye to the black leather pants that looked as if theyd been braided together on the sides as if he hadnt so much slipped them on as been bound into them the boots were only knee high made of the same rich dark velvet as the coat i was bespelled and i knew it and i couldnt help but stare but i left his face for last because i knew in what was left of my selfcontrol that if i looked into his face i would truly be lost one slender hand came up to my lowered face that hand surrounded by a spill of white lace he touched my chin the barest of touches and began to raise my face upward it was a delicate touch i could have fought or stopped him but i didnt want to it had taken all of my willpower simply to avoid his face at first glance his black curls mingled with the velvet until it was hard to tell where one began and the other ended his eyes were huge and beautiful a color darker than the sapphire at his throat his eyes were as dark as blue could be and did not hold a single shade of black his face was a pale perfection like a painting almost finished he was pale and the fingers against my face were like ice he was like some pale sculpture waiting for someone to breathe it to life except for the dark glitter of those eyes those eyes held all the life in the world his voice was low and soft like fur sliding across my skull ma petite let me in let me in do not leave me to the cold i actually opened my mouth to say of course but closed it once before when wed been less bound than this hed taken energy from me without drawing blood that had been because big bad vamps were in town and he needed to not look weak in front of them and if they were to find out that his human servant didnt allow him to take blood he would have looked weak indeed he needed to feed desperately so why i found my voice hoarse and not at all like the smooth pull of his why is your energy so low i have done what i could from a distance to make your day easier i reached up and laid my fingers against his cheek youve drained yourself for me for your peace of mind he whispered and his voice trailed down my spine like a tiny drop of water trickling low and lower you want to feed i said he gave a small nod moving his cold skin against the warmth of my fingers in my head he whispered if i am to maintain our control of primo i need to feed you dont mean blood i said no he raised his other hand to my bandaged cheek are you hurt not much i said and my voice was sounding almost like my own i realized that hed pulled back he was letting me think he didnt have to but he knew me too well if he didnt let me think now id be mad later you dont mean like you did when the council was in town do you youre asking something else his voice in my mind something has happened with your binding of damian and nathaniel more power is everywhere but also more need i have denied myself for a very long time ma petite his hands slid along the edge of my jawline until they cradled my face and his fingers were buried in the warmth of my hair i heard him think that he was warming his hands against my hair so cold so empty so needy id never seen him like this never this wasnt his need i turned enough so that i could see nathaniel who had gone to lean against the wall he wasnt close enough to project like this he gave me innocent lavender eyes i couldnt feel him in my head it was just jeanclaude and me but even with only two of us connected it still felt like nathaniels need or damians skin hunger i looked back into those dark dark blue eyes and whispered youve inherited their neediness aloud he said i fear so what can we do i asked let me in ma petite let me through those wonderful shields let me in and his voice spilled over my skin as if hed covered me naked in satin and drawn it along my body i shivered and only the cool touch of his hands kept my knees from buckling i stared into those eyes that face and i whispered yes his face filled my vision then his lips brushed mine i expected him to take me in his arms and kiss me with the desperation i felt in his need but he didnt he touched me only with his mouth and even that was the barest pressure of his lips against mine i actually pushed against him raised a hand to touch him and he put a hand on my shoulder and held us apart a second after hed done it i understood why because it was as if my soul spilled up into my lips as if the very essence of me was a taste upon my lips my power my magic my heart my soul everything was there for the taking in one soft brush of lips id thought wed fed theardeur upon each other before but id been wrong he sipped from my lips delicate so much more he wanted i could feel it feel his need but he held me back with his hands on my shoulders while i struggled to close that distance but i knew with his knowledge that bare skin was bare skin and all of it could drink me down it was the most careful kiss id ever been given and one of the most frustrating i was making small noises deep in my throat because i wanted more i wanted so much more when he drew back he held a spot of my lipstick like a crimson stain in the center of his lips there was the tiniest bit of color to his cheeks he was like the cold of winter touched by the barest breath of spring so that warmth was only a promise not real not now but a distant hope but hope is better than the alternative he swallowed convulsively his eyes fluttering closed for a moment before he straightened and his hands on my shoulders were firm that is but a taste of what i need ma petite dont stop i said he smiled but it was sad let the effects wear awhile then give me an answer about more i shook my head what was he talking about of course of course he could have more it is my fault ma petite i asked you to let me in your shields i did not mean for you to drop all the defenses in your considerable repertoire it was nearly overwhelming for both of us he looked at me as if he saw something new there or someone new i must attend to our fair audience he almost came to me again for a goodbye kiss but he pushed away and he called to someone attend her until she recovers no not you not until she is herself again i fear what she would do if you touched her now his voice when it came again filled the club echoed into the shadows of it and yet seemed intimate as if he whispered it against your skin and only your skin primo has walked through fire and blood to be reborn for you tonight transformed before your eyes from the warrior of nightmares to the lover of dreams theyre too scared they wont believe it it was nathaniels voice i turned toward that voice but met a different face nathaniel was standing just beyond out of reach but byron was standing so close that it startled me he wasnt quite three hundred years old and i normally heard him move as if he were human he wasnt powerful and never would be but tonight i hadnt even known he was standing nearly touching me that helped sober me up more than anything else i hadnt heard one of the weakest of the new vamps that jeanclaude had welcomed to town bad necromancer no cookie youve never seen him after hes fed like this byron said in that nicely accented british voice watch i fought not to look at jeanclaude i looked at the audience instead their eyes were wide their faces pale or flushed some of them were still hiding under the tables if the fight hadnt taken place between them and the most obvious door theyd have probably fled all they needed was a sign above them that said scared shitless it was probably the most spilled blood that any of them had ever seen scary stuff as long as i looked at the audience i agreed with nathaniel but when my eyes drifted to jeanclaudes back as he spoke with them well i had to look away i had to not look because the craving was still there id been told that my desire to touch him had been part of the same craving that any servant felt for their master but i hadnt really believed it this this was craving i found myself staring at primo who was still on his knees looking confused a halfcircle of blackshirted security guards standing around him he looked up at me and his eyes held something like pain he spoke and no one at the tables heard him just me and security and the vampire and wereleopard at my back you have trapped me i opened my mouth to say i didnt mean to but someone touched my left wrist and it hurt a sharp immediate pain i whirled and found byron touching me let go of me he opened his hand and just let my arm fall back he whispered youre bleeding jeanclaude told me to attend to you let me tend your wound here was a face younger and more innocent seeming than nathaniels hed been in his late teens when his master had brought him over his hair was a soft brown that fell in loose curls just past his ears leaving his slender neck bare and showing the v of white skin at the neck of the robe he wore i remembered that someone had said the college students were heckling byron he must have been the one on stage he was shorter than i was and slender not preadolescent but young unfinished and hed be unfinished forever whether his shoulders would have broadened or hed have gotten taller wed never know he could lift weights and add definition in fact he had at jeanclaudes insistence but hed never have the body he might have had if the vampire that killed him had waited a year or two his eyes were gray and seemed to take up most of his face huge soft gray the color that fog can have when its at its thickest that close suffocating wall of mist i had to shake my head and draw back shit byron had almost rolled me with his eyes that shouldnt have been possible jeanclaude had said that id let down all my defenses i hadnt meant to it was more as if jeanclaude had taken down all my defenses but byron was no jeanclaude him i could keep out i actually closed my eyes and did the deepbreathing exercises that id learned draw yourself to the center of your body draw yourself in and center yourself down a line that goes into the earth itself marianne called it grounding and it was grounding as in being grounded solid on your feet secure but it was hard to stay focused because jeanclaudes voice was still there and closing my eyes didnt get rid of it who among you has not wished to tame a savage heart to take a man and change him beyond reckoning to make him into what you wish him to be primo kneels before your beauty and he is what you will make of him he will rise and fall to your desires i felt jeanclaude walk between me and primo even with my eyes closed even with me trying to anchor myself i felt him like a hand sweeping all my concentration away i looked up and saw him touch primos face the lightest of touches show them that magnificent body primo shook his head he did not want to play i felt jeanclaudes will flex like a muscle squeezing around primo i felt that flare of warmth spill out from him to the bigger man i had actually stepped closer to them when byron pulled me back i wouldnt advise that he said and again i felt the pull of those soft gray eyes like being wrapped in the warmest of blankets primo stood and that turned me back to them the big man balled his hands into his black bloodsoaked shirt and tore it like it was paper naked from the waist up he was magnificent if you were into giants it wasnt the hugeness that came from weight lifting it was just how big he was who will be his first kiss jeanclaude asked i felt the movement before i turned and saw the audience there was no fear now jeanclaudes voice had taken their fear all i saw now was eagerness at worst uncertainty as if they just werent sure the first few hands went up with money in them and once that happened more followed no one wants to be first but no one wants to be left out either byron pulled gently on my shoulder we need to bind that wound anita lets go backstage hes right nathaniel said and he was closer now close enough that i could see that there was some blood spattered on his lavender shirt he must have been closer to primo than i remembered but i wasnt thinking well it was as if i hadnt been quite myself since i got out here what was wrong with me i nodded okay okay yeah i let byron and nathaniel lead me away but my glance stayed turned to the room the brunette from the alleyway was running her hand up primos skin and that skin was clean and smooth no blood no signs of the struggle she ran her hands over his skin but his glance was for me his eyes held a mute appeal for help and i didnt understand why jeanclaude touched the big mans bare back and primos face turned back to the woman there was no confusion on his face now there was nothing but lust and in that moment i understood jeanclaude was controlling primo he was manipulating the vampire more than he had ever manipulated the audience theyd come for a little bit of lascivious fun primo had come to be master of the city but instead he was just another act at guilty pleasures he kissed the brunette like hed breathe her in as if to kiss her were life itself when he let her go and one of the security guards eased her shaking body into her seat money sprang up in hands throughout the room welcome to show business primo i thought the door closed and like magic it was quiet the backstage area was soundproofed but it was more than that today it was as if with the closing of that door i could think again really think i knew that proximity to jeanclaude could make things worse usually proximity meant touching tonight in the same room was too close i shook my head what the hell is happening we have a first aid kit in the dressing rooms byron said he tried to lead me toward one of the doors on the right i took my arm out of his grip and looked at nathaniel did i hear jeanclaude tell you not to touch me he nodded hes not sure what will happen right now his face was very solemn serious closed he was being careful around me again and i didnt know why have i missed something tonight youre dripping blood byron said and he motioned at my arm blood was trickling down my hand to drop drop onto the white floor the hallway was so white and so empty that the spot of crimson seemed loud as if color were sound i shook my head again somethings wrong youve lost more blood than you realize byron said anita nathaniel said and it seemed like it took longer than it should have for me to turn and look at him anita come into the dressing rooms well take care of you i nodded and raised my arm up to about chest high it would help slow the blood loss the sleeve of my jacket was a bloody mess and i hadnt noticed until now something was terribly wrong and i didnt know what it was i knew that making a new triumvirate with damian and nathaniel was probably the cause but that only told me why it was happening not what was happening why didnt matter very much to me right that moment what was happening that mattered a great deal byron touched my arm only enough to guide me through the door that nathaniel opened for us as i walked past nathaniel i felt something open between us as if there were a door in the middle of our bodies a door that wanted to close around us to press us tight together byron literally put his body in front of mine and kept me from touching nathaniel i growled at him and nathaniel echoed me at his back ease down kittycats i am only doing what the master of the city ordered me to do his eyes were a little wide and i got a whiff not of fear but something close to it do you remember what jeanclaudes kiss felt like out there he grabbed my hurt wrist and ground his fingers into it that hurts i said and i turned on him angry ready to be angry but you can think now cant you that made me take a step back into the dressing rooms beyond byron followed a hand still on my wrist but loosely now not to hurt but more to guide whats happening to us i asked it looks like youve all hit a new power plateau byron said as he led me between the little lighted tables scattered with makeup and bits of costume which means what i asked he stopped in front of a big gray metal cabinet that was at the far end of the room which means answer my question do you remember what the kiss felt like in the other room he opened the cabinet and it seemed to be full of cleaning supplies and extra bits of things that people might need on the top shelf so he had to stand on tiptoe was a first aid kit a big one it was like he drank my soul and saying it out loud was too poetic for me i blushed and tried again i thought hed fed theardeur during sex with me but if that kiss was feeding the same thing hes been holding back byron tried to find enough clean space on the nearby tables to open the medicine chest but gave up and asked nathaniel to hold it while he rummaged through it hes been holding back luv trust me on that how do you know i asked he gave me a very flat stare out of his big gray eyes jeanclaude liked london once he liked it a very great deal and i liked that he liked it there was something almost unfriendly in the way he finished that sentence why do i feel like apologizing i asked just hold your arm up higher he said he had his hands full of things but still wasnt satisfied nothing to apologize for duckie except for asher jeanclaude prefers his meat of the gentler persuasion always did ah here it is he held up an unopened package of gauze pads he smiled at me and the smile was so harmless so not matching the situation now let uncle byron see to the big bad booboo i gave him a look that wasnt entirely friendly im bleeding not brain damaged can the baby talk he shrugged whatever you say lover i started to correct him but byron used pet names mostly the same pet names for everybody if i took it too personally it would be impossible to have a conversation with him i was tired tonight i let it go why doesnt he want me to touch nathaniel byron looked at me like i was being slow because luv if jeanclaudes kiss is suddenly more then maybe yours will be too the servant rises in power with his master he looked at everything in his hands then shook his head looked impatient and dumped it all back into the box hand me things when i ask for them he said to nathaniel nathaniel nodded but he was looking at me i found myself staring into those lavender eyes byron snapped his fingers in the air between our faces it made us both jump the two of you are so not touching right now dangerous is what it would be now take off your jacket i did what he asked and it hurt to get the sleeve off but it wasnt until i saw my wrist that i gasped and nathaniel said oh shit most vampire bites are neat almost dainty things this wasnt it was as if even once his fangs sank home hed used his other teeth to bite down so that it looked more like an animal bite a big angry animal bite blood was seeping out of the two deepest fang marks seeping in a nice steady line the moment i saw it i was dizzy and it hurt like hell why does it always hurt so much more when you see the blood you are lucky youre still standing byron said he hooked a chair with one naked foot and said sit i sat because truthfully i was a little shaken it was a bad enough wound that i should have noticed it sooner really noticed it a fraction of an inch better or worse or just deeper and i could have bled nearly to death before i noticed it why didnt i notice sooner ive seen bespelled humans bleed to death from tiny wounds a smile on their face all the way to the end duckie he ripped open the sterile gauze pads put this on it and press hard youve lost enough blood for one night lets see if we can save the rest when he was serious the nicknames vanished hed only been in town a few weeks and already i knew that when the duckies luvs and crumpets disappeared things were bad what can i do to help nathaniel asked find more gauze pads thats the only pack in here and shes going to need more nathaniel put the first aid kit on a chair that he moved close to byron then he went for the door apparently he knew where they kept the extra gauze how bad do you guys get cut up here usually scratches he said though youd be surprised the number of women that try to bite i looked at him he grinned now duckie why would i lie one second i was looking at byron and thinking nothing really my wrist hurt and i wondered why i hadnt noticed it sooner and then suddenly i was wondering if he was naked under the robe and i was hoping he was i closed my eyes and tried to shield tried to nail anything and everything i had between me and jeanclaude but his voice came through i am sorry ma petite so sorry but primo is still fighting me and i have not fed enough i cannot feed and control him but you can feed for me you can give me what i need ma petite please please do not deny me if i lose control of primo now he will slaughter these women he will see himself humiliated by them please ma petite hear me and know that i speak only truth help me he cut contact abruptly and i got a glimpse of primos rage stabbing at the lust that jeanclaude had fed him it was as if primo were a human besotted but still fighting fighting to break free damn you jeanclaude i whispered byron touched my arm dont faint on me i opened my eyes and his gray ones were so close to mine he was so close i dont know what showed in my eyes but he let go of me like id burned him his eyes were a little wide and his voice was breathy when he said i dont like the look in your eyes it doesnt look much like you i leaned into him and he leaned back i kept moving forward and he kept moving back so that i slipped out of the chair and he ended up on the floor for a second before he rolled to his feet i was left kneeling on the floor but i had a handful of his robe the cloth stretched away from his body and i saw that he was wearing something under it but not much it was lust but it was more than that it was lust as if sex were food id thought theardeur was the worst of it but this felt less worse except for that first time id had some control over theardeur not liking someone or knowing someone helped me fight it off this was different it wouldnt have mattered this was need so raw that it just wouldnt have mattered jeanclaude screamed through my head anita help me hed used my real name and his desperation cut through me like a knife some of that desperation fell into my voice im sorry byron but jeanclaude is about to lose control of primo he needs more food and who gets to be the food he asked and there was that edge of fear to him i had to close my eyes and take a deep breath theres no time i wont let you tear my throat out just because the master has bitten off more than he can tame i shook my head eyes still closed dont be afraid byron please that fuels the beast im offering theardeur i opened my eyes and stared up at him he still stood as far away as the stretched fabric of the black robe could take him my voice had found an edge of growl when i said but its a limited time offer either come across or food wont be a euphemism a funny look crossed his face do you mean sex real sex not a euphemism for anything if id had time it would have been funny yes oh duckie why didnt you say so he came to me undoing the sash of his robe and letting it fall away he was wearing only the tiniest of black thongs with his pale pale body exposed everywhere else the muscles that hed managed to acquire in less than a month worked under his skin as he dropped to his knees in front of me who gets to be on top he asked with a smile i put my hands on his bare shoulders and the moment i touched his skin the smile faded i do i said and pushed him to the floor byron lay back against the floor with my body riding him my hands on his wrists pinning him to the floor the only thing id ripped off my own body had been underwear there was no foreplay there was no time for it no need for it everywhere i touched him i could feed a little bare skin was all i needed now but it was an incomplete feeding it wasnt enough i pressed our mouths together slid my tongue into his mouth and again i could feed but it wasnt enough i ground myself against him but he was still trapped in the thong i let go with one wrist and his hand found the side of the thong first snap away he said in a voice that was deeper more real than his usual i tore the cloth away and he was suddenly naked against me not inside me but pressed against me and he was warm warm with the blood hed taken from someone else the feel of him pressed against me made me cry out nathaniel said anita he came pressed as far from us as he could get and stayed where i could see him its like theardeur but worse more he looked almost panicstricken he had an armful of gauze packets i wanted to say im sorry or something civilized but byron moved his hips underneath me and that one small movement brought my attention back to the man underneath me his eyes had darkened like sky before a storm and staring down into them i wondered how id ever thought they were soft he spent so much time being the charming youth playing to the body hed been given but now suddenly out of his eyes i saw just how much grownup i was dealing with fuck me he said and it came out softer the second time fuck me fuck me he whispered it over and over softer and softer until his breath itself whispered fuck me i leaned over him pressed my mouth to his and it was as if i could feel his soul down the long tunnel of his body as if i knew how to reach in and snatch it away i knew in that instant that i could feed on everything that byron was i could feed on that divine or infernal spark that made him vampire i could eat him up completely and utterly and leave only the lovely corpse behind i came off his mouth screaming because the urge to do it was almost overwhelming the hunger wanted it all all of him it couldnt have all of him it couldnt i wouldnt do that to him i wouldnt do that to anyone for the first time i understood just what they meant by a fate worse than death or rather that sex wasnt it if i could feed theardeur then maybe this darker thing would go away but even willing i had trouble i didnt know byrons body i tried to simply rock back onto him slide him inside me but twice we slid across each other but didnt go in i finally yelled my frustration and he said let me have my hand lover and ill help a hand appeared between us and it actually took me a moment to realize it was nathaniel he had a condom in his hand we dont know where hes been i growled at him but he growled back the only way you can catch something from a vampire or lycanthrope is if one of us has fucked someone whos got something then fucks you after you want to take that chance let me have my hands lover and ill put on anything you want i let go of his wrists and he moved himself just enough so he could open the foil packet and slip it on then he slid himself back where wed started with him pressed against me but not inside he put his hands on either side of my thighs and lifted me at the same time that he shifted his own hips he slid inside me in one smooth movement that threw my head back and made him yell oh yes when i looked back at him his gray eyes had lost focus his lips were halfparted i wanted to cover his mouth with mine i wanted that brief sweet taste of his soul again i finally realized it wasnt theardeur we were fighting not entirely something else was happening something darker something worse id thought the worst would be sex with strangers but i was wrong byron wasnt my friend yet i didnt make friends that quickly but he wasnt a bad man i liked him with his duckie and luvs i liked that he had told me the first time wed met that no he wasnt that byron and that actually lord byron wasnt one of us that had just been a rumor spread by people that wanted an excuse to burn him at the stake in some backwater country though if hed known the great poet was going to get himself drowned before the age of thirty hed have offered i liked byron he didnt deserve to die there was an angry echo in my head i thought it was primo and then knew it wasnt he didnt have the kind of power it took to interfere from a room away not through my shielding and jeanclaudes i asked myself the question where would the power go if i sucked byrons life away i threw the question out to jeanclaude i let him see that darkest of desires in my head that is not our hunger he said who is it she is the dragon he spoke in my head and there was urgency there she made primo i said and it was only then that i realized i wasnt talking out loud shes using him as a conduit for her own power how do we stop it byron suddenly drew back and thrust himself inside me again and did something with his hips and legs at the same time it blew my concentration all to hell and all i could do was stare down at him a man likes to know hes not boring a girl he said but there was no smile to go with the lighthearted comment jeanclaude echoed through my head we stop her as we did moroven by sending her something she does not understand let me guess i said and again it wasnt aloud sex or love ma petite what else is there for us i dont know what i would have said because byron rolled me he rolled us over in a sudden amazingly fast fluid movement and never fell out of me which is harder to do than it sounds i was suddenly on the floor staring up at him my hands on his shoulders as if id grabbed the nearest thing to prevent me from falling he grinned at the surprised look on my face and said youre not moving enough luv let me show you how its done he did two quick thrusts that left me breathless then he raised up on his hands like he was trying to do a bad pushup with his groin pressed tight against mine his smile faded and he frowned youre bleeding luv id forgotten about my wrist again i followed his glance and found that blood was seeping out from it there was blood spattered across my blue top some gauze please he said i think it took both nathaniel and me a second to realize who he was talking about and why nathaniel fumbled a package open and handed it to him it was acutely uncomfortable to be trapped under the body of a strange man while nathaniel knelt beside us it was more embarrassing than having richard watch with damian it just felt worse as if i should apologize i think i would have done just that but byron pressed the gauze to my wounded wrist pinning it to the floor it hurt sharp and immediate and i was left gasping and staring up at his face he pinned my other wrist so that he was pressed above me and i was very very pinned i might have complained but jeanclaude roared through my head ma petite i need to feed you are not moving fast enough with byron youre a big vampire feed yourself i said and that was out loud do you understand what youre giving permission for ma petite tonight yes help me jeanclaude feed for gods sake feed byron hesitated poised above me something wrong were not moving fast enough for him apparently a nearly evil grin crossed byrons face oh we can fix that luver we can fix that and he fixed it he moved himself in and out of me in long writhing waves of his body it was as if the thrust started at his shoulders and danced its way down his body until he thrust himself inside me once inside me he did something with his hips that seemed almost to make him roll inside me it was as if that writhing dancelike movement went all the way down his body and inside mine it wasnt fast as in speed but it was fast in other ways my breathing had sped up and my body had figured out at what point in his writhing that he plunged inside me so that my hips thrust upward to meet him it began to be like a dance except we were both flat on the floor but when he realized that i wanted to move he changed how his lower body pinned me so that mostly only him sliding in and out of me pinned my lower body and the rest of me was left to rise and fall against his body he kept my wrists pinned and i kept thinking i should say something about that but i kept forgetting and i finally realized i didnt want to say anything another british voice came from behind us jeanclaude said i was needed in here but it looks like youve got a queue i said his name requiem just that and nothing more but he came to me he knelt in a fall of blackhooded cloak he pushed the hood back to reveal hair as straight and black as the cloak itself his eyes were a deep rich blue like startled cornflowers in the white skin and black hair of his face the thin mustache and vandyke beard were as raven dark as his hair and the eyebrows that framed those startling blue eyes hed once told me that belle had wanted to buy him from his old master shed wanted a third blueeyed lover asher had the palest blue jeanclaude the darkest and requiem had the brightest his master had refused and they had fled france he knelt by my head kneeling over us on his knees like some dark angel in the cloak he would not give up for any modern coat what would you have of me my lady my voice came breathy but clear good for me if you take blood at the same time i feed on him then ill feed on both of you he didnt argue he simply laid down behind us so that his face was close to mine as my lady wills it so shall it be done well if its to be done do it fast byron said and his voice sounded more strained than mine requiem looked up at him propped on his elbows by my head are you implying that you wont last much longer yes and his voice sounded halfstrangled youre out of training requiem said you havent fucked her dont criticize until youve tried are you implying that shes such a good shag that shes going to bring you early stop bickering i said and my body still rose and fell with byrons he was still fighting to keep the rhythm even and pretty but he was beginning to lose that smooth glide and i knew when he stopped dancing above me that that would be it hurry or youll miss us as my lady bids requiem dropped to his chest his stomach and ran his hands through my hair bad angle he whispered may i improve the angle mlady yes and it was a strangled sound he dug his fingers through my curls and pulled my head sharply to one side exposing a long line of my neck he balled his fist in my hair and pulled it sharp i gasped and it wasnt a pain sound i found myself staring not into byrons gray eyes but at nathaniel he was still there huddled near but not too near he looked both afraid and eager and i didnt understand the look i wanted to and i had an instant to feel how he saw this one lover pinned my wrists to the floor grinding his hand into a fresh bite plunging himself into me over and over while i writhed underneath him now another man had jerked my hair tight and painful exposed my neck and when i orgasmed he would plunge his fangs into my neck both vampires would plunge inside me at the same time and there was nothing i could do to stop it it didnt matter to nathaniel that id given permission it mattered that i was trapped and helpless and at their mercy and the entire scene did it for him it just flat did it for him he was enjoying watching because this was the closest hed come to what hed wanted in months i felt his need like a weight in my mind and i knew that he would have given almost anything to be the one on the bottom byrons body began to lose its smooth gliding rhythm and he seemed to be fighting not to simply plunge in and out as fast as he could close very close he whispered i started to turn my head back so i could see his face but requiems hand tightened and i couldnt move his breath was hot on my throat and i knew that hed borrowed that warmth from someone else are you close mlady are you close his voice spread like heat down my skin byron leaned heavier on my wrists grinding them into the floor and his body took on a more urgent rhythm i felt that weight in my groin that grew and grew and would spill out would spill out i whispered close almost requiems lips touched my neck just his lips as if he kissed me byron fought for something smoother more controlled but his voice was hoarse breathless almost almost almost that heavy warmth inside me burst outward and i screamed fangs plunged into my throat and byrons body bucked over me convulsed against me inside me requiems mouth sealed over the kiss of his fangs and he began to feed and it was as if every suck of his mouth brought a new orgasm byron cried out above me and his body rocked with mine requiems hand convulsed in my hair and his hand gripped my shoulder dug nails into me and i felt his body jerking rocking with us i screamed until my voice went hoarse and still he fed and still byron stayed pinned inside me thrusting into me it was like being caught in an endless loop of pleasure one movement feeding the others until we finally collapsed into a quivering heap requiems mouth fell away from my neck i can drink no more his perfect voice was breathless barely a whisper byron collapsed on top of me like a puppet whose strings had been sliced he lay on top of me and i could feel his heart thudding inside his chest like a trapped thing his breathing was ragged and sounded painful and mine wasnt much better he found his voice hoarse and shaking if i wasnt dead already id say i was having a heart attack i tried to laugh and ended up coughing oh dont do that byron said oh please the coughing fit had tightened me around him again and it jerked him up on his arms pushed him one last time against me which made me writhe under him he collapsed again and begged no more please anita no more i never thought id say that from just one time but give me a moment to catch my breath breath requiem said with his face collapsed next to mine not breath pulse i knew you had theardeur but you should warn a vampire if you can do things like that i found my voice like what he moved his head just enough so that he could look me in the eye with his face on my shoulder i knew you would feed from me but i didnt know you would bring me bring us byron said bring us again and again he was collapsed across my chest and body so all i could see was his brown curls i usually try and keep track of things like that but i gave up when we passed five or was it six eight requiem said or maybe more i think if i could have kept feeding we wouldnt have stopped he closed his eyes and a faint shiver ran through him id forgotten how many different ways theardeur could be fed id forgotten how good it could feel i dont have anything to compare this to byron said in a hoarse voice you never met belle morte did you requiem asked byron seemed to want to look at the other man when he spoke but he gave up when raising his head was too much effort no never had the pleasure it was a pleasure he said if i could have moved and been sure i wouldnt fall over id have told everyone to get off of me but i couldnt move and if i couldnt i knew at least byron couldnt either hed been using more muscles than i had but it felt odd to lay there with them draped around me and talk as if i wasnt there i asked him why didnt you let belle keep you then have you met her in a manner of speaking yeah his blue blue eyes looked sad the excited exhaustion fading in the light of memories then you should know the answer no pleasure is worth her price and besides i dont like men not even a little and if you arent at least bisexual you cant survive at her court why i asked when shes not fucking the men she likes to watch the men fucking each other i dont think there was ever a waking moment at her court when someone wasnt having sex either with her or for her entertainment or the entertainment of her guests byron managed to lever himself around so he could give gray eyes to the other vampire i like men but you make it sound like i wouldnt have liked it either there is no pleasure without payment no pleasure without some pain attached and not the kind of pain youll enjoy first she finds what you most desire she learns your body as no other lover can then she begins to deny you that love she begins to make you beg for it she addicts you to her if she can then when she has you truly has you she begins to pull away so that you spend the rest of eternity gazing into the face of paradise but you are locked outside the shining gates and can only touch glimpses of heaven i found that i could move my arm again i reached around byrons curls and touched requiems face you didnt end up with belle i said his eyes lost their remembering look but they didnt regain the shine of pleasure if jeanclaude had not offered me a home when our old master got himself executed belle morte would have had me if any other master had offered for me anyone less than ale sourdre de sang then i could not have refused her you have no idea how rare it is that jeanclaude has gained enough power to be his own fountainhead of blood not more than three vampires in nearly eight hundred years have gained that kind of power it protected all of us when our old master lost his mind and went against the councils orders an entire court of nearly all belles line when it fell apart she tried to pick up all the pieces britain was the only other country in the world where vampires were legal they had rights and you couldnt just kill one of them simply because they were a vampire it was murder but in america wed been doing it almost four years and the brits were newer at it thered been some hitches hitches that the human media and powers that be didnt know about the master of the city of london had been very old hed been one of the first master vamps that belle morte made oh so long ago sometimes the really ancient vampires dont take well to newfangled ideas you know electricity modern medicine and the fact that they were supposed to expose themselves to public view in a very modern rock star sort of way london had had more of belles lovely vampires than any but three other groups and that included belles own court so when the vamps got legal the vampire council wanted the master of the city to play to the human media he called himself dracula because once the real vampire dracula was assassinated the name was up for grabs only one person at a time can hold a name per country and only one person per time can hold some of the more wellknown names dracula wasnt really dracula but the news media didnt seem to understand that and theyd enjoyed talking about how they had the real dracula as their master of the city theyd only wanted him to be as politically correctly visible as jeanclaude and a lot of the masters in this country but the new drac didnt take well to it in fact he went buggers and started slaughtering humans the council managed to hush most of it up to assassinate dracula again and just to prove that vampires can be as superstitious as the next bunch they declareddracula a dead name no other vampire was allowed to choose it or hold it there had been two of them and both had broken council law and had to be assassinated two was enough jeanclaude had offered the london vamps a home not all of them but many of them all of them that could trace their lineage to belle morte who better to be strippers and dancers than the most beautiful and seductive vampires in the world i couldnt argue with his logic but lying there trapped under the weight of two of those vampires i had to wonder if part of what was happening was just too damn many of them in one place was there such a thing as vampire pheromones probably youre safe now i said so everybody off the animator i need to get up that i did not offer means i am no gentleman requiem said and he came to his knees with more grace than i was going to manage byron got to all fours head hanging down like a tired horse i could see down the line of his body and he looked tired spent i cant feel my legs below my knees so im as far up as im getting for awhile sorry luv his getting up even that far left me suddenly naked from the waist down or as naked as mattered to me i never felt dressed in just thighhighs and boots and still wearing the shirt complete with gun didnt matter either my skirt was up so high that the front of me was totally exposed and for me that was naked i know i know how middleamerica how small town but truth is truth if you gave me a choice of covering anything that would be it i tried to pull the skirt down but i was lying on too much of it requiem stood and offered me a hand but nathaniel was on the other side with his hand out there was a look i couldnt quite read on his face and this time i fought not to read his mind id had enough surprises for one evening but i took nathaniels hand and not requiems nathaniel had to take both my hands to pull me out from under byron when he got me standing my knees wouldnt hold and he had to catch me around the waist i looked at requiem who had spilled his black cloak around himself i thought he was insulted so i said nothing personal requiem he gave me a brief and rare grin he smiled but grinning was rare i am not insulted my lady he spread the cloak wide suddenly so that the front of his body showed the cloak was black but his slacks were not the pale gray slacks were stained on the front as if hed not quite made it to a bathroom but that wasnt really what the stain was it wasnt the stain that got me it was the fact that the stain ran from his groin down one leg of his pants nearly to his knees i gave him raised eyebrows i expected embarrassment but didnt get it a task well done mlady a task well done that made me blush which made him laugh that deep rolling chuckle that was all masculine byron joined it and his was not as deep a sound but had just as much maleness to it he was finally on his knees instead of all fours nathaniel didnt join in the laughter he was helping me pull my skirt into place something about his face his silence reached the vampires requiem made a low sweeping bow that flared the cloak around him like wings he used the cloak or one similar to it on stage my apologies nathaniel it did not occur to me to ask your favor when i entered jeanclaude is our master and hers but not yours he looked up at nathaniel giving him the full force of those startling blue eyes anita doesnt need my permission for anything nathaniel said but his voice made the words not ring true i sighed i guess i couldnt blame him hed spent a lot of time lately watching everybody else but him get so much more than just sleeping privileges but i couldnt apologize in front of the vampires without explaining way too much so i didnt try you get to sleep with her every night mate dont begrudge us a few crumbs from your table he took a breath like hed say something but i stopped him with a hand against his lips it was a metaphysical emergency nathaniel wants to opt out of those for awhile he looked at me and i felt his smile against my hand a smile just for me because no one else could see it he kissed the palm of my hand and moved it away from his mouth but some piece of unhappiness had faded from his eyes it made me smile lets bandage that wrist i glanced at the wrist in question the gauze had glued itself to the wound and it had begun to close byron had put a lot of pressure on it and find my underwear i said byron lifted what was left of my black undies from under the tables i think theyve had it luver i sighed bert had been right the skirt was too short and it was certainly too short to wear without underwear i might have something that fits you byron said what i asked a thong but at least the front bits will be covered he smiled when he said it i shook my head but i took his offer a little underwear was better than no underwear at all the club was dark except for a single soft spotlight in the middle of the stage in that soft white light jeanclaude stood the light hit only his shoulders and face the rest of him was lost to darkness it gave the illusion that his body formed from the darkness itself to rise to the shining paleness of his face the gleaming white of his cravat the tiny colored spark of the sapphire winking only when he moved his hair looked as if the darkness had been drawn out into some dark thread and formed into curls the only color was the drowning blue of his eyes and the crimson smear of lipstick across his face it wasnt my lipstick or at least not most of it his voice floated through the darkened room who will taste my kiss taste left a sweetness on my tongue as if id licked a piece of candy kiss gave a ghost of lips brushing my cheek who will embrace me embrace made me feel faintly warm as if id been given a really good hug by someone i cared about jeanclaudes voice had always been good but not this good not this good with my partial immunity i probably wasnt getting all of it i had no idea how much more the audience was getting it took a force of will to look away from him in that shining circle of light i made myself look out at the audience it took a moment for my eyes to adjust to the dark but when i could see nearly every face was turned to him they gazed up at him in the dark as if he were the rising sun and they had never seen anything so bright before only a handful of faces werent turned toward the stage a few women were shaking their heads and looking confused a little psychic talent of the right kind or with the right practice helped marianne had proven to me that you didnt have to be a necromancer to have some immunity to vampire mind tricks one of the few men was standing up and the woman with him was tugging on his arm trying to get him to sit back down he was shaking his head adamantly no no he wouldnt sit in the dark and let that voice wash over him he didnt understand that it wasnt a matter of sexual orientation it was jeanclaude his power was seduction and it had nothing and everything to do with sex two of the waiters were escorting a woman up on stage she was tall and almost anorexically thin shed apparently been waving more money than anybody else because jeanclaude preferred more curves on his women as hed pointed out to me the beauties of his day in the french courts were todays size twenty most of the old vamps liked short women with curves most of us were living in so the wrong century the lights around the stage had been growing brighter so gradually that if youd been gazing at the stage the entire time you might not have noticed the light was just barely bright enough so the audience could see more of their bodies from the waist up you could see his pale hands sliding over her body nothing déclassé but he got more out of simply touching a womans back shoulder or waist than some men got out of touching breasts and groin sometimes its not what you touch but how you touch it he pressed her against the front of his body so there was no space between them so that her thin frame seemed almost to mold itself to his body he lifted her face up to meet his using one pale hand to cradle her face so that he would control the kiss his arm slid around her waist and tightened tightened enough to bow her neck and make her mouth open in a surprised littleo one of the women before this one had groped him so hed made sure there wasnt enough space between the front of their bodies for anyones hands to wander too far the women seemed to take the closer frontal contact as a sign of favor i knew it wasnt it was a sign of control and damn near displeasure but when he bowed his head to her mouth and locked their lips together in a kiss there was no displeasure he kissed her as if he were trying to breathe her down through his mouth he fed from her lips almost as if he were feeding from her neck and in a way he was feeding at least he fed from their mouths in a way that the dragons presence in my head had told me about except she knew how to eat the essence of the dead and make the undead really truly dead this was not that but it was eerily similar he was feeding theardeur from a kiss nikolaos would never let him feed like that a quiet voice said from behind me i turned to find buzz just behind me i hadnt heard him or sensed him which meant that id been more caught up in the show than id realized what do you mean i asked nikolaos knew that he was feeding off the audience without ever touching them so she forbade him to touch any of the customers his gaze went past me to the stage i think she had some clue what he could have been and she did everything she could to make sure he didnt come into that power shes been dead almost three years you make it sound like tonight is the first time youve seen this show he looked at me it is i gave him wide eyes nikolaos was dead she couldnt stop him but you could he said what do you mean do you really think three years ago you would have dated him after you saw this i glanced back at the stage i watched him kissing a strange woman as if she were his deepest love or at least deepest lust would i have tolerated it three years ago no would i have used it as an excuse to dump his ass oh yeah the woman swooned in his arms her mouth falling away from his as she seemed to halffaint as if the kiss alone were so intense that she couldnt stay conscious i would have thought she was playacting or exaggerating but i had to believe it when the waiters carried her off stage and gave her back to her friends at their table jeanclaude gazed out at the audience with fresh crimson lipstick smeared across his entire lower jaw it looked eerily like blood and i knew him well enough to know that the resemblance was not accidental his blue eyes had bled to solid blue light as if a summers dusk could burn in his eyes who will be next and it was as if he whispered along my skin as if he were standing just behind me the illusion was so strong that i had to fight not to turn around and look i was supposed to be immune to this crap if this was how i was feeling what must the women connected to all those eager faces be feeling i lowered my shields just enough to see jeanclaude shining with power this was what he was meant to be this wasnt just feeding theardeur this wasnt a substitute for a blood feed this was an end in itself this was something id never seen not in jeanclaude not in anyone it was akin to all his other abilities but more somehow this was more i turned back to buzz him feeding like this is what saved me he looked puzzled vampires under twenty years dead have so many more human facial expressions saved you from what if he hadnt fed then id have had to feed for him thats one of the things a human servant is for we feed when the vamps cant i would still be trapped backstage fucking my metaphysical brains out i shook my head no thank you so youre not disappointed thats hes doing strangers i felt my face go sort of unfriendly you sound disappointed that im not upset about this why he raised his hands making his big arms flex i think by accident he meant it to be a harmless gesture but he was too musclebound for it to look anything but impressive or scary depending on how you looked at it it just seems like a fast turnaround thats all i sighed the last time jeanclaude asked me if he could feed off the audience i didnt really understand what he was asking i smiled but not like i was happy besides i wasnt fucking strangers to feed the vampiric powers then strangely thats changed my mind about a lot of things he looked way too serious for my tastes i didnt know what was up with buzz so i decided to change topics primo all tucked away in the spare coffin we put him in while you were cleaning up i nodded id been told about it but id also laid my hands on the coffin and felt primo trapped inside behind silver chains and a holy item it wasnt that i didnt trust everybody it was just good business to be cautious buzzs odd behavior hadnt changed my mind about that not one little bit lisandro told me that you ordered him to babysit the coffin i nodded yes i did primo is in a crosswrapped coffin anita hes not getting out i shrugged lisandro was tall dark handsome with the longest hair that any of the new security had he was also the only one with a gun tucked into the small of his back under the black tshirt once i spotted the gun i pegged him for a wererat and id been right i told him if primo started to tear out of the coffin to kill him jeanclaude would probably have agreed with me but hed been busy on stage so id made the call i was happy with the call and i didnt like that buzz wasnt lets just say that i feel better going off to raise the dead knowing that lisandro is sitting by that coffin with silver ammo and a willingness to shoot im head of security here anita you should have cleared it with me i sighed youre right youre right i should have im sorry he just blinked at me like a deer caught in headlights i think hed expected an argument but i was tired and late and feeling squidgie about having had sex with byron and requiem ive got to go buzz your security detail is waiting at the door he said and nodded toward the door in question requiem was by the door in his black cloak wearing a fresh pair of pants that hed borrowed from someone the new pants were leather so hed probably borrowed them from another dancer but we had a new addition and that was the darkhaired werewolf that had fallen on top of clay and me when primo was fighting everyone his name was graham and his body had that width of shoulder and impressive swell of arm that only semiserious weight lifting can get you his black hair was cut in a longish layer on top so that it fell like a silken fringe over his ears but underneath the hair was shaved close to his head and upper neck it seemed an odd haircut to me but it wasnt my hair his face was exotic in the way that people can be when some ancestor didnt come from northern or southern europe the straight black hair the eversoslight uptilt to the edge of his eyes made me bet hed come from somewhere much farther east id argued that i didnt need or want guards but just as id made the call about primo and lisandro so jeanclaude had given his orders about this before he got carried away on stage i was to go nowhere without someone with me he wasnt sure the dragon was done with us for the night and it would be a shame if something went horribly wrong what he hadnt told the security detail vampire or otherwise was about what had happened earlier in my office that had had nothing to do with the dragon and everything to do with my own metaphysical shit well mine and jeanclaudes jeanclaude had even left a list of people he thought were appropriate to the job byron had not been on the list nor had clay it had been a damn short list actually basically requiem and graham the last thing i wanted to do was be trapped in a car with requiem but i didnt have time to argue id gone from having plenty of time to having to call my clients and tell them to hold fast in the cemetery i really was on my way i was wearing byrons leather jacket to take the place of my bloodied suit jacket his was the only one that came close to fitting me and not making me look like i was wearing the upper half of a gorilla it smelled faintly of his cologne buzzs eyes left me and went to the audience the man who had been arguing with his date was still standing but now so was the woman and she was starting to make a scene sorry gotta catch that be my guest i said nathaniel seemed to appear from nowhere he escorted me toward the outer door he was smiling and seemed terribly at ease more so than id seen him in a long time maybe ever it seemed an odd night for him to be happy you promised to get back in time to see some of my act he said smiling ive got two clients stuck in cemeteries i said he gave me the look that was halfpout and halfheknewhedalreadywontheargument you promised cant we just fuck at home later i asked he gave me a frown ill be furry you dont do furry i had an idea an awful idea i promised to mark your neck tonight oh no you so are not planning on me doing it in front of an audience he smiled and there was something in that smile that i hadnt seen before some hint of confidence of security that hadnt been there before hed watched me have sex with two near strangers and suddenly he felt more secure go figure you little exhibitionist you i said you like the idea of me marking you for the first time in front of all these people he gave an awgeeshucks shrug which was all act because his eyes were bright with the answer i like a lot of things anita i tried to frown at him but couldnt keep it up you got me to promise id mark you and now youre taking advantage of it youre running late he said clients waiting in the cemetery he looked solemn except for the glint of humor in his eyes which spoiled the effect i shook my head smiling ive got to go i know he said would it ruin the illusion if i kissed you goodbye ill risk it he said i kissed him it was chaste a touch of lips a little pressure barely any body language i drew back with a suspicious look on my face it made him laugh and push me toward the door youre late remember i went but i went out into the october dark even more certain that i knew absolutely nothing about men alright to be fair that i knew absolutely nothing about the men in my life i glanced back to see jeanclaude on stage with another woman kissing her as if he were trying to find her tonsils without his hands most people looked disturbing or awkward when they kissed that deep he didnt he made it all seem suave erotic and perfect i realized id kissed nathaniel goodbye but not jeanclaude didnt want to interrupt but didnt want him to feel left out either i blew him a kiss as his arms emptied of the woman he returned the gesture with one pale hand the lower half of his face was smeared bright crimson with lipstick it didnt really look like blood not if youd seen enough of the real deal but it was still a less than comforting image to take away into the night one of the other men in my life was smiling at the door looking forward to having me do foreplay on him in front of an audience sometimes the parts of my life that are weirdest to me arent the parts dealing with vampires and werewolves and zombies even vampire politics didnt confuse me as much as my own love life we were on gravois trapped between an endless line of storefronts that had seen better days the entire area was doing that slow slide into not being a good area to be in after dark it wasnt quite a danger zone but if nothing saved it in a couple of years it would be the bevo mill restaurant an honesttogod windmill loomed like a ship in a sea of lesser buildings and harder times the bevo mill still served great german food the slowly turning windmill was just ahead and suddenly we were driving under the stone overpass blocks past the mill i didnt remember passing any of it that wasnt good i was missing things like my attention was going in and out not good at all since i was driving graham squeaked a second time you know that sharp intake of breath that comes out when youre trying to swallow the sound i glanced at him what what is your problem youve almost hit two cars he said in a strangled voice no i havent yes requiem said from the back yes you have there was a white car in front of me like magic it just appeared i slammed on the brakes and graham squeaked again my pulse was thudding in my throat i hadnt seen that car i signaled that i was turning right right meant i didnt have to cross any lanes of traffic the suddenly appearing white car had scared me i eased us into grasso plaza which held the affton post office a savealot and a lot of empty storefronts this whole area along gravois seemed tired as if it had given its best and its best hadnt been good enough or maybe it was projecting i cut the engine and we sat in silence for a minute are you well requiem asked his voice was very quiet and deep like he was talking from inside a well i actually turned around and looked at him and even turning around seemed to be slower as if i wasnt moving at the same speed as the rest of the world requiem was just sitting in the backseat with his hands clasped in his lap he wasnt far away or doing anything odd he was sitting very still as if he didnt want to attract attention to himself what did you say my voice seemed hollow too as if i had an echo in my head are you well he said slowly distinctly and as i stared at his lips watching them move the sound and the movement seemed just a little out of sync i had to think about it as if it were a much harder question than it should have been no i said finally no i dont think i am whats wrong graham asked what was wrong good question trouble is i wasnt sure i had a good answer what was wrong i was having something close to a shock reaction why had i lost more blood than i knew maybe maybe not i was cold and i huddled in the borrowed jacket burying my face in the collar byrons cologne the scent of him was there and i jerked back from it because the smell of his skin in the leather brought it all back scent brings memory stronger than any other sense and i was suddenly drowning in the feel of byrons body the look of his face as he gazed down at me the weight of him the sight of him going in and out of my body i fell back against the seat my head thrown back and it was as if all the pleasure of it was suddenly there again rolling over me through me it wasnt the exact experience but like a strong strong echo strong enough to shake my body against the seat and leave my hands clawing at the air as if i needed something to hold on to anything to hold on to i heard requiems voice no dont touch and i found something to hold on to graham had tried to grab me hold me down keep me from hurting myself i think hed thought i was having a fit his hand touched mine and my hand convulsed around his and it was as if from the moment our palms locked together that all that memory all that pleasure poured down my hand and into him graham shuddered against me i felt the shiver of it go down his arm and it threw him against the seat so hard the jeep shook from the impact i let him have the memory the pleasure the sights and smells of it i let it all pour away from me and into him it wasnt a conscious thought because i hadnt known until i did it that i could put it into someone else and not have to be pulled along for the ride i didnt mean to do it but i wasnt unhappy about it i was glad for once to be the calm one on the other side of the seat while i watched graham writhing in just the echo of what wed done i was glad it wasnt me because i knew now why id had the shocky reaction earlier before the metaphysics had gotten out of hand i killed without thinking much about it not in cold blood but if it came time to kill i had no real problem with it id mourned the fact that killing had stopped bothering me then on my first trip to tennessee to help richard back when we were still a couple id tortured someone the bad guys had sent us richards mothers finger in a little box along with a lock of his brother daniels hair we had a time limit to find them and we already knew that theyd been tortured the man whod delivered the box had bragged that theyd both been raped id tortured him made him tell us where they were and when we were done with him id shot him in the head and made the screaming stop id done it to save richards family and because i couldnt see another way to do it id done it because i never ask anyone to do anything that im not willing to do myself its a rule of course before that my rule had been i did not do torture that was a line i did not cross and id crossed it the terrible part was that i hadnt regretted doing it only having to do it hed raped richards mother if i could have id have killed him slower but that wasnt in me not even for what hed done wed saved them but before all of it the zeemans had been like the waltons and now they werent they werent broken completely but they werent as fixed as when they started either id killed the men that did it or helped them get killed but all the revenge in the world wouldnt really fix what was broken how do you give someone back their innocence that wonderful sense of perfect safety that only exists for people that have never really had anything bad happen to them how do you give that back i wish i knew id crossed a lot of lines over the years but one line id never crossed until tonight had been i didnt have sex just to feed i didnt have sex with strangers byron and requiem were strangers id known them for two weeks give or take i had fucked them because jeanclaude needed me to feed requiem had moved to one side of the backseat so he was close enough to see my face and to watch graham still twitching on the front seat but not close enough so i could touch him easily you had a flashback didnt you i nodded still staring at the werewolf in my front seat has that ever happened before only after asher rolled me completely with his mind and we all had sex i didnt look at him as i spoke i watched grahams body begin to grow quiet but asher was not involved tonight no i said he wasnt my voice sounded very even very neutral empty empty just like i felt did you know that you could send that memory into someone else no i said grahams eyes were fluttering like butterflies trying to open but not able to do it he looked boneless as if he could have slid into the floorboard if his body had been a little less solid you spilled it into him then watched him writhe how did it make you feel i shook my head nothing just glad for once that it wasnt me twisting in the seat he moved to lean against the back of grahams seat a little closer to me is that true is that really how you feel about it i moved my whole head to meet his eyes as if a glance wasnt enough i let him see how dead my eyes felt how empty i was inside youre a master vamp cant you smell it if im lying he licked his lips like he was nervous the last vampire i knew that could do what you just did did it on purpose she would recall a memory of pleasure and she would pick someone to give it to it could be a reward and it was but it could also be punishment sometimes she would choose someone who did not wish to feel such pleasures and she would force them to experience it a kind of rape i said he nodded youre talking about belle morte arent you he nodded again she enjoyed watching them writhe especially if they didnt want to do it i said you say that as a statement not a question ive met her remember you are exactly right she loved watching prim proper women and men forced to spill themselves upon the floor and flop about experiencing a pleasure greater than any they had ever felt before it pleased her to watch the righteous brought low yeah that sounds like her but you truly felt nothing it did not excite you to watch graham writhe why should it he smiled then and there was relief in his eyes that you would ask the question makes me worry less about you worry how i asked it has been speculation for centuries whether belle was formed into the type of he seemed to search for a word creature she was by theardeur and her powers running to flesh and pleasure or whether she was always as she is and the power simply made her more its been my experience requiem that people become more of who they are in extremes both good and bad give a truly good person power and theyre still a good person give a bad person power and theyre still a bad person the question is always about the person in between the one that isnt evil or good but just ordinary you dont always know what an ordinary person is like on the inside he looked at me with an odd expression on his face that was a very wise thing to say i had to smile you sound surprised he gave an almost bow from the neck as much as he could sitting in the seat my apologies but in truth ive always thought of you as more muscle than brain not stupid he added hastily but not wise intelligent perhaps but no not wise i guess ill just take the compliment and leave the insult alone it was not meant as an insult anita far from it there was a look on his face a feel to him that was anxious dont worry i wont hold it against you a lot of people underestimate me they see the delicate beauty but not the killer he said im not a delicate beauty i said he gave a small frown you are most assuredly delicate in appearance and you are beautiful i shook my head no im not not beautiful pretty maybe but not beautiful his eyes widened a little if you do not think yourself beautiful then you are using a different mirror from the one in front of my eyes pretty words but im surrounded by some of the most beautiful men living or dead i may clean up well but when comparing beauty i dont rank that high not in this company it is true perhaps that your beauty is not a flashy beauty as is ashers or jeanclaudes or even your nathaniels but it is beauty nonetheless perhaps the more precious for it grows not at the first sight of the eye but a little more each time one speaks with you or watches you move so commandingly into a situation or watches the truth in your eyes when you say that you are not beautiful and i realize that you mean it that you are not being humble or playing silly games you simply do not see yourself see thats not beauty thats pretty with a personality that you like but do you not see anita that there is beauty that hits the eye like a bolt of lighting that burns and sears and blinds it is more disaster than pleasure but yours yours is a beauty that lulls one into comfort into not protecting ones eyes from the light then one night you realize that the moon too has its beauty i shook my head i have no idea who youre talking about but its not me he sighed you are a very hard woman to compliment you know youre not the first person to say that he smiled that does not surprise me at all graham let out a long long sigh and sort of spilled himself back up onto the seat it was like watching liquid fall upward he had that same liquid grace that all the wereanimals seemed to have he leaned his head against the headrest but at least he was upright again he gave me a slow lazy blink and his eyes were a dark wolf amber almost brown but i knew the difference id seen it often enough he smiled and even that was lazy that was amazing i didnt do it on purpose i said i dont care i frowned at him can you do it again is all i want to know i frowned harder some of the laziness began to seep away from his face look you give me one of the most amazing orgasmic experiences of my life and now youre acting like the injured party youre the one that spilled all over me not on purpose i said you keep saying that like youre apologizing why why are you apologizing i looked at requiem for help though i didnt hold much hope but he did help i believe that anita sees it as unaskedfor sexual contact a sort of rape if you will cant rape the willing graham said and he stretched himself taller in the seat settling more into it and his eyes were bleeding back to human i didnt know you were willing when it happened he nodded okay but im okay with it he looked at me but you dont seem okay with it at all whats wrong now whats wrong i asked i just had a flashback so strong that if id still been driving wed have wrecked i fed it into you by accident i didnt mean to do it what else am i not going to mean to do she and jeanclaude have hit a new power plateau requiem said oh graham said as if that made perfect sense to him so you dont know what all the new power can do yet no i said he nodded yeah that can get scary im sorry i didnt know this was the first time youd done something like this i enjoyed it you dont owe me an apology but what if i grab a client next time i said you had warning requiem said or you wouldnt have pulled off the road i dont think that had anything to do with new powers then why did you nearly run us up the back of three different cars graham asked i opened my mouth closed it and didnt know what to say i think i crossed my last few lines tonight what does that mean graham asked i broke some personal rules tonight thats all rules that you thought would never be broken requiem said softly i looked at him surprised you say that like you know a person likes to think of himself in a certain way and when something happens that makes that no longer possible you mourn the old self the person you thought you were i shook my head i am still the person i thought i was damn it he gave a shrug that reminded me of that graceful lift of shoulders that jeanclaude always did as you like mlady i turned around in my seat and put my forehead against the steering wheel i just wanted this night over with i didnt want to have to explain myself to anyone let alone one of the men that id had sex with by accident tonight the trouble was i wasnt sure that i believed what id just said it wasnt just the sex with byron and requiem it was that tonight for the first time id let jeanclaude into my head as far as he could go for the first time wed touched what might be possible if only id get out of our way until tonight i hadnt realized how much id crippled us as much in my own way as richard id thought that sleeping with jeanclaude and doing small things with him was being his human servant id learned differently less than an hour ago and that knowledge was eating me up it wasnt that i had crippled us as a triumvirate of power no id guessed that before just not the amount of crippling i thought my limits and boundaries had hobbled us not cut both our legs off at the knees what i hadnt expected what i hadnt wanted to know was how good it felt to let jeanclaude roll me it had been afuckingmazing peaceful and intoxicating all at the same time id never really known what i was doing without because i had been so careful not to let him show me and he had respected my wishes i knew now that it had cost him dear cost him in power he might have had safety he might have built for his vampires and in the sheer pleasure he might have experienced hed cut himself off from so much just because i couldnt handle it that made me feel guilty but part of the real problem was that after id let jeanclaude in that deep id then turned around and had sex with byron and let requiem bite me two things i didnt do lightly yeah it had been important maybe urgent maybe it had saved the lives of most of those women in that club maybe it had even saved jeanclaudes life id felt primos power and the whisper of the dragon but that wasnt what bothered me the most jeanclaude had gained nathaniel and damians neediness what had i gained id had sex with byron and requiem and i didnt feel bad about it even now i felt bad only because i didnt feel bad it hadnt bothered me thats what made me almost run into three cars and pull into the parking lot so i could have my little moment of shock reaction i didnt feel guilty about byron i only felt guilty about not feeling guilty about it and even now i wanted to turn the car around and go back to jeanclaude i wanted him to hold me to kiss me to feed from me i wanted the whole ride now that id had a taste i wanted it the way junkies want their fix thats not love thats control i wouldnt let anyone control me like that i couldnt not and still be me i didnt explain any of this to graham or requiem they werent close enough to me for a hearttoheart i just said whoever feels better to drive drive i do not know how to drive requiem said ill drive graham said just dont touch me while im behind the wheel ill do my best to resist i said and made it plain by my tone that it wouldnt be hard he laughed and got out his door to walk around in the moments it took him to walk around the car requiem said you feel very serious tonight anita im always serious i said perhaps he said and he might have said more but graham opened the door and i got out i walked around the car and got into the passenger seat as graham started the engine where to sunset cemetery its less than five minutes from here do you feel well enough to raise the dead tonight requiem asked just get me there and dont let me touch any of the clients ill do the rest just dont let me fuck anybody or tear anybodys throat out what if you order us to allow you to fuck someone requiem asked or kill someone graham said im not planning on it tonight okay you werent planning on it earlier requiem said quietly graham pulled carefully into the traffic on gravois as if he were trying to make up for my bad driving earlier what do we do if some new vampire power kicks in he asked as he eased us to the first stoplight just keep me from hurting anybody i said and if the need arises for you to feed again what then requiem asked i turned in my seat as far as the seat belt would allow so i could see his face in the streetlights he was revealed in startling white light for an instant it made his eyes glow then shadow swept over the backseat and his eyes faded to a dim blue glow what are you getting at i asked did you wonder why jeanclaude chose us and only us to guard you tonight i had some ideas but enlighten me he wanted people with you that were strong enough and dominant enough that if they had to they could override you that they would use their best judgment and not blindly follow bully for you both i said but it wasnt that alone just spill it requiem the foreplay is getting tiresome i heard that about you graham said i turned and looked at him what that you dont like a lot of foreplay i gave him a very cold look one no one that would actually know would tell you shit and two dont let a little metaphysical sex go to your head remember i watched you writhe all over the seat and it didnt appeal to me it wasnt foreplay or a preview it was just an accident sorry i turned back to requiem now you just tell me what you need to tell me no preface no long explanation just say it you wont like it he said i already dont like it just tell me requiem just tell me i was getting a headache i didnt know if it was loss of blood or tension but whatever it was beginning to pound right behind my eye he thought that if things went as badly as they could go games word games just say it he sighed and the sigh seemed to fill the jeep with echoes if you had to feed theardeur or if your beast rose we were the two most likely to survive an attack without having to resort to hurting you you left something out i said ive said enough he said all of it requiem i want to hear all of it no graham said you dont that tone in your voice no you dont just drive i said and turned back to the vampire tell me the rest he sighed again and it flittered through the interior of the jeep like it had a life of its own and can the voice tricks or youre really going to piss me off my apologies it is automatic for me when faced with an angry woman to try and pacify her by whatever means talk to me requiem were almost at the cemetery i want that last bit before we get out of the car he drew himself up even straighter in his seat very formal we were also the two at the club most likely to be able to turn violence to seduction if the need arose he must have a high opinion of you both or a low opinion of me that last is not true and you know it requiem said i sighed just the way im feeling tonight graham said it youre feeling slutty because you did byron i looked at him well thats one way of putting it its exactly how youre feeling he said sounding sure and youre sure of that the way youre acting yeah besides i know your reputation if anyone can resist temptation its you everyone keeps telling me that but i dont seem to be resisting much anymore i have lived with others more powerful than i in belle mortes line for centuries anita i more than most know just how much you must fight every night of your existence not to be consumed by their power he paused and then whispered so that it filled the darkened car if you are not careful their beauty will become both heaven and hell you will betray every oath abandon every loyalty give up your heart your mind your body and your immortal soul to have them near you but one more night then one cold night a hundred years after the passion is spent and nothing but ashes remain you look up and see someone gazing at you and you know that look youve seen it before a hundred years later and someone gazes upon you as if you were heaven itself but you know in your heart of hearts that its not heaven youre offering them its hell i didnt know what to say to that but graham did now i know why they call you requiem youre poetic but fucking depressing tonight i just thought he was accurate sunset cemetery was a nice combination of old and new big monuments of angels and weeping virgins combined with flat modern stonesso much less interesting it was still a place for the rich and famous to be interred like our local famous brewery family the busches in his day edwin alonzo herman had been a very important man and his monument showed that he thought so too it loomed up into the darkness like some winged giant there was enough light to see that the huge angel had a sword and shield and it gave you sense that it was waiting to pass judgment and you wouldnt like what it decided of course maybe that was just the way i was feeling tonight there were more than a dozen people waiting at the paved road most of them lawyers though with enough family members to have nearly caused a fistfight when i introduced myself and briefly explained what id be doing id started telling people up front that id be using a machete and beheading chickens for two different reasons id had an overzealous bodyguard of a very wealthy man nearly shoot me when i drew the big blade at a different graveside for a historical society the secretary of said society had jumped me and tried to save the chicken shed turned out to be a vegan thats like a rabid fundamentalist vegetarian id been glad later that it hadnt been cold enough to wear a coat because leather is the only kind of coat i own tonight was cold enough for coats october isnt usually that chilly in st louis but tonight had decided to be cold or maybe it just felt colder because i was wearing a thong id been surprised by two things about the skimpy underwear one once i got over the sensation of having something in the crack of my butt the thong wasnt uncomfortable two a thong under a short skirt on a cold night was damn cold id never fully appreciated how much warmth a little extra bit of satin or silk could hold in against my ass i certainly appreciated it as i walked over the grass in my little boots and skirt i huddled in the borrowed leather jacket but kept my face away from the collar i did not want a repeat of what had happened in the car i willed the warmth in my upper body to travel downward i was suddenly wishing id taken one of the taller mens jackets it wouldnt have looked as good but it would have covered my ass i stood in front of the grave though since it had been nearly two hundred years in a cemetery that was as wellmaintained as sunset there was no way for me to truly be sure of where the grave had been not really a lot of the graves had been moved here from smaller cemeteries over the years as increased population had needed the land but i had dropped just enough of my shields to know exactly where edwin alonzo hermans grave lay his bones were under there i could feel them to the watchers from the road who had paid for this show it must have looked like i was standing a little far away from the impressive angel but it had been my experience that once the zombie crawls out of the grave the crowd always thinks theyve had a good show theyll forgive almost any lack of showmanship on my part once theyve seen me raise the dead funny that the crate with softly clucking chickens was near my feet graham had carried it and put it where i said to put it no arguments once we left the jeep he went back into serious security guard mode he was the unsmiling business only person hed been when i first saw him at the club he was wearing a plain white tshirt with his black jeans jogging shoes and his own short leather jacket hed changed out of the guilty pleasures shirt without being asked the joking halfflirting man of a few minutes ago had vanished behind a very serious face and a pair of dark eyes that kept searching the cemetery the people near us and farther away so he was very obviously aware of the perimeter he seemed to vibrate bodyguard id let the lawyers think he was and showed them the many bandages on my face wrist and fingers to prove the necessity no one had argued that this was private business and they didnt like anyone but me here with them once graham put his dark gaze on their faces he had a really good stare a hardness to his face and eyes that did not match what hed been like in the car interesting requiem had carried my gym bag with all the rest of the zombieraising equipment except the chickens i could have carried the bag but it would have taken me two trips to get the chickens they tended to squawk if you didnt carry them upright and carefully since i was planning on killing them tonight i tried not to scare them i had to kill them to raise the dead but i could make it as painless as possible and fear definitely goes under the heading of pain in the wrong situation being a blood sacrifice probably qualifies as a wrong situation even if youre a chicken id persuaded requiem to leave his long black cloak in the jeep because in it he looked like a cute version of the grim reaper out of it he looked like he should have been going clubbing maybe it was the leather pants or the boots or the longsleeved silk shirt in a deep green jewel tone that made his white skin almost shine in contrast the shirt had made his eyes turquoise in the light as if there was green in that bright blue somewhere hed been harder to explain than graham because even without the cloak he didnt really look like a bodyguard he looked like what he was and that was nothing that any of hermans descendants thought should be here tonight the only walking dead they wanted to see tonight was herman himself id told them the vampire stayed they could like it or lump it i also reminded them that i was not obligated to return their down payment if they changed their minds about raising edwin herman from the grave i was here ready to fulfill my part of the bargain when you start needing more than a hundred years worth of zombie raised its sort of a sellers market and i was the seller there were two other animators in the united states that could do it one in california and one in new orleans but they werent here and i was besides they were nearly as expensive as i was and they also came with the cost of plane fare and hotels more money so the lawyers got them to shut up though there was an elderly woman on the side of the family that had inherited the money that wanted to leave if the demon stayed demon if she thought requiem was a demon shed never seen one for real i had and i knew the difference but the lawyers had settled them down and one of the granddaughters had settled the grandmother down and now they were waiting in the dark for me to do my job i had the chickens in their crate and my gym bag with the machete and other paraphernalia but before anything else i had to drop my shields enough to do this id learned how to shield really shield so that i could fight off the urge to use my gift id learned long ago to control it enough so i didnt raise the dead by accident thered been a professor in college that committed suicide hed come to my dorm room one night he wanted to tell his wife he was sorry that was back when i wasnt raising anything just shut it down ignored it im too damn gifted to ignore it psychic ability will come out one way or another if the power is big enough itll find a way and you probably wont like what it will find i dropped my shields not all of them but enough enough so i could open that part of me that raised the dead it was like a fist that stayed clenched and tight and only when i relaxed spread wide those metaphysical fingers could i be free i knew people that had studied with animators or voodoo practitioners to acquire the skills needed to raise the dead id studied to learn hownot to raise the dead but it took a little effort all the time to keep that fist closed that power shut down it was like a piece of me never completely relaxed not even when i slept unless i was here with the true dead here to call one of them from the grave it was the only moment that all of me could be free i stood there for a minute with my power spilling cool and seeking like a wind except that this wind didnt move your hair it only crept along your skin it was like id been holding my breath tight so tight and finally i could let it out let it all out and relax once id stopped being afraid of it it felt so good to be with the dead peaceful so peaceful because whatever was left in the grave had nothing to do with souls or pain quiet as the grave wasnt just a saying but id forgotten that there were dead near at hand that werent underground my power touched requiem it should have ignored him but it didnt that cool notwind curled around him like the arms of some longlost lover id never felt anything quite like it for the first time i truly understood that my power was over the dead all the dead and that undead is still dead id always thought and been told that vampires killed necromancers for fear that they would be controlled by them but in that second i knew that wasnt the whole truth it was as if a door opened inside me to a room that i hadnt known existed inside that metaphysical room stood something it had no shape that my eye could see no weight nothing to touch nothing to hold but it was there and it was real and it was me mine sort of a power plateau byron and requiem had called it but that wasnt it plateau is static not growing not changing this wasnt static it blew out toward me and if it had been a real room in a real house the house would have exploded outward with the force of its coming it would have roared outward in a blizzard of wood and glass and metal and there would have been nothing standing in that metaphysical yard except ground zero of some mysterious blast it was inside me so it couldnt slam into me that was silly but thats still what it did it slammed into me and for a second i was blind deaf weightless nothingness there was nothing but the rawness of that power i came to with grahams voice anita anita can you hear me anita i felt him holding me knew we were on top of the grave i could feel the grave could feel edwin alonzo herman lying underneath me all i had to do was call his name somethings wrong requiem no he said and that one word was enough i opened my eyes and saw the vampire standing over me shes awake graham said and he tried to cradle me into a sitting position but i lifted my hand up toward requiem the vampire reached down for me and i reached for him graham helped by pushing me upright but he wasnt there for me in that moment my business was with the dead and graham was too warm for me the blood i wanted was slow and thick and holding its hand out to me requiems fingers brushed mine and the power inside me steadied as if the world had been trembling and now it was still i touched his hand in that sudden stillness and there was no pulse in his palm no beat of blood to distract the senses he blinked at me his lips moved but he did not breathe he was still he was dead he was mine he pulled me to my feet and we stood on the foot of the grave hand in hand i looked up into that face met the turquoise flame of his eyes but it wasnt me that was pulled into his gaze it was he that fell into mine and i knew because i had a glimpse from his mind to mine that my eyes were solid pools of black with stars glittering in them it was the way my eyes had looked when obsidian butterfly a vampire that thought she was an aztec goddess had shown me some of her power she was powerful enough that no one argued with her about whether or not she was deity some things arent worth the fight id used the power id learned from her only twice and both times my eyes had filled with stars the night was suddenly less dark i could see details colors things that my own eyes could never have seen requiems shirt was so green it seemed to burn like his eyes it was a kind of hyperfocus and it wasnt just sight his hand in mine felt heavier than it should have more important than it should have as if i could feel each whorl of his fingertip like tiny silken lines against my hand to make love like this would either be the most wondrous experience of your life or drive you mad i remembered this power but it wasnt what i needed i had another flash from requiems mind a tiny flash of fear quieted almost immediately because i was touching him and i didnt want him to be afraid the stars in my eyes drowned in a rush of flame black flame with a center of brown as if wood were the flame and fire what it ate my eyes were for a moment what theyd be if id been a vampire they filled with dark dark brown light so dark it was almost black i turned those glowing eyes toward the grave and graham saw them oh god he whispered get off the grave graham i said and my voice was mine almost he just knelt on the ground and stared up at me move graham i said you wont want to be there when im finished he scrambled to his feet and moved until i told him good enough he stayed close eyes wide fear like a scent off of his skin but he didnt run and he didnt try to distance himself brave boy i knelt on the hard ground and drew requiem down with me so that he knelt behind me with his hands on my shoulders he was like some huge solid wall of quiet strength behind me id known that i amplified jeanclaudes powers when i was near him but id never felt anything like what was happening now it wasnt a triumvirate of power between requiem and me it was that he was one of jeanclaudes vampires and that made him mine in a way mine to call on mine to use mine to reward i bent until my hands touched the ground until i could feel the dead just below me it was as if the ground were water and i knew there was someone drowning just below me and all i had to do was reach down and save them i whispered edwin alonzo herman hear me i felt him stir like a sleeper disturbed by a dream edwin alonzo herman i call you from your grave i felt his bones grow long and straight felt his flesh coalesce around him it was like restuffing a broken doll he remade himself and it was so easy too easy the power began to spread outward began to seek another grave but some small part of me that was still me knew better it wouldnt be just one more grave i knew in that instant that i could raise this cemetery that i could raise them all no blood sacrifice no chickens no goats nothing but the power blowing through me and the vampire at my back because the power wanted to be used it wanted to help me help me caress them all from their graves pull them to the light of stars and fill them with life it would feel so good to lift them all up so good i shook my head and fought that helpful power fought not to spread like a sweet sickness through the graves fought to hold on to what was left of who id thought i was i needed help i thought about jeanclaude but that wasnt it i needed to remember that i wasnt just the dead i was alive i reached out to the other third of our triumvirate i reached out to richard he looked up at me as if i hovered in the air above his familys dining room table i saw his father like an older clone of richard himself and most of his brothers sitting at the table passing a blue bowl charlotte his mother came in from the kitchens swinging door just behind that chair she was still about my size with honeyblond hair and a figure that was both petite and fullfigured except for the hair color and skin tone charlotte even reminded me of me there was a reason that most of the zeeman brothers had chosen small tough women i watched her bring in a big platter smiling chatting with her family i couldnt hear what she was saying or any noise from the crowded smiling family scene they all seemed so happy so perfect i didnt want to bring this here i started to pull away and richards voice was in my head wait wait anita please he excused himself from the table and walked through the big living room out onto the sweep of porch and down the handful of steps until he could gaze up into the same sky that rode above me by the time he gazed up into the air gazed at me he seemed to have sensed some of what was happening because he said dear god anita whats happened ive felt your power before but not like this i didnt have enough control to talk in my head so requiem was going to get the out loud version but i was past caring the vampires keep saying that weve hit a new power level he hugged his bare arms in the tshirt he hadnt stopped for a jacket its like the night is breathing your power what can i do remind me that im not dead remind me that my ties are with things that have a heartbeat how will that help i wanted to scream my frustration at him god richard just help me please help if you dont im afraid of what ill raise in this cemetery tonight he nodded im sorry im sorry for so much anita he looked down and i knew the gesture he was thinking or gathering his will for something usually something he didnt want to do but i didnt have time to worry about richards hangups tonight i was too scared of the power that pulsed in the ground underneath me a cold pulsing but it promised to spread to all the graves i knew that tonight i could raise one of those shambling zombie armies that the movies are so fond of portraying and usually has nothing to do with real necromancy he looked back at the house and said im fine mom i just need a little privacy keep everybody close to the house okay he shook his head no mom its not that close to the full moon he walked out into the openness of the yard away from the lights of the house and he let down his shieldsthe metaphysical walls that kept his beast caged and helped him pass for human the night was suddenly alive in a way that it hadnt been the still air held a thousand scents the ripeness of apples from the orchard behind the house grass like a thick green blanket against our face trees the spicy tang of sweet gum the softer scent of birch the sweet pungent wood of poplar and over it all the dry richness of fallen leaves all around us sounds then the last crickets of the year chirping their plaintive song other insects from the woods singing their last songs before the cold came the wind raised and the trees creaked and groaned around the house the big oak by the driveway threw its branches against the stars and richard raised his head to watch that wild wind there was barely a breeze on the ground but up high in the highest trees the wind ran fast and pulled at the bare limbs at the very top of the trees most people dont look up animals look up because they know that there is no true safety they dont worry about it the way we do but theyre aware of it in a way that we arent richard walked into the edge of trees that began the woods that bordered the western edge of the family land he touched a trunk laid his hands on it and it was rough and hard with deep grooves in the bark like tiny tunnels he laid his face against that roughness and it was spicy and pungent and i knew it was sweet gum he gazed up into the bare branches where the tiny rough balls still hung on to the edges of the tree he hugged the tree hugged it so tight that the bark dug into his skin he rubbed his cheek against the roughness of it like he was scent marking then he was off he was running at an easy lope through the trees into the woods he wasnt hunting he was running for the joy of it he twisted through the underbrush like it wasnt there and as id felt only once before it was as if the trees and bushes welcomed him or turned aside for him or as if green growth could be water and he dived through it running dodging twisting giving himself to the brush of twigs and branches and the feel of the living ground underfoot there was life that didnt run or hide it was all alive alive in a way that most humans never understand richard ran and he took me with him as he had one night long ago then hed held my hand and id struggled to keep up to understand now it was effortless because i was inside his head inside him the night was alive for him in a way that it wasnt for jeanclaude or for me i was too human and jeanclaudes interest in life was too shallow neither of us could feel what richards beast ould give him something touched my hand and i was jerked back to the grave requiem was still at my back dead still but graham was on the grave he looked uncertain but he was sniffing the air near my skin you smell like trees and pack he said softly richard looked up at us why is graham there bodyguard jeanclaude was afraid of what would happen if i didnt have someone with me tell him hes supposed to guard you and he cant do that on the grave youre supposed to guard me graham you cant do that from here the sharp scent of wolf thickened around me as i said it graham reacted to it like hed been struck he cringed to the ground doing the wolf grovel im sorry you just smelled so good i forgot myself stop groveling and get back to work richard said it first and i echoed it for him graham did what he was told he went back to very serious bodyguard mode looking out into the dark for whatever might come richard took in a deep breath and i smelled that thick sweet scent of deep woods hed run miles effortlessly not for the same reason that a human will run well but because the land itself helped him run gave him strength welcomed him he stood there in the middle of the woods his feet anchored into the ground i realized that richard was my ground my center his joy his heart pumping in his chest from that joyous run i kept my tie to him open and full of scents and sounds and things faraway from here i put my hands on the grave and even with requiem at my back touching me it wasnt as real as the pounding of richards heart miles away edwin alonzo herman with will word and flesh i call you from your grave come come now it was all wrong all different from usual but it was right just the same i felt the corpse shift solidify piece itself together like a puzzle and begin to rise up through the earth as if it were water id watched this happen countless times but id never been kneeling on the ground when it happened the earth buckled and rolled like an earthquake that was trapped in a few feet of ground the ground flowed under my hands like it was something else not water not mud but something both less and more solid i dont know what requiem thought was happening but he didnt try to pull away he stayed solid at my back he rode it with me and never made a noise brave vampire hands met mine through the shifting earth cool fingers wrapped around my warmth edwin alonzo hermans hands wrapped around mine like a swimmer whos given up hope and finally touches a rope the grave threw him upward like a flower springing free of the earth but the push of it forced me to pull him upward to find my feet with requiem steadying me if the vampire hadnt been there to hold me standing on the writhing twisting ground i would have fallen but requiem kept me standing and i pulled the dead man from his grave pulled him perfect and whole until he stood taller than me with the grave dirt falling away from a perfect black suit that looked as if it had been freshly pressed his hair was balding with a thick fringe just above the ears and down the collar and thick sideburns that curved to a walrus thick mustache he was portly nearly fat which had been in style among the rich when edwin alonzo died only the poor were skinny only the poor looked starved i felt richard still standing by the edge of that small stream the air was cooler by that musical run and his pulse was beginning to slow from the run the light sweat starting to cool on his skin he wasnt afraid or horrified he simply stood rooted to the ground steadying me with the pulse and beat of his body the thick musk of wolf faint in the autumn air i stared up at the zombie and even to me it looked like damn good work with a big enough blood sacrifice i could raise a zombie that looked alive close at least but this this was perfect his skin looked full and healthy in the starlight he had a faint smile on his face and his clothes looked as if hed just put them on even his shoes were near spotless and gleaming with polish polish so shiny i noticed by moonlight the hands that were pressed to mine were cool but they didnt feel dead he wasnt breathing but he looked felt more alive than dead it was unnerving id known there was a lot of power tonight and id had to force all of it into this one grave so i guess it was alright that he looked this good but for a moment when i looked into that plump smiling face i was afraid afraid that id done more than id been paid for but when i reached his eyes i let out a sigh of relief the eyes were thick and full and looked again perfect grayish in the starlight probably would be blue in the brighter light but there was no one home in those eyes they were empty and waiting i knew what they were waiting for those empty eyes i lifted my left hand away from the zombies and he didnt cling to me his fingers just opened as i moved i held my hand at shoulder level toward the vampire at my back undo my bandage requiem kept one hand on my shoulder but used the other hand to peel back the tape on my wrist take it off i said he finally ripped the bandage away i couldnt stop a small jerk of pain richard called inside my head what are you going to do he needs blood so he can speak i didnt kill an animal this is all the blood ive got he didnt say anything but i felt his pulse begin to pick up speed i offered my wrist upward to the slightly taller body in front of me something slid through those pale eyes something id seen before in the better preserved zombies it was as if something went through them something that paused in their eyes as if there were darker things waiting waiting for a chance for a body to inhabit something not so much evil as just very very not good but that whiskered face turned toward my wrist sniffed the air and the moment it scented the blood that otherness in its eyes vanished driven out by the promise of something that all the dead value a bit of the living the zombie grabbed my arm with both of its hands and smacked its mouth against my wrist like youd grab a kiss from your dearest lover just the impact hurt the wound made me gasp but i knew what was coming because id fed zombies off my own blood before not often but often enough the mouth locked around the wound and his mouth was wide enough to take it all in to set his teeth against the torn edges and grind i made a small sound because i couldnt make no sound usually the zombies mouth felt less real than this one except for how cool the flesh was i couldnt tell the difference between the zombie and a person it was a very good job solid all the way through even in places that only i would feel richard bounded across the stream hitting the edge of it with one foot as if he wasnt quite steady he began to run up the other bank began to run with the night and the trees and the smells edwin alonzo hermans mouth locked around my wrist and began to suck the wound had begun to heal more than id realized because to get to the blood he had to pull hard and tight on my wrist it hurt really hurt yeah i liked teeth in the right situation but this wasnt it and what might feel good during sex just fucking hurts during violence richard was running full out now id thought he was fast before but hed just been playing now he ran he ran so fast that branches slashed at him that the earth didnt give to him and part like water he was running running running from himself i had a bright glimpse inside his head the sensation of teeth in my wrist of that forceful mouth on my wound excited him excited him as both man and beast he could have accepted if it was just about food but it wasnt the mixture of human and animal blurred the differences between food and sex blurred so many lines lines that richard had never known existed let alone wanted to cross he ran and slipped in the leaves and fell and was on his feet and running before his body had time to realize it was down it was only in that moment that i remembered his injured shoulder and the thought got me the memory hed shapeshifted briefly and healed himself so much more powerful than he wanted to be the zombie had fallen to his knees as if sucking at my wrist was the most exquisite thing it had ever tasted it cradled my wrist against its mouth and its tongue explored the wound my breath came out in a harsh word shit are you hurt requiem asked softly i shook my head it hurt but i wasnt hurt there was a difference but usually a zombie starts to slow down about now this one was still sucking hard and fast as if he were a baby that had been starved of course id never raised anyone this long dead without an animal sacrifice maybe that was the difference i hoped so because anything else would mean that something had gone wrong really wrong he shook his mouth like a dog with a bone and i swallowed a scream it wasnt just that it hurt that was way too much enthusiasm for a zombie edwin stop feeding my voice was clear and he ignored me shit i licked suddenly dry lips hes had enough help me pry him loose i said voice low mustnt scare the clients mustnt let them know that everything had gone wrong tonight richard fell again slid in the damp autumn leaves slid until a tree stopped him sudden and abrupt and bruising he looked up and i saw those wide brown eyes saw what he was running from he wanted to be there on his knees he wanted to lick my wound taste my blood maybe widen that wound with sharp teeth the thought didnt just excite him the thought did it for him just flat did it for him what he wanted to do in the deepest darkest places in his soul gave a whole new meaning to oral sex he waited for me to be horrified but i wasnt if there was anyone who could resist doing the great bad thing it was richard i trusted his control not always his temper but his controlthat i trusted without doubt or reservation i whispered just because you want to do something doesnt mean you will do it or even that you have to do it youre human richard you have a mind and willpower you arent just your beast you dont understand he said and the moment he said it i knew what hed done by accident you can feel what the zombie is doing i said he hid his face from me and scrambled to his feet and ran he ran out of the trees and hit a paved road and was across it before the headlights could be sure what theyd seen fast faster run run run but what he was running from he couldnt outrun because no matter how fast or how far he would still be there how do you outrun the monster when you are the monster richard make the zombie stop feeding on me i dont know how and he was gone crashing through the trees but it wasnt friendly now or joyous the zombie bit me hard and damn it it hurt requiem get him off of me the vampire moved around so he could touch the zombies face and hands but nothing holds on like a zombie id had to help clean up other peoples zombies that had gone wrong and sometimes you had to cut them apart a finger at a time to get them to let go of someone human teeth could still bite deep enough to sever a vein or artery i wanted him off of me requiem tried to pry him off but he finally looked up at me i can pull him apart in pieces but i cannot pull him off of you i looked at the very bodyguarding werewolf and called him over he came face serious hands behind his back as if he didnt exactly trust himself not to touch me again did i smell of wolf and forest or was it the fresh blood dont ask unless you want to know i didnt want to know the zombie plunged his tongue into the wound as if he were trying to get the blood to flow faster it hurt and it surprised me and i screamed a little scream but enough that one of the lawyers called are you alright ms blake fine i called back fine mustnt let the clients know that the zombie you raised for them is beginning to eat you fuck using every ounce of strength he had graham was able to pry one finger off of my wrist but he had to hold on to that finger or it curled right back into place he shouldnt be this strong youve never tried to fight zombies have you i said he gave me wide eyes if theyre this strong i dont want to theyre not just strong they dont feel pain anita i can tear his fingers off requiem said or break his jaw but other than those extremities i have no other suggestions the bad part was neither did i the zombie bit me harder and i knew it was only a matter of time before he hit something major he was digging his teeth in deeper by the tiniest of increments but eventually it was going to get bad and i was no longer sure what would happen if a gush of fresh blood hit its mouth id seen what flesheating zombies could do to people i wasnt exactly human but i wouldnt grow back a hand if you ripped it off we could burn him up but he wouldnt let go and id burn with him shit richard was sitting in a clearing under a tangle of naked limbs i have to shut the link between us anita i have to i cant separate myself from the zombie i keep feeling what hes doing keep wanting him to find more blood he cradled his face in his hands and hed lost his shirt somewhere so that his back was bowed and naked as the trees overhead im sorry anita i tried i really tried its okay richard well do what we can from here go take care of yourself he looked up and there were tears shining in the starlight im supposed to take care of you its a partnership richard were supposed to take turns helping each other he shook his head i fucked this up anita im sorry i wasnt sure id ever heard him say fuck when he wasnt referring to sex go richard go back to your folks house theyll be worried the zombie bit hard enough that i screamed and richard was suddenly gone he cut the tie so abruptly that it staggered me and only requiems and grahams hands kept me from falling anita graham said and he lost his grip on the zombie trying to keep me standing but the hands on my wrists eased i looked down at the kneeling zombie and the eyes were filling up there was personality there someone home id been stupid richard had accidentally tied the zombie to him and when he broke the link to me the zombie was mine again good news but i felt stupid that i hadnt thought of it sooner the dead are supposed to be my specialty i wasnt feeling very special tonight the zombie blinked up at me drawing its mouth back from my wrist his big mustache was stained with my blood he frowned up at me im sorry i dont know what im doing here he let me go and stumbled to his feet staring at his hands and my bloody wrist horror showing on his face i beg your pardon miss i dont know what i was doing to you i do apologize most sincerely its monstrous monstrous he was staring at the blood on his hands and wiping at his mouth shit he didnt know he was dead i hated when they didnt know they were dead and as if on cue he backed up enough to bump into his own monument he gazed up at that uncompromising stone angel and then he had the ebenezer scrooge moment he saw his own name on the tomb complete with a date even by starlight all the color drained from his face hear me edwin by right of the blood you have tasted hear me he turned huge stricken eyes to me where am i whats happened to me dont be afraid edwin be calm the panic began to slide away from his face his eyes began to fill with that artificial calm because i willed it and because id been the one to call him from the grave and it was my blood on his lips id earned the right to order him around i told him to be calm i told him to be clear and concise and answer the questions from the nice lawyers he informed me that he was always clear and concise thank you very much and i knew hed do what the lawyers and his descendants wanted him to do this group of lawyers and clients had decided ahead of time that they didnt want me asking the questions something about not trusting that i couldnt control the zombie enough to get the answers that certain people wanted the implication had been that some of the clients feared that other clients would bribe me at the time theyd set the guidelines down id been a little offended tonight i was glad it meant that i could go back to the jeep while they questioned the zombie i had a first aid kit in the jeep and i needed it the zombie hadnt exactly reopened the wound hed made the old wound bloodier and put new teeth marks into my wrist so it was like a new wound around the old one some nights it feels like i have a target on my left arm if i take a major hit thats usually where it lands youve lost more blood requiem said no shit i said he gave a small frown what i am saying is could you not allow them to take the zombie home for the night and put him back tomorrow i shook my head and winced as graham raised the gauze to see if the bleeding had stopped he bit me he actually injured me zombies arent supposed to do that they take blood from an open wound or animal thats already dead but they dont make a wound they dont feed that actively this one sure as hell did graham said frowning at my wrist and putting pressure and a fresh gauze pad back on it exactly so much is going wrong tonight or not working exactly like its supposed to that i cant risk letting it have that much time i have to put it back tonight as soon as possible why requiem asked just in case i said in case what graham asked this time in case it becomes a flesh eater they both looked at me like youve got to be kidding i thought that was like legend graham said i have seen such things requiem said long long ago i thought that the power to do such he seemed to think what word to use and settled for things was lost evil you were going to say power to do suchevil was lost he gave me a faint smile my apologies he said thats alright nobody likes necromancers christian wiccan vampires whatever nobody likes us it is not that we do not like you requiem said no i said its that everybodys afraid of us yes the vampire said softly i sighed tonight for the first time i felt that i could have raised this entire cemetery without a sacrifice of any kind i could have raised them and they would have been mine totally mine i contacted richard because i was fighting the urge to raise my own personal army of the dead contacting your ulfric went very wrong from what i understood from your side of the conversation requiem said graham said he tried to help yeah he did but just as jeanclaude and i are gaining powers so is richard neither of us expected him to be able to link up with the zombie i have never heard of such a thing requiem said were a ufuckingnique bunch here in st louis i said unique requiem said as he and graham began to bandage my arm well that is one way of putting it how about scary i said he looked at me with those blue blue eyes with their hint of green from the shirt near his face oh yes he said oh yes scary will do yeah scary would do i canceled the rest of the clients for the night it had been too close for comfort i would put this zombie back but that was it until i figured out what the hell was going on bert would be pissed the clients would be pissed but not half so pissed as theyd be if i raised a shambling army of the dead and terrorized the city no that would be more bad press than even bert could figure out how to cure besides id finally lost enough blood that i wasnt feeling well it wasnt metaphysics it was just physical i was lightheaded vaguely nauseous cold even with the leather jacket and a blanket from the back of my jeep id lost enough blood over the years to know the signs i didnt need like a transfusion or anything but i didnt need to lose anymore blood tonight either in fact id have graham drive us back to the club pick up nathaniel and beg off on any big sexy scene tonight sex called on account of blood loss surely hed accept that as a good enough excuse we were all huddled in the backseat of the jeep me because i felt like shit graham and requiem because i couldnt get warm on my own a blanket the leather jacket and i was still shivering my lady may i make a bold suggestion requiem asked it took me two tries to stop my teeth from chattering long enough to say sure if we do not get you warm you will be fit for nothing tonight just say it stopi shook so hard it almost hurt when the shuddering passedstop talking me to death requiem graham under the blanket would double your body heat he said it very crisp no wasted words it was nice to know he could be concise when he needed to be if i could have stopped my teeth from chattering i might have argued but i couldnt so i didnt besides a little fully clothed cuddling under a blanket seemed pretty tame after what had happened earlier tonight what could it hurt oh hell dont answer that graham was still in his serious bodyguard mode so he eased under the blanket as if id bite i cant really be security while trapped under a blanket in the backseat he said it took me three tries to say you carrying you mean a gun yeah no if im the only one armed then you aint my security he looked like hed argue and requiem said there are many ways to guard someones body graham if we do not help her warm herself then i fear we will be going to the emergency room with her would you like to explain to jeanclaude how you let that happen when you could have prevented it with such a small action on your part no graham said and eased himself in around my right side it was as if he were a totally different person from the one that got that taste of orgasm from me earlier he seemed stiff and uncomfortable he slid his arm across my shoulders tentatively awkwardly she will not break graham requiem said ive forgotten my job twice tonight i dont want to do it a third time i snuggled in against the warmth of his body burrowing under his leather jacket to find where the heat was trapped between his own body and the leather he was so warm so incredibly warm god she fits under my arm that arm curled around me almost reflexively as if he just couldnt help himself she seems so much bigger when shes moving around or talking or doing anything his voice sounded puzzled and soft his arm wrapped around me tucking me close in against the line of his body and he was right i did fit he was around six feet and i so wasnt he could have cradled me like a child and i hated that but he was so warm so warm his body felt almost hot we were about a week away from full moon and some lycanthropes body temperature went up before the change almost like a fever either i was colder than i thought or graham was one of the wereanimals that ran hot my teeth stopped chattering and it was as if my muscles began to unclench i still had small involuntary spasms but it was better can i pick you up graham asked and he sounded like he expected me to say no i said why youll be warmer he said i thought about it he was probably right but it would reinforce that i was tiny enough to sit in his lap and cuddle against his chest like a child i really hated doing shit like that but he was probably right it would be warmer damn it yes i said and even to me it didnt sound happy are you sure the lady has spoken graham do not make her repeat herself requiem said graham hesitated for a second then he scooped me up in his arms like i weighed nothing he sat me on his lap and i found another downside to the thong he must have been wearing new jeans because they werent soft i was so not wearing enough underwear or enough skirt but id dressed mostly for meeting jeanclaude and asher later in the evening id been thinking date not medical emergencies silly me he was able to curl most of me underneath his jacket against his chest the rest of me curled into a small ball in his lap with just a little leg off to one side he put one of his arms across that spill of leg and the other arm held the jacket tight around me requiem helped us get the blanket draped around us and the only thing uncovered was the top of my head it was dark and warm and i laid my head against his chest and the tshirt was a thin barrier between me and the heat of his skin i let my body ease into the warmth of his skin and the scent of leather and just him i realized why his scent seemed so comfortable to me he smelled like pack that faint scent that all of richards wolves had i was too friendly with too many of them not to equate that faint ruffling musk with safety i let myself sink into a warm nest of leather and blanket and body and shared warmth and the distant smell of wolf and i slept the next thing i was aware of was grahams voice very soft as if he didnt really want to wake me anita anita theyre done with the zombie for a second i couldnt remember where i was or who was talking to me fresh from sleep to me his body felt more like richards than anyone elses the size and the musculature and the faint scent of musk was all richard but the voice didnt match anita you are wanted by the graveside requiems british accent the last of sleep and whatever wolfscented dreams id had slipped away and i knew where i was and whose lap id fallen asleep in graham stroked my hair and said softly anita are you awake i sat up pushing his arm his jacket off of me but we were tangled in the blanket i pushed at the soft gray material but it was caught at the edges wedged under his body i could punch at it but icouldnt get free of it i had one of those moments of claustrophobia that make no sense i wasnt actually trapped but there was something about being close to trapped with two people that i knew so little about if it had been anyone on my list of people that i trusted implicitly it wouldnt have happened but i didnt know graham not really and id fallen asleep in his arms id fallen asleep with only him and requiem to watch over me careless terribly careless maybe it was some remnant of an unremembered dream or maybe there is no excuse but whatever i lost it i panicked if id been thinking clearly i could have gotten out of a stupid blanket but iwasnt thinking anymore my head was screaming trapped trapped were trapped graham grabbed my arms and i shoved an elbow back into him as hard as i could he let go and made a satisfyinghummph sound shit youll crack a rib doing that dont grab me okay just dont grab me my voice was breathy but i was a touch calmer calm enough not to fight the stupid blanket calm enough not to struggle so that graham thought something was wrong with me my pulse was still wild in my throat like id choke on it but i could think again requiem was there on his knees looming over both of us the panic flared through me in a cold wash that left my fingertips tingling with static but i fought it off this time i tried to relax as he pulled at the edge of the blanket and started to ease us free im sorry i said i think i had a bad dream no shit graham said and he sounded slightly offended id apologized once he wasnt getting it twice truth was id gotten claustrophobic from two things a diving accident years ago and waking up in a vampires coffin waking up in the tight darkness with a dead body wrapped around you the stuff of nightmares there was a look on requiems face that was eloquent he knew i was lying and i didnt care i made it policy not to parade my phobias in front of people never let people see what really scares you they may use it against you later when he pulled enough blanket i scrambled out and was damn rude getting out of the jeep but i felt better as soon as i hit the open air i took in deep breaths of the cool night air about the time i got myself calmer my lower body started to be cold shit youre shivering again requiem said from right behind me i jumped because i hadnt heard him slide out of the car im alright no you are not i frowned at him graham slid out of the backseat hes right i frowned at them both it doesnt matter how i feel ive got a job to do yes you have a job to do but how you feel still matters requiem said i opened the front door and got my gym bag out of the seat i didnt leave it graveside because of the machete the machete might only be magical in my hand or in another animators hand but it was still a damn long blade and i didnt trust civilians around it i shut the door hit the beeper to lock it and started walking back to the grave with the bag in hand id gone about four feet into the grass when i tripped and nearly fell requiems hand was at my elbow you are not well i stood there and let him steady me i dont know whats wrong with me usually raising the dead makes me feel good better tonight did not go as planned i shook my head no it didnt part of that was my fault no he said yes i said i got distracted by all that new power and forgot to put up a protective circle it keeps the zombie in but it also keeps other things out a lot of metaphysical shit likes to mess with bodies if they get the chance i knew better you were distracted yeah can i carry the bag for you graham asked though i noticed he was staying just out of reach i wondered how hard id hit him in the ribs i hadnt hurt him but i was more than human strong now and i could have hurt him yeah thanks i said he took the bag and then stood to one side and let requiem and me go first the vampire kept his hand on my elbow and i let him i was getting cold again ive lost more blood than this before and not felt this bad i said softly one group of cars had left the cemetery the group that had brought the suit the lawyers from the winning side were at graveside and there was a cheerful murmur of voices as the descendants got to talk to their patriarch he had a big booming laugh have you fed tonight requiem asked his voice brought me back to the dark and how far we still had to walk it seemed like a long way but it wasnt that far it just wasnt yeah i had dinner he shook his head that is not what i meant i thought about it for a second or two then said you mean like theardeur yes yeah i fed off of you and byron no he said you were feeding for jeanclaude he got that energy i guess so but if theardeur needs feeding it just flares up and i have to feed i put my hand on his arm because my legs were feeling wobbly perhaps you have gained more control over it what does that mean it means you can go without feeding it until you choose to feed it i stopped walking and looked up at him what you have many of the symptoms of a vampire that has not fed enough the blood lust rules us at first but once we are masters then we can go without feeding if we must we can choose to feed but i feel like shit the choice comes with a price he said im confused i said i think it took a great deal more energy from you than it should have to raise this zombie and fight what the ulfric did by accident i think it took energy to defeat primo to feed on byron and myself i think that took not just physical energy but mental as well you are not a creature of casual lusts and i think it cost you more than you will admit to feed your master tonight i would have argued the master part but it was becoming a case of the lady protesting too much so what do i do you need to feed he said simply i gave him a look he smiled and raised a hand as if to prove he was innocent it does not have to be me or even graham it does not have to be this moment but it must be soon anita surely you feel that i just stood there and stared at him id wished for control of theardeur for so long and now i had it sort of i didnt have to feed unless i wanted to but if i waited too long id get sick i shook my head i thought control of theardeur meant you could just skip it and not feed it at all who told you that i started to say jeanclaude then stopped what had he said about theardeur that id gain control of it that id learn how to feed from a distance had he ever promised that it would go away no he hadnt id just wantedcontrol to mean it would be gone no one had promised that no one shit no one i said i just heard it that way i wanted theardeur to be gone i wanted it to go away so i just kept thinking thats what it would mean i am sorry to be the one to tell you that it is not so i looked at his face studied it you sound like you know what youre talking about i do not carry theardeur to hold the completeardeur as our dark mistress does is very rare even among her own bloodline then how do you know that thats whats happening to me logic he said and just because i do not carry it does not mean i have not seen one who did who ligeia he turned away as he said the name so i couldnt see his face i dont know the name at least not as a vamp it does not matter for she is dead i touched his face what happened i asked he looked at me but his face held that distance that the old ones have when they dont want you to know what theyre thinking belle morte killed her why do i feel like i should say im sorry for asking he gave me the smallest of smiles because you are not insensitive that one comment let me know that ligeias death meant a lot more to him than just another cruel death shed meant something to him and it was none of my business the customers are getting restless graham called back to us he was standing a little ahead of us with my bag in his hands hed given us privacy like a good bodyguard i looked past him and saw one of the lawyers waving at us restless indeed even if i was willing i dont think theyd wait while we went back to the car to feed theardeur he gave me a real smile this time with enough humor to drive out the blankness in his eyes i fear you are right then we muscle through this and you guys can drive me back to the club where yourpomme de sang waits he said yeah i wondered if i was going to get back in time to see any of nathaniels dance i suddenly saw nathaniel in front of a mirror he was putting eyeliner around his lavender eyes he stopped in the middle of it and said anitaa question like he wasnt sure requiem had both my arms now id have gone to my knees if he hadnt caught me anita what happened i thought about mypomme de sang and i could see him hes getting ready to go on i was dizzy and when requiem cradled me against him i didnt complain ive had mindtomind communication with richard and jeanclaude its never been this draining requiem picked me up and again i was wishing id worn a longer skirt god knew what he was flashing the graveside with but i couldnt stand the world was swimming jeanclaude is the master of your triumvirate with the ulfric but you are the master of nathaniel and damian it is your power that makes this partnership move and that too uses energy does everyone know what happened between the three of us no he told only asher and myself among his vampires perhaps his ownpomme de sang jason he keeps little from him i frowned at him as the world stopped spinning why you i am his third after asher news to me though of the vamps id met i couldnt think of anyone id have preferred for the job the night was solid again i think i can walk he looked doubtful let me try i said he lowered me to the ground but kept an arm around me like he expected me to collapse at any minute i guess i couldnt blame him but it bugged me anyway i didnt collapse great in fact i felt pretty good considering i kept a hand through his arm so it looked like he was escorting me the last little bit of the way only he and i and maybe graham knew just how shaky i was feeling edwin alonzo herman was regaling his audience with a story of how hed tricked someone into signing away a small fortune in these modern times it would have been considered swindling but not back in the late s or even early s many of the laws on the books about money and how you can legally acquire it stem from the old robber baron days when almost anything was fair game most of the ways that the first millionaires in this country won their fortunes would be illegal today but herman had them laughing he looked positively rosycheeked and very much the center of attention of the group of lawyers and descendants everyone was willing to be happy theyd won and the man telling the story had helped them win if someone had saved me millions of dollars id like them too i guess he finished his story to laughter and shining faces im ready to complete the contract gentleman and ladies i said some of them had to shake my hand splendid job ms blake splendid job wow i mean like wow honestly i wouldnt have believed it if i hadnt seen you do it apparently i was included in the good feelings most people get a little uncomfortable when its time to put the zombie back if he looks alive enough requiem stopped the compliments ms blake has had a difficult night gentlemen if you could allow her to finish her work then she can rest oh terribly sorry we didnt know thank you worth every penny and they began to drift away edwin alonzo herman looked down at me and it wasnt a friendly look i understand that i am supposed to be dead and only your magic gave me life again i shrugged and asked graham to please get the machete and the salt from the bag ive also been told that vampires have rights and are considered citizens am i not merely another kind of vampire if i were declared alive i would be a very very wealthy man i would be willing to share that wealth miss blake i clung to requiems arm and looked up at the zombie so selfassured you know mr herman youre one of the few old ones that ive ever raised that have grasped the possibilities so quickly you must have been something special in your day thank you for the compliment and may i return one this must be a unique gift that you have together we could turn it into an empire i smiled i have a business manager but thanks anyway i let go of requiem and found i could stand without falling good to know i was actually feeling a little better just standing on the grave by the zombie because no matter how good he looked thats what he was i took the jar of salt from grahams hand miss blake if i am only another type of walking dead then is it fair to deny me the same chance that this vampire has gotten youre not a vampire i said and how great could the difference be between what i am and what he is i did something that marianne had tried to teach me and i just had been too stubborn to try before i wasnt sure i had enough energy left to walk the circle so i just pictured it in my mind like a glowing circle around the grave around the great stone angel around all of us it closed with the same neckruffling power rush that it did when i walked it with steel and blood good very good you want a difference try and walk away from the grave he frowned at me i dont understand just walk to the road where you answered their questions i dont see what it will prove it will prove the difference between what you are and what he is herman frowned at me then took a deep settling breath and strode off of his grave toward the road he hesitated then slowed then stopped i seem unable to move forward i dont know why i just simply dont seem able to go farther he turned back to me why why can i not go where i just stood requiem walk outside the circle he looked at me then he walked past the man he hesitated for a moment and i worried that id done too good a job on the circle but it should have only kept in the zombie and out other things the vampire shouldnt have been affected by it requiem pushed through and the circle flared it did recognize him as a type of undead but not the one tied to this grave i realized that with a little tweaking i might be able to throw up a circle that bound a vampire to its grave or coffin or a room it couldnt be kept up forever but for awhile i filed it away it would be a sort of desperation measure but id been desperate before herman pushed against the circle or rather pushed against his own unwillingness to cross it requiem glided back through it and out again and in again enough i said i think weve made the point why can i not cross this point and he can because this is your grave mr herman your body knows this ground and it knows you it holds you to it now that ive made it do so now come back and stand on the grave like a nice zombie i am not a zombie i said stand on the grave he took a step toward me before he stopped and fought me he fought his body as hed fought to cross the circle now he fought not to come to me id never had one that could fight me when i gave it a direct order especially not one that had tasted my blood i watched that wellmade body that soalive person struggle not to move closer i threw power into the next command edwin alonzo herman come and stand on your grave now he walked toward me slowly jerkily like a badly made robot he had to come now but he was still fighting me he should not have been able to do that even when he stood on the grave facing us his body jerked and spasmed because still he fought my control i had the jar of salt open i handed it to requiem just hold it graham handed me the machete and suddenly the zombies eyes went wide what are you going to do with that great knife he sounded uncertain not afraid he was made of tougher stuff than that its not for you i said id already pushed the sleeves of the leather jacket up above my wrists now i started to lay the machete tip against my arm but requiems hand was suddenly wrapped around the hand holding the machete what are you doing he asked i need blood to bind him to his grave id rather do a smaller fresh wound than reopen my left wrist his hand stayed around my wrist you do not need to lose more blood tonight anita i need blood to finish this i said does it have to be yours he asked normally its animal blood but im not going to slaughter a chicken just to lay a zombie the chickens have survived this far if i spill a little more blood they can make it through the night would my blood do he asked i frowned at him youre seriously not going to let me do this without an argument are you no he said i sighed and relaxed my arm just a little to save muscle cramp he kept his grip on the arm with the machete ive used vampire blood by accident but it went a little odd i dont need more odd tonight requiem will his do he pointed at graham will my what do graham asked your blood requiem said as if it was an everyday request how much blood graham asked as if it wasnt the first time hed been asked just enough to touch the face sprinkle or smear okay graham said i agree that you dont need to lose more blood tonight if mine will do then okay where will you make the cut lower arm but above the wrist less risk of hitting something thatll bleed too freely also a wound in the wrist hurts more because of all the movement that goes through it he stripped out of his jacket and tossed it on the ground behind him i looked up into his face searched it for some sign that he felt used or abused i didnt see that he looked like he said he was okay with it the look on your face he said really its okay its not like i dont donate blood on a regular basis your neck and arms are clean i said no bite marks there are other places to donate from anita you should know that i blushed which was bad since i didnt have enough blood to spare there were other places to donate from most of them intimate you someonespomme de sang i asked no not yet what does not yet mean it means that some of my brethren are hesitant to commit themselves to a single wolf when your ulfric has suddenly decided to share such bounty requiem said he asked for volunteers i said oh im willing graham said i just dont like going around advertising the fact besides he said and he put his hands on his hips palms flat it is a wild he smoothed his hands down his jeans ride until his hands touched either side of his groin when they feed and his hands formed a frame of fingers and thumbs around the bulge in his pants down low my gaze had followed his hands the whole way like i was mesmerized i think i was just tired i blinked and tried to concentrate on what we needed to do i was not going to feel well until id fed but i also wasnt feeding on anyone standing here nathaniel was waiting back at the club and so was jeanclaude i had people who were willing now that i could say no to theardeur until i chose i didnt have to depend on the kindness of strangers fine hold out an arm id recommend it be your nondominant arm i had the machete in my hand id made small cuts in the arms of other animators when we shared power so we could raise a bigger or older zombie i choked up my hold on the hilt and held out my other hand for his arm he tried to give me his hand and i had to say no ill hold your wrist to help steady us both have it your way he said and he let me grip his wrist in my left hand normally this was quick but my hands were shaking tonight its not good to be cutting on people when your hands are shaking i blew out all the breath in my body as if i were aiming down the barrel of a gun and pressed the edge of the tip against his arm i had to take a breath and did the downstroke as i breathed out i was slower than i would have been if id felt steadier i was working on not going too deep rather than not causing pain he hissed shit under his breath blood welled out almost black in the starlight not a lot of blood just a trickle along the edge of the cut the blood began to glide out of the wound and i rubbed my fingers through it i turned with my fingers stained with grahams blood turned to the zombie still waiting on the grave dont touch me with that he said and he recoiled away from me stand still very still i said and he froze in place unable to move or back away only his eyes showed wide and frightened i had to stand on tiptoe to touch his face and requiem was at my arm as i wobbled with blood i bind you to your grave i said hermans eyes didnt get one bit less frightened i raised the machete up and he made small protesting sounds because id told him not to move and he couldnt scream i tapped him with the flat of the machete with steel i bind you to your grave i spoke to requiem the salt now he turned and got the open jar that hed laid down by the foot of the grave he held it out toward me i took a handful of salt and id used the wrong hand and gotten blood in the white crystals all the salt would have to be dumped damn it i turned to the frightened zombie and threw the salt on him with salt i bind you to your grave i waited for what should happen next and prayed that this part at least would go like normal the fear and fierce personality in those pale eyes began to fade to leak away until he stood openeyed but empty his eyes were the eyes of the dead relief poured through me because if his eyes hadnt gone dead then wed have had more problems on our hands than i wanted for tonight but he was just a zombie a really good wellmade zombie but just a zombie yeah hed fought me but he was just dead clay like all the others with blood steel and salt i bind you to your grave edwin alonzo herman go rest and walk no more he lay down on the ground like it was a bed and then he simply sank into the ground i moved us off the grave so that that heaving shifting earth settled around him without us having to go along for the ride when it was over the ground was undisturbed it looked as it had when wed first walked up like an old grave in an old cemetery wow graham said into the silence wow wow indeed requiem said you are very good at this thanks there are aloe baby wipes in the jeep for cleaning up first aid kit for graham then get me back to the club as my lady commands so shall it be done i looked at the tall vampire and frowned at him theres going to come a time between us when im going to ask you to do something and you wont say that how can you be certain of that he asked and offered me his arm for the walk back to the jeep graham was already packing everything up except the machete which i had cleaned with a rag for that purpose and was oiling down with a cloth that id bought for the occasion the two rags lived in the same bag until one got bloody then it went in the trash organization is the key because eventually everyone says no you are terribly young to be so cynical he said its a gift i said and put the machete back in its sheath and that went on top of the bag that graham had waiting he was awfully efficient for a werewolf no requiem said it is not it is something learned through harsh experience speaking of harsh experience i had to check something i knelt on the now pristine grave i laid a hand on the hard ground what are you doing anita requiem asked this zombie fought me more than most it seemed more real im just checking to make sure that it is back to being bones and rags why what happens if he isnt graham asked i closed my eyes and opened just a little of that metaphysical hand that id had to squeeze back into a fist then the zombie would be trapped down there thinking aware but imprisoned he wont rot he cant die i thrust my power into that cold ground it was quiet down there peaceful again bones and rags were all that lay underneath good could you really trap someone like that graham asked i dont know for sure but i dont want to take the chance i wouldnt want to leave anyone down there like that i dusted my hands off is it okay graham asked yeah just bones vampires do not die when buried either requiem said there have been accidents where new vampires were buried too deep or those that were appointed to retrieve them failed graham shuddered thats just creepy i stood and i almost fell requiem caught me steadied me is that buried alive stuff what they tell bad little vampires he looked at me and there were suddenly centuries of pain in those eyes i too have learned from harsh experience just get me to guilty pleasures and well try to avoid adding tonight to the harsh list as my lady commands he said smiling and offering his arm i took his arm and let him walk me to the jeep because i wasnt sure i could have walked that far without falling over i didnt feel well enough to mark nathaniel in public i felt weak and ill and didnt want to be part of the show but i also needed to feed and hed be furry after the show choices choices too many damn choices and not enough options i was cold by the time we got to the jeep graham had to drive and i wouldnt ride without a seat belt so we worked out a compromise i rode in the backseat with the blanket and requiem did his best to cuddle with me while i was strapped into the seat which was a lot harder than it sounded he started with his arm around my shoulders his body pressed as close to my side as he could get the blanket spread over us he was warm warm with the blood hed taken from me but his wasnt the heat of the werewolf and sitting sidebyside wasnt as warm as sitting in someones lap by the time wed pulled out of the cemetery i was shivering a mile or so down gravois and my body started to do those little involuntary spasms requiem gripped my hand under the blanket your hand is cool to the touch yeah i said he wrapped his arms tighter around me and the blanket slid off he grabbed it tried to spread it back over us both allow me to unbelt you allow me to hold you as graham did ifand i had to fight past chattering teethwe get in an accident i could die it is true you are no vampire and couldnt survive a car crash but it is also true that a vampire that goes too long without a feeding cannot die they may whither as a grape upon the vine but they will spring back to plump ripe life with the first taste of blood i fear that you will not my teeth began to chatter as if i was sitting on snow instead of in a car with the heater on high and a warm man wrapped around me i was so cold that my muscles were beginning to ache from it allow me at least to cover more of your body with my own i know you felt that the position lacked a certain dignity but allow me this liberty i beg of you i would have said no but my teeth were shaking so hard i was afraid i was going to chip one of them he took the silence for a yes and slid to the floorboard he burrowed under the blanket and laid his head against my stomach his arms wrapped around me i fought to tell him move but the involuntary muscle movement eased and my teeth stopped sounding like castanets hed been right with more of his body against mine it was warmer not a lot but maybe just enough i was still cold so cold as if i were assdeep in the snow and more was falling all around me id thought freezing to death was an easier way to die you just fell asleep this wasnt easy and i didnt feel the least bit sleepy a little scared but not sleepy i wanted to be warm i wanted heat i needed something warmer requiems voice came from under the blanket his upper body completely hidden under the gray folds the shivering has slowed i noticed i said and it was nice to just be able to talk without risking a tongue injury he snuggled his face against me an oddly catlike gesture id had enough of the wereleopards rubbing over me to know what i was talking about i would do anything that my lady required whats that supposed to mean i asked and i was feeling better enough to sound suspicious he laughed and pressed his body against my legs hard enough that my knees moved just a little apart his body was covering my legs but that one little movement was like the beginning of something its hard for most men to keep their thoughts above the waist when theyre touching below the waist no matter how innocently he was a vampire but he was still male i guess i couldnt fault him for thinking about it as long as thinking was all he did im feeling better than i was i dont think we need any heroic measures the tone of your voice the stiffening of your body he said from under the blanket such disapproval as if you think i will try to ravish you lets just say that im not the trusting sort though it felt a little silly talking to a lump under a blanket when the lump was wrapped around my body it did lack a certain dignity he laid his head against the side of my body because he was too tall to lay his head in my lap with so much of him covering my legs his hands wrapped around the back of my body sliding between me and the seat it was way too intimate for my tastes and not long ago when theardeur was hungry this much upcloseandpersonal would have raised it but there was nothing nothing but the warmth and movement of him and the awkwardness of having a near stranger that close to me but i could think i felt like crap but him this close didnt bring it on id fed on him earlier tonight and even that thought didnt raise anything through the chill if id felt better i would have been happy theardeur wasnt my master anymore it couldnt make me do impossibly embarrassing things anymore yeah maybe i had to feed it but it could be on my own terms or close to my own terms i sat there with a gorgeous male curled around my body and smiled even cold and aching with emptiness i was still happy still willing to trade that overwhelming heat for this cold waiting because it was a waiting that i could feel now theardeur wasnt gone it was like a fire that had burned down to cold ashes but there was still life in the heart of that dying wood it just needed a good poke and stir and there would be flames oh yeah just thinking that hard made it curl to life a tiny flare i squashed it pressed it down not yet not yet requiem raised his head against my body so that the top of his head brushed my breasts but through the leather jacket it wasnt much of a touch the jacket was bulky enough that it could have been accidental on his part though i doubted it if requiem was anything like jeanclaude and asher then he was very aware of where his body was and what it was doing but i let it go i wasnt that cheap a date for theardeur anymore yea i felt damian i would like to say i heard him or saw him but that wouldnt be true i felt him he was sitting against a wall and he was cold so cold colder than id ever been i called to him damian damian whats wrong i didnt hear him answer but i felt his body felt that aching cold at the center of it why what was happening to him what was wrong damian whats wrong did you say damian requiem asked yes hes hurt hes so cold so cold that hes collapsed against a wall there are people around him but i cant see who hes so cold so cold requiem knelt upward pushing his head out of the blanket and meeting my eyes you are his master now anita you make him live your energy makes him live oh shit yes you can refuse theardeur s call but you are cold to the touch and it is your warmth that gives warmth to damian in a way that goes far beyond sharing blood i closed my eyes and leaned my head back against the seat shit shit shit will you let him die for embarrassments sake i opened my eyes that question would have a lot more merit if you werent the one kneeling by my knees he put his head to one side and a curious look came over his face he looked as if hed say something then shook his head as if hed decided better of it and i was almost certain that what came out of his mouth wasnt what hed thought of first are you able to feed theardeur without intercourse or donating blood yes i said then allow me to offer myself as a tiding over snack until you reach the club and yourpomme de sang definesnack i said damian screamed through my head and i got a confused glimpse through his eyes of a blond woman bending over him it was elinore one of the new vampires she was speaking but he couldnt hear her anymore only watch her lipsticked mouth move noiseless i grabbed the front of requiems shirt out of time damian needs needs to be warm then let me share my warmth with you requiem whispered it as his face bent toward mine as happened so often tonight i didnt have to explain or give detailed instructions he just grasped what was needed and acted his lips touched mine and the kiss was gentle and no liberties were taken his tongue stayed nicely in his own mouth of course that did nothing to raise theardeur he drew back and searched my face with his gaze you are still cold in every way i nodded and down that long metaphysical line damian called out for help he was dying not like a human dies but like you watch a flame fade from lack of oxygen it was as if some invisible spark were being blown out inside him i was his spark now and i didnt know how to fix this i looked up at the man in front of me he was handsome enough but without theardeur s heat he was still a stranger and i didnt lust after strangers i had to be seduced not by the color of someones eyes or the flawlessness of their face but by a smile that had become dear to me a conversation so familiar that it had become like music to me familiarity never bred contempt with me it made me feel safe and until i felt safe i did not lust after people at least not in the front of my head and it was the front of my head that i needed id finally found the lock for my subconscious which meant i had to bring theardeur out on purpose not just get out of its way or stop fighting it but truly had to coax it to life again i hadnt thought what it would mean to control the power to this degree i seemed to spend my life not understanding the mess i was making until it was too late i grabbed requiems arms dug my fingers into his flesh damian is dying and i dont know how to save him simply raise theardeur and feed i dont know how to do it without theardeur pushing on me shit do you mean you do not know how to raise lust for me nothing personal but i dont know you there is no shame in not being a creature of casual lusts he said damian is dying i whispered it because i could feel it i could feel him beginning to pull away from me he was trying not to drag me to the grave with him so he was shielding as best he could i can raise lust in you anita it is not theardeur but it is one of my gifts if wed had time i would have asked him what the difference was but we were out of time do it help me feed dont let me kill damian not like this drop your shields or i am helpless to bespell you he cupped the side of my face in his warm hand damian felt like a cold wind in my head i dropped my shields and two things happened at once requiems power crashed into me it was as if that power had been pushing at me all night and i simply hadnt felt it he couldnt have gotten past my shields he was right but without them without them i was suddenly wet soaking through what panties i had it left me breathless helpless staring up at him my body already moist and ready for him it wasnt lust it was like hours of really good foreplay packed into seconds the second thing that happened was my own special little power went wow it was as if his power complemented theardeur as if it were a key to the lock or maybe all of belles line were like this that we could bring each other whatever the reason whatever the cause theardeur roared back to life and i felt it smash into him the way his power had hit me his eyes drowned in bright blue flame like gas lights sparkling in his skull our mouths met and this kiss wasnt gentle this kiss was like feeding like we were trying to suck each others souls from between our lips the thought brought the memory of what the dragon had shown me had tried to get me to do but it was distant and gone it wasnt souls we were after i fed on him and shoved it down that cold line to damian i heard him in my head anita but still he was cold still he lay in someones arms the jeep skittered around a turn and stopped graham yelled from the front seat what the fuck are you two doing back there my skin is crawling with it my hand was on the seat belt a second before requiems the seat belt unsnapped and he spilled me to the seat with him on top he was suddenly grinding me against the seat and i was suddenly very aware that the front of the leather pants were laced up tight those lacings began to rub against me i tore the side of the thong panties and pressed naked against the front of his leather pants he hesitated as if afraid hed hurt me but i pulled at him made him collapse on top of me he looked down at me with eyes like drowned flames and whatever he saw on my face seemed to decide him because he slid hands on my naked hips cupped my ass and angled me up against the front of his pants so the leather bindings rubbed directly onto the most delicate of places the sensation bowed my spine threw my head back i wrapped my legs around his waist pressed myself tighter against the front of him dug that strangely smooth roughness in against me that distant spark was growing brighter i shoved the energy into damian shoved the feel of it the heat of it and knew he was awake knew he gazed up at the world through eyes that had swum to green flames his voice sounded soft in my head anita what are you doing feeding requiem did something with his hips that brought me back into my head my skin i knew i was still giving energy to damian small bits of the pleasure but i was back to gazing up at requiem his hands his arms were around my waist his groin pressing into me the leather braiding rubbing up and down the front of my body he rotated his hips and rubbed back and forth between my legs i could feel him swollen and thick behind the leather i let my head fall back so that my upper body draped backward my hair trailing along the seat and was staring upside down when the door opened graham stood looking down at me he went to his knees as if he meant to kiss me but requiem picked me up moved me out of reach he put one hand under my shoulders and lifted so that my back was pressed against the back of the seat i was suddenly trapped between his body and the seat in a way that i hadnt been before the push of his body was firmer harder rougher it was as if hed spread me wider with the push of his body peeled back the layers of my most intimate places until the leather braiding rubbed directly on those spots that spot it was as if he knew exactly what hed done because he looked down at me with those burning eyes and said does it hurt no not yet i put my hands on his shoulders and would have drawn him down to a kiss but he drew back and stroked himself against me so hard so rough so smooth the leather was wet from my body from how wet hed made me if id been a little less wet hed have hurt me but it didnt hurt he began to pivot his hips rubbing his groin against mine beginning to rub across me not just back and forth but around rolling himself over me around and around over and over that bright spark of pleasure began to build inside me it all felt good but it was at the height of his stroke as his groin brushed over that one small point that the spark grew it grew as if he were feeding some tiny flame every stroke every rub of the leather soaking wet from my body every time he touched me there the spark flared bright and brighter it was as if fire had weight to it and that bright light grew heavy inside my body until i could feel the brush of that heat every time he moved over me until it was as if my lower body became heat and weight nothing but the building pleasure and then finally at the height of one of those rough strokes all that heat and weight spilled over me through me washing like heat across my body spilling in screams from my mouth dancing down my hands so that i ripped his shirt until i found skin to drive my nails into it was only then that he drove himself against me hard enough that it was almost pain hard enough that i felt his body convulse against me through the leather of his pants his hands were on the back of the seat holding us in place but his neck was bowed his eyes closed and his body pinning me to the seat as if he would press himself through the leather and find himself inside me his body convulsed a second time and he crushed me against the seat and the cry i gave him was part pleasure and part pain it was only then that theardeur truly fed it had gotten small bits but not what it needed not what i needed requiem had been controlling himself with an iron will and that iron will had kept me out of something that i needed only with his release had all his walls come tumbling down and theardeur had roared into that breach and fed his body collapsed down the seat so that he was resting on his legs still on his knees still with my legs wrapped around him but no longer pushing us against the seat his shoulders slumped and he pressed his face against the top of my head one hand on the back of the seat and the other around my waist i could hear his heart racing feel his pulse against the side of my face where his neck lay warm and close above me if id taken blood from him it would have left him colder but theardeur wasnt blood and it didnt mind sharing its warmth with those who fed it well i felt damian like a warm wind inside my head he blew me a kiss thank you anita thank you then he pulled away and there was someone touching his arm taking his hand he let them lead him onto the dance floor and i was alone inside my head with requiem still holding me oh god it was graham still kneeling in the open door of the jeep why wouldnt you share requiem why wouldnt you share requiem turned his head slowly as if even that small movement were an effort she is not mine to share graham laid his head on his arms on the seat almost as if he would weep i spoke staring at requiems chest where the lovely green shirt had been ripped away and there was a glint of scarlet from my nails the sleeve on his right arm was ripped away too and there were more marks there i said the only thing i could think of did i hurt you that made him laugh and then wince as if the laughter hurt i think mlady i should be asking that of you he eased me off his body and himself to the floorboard so that i was sitting on the seat and he was kneeling in front of me it was almost exactly how we started he moved down until he was sitting flat in the floor with his back against the opposite door from where graham was still kneeling did i hurt you he asked not yet i said but even as i said it the endorphins began to fade and the first ache began it was suddenly harder to find a comfortable place to sit on the seats i have hurt you he said and i am a clumsy fool i eased until i was sitting more on one hip fool i dont know you well enough to answer but clumsy that i know is a lie you may be a lot of things but clumsy isnt one of them you compliment me even as i see your discomfort why didnt you just take off the pants and fuck her graham asked his face looked more in pain than either of ours i told her to let down her shields and she did it she trusted me but she did not understand what my power can do you told me that it was lust i said and my voice still sounded lazier than normal almost sleepy yes but it is not seduction as jeanclaude and asher can do it is simply lust it was like hours of really good foreplay all at once it felt wonderful but it is purely physiological purely of the body my gift does not touch the mind only the flesh whats wrong with that graham asked if a womans body reacts to my power but her mind does not i see it as little better than rape and i have never been interested in such things he sighed anita did not want to have intercourse with me she made that clear shed offered me blood once tonight but she needed to keep the rest for herself i was hoping to be able to stop sooner but you kept demanding more theardeur did not quiet as i had hoped i could feel it graham said it was amazing like what you did to me earlier but more it felt like if i could have just touched you it would have been more requiem said more yes it would be more what could be more than orgasm he looked at me and i looked at him and neither of us looked at graham i knew it graham said i fucking knew it i obeyed anitas wishes we did not have intercourse we saved her vampire servant and theardeur has been fed i looked at him as he sat on the floorboard he still looked elegant but sort of dissipated like an elegant rake if hed unfastened those leather pants and made it intercourse i wouldnt have said no because truthfully id thought that was all that would save damian or maybe i was just too american and only intercourse meant sex maybe but whatever the reasoning requiem had behaved himself in circumstances where most men wouldnt have he got a lot of brownie points for that if id had a gold star i would have pinned it on him i did the next best thing i kissed him on the cheek and said thank you graham doubleparked in front of guilty pleasures and said hed valet the car for me i let him do it which said just how well i was feeling i was better but id shoved a lot of the last feeding into damian and apparently not kept enough for myself the learning curve on the new version of theardeur was going to take some getting used to requiem offered me his hand to help me out of the jeep and i took it i was stiff and more than a little sore and since hed helped get me that way it seemed fair he help me out of the jeep besides i couldnt just flounce out of the jeep like normal i had no underwear on and one of my great goals in life was not to flash anyone tonight by accident clay the new blond werewolf was at the door a trio of women were chatting him up a man in coat and hat slipped past his back and into the club clay didnt seem to notice he was far too busy staring at the redheads chest he noticed us in time to suddenly usher the women into the club before we got there he stood one hand on the opposite wrist as if hed been doing it all night but everything about him screamedkid caught with his hand in the cookie jar requiem had a little trouble with the steps leading up to the door too which let me know that vampire or not he might have a few rubby spots of his own when we were at the top even with clay i stopped long enough to say all those women better be of age clay he looked surprised either at the thought of it or that id seen him theyre over twentyone you see id he looked perplexed well maria said that her friend had left her id at home i know maria i shook my head you better hope someone catches her friend inside i let requiem lead me past the puzzled werewolf it was in the morning but when requiem opened the door the sound of many people in a small space having a very good time spilled out around us it was hot inside the doors and it wasnt caused by the heating system it was just that many bodies in a small space i couldnt see if nathaniel was on stage yet because my view was blocked by a curtain of blackshirted security buzz was talking to the three women if she doesnt have id she doesnt get in but clay told us it would be alright the redhead said and i assumed it was maria maria buzz said you know the rules no exceptions not even for regulars the man whod come in just ahead of us was facing two of the largest security guards id seen one was as blond as clay and the other was very very brunette as in african american brunette they were both over six feet with a shoulder spread that was nearly as wide as i was tall they made buzz look small and i wondered where theyd been when primo was beating everyones ass the brunette said you are not allowed in here i have a right to see my own son the man said i told you marlowe is not dancing tonight he called in sick marlowe was gregorys stage name and he only had one biological unit that called itself his father the man whod sexually abused them as children pimped them out to other pedophiles and even put them in films i knew he was in town but we had a restraining order against him alright gregory and stephen did i patted requiems hand and said excuse me a minute i went to the big security guards buzz saw me moving and he gave the three women over to someone else to usher outside he followed me youd think he didnt trust me not to start trouble excuse me i said are you anthony dietrich he turned then had to look down as if hed expected me to be taller whos asking the creepy thing was that he had their eyes those beautiful cornflower blue eyes stared out of a lined and aged face he was close to six feet tall and the face was flat and harsh not the delicate bone structure of the boys only the eyes staring out of a strangers face the eyes shook me so that i stood there staring for a second and it was buzz who said the boys have a restraining order against you you cant enter this club without violating it charon cerebus get his ass out of here dont hurt him but get him out the two big men took an arm apiece lifted and carried him without his feet touching the ground out the door i turned to buzz does he try to get in here often a couple of times whenever harlow or marlowe are scheduled i shook my head that is just so wrong buzz nodded then took a deep breath and shook his shoulders like a bird settling its feathers im going to have to talk to clay you talk to him then send him to me because i want to talk to him too he looked at me okay but brandon saved a chair by the stage for you and i think hell be very disappointed if you dont at least catch the end of his act it took me a second to remember that brandon was nathaniels stage name oh yeah sorry got distracted the fact that that piece of shit keeps trying to get in and watch his sons strip distracts me too i nodded yeah requiem will take you to your seat enjoy the show the vampire was just suddenly at my elbow and i let him lead me through the crowd but my eyes were back toward the door what did anthony dietrich want with gregory and stephen what could he possibly want from them after all these years they were too old for a pedophile to be interested in them werent they i bumped into a chair and had to apologize to the woman who sat in it and pay more attention to what was in front of me than what was behind it was worth paying attention to nathaniel was on stage i dont know what id expected i knew he stripped i knew he performed but id never seen him do it it wasnt that nathaniel was shy but he was quiet gentle the person on stage was neither of those things he stalked he strutted and he danced it was similar to what hed taught me moving to the beat of the music but this was the real deal him throwing himself around the stage springing up in the air and spilling himself back down every movement fluid and graceful and amazing he was down to a creamcolored gstring it left his ass bare and held him tight in front so that he filled the cloth and i knew him well enough to know that he was already excited that he liked what he was doing his eyes sparkled with it his face shone with a fierce joy he threw himself into the air again and landed in a pushup position the audience screamed requiem lowered me to the chair by the stage and lifted the reserved sign off the seat before i sat on it i forgot to smooth my skirt down in back until i touched the cold chair i had to sit up enough to smooth it down and not put my bare cookies on a chair that someone else would have to sit on later just politeness but my eyes never left the stage nathaniel did pushups then his hips dropped lower and his body came up and he did a movement that managed to look like he was fucking the stage and at the same time was a bigger movement than that like a wave that went from his head to his feet over and over again until the women in the audience were almost hysterical a woman two chairs to my right was pulling down her blouse flashing her breasts at him he crawled across the stage in that way that the wereanimals had as if they had muscles in places that humans didnt it was graceful and dangerous and utterly sensual as he slinked on all fours toward the end of the stage from the back with his legs tight together he looked nude he laid his head on the floor and the ponytail of his auburn hair spilled out around him like a cloak he stayed that way for a moment in a tight ball that looked so terribly nude then the music changed and his head flew up his hair spilling in an arc through the air like a shining spray of colored water until it fell around his back and i realized that he had it up in a high tight ponytail so that the hair bounced and moved with him he used it like it was a piece of costume to hide his body to peek pale flesh through it then to swirl it around him so that the hair itself was the show for a moment then he began to do that sensuous crawl around the stage and people began to put money in the thin strap of his gstring there was already a pile of money at the far end of the stage as if hed been getting it all along but only now was he letting them slip the bills in so close to his body one woman pulled on the gstring pulling it away from his body and he cupped his hand over the front of him to hide and i almost got up almost rode to his rescue but he didnt need to be rescued he kissed her and she let him move her hand away from his clothes and sat back like hed stunned her he joked and chastized and flowed through their hands like muscled water he was always almost close enough but never quite where they reached if they were reaching where they shouldnt have i watched the other women and the one or two men and i felt something lust i think it was lust but it was as if their lust was solid enough to grab to pull out of the air itself and wrap around my body like a coat jeanclaudes voice whispered through my head ma petite do you want to know how to feed on their lust to feed without touching you know i do i whispered and it was like before with primo it was as if he stepped inside my skin almost so that i suddenly knew what he knew i knew how to open myself up and pull in the thick air it wasnt like breathing and it wasnt like feeding when i touched someone it was closer to literally pulling at the air with metaphysical hands and dragging the lust hand over hand and pulling it inside me it was the oddest sensation as if the lust were silk or satin and i pulled it inside my body as if silk scarves could pass through a hole in my skin the sensation felt like id made a wound in my body and was pulling things through that wound it was a sensation just this side of pain jeanclaudes voice in my head it will not be so uncomfortable when you have practiced it it feels awful but are you feeding he asked i had to think about it because all my attention was on how disturbing it felt to draw the lusts of strangers inside me but once i thought about it i realized i was feeding i felt less cold than i had but do you ever fill up this way it keeps one from starving but it is not a meal no i dont know what i would have said to that because suddenly nathaniel was in front of me i think he was repeating himself but i hadnt heard him the first time i said do you want to come play with the kitty jeanclaude was gone from my head and id stopped feeding from the audience everything just shut down everything but the lavender eyes staring at me from the edge of the stage his hand was held out womens voices were calling im not shy pick me if she doesnt want to go brandon brandon she doesnt want you but i do i put my hand in his but i made a face to show just how uneasy this whole thing made me i didnt like to dance where strangers or even friends could see me being dragged on stage at a strip club was so far beyond my comfort level until that moment i hadnt really thought about what it would mean to mark him tonight on stage in front of people eek i stumbled going up on the stage because i remembered the short skirt and the lack of anything under it so i was very ladylike getting up on stage trouble was the stage was too high from the floor to be that ladylike so i stumbled and he caught me and gave me a look that look gave me a last refuge that look said if you cant do this ill let it go he would have too but i also knew that if it wasnt me it was going to be someone else truthfully i wasnt sure how i felt about watching him get pawed or paw another woman the fact that i thought flaunting myself up on stage would be a lesser evil than watching someone else flaunt themselves at nathaniel said clearly that my priorities had become skewed theyd brought a chair up on stage and i hadnt seen it the money was missing from his gstring i think hed put it with the pile at the end of the stage i hadnt seen that either which meant that id missed some of the act while i was feeding off the audience he led me to the chair and sat me down in it with a flourish of his arm i looked up at him and knew that the look on my face was suspicious it said clearly what are you going to do to me he laughed and it was that fullthroated laugh that turned his face from handsome to something younger moreinnocent for lack of a better word i valued that laugh because i didnt get to hear it often if me sitting here like this made him feel that good then it just couldnt be that bad he put a hand on the back of the chair on either side of my shoulders leaning his face very close into mine i could see the eyeliner around his lavender eyes now and realized that there was mascara there too not a lot but his eyes didnt need a lot to go from beautiful to freaking amazing youre not allowed to touch me and im only allowed limited contact with you but your hands need to stay on the chair most of the time his lips showed the shadow of the smile that gleamed in his eyes i dont know what i would have said to that because the music came up or maybe it just began and he started to dance it had been spectacular enough from the edge of the stage up this close it passed from spectacular to embarrassing it didnt matter that i slept with him almost every night or that id seen him more nude than this more than once it mattered only that it was in public and i didnt know what to do he started by writhing over me with his hands still on the back of the chair his chest was so close to my face that it was harder not to have my lips touch him than to touch him id seen him use his body before but not like this it was as if every muscle from shoulder to groin was capable of moving independently and he was using every one of them it was amazing and in private i would have told him so but here and now i blushed he sat in my lap with his legs wide around the chair his hands still on the back of it if hed just sat i could have handled it but of course he didnt he moved his hips around my lap like he was stirring something but the movement didnt stop at the hips it danced up his body so that it was a bigger movement and more of the crowd could see it as if there was any doubt what he was pantomiming my face was hot as if my skin would burn if you touched it he leaned in against my hair where id hidden my face and whispered ill stop and pick someone else if its too much i raised up enough to meet his eyes pick someone else i said the act doesnt change he whispered just whos on stage the smile was gone from his eyes he was serious again id killed the smile in his face or my embarrassment had god i touched his face cupped the edge of his cheek against my hand i looked into those suddenly serious eyes while the music beat and pulsed around us in that moment there was no crowd there was nothing but his face and my decision i forgot the people forgot that i was supposed to be embarrassed forgot everything but that i wanted him to smile again no dont pick anyone else ill try ill really try he gave me that flash of smile that id only recently known he had in him and he dropped to his knees in front of me his hands played lightly on my knees and he began to spread my legs apart but he was still dancing to the music even on his knees and he saw the problem before the rest of the audience did he put his body between my knees and leaned in enough to say youre not wearing anything i had to smile at the almost surprised embarrassment on his face it was nice to know that he could be embarrassed nope i said he laughed again and raised up high on his knees his hands on the back of the chair again he thrust against me not touching but it must have looked worse to the audience because they yelled and screamed and began to throw money onto the stage he didnt so much fall down my body as spill down it again that sense of liquid grace that the wereanimals had when they wanted to he ended with his face in my lap across the stretched fabric of the skirt his upper body actually hiding the rest of me from the audience the skirt had ridden up enough that everyone knew i was wearing black lace thighhighs his hands traced up my hose above the boots across my knees and up my thighs until his fingers came to the edge of the lace his fingers traced just above the lace played along the bare skin of my thighs he turned his head in my lap just enough so that his lips were close to my bare thigh and he kissed the inside of my thigh that one small touch made me shudder and close my eyes in a sigh he was up while my eyes were closed hands putting my knees together so when his body moved i wasnt flashing anyone he danced behind me and suddenly his hair feel over my face and body like an auburn waterfall i was suddenly drowning in the vanilla scent of his hair he whirled around me touching me only with his hair then he had my hand in his and pulled me hard and fast out of the chair so that i was forced against his body it was like a move in a dance but more forceful if you wanted your partner to stay on her feet if he hadnt caught me i might have fallen but his body was there and my hands were on that body i couldnt help it i just caught myself with his arm and chest but the sight of me touching him like that sent more money onto the stage and raised the frenzy of the women grouped around the stage his other hand had gone to the back of my skirt and tugged it down he made it look like he was taking liberties when it was the exact opposite whatever they thought he was doing they liked it the music had slowed changed and he was suddenly dancing with me it was almost a waltz and he did three quick turns across the stage and we were back at the chair he used my hand to whip me out from his body and have me facing the back of the chair he put my hands on the curved back of the chair then put his body as close to mine as he could he was close enough that i could feel the tightness of him pressing against the back of my skirt he whispered against my hair this would be easier if you were wearing underwear i started to turn and ask what would be easier but his hands covered mine trapping them against the curve of the chair and he suddenly started pressing that tight part of him against my ass id said he pantomimed sex before but id been wrong because he was doing it now he thrust against the back of my body with his hands trapping mine against the chair and his body curved over me with my legs together he wasnt brushing up against anything that requiem had hurt with my legs together the angle would have been wrong if we were actually trying to have sex but that wasnt what the show was about as hed said hours ago it was an illusion the illusion that they could have him the illusion that he could bring someone up on stage and have them in front of everyone else the cloth of the gstring was satiny but what lay inside that satin was hard and firm and all i could think of was earlier in my office of the feel of him inside of me for real of him pushed inside me as far as he could go of him sliding in and out of my body of him stroking over that spot inside me of the feel of him so careful so delicate so very strong as he moved inside me my imagination was suddenly not my friend because between one breath and another the memory overwhelmed me and suddenly that heavy warmth spread from low in my body to spill over my skin in a dance of goosebumps i spasmed against the chair against nathaniels body his body was still bent over mine and the weight of him rode me as i spasmed as i orgasmed it was a small one no screaming no clawing just that helpless spasming and not much of that by my standards he whispered against the side of my face his breath almost hot anita but the next moment there was movement behind us i felt it like a disturbance of air and there was a sound i didnt know and a sharp sound of something heavy hitting flesh nathaniels body reacted to the blow spasmed almost like mine had a second blow came and this time words jeanclaudes voice bad cat very bad cat away from her bad cat away from her nathaniels body responded to every blow almost like it was a miniature orgasm his body tightened around me as if the feel of my body next to him while jeanclaude whipped him was something he didnt want to lose but jeanclaude drove him off with a joking voice and nathaniel made sure my skirt was in place before he let jeanclaude drive him across the stage i was left holding the chair so weakkneed i didnt trust myself to move yet jeanclaude had a small manytailed whip in his hand nathaniel crouched and crawled across the stage and jeanclaude beat him it was like an odd version of an oldtime lion tamer act except the chair served an entirely different purpose you are a very bad kittycat very bad how do we punish our bad kitty for a second i thought he was asking me but he wasnt the women around the stage started to chant tie him up tie him up tie him up jeanclaude smiled as if that had never occurred to him but what a good idea it was at a gesture from him chains descended from the ceiling i hadnt noticed them in the welter of lights and cables oh hell i hadnt even looked up two barechested waiters wearing only leather pants came up on stage and dragged nathaniel to his feet they chained his arms spread wide wrists above his head jeanclaude came to me walking so that his hips rolled more than they should have he touched my arm and whispered with a smile that did not match the words are you alright ma petite i nodded and whispered because i knew hed hear me flashback not as strong as those that our asher can give i shook my head interesting he said are you well enough to finish this show i promised i said his smile widened and his voice was suddenly that roomfilling jolly sound now you may help us punish our bad kitty you may make him pay for taking liberties i got a shadow of what he was doing to the audience when he said punish it was a sharp pull on the body bad kitty made you think of very naughty things pay and more money hit the stage liberties had a lascivious lilt to it that made the audience do that nervous giggle like what they were thinking was worse than anything theyd seen tonight i just nodded and let him take my hand that one touch was both a mistake and a help it made me feel less shaky but it also opened me to him more touching just his hand was more distracting than touching so much more on most men he led me a little dazed across the stage until we were standing behind nathaniel facing the bareness of the back of his body jeanclaude let go of my hand and went to him he touched the bare back you may hit him herehis hand slid down nathaniels back to his buttocksor here he has been a bad kitty but we dont want to damage him he is far too pretty for that the audience agreed with him most of them jeanclaude handed the whip toward me i dont know how to use a whip first it is a what my sweets most of the women yelled flogger and second it would bemy pleasure and that one word slithered over my skin and apparently over the other women as well for they squealed to show you just how it works and every word seemed darker more suggestive than it should have he tried to show me first by simply using it on nathaniel he made the heavy leather tails blur and blossom against nathaniels skin nathaniel reacted to every blow with a spasm that went from his fingers to his toes and everything in between i could see enough of his face to know that those closed eyes and parted lips werent from pain jeanclaude whipped nathaniel or i guessflogged him until his skin was pink in places and the stage was littered with money at their feet he leaned close to nathaniels face said something and nathaniel said something back then jeanclaude turned to me he held the flogger out again hes such a bad kitty i shook my head shall i show her how its done he asked the audience and they yelled louder and i wished id just taken the damn thing and tried but too late now he put the flogger in my hand and pressed his body against the back of mine with one arm around my waist and the other hand on the hand that held the flogger it was the way lecherous men stand when they try to teach you how to golf or swing a bat he swung my arm back and tried to make me give that sharp crack against nathaniels body but it wasnt sharp it was sort of flabby you must relax and let me do the work ma petite loud enough for the audience he said relax my sweet relax and we will show him pain and perhaps more the perhaps more was like a whisper in the dark against your skin i let out the breath i was holding and tried to relax never my best thing but i also knew that if i didnt relax this part of the show would last longer and i wanted this part over it was sort of demeaning like i was a girl who couldnt swing at the ball without help okay maybe i didnt know how to use a flogger but i really didnt need this much help we got a couple of good blows in enough to make nathaniel shiver in his chains then jeanclaude stepped away from me leaving the flogger in my hand give the bad kitty what he wants and what he said was not what it felt like in my head or on my skin or deeper in my body the women around the stage and farther into the room made small noises shit i threw the flogger at jeanclaude the way youd throw a baseball bat when you want someone to catch it he caught it by the handle like id known he would i know what the bad kitty wants and i am going to give it to him the women made ooh and aah sounds and several said you go girl one yelled lucky bitch i walked to nathaniel and stood in front of him his eyes were only partly focused hed liked the flogger id known sort of academically that he would but seeing it in his face was different it bothered me and i wasnt sure if the entire thing bothered me or if what bothered me was that this was something he liked this much and i wasnt sure i was willing to do it for him i let the doubts go because what i was about to do was something i could do and wanted to do and had promised to do i looked up at the chains and just wasnt familiar enough with the concept to know so i asked jeanclaude does this swivel it can he said why because theyll want to see his face the audience liked that and they shouted more encouragement but i didnt need it i dont know why but suddenly i was calm i wasnt bothered that we were in public or that we were on stage it was very peaceful inside my head very calm the waiters turned nathaniel around so that he faced the audience his eyes had gone back to almost normal i could see his face reflected in the distant glass of the far wall id never really noticed how much shiny surface there was all around until that moment when i could watch nathaniels face and mine i grabbed his ponytail grabbed it and wound it around my hand tight tight enough that he gasped i think the audience screamed but the sound of them was receding pulling away and leaving me in a well of silence where the only noises were nathaniels breath and mine i pressed my body along his back tucked him tight against me so that his ass pushed against my stomach and my breasts pressed into his back i kept my hold on his hair and used it like a handle to keep him from moving pulling harder if he shifted his weight until he hung suspended afraid to move eager not to i had to go on tiptoe to get the angle i wanted for the smooth expanse of his neck i put my free hand around his upper chest holding us tight together i used his hair to stretch his neck to one side to give me as much of that smooth delicate flesh as possible his breathing had already changed already sped in anticipation i licked his neck a quick flick of tongue and he gasped for me i licked harder and he shuddered i kissed his neck and he made a small noise not of protest but of eagerness i opened my mouth wide and let my breath touch hot upon his skin and then i bit him no more foreplay no more games i bit him he struggled against me he couldnt help it and i used his hair and my arm around his body and the press of my body against his back to hold him in place i felt his skin under my teeth felt the meat of him in my mouth and underneath that was that frantic beating pulse i could taste his life underneath his skin taste it and know that it was mine mine if i wanted it mine because part of him wanted to give it up to me the sensation of that much meat in my mouth was almost overwhelming and i fought not to bite down and take away all that flesh i fought not to take everything that he offered in that moment i bit down held him as he struggled held him as his wrists jerked on the chains as his body began to spasm and still i sank my teeth into his flesh the first sweet taste of blood like salt and metal and something so much sweeter filled my mouth and i felt him convulse against me heard him cry out and i fed i fed theardeur and hadnt even known it was coming i fed on his blood fed on the meat of his body fed on his sex fed on all of him i fed and when i looked up from his body i saw my eyes reflected in the mirror black light with that flash of brown light my eyes drowned with power i let go with my mouth abruptly and saw blood on my mouth on my chin shining in the lights i let go of his hair his body and stepped back and i knew that my eyes were still full of that dark light i was afraid for a second what id done but found that other than a perfect set of my own teeth marks set like a bloody necklace on his skin i hadnt bitten through to his pulse i hadnt hurt him not more than he wanted to be hurt jeanclaude was standing there in front of me ma petite he whispered ma petite but i knew what he was thinking i knew what he wanted bound closer than wed ever been it cut both ways he mouthed something about how did i feel was i alright but that wasnt what he was thinking not really say what you want i said say what you want he stopped trying to be careful and said simply kiss me i went to him and he kissed me he kissed me as if he were tasting me as if with tongue and teeth and lips he could drain from me every last drop of nathaniels blood and the taste of me along with it he licked the roof of my mouth and drew a sound from low in my throat his eyes had bled to midnight blue light as if the darkest of water held starlight in it i caught the glint of my own eyes and they were still full of light blind with the darkness of it except it wasnt blind it was anything but it was like being hyperaware of everything anything i knew suddenly that as long as the light lasted that every sense would be heightened i remembered thinking in the cemetery that to make love like this would either be the most wondrous thing ever or drive you mad staring up into jeanclaudes drowning blue eyes i was willing to bet on wondrous we must see to nathaniel first he said but his voice was hoarse and thick with need i nodded yes nathaniel first and then he asked say what you mean i said and my voice wasnt as hoarse as his but it didnt sound exactly like me either and then there is a couch in my office he said i was thinking the desk i said he looked at me and even with those drowning eyes the look was very male either will do for me but it is you who will be on bottom so it is your choice ill be on bottom i made it a question he nodded yes why i asked because that is what i want okay i said nathaniel was done for the night there would be no shapeshifting he was barely conscious in that after great sex kind of way a few of the customers complained but not many most of them felt that theyd had a show worth the price of admission we got nathaniel settled in what the strippers called the quiet room it had an oversized couch blankets low lights and was just what the name implied a quiet room where you could either sleep or get your shit together when things went odd there were smaller rooms where you could pay to have a private dance but this wasnt one of them this was more a room for crashing when you were tired or had to pull a surprise double shift i stroked nathaniels hair and asked him are you alright hed opened his eyes just barely and smiled up at me id never seen his face so content yes very yes i told him to enjoy the afterglow and i put requiem on the door because nathaniel was mine to take care of and i planned on being busy for awhile my eyes had bled back to normal by the time i walked down the hallway toward jeanclaudes office he stopped in the hallway and called after me where are you going ma petite i paused at the door and looked at him to your office your mood is cooler now and the power has left you he was trying to be utterly neutral and failing just a bit i opened the door still looking at him come into the office jeanclaude and lock the door i didnt wait to see what hed do i went through the door leaving it open behind me i went to the desk and hopped up on it i could have tried for subtle but it was late and i didnt feel the least bit subtle i put my boots up on the desk my legs apart and let the skirt ride up as far as it wanted to go it was outrageously slutty but the look on his face as he came through the door made me glad id done it he leaned against the door and locked it and was unbuttoning his jacket as he walked across the floor i pulled off the leather jacket and threw it to the floor his jacket was on the floor the fluffy white cravat undone so that his upper neck showed pale i slipped the shoulder holster off my arms but only had the belt partly undone when he pulled the shirt over his head and was naked from the waist up i finished the belt but he was at the desk before i got it off slipping the shoulder holster free and setting gun and all beside me on the big black lacquer desk i went to my knees on his desk and fell upon the silken muscle and lines of his chest with hands and fingers and mouth i licked the crossshaped burn scar i drew first one nipple and then the other into my mouth rolled them with my tongue sucked them used my hands to mound the flesh of his chest so i could take more of his nipple into my mouth more of his breast until i could lock my mouth around as much as would fill it and bit down until he cried out and his hands found my face drew me away from his body and to his mouth we kissed as we had on stage as if we were exploring every inch with tongue lips teeth he drew back from the kiss and his eyes had bled to blue mine were still my own but i didnt care his hands found my shirt and he pulled it over my head and bent over me kissing down the line of my neck my shoulder and mounds of my breasts where they spilled up from the black lace bra he stuck his hands inside my bra and lifted my breasts out so they rested on the underwire like it was a black frame for the pale mounds of my breasts he went to his knees and pulled me to the edge of the desk so he could run his tongue over my breasts flicking against my nipples quick and light and wet until i made small noises he locked his mouth around my breast and drew as much of my breast as he could between his fangs without nicking me he sucked hard and harder rolling his tongue along my nipple and drawing harder on my breast until he stretched me out in a line that felt so good but i could feel how careful he was being it wasnt the first time hed played with me like this but it was the first time that id known that this was only the beginning of what he wanted it wasnt like telepathy or a picture in my head i just knew i knew what he wanted to do what he was fighting not to do bleed me i said he rolled his eyes up to me so he could see my face bleed me i know how long youve wanted to do that now how careful youve been he stopped and released my breast slowly carefully he said ma petite you are drunk with the new powers but tomorrow night you will not be i shook my head let me feel what its like to have you stretch me tight in your mouth and draw just a little blood im not saying that the whole ride will appeal to me but i am saying that im willing to try a little to see if ill like a lot or not he looked strangely suspicious and i realized that it was my expression in his eyes more than his as if id taught him that look and this caution i give you my word that i wont punish you for anything i agree to try tonight a little blood tonight only a little barely a nick just a taste i leaned in toward his face i know that you want to feed there now you never told me nor would i have ma petite you let me take blood so infrequently that i would never have dreamt to ask such a liberty when you will not share your neck why would i think to ask for more delicate parts im offering now id take me up on it if i were you who knows if ill ever offer again if you say no now i stared into his face from inches away and let him see that there was no conflict here no doubts just eagerness eagerness to try what has gotten into you ma petite you youve gotten into me or i want you to i want you inside me jeanclaude i want you inside me i want you to lie me back across this desk with my breasts bare and your mark on them i want you to push yourself inside me and watch the blood flow from the wound that you made i want you to watch the blood flow fast and faster while you fuck me you are echoing my fantasy ma petite have i taken you over i dont think so i said but even the thought of it didnt panic me just a little tonight jeanclaude just a little nick he reached around my body and it took me a second to realize he was undoing the back of my bra he slipped it off my shoulders down my arms and let it fall to the floor he gazed up at me and his eyes never got higher than my breasts i didnt mind in the least he cupped my breasts in his hands gently reverently and laid the gentlest of kisses upon each of them he raised eyes to me that were back to their normal midnight blue as human as his eyes ever became are you sure ma petite are you sure i nodded yes oh yes he cupped my right breast in his hand then took just the tip of it in his mouth a quick drawing of his mouth over my flesh he sucked and pulled until my nipple was tight and thick under his touch it brought my breath faster made my pulse race he rolled his eyes upward to watch my face and whatever he saw there reassured him because he drew hard and fast made me gasp then he drew slowly so slowly more and more of my breast into his mouth hed never taken so much in at once because to do even this much was to risk drawing blood his mouth was so warm so wide the hard press of his teeth was as distant as he could make it and still hold me in his mouth he used his hands to help his mouth pour so carefully over me his breath like heat against my skin he moved carefully off of me his mouth sliding back until there was much less between his lips he went back out to the safe distance that hed been before he drew just the tip of my breast in his mouth and he sucked he sucked and pulled and stretched it out and out until i made small sounds low in my throat he squeezed my breast between his hand squeezed it and rolled his eyes up to watch my face when i didnt tell him to stop he squeezed tighter tighter until it felt like he was trying to garrote my breast with his fingers it hurt it did but it was all mixed up with the sucking and the pulling on my nipple and that didnt hurt not really in fact it felt good so good it fell out of my mouth in a voice that was almost a moan yes please please yes he rolled his eyes up again to watch my face and there was something in those eyes some knowledge or warning and suddenly he bit down not as hard as id seen in his head but a little he let the barest tips of those sharp fangs graze my breast as he sucked it as he squeezed it with his hand it was sharp but it didnt hurt it was lost in the other sensations his hand squeezing so tight his mouth sucking so hard the tiny bit of the fangs was nothing compared to the rest he let his mouth slide down my breast until only the nipple was caught between his teeth but there on the mound of my breast were two tiny dots of crimson as i watched those two tiny dots began to glide down my skin he drew my nipple out and out and we both watched those two tiny trails of red slide down my skin he pulled on my nipple so hard and so long that i cried out enough enough he drew back gently and knelt for a moment watching the colors flow on my skin not just of the blood but of the marks of his fingers they faded but the two lines of blood didnt fade they glided down my skin and as the sensation returned to my breast they tickled down my skin the feel of that tiny gliding touch the sight of it easing down my skin made me shiver he smoothed his hands up the insides of my thighs and it was only as his fingers brushed certain parts that i made real pain sounds no manual manipulation tonight he frowned are you hurt i explained as briefly as possible lets just say that theardeur needed feeding and requiem was a gentleman i think wed both be less sore if hed been a little less of a gentleman he looked puzzled ill explain everything in detail but later please jeanclaude take off the pants ive had all the leather pants up close and personal that i can handle tonight let me see you nude he peeled off boots and the leather pants with the practiced ease of someone who wears a lot of them id seen him nude more times than i could count now but he never stopped amazing me with his beauty flawless was the only word i had for him white and pale and perfect as if someone could carve cold white marble and breathe life into it and plant a blush of color at his groin where he sat straight and thick and ready the hair that trailed from the delicate thimble of his belly button down to his groin was as black as the curls that fell around his shoulders that black black hair stark and unreal against the whiteness of him there should have been gentler words for what i wanted but all i could think of was how much i wanted him inside me how much i wanted him to sink that shining color inside my body fuck me i said becausemake love was not what i meant i wanted the sex that went with what hed done to my breast i wanted the sex that matched the blood trailing down my skin fuck me he bent over me and licked the blood off my chest not a quick lick but thick long movements of his tongue as if hed never tasted anything so good and didnt want to lose a single drop i was making small wordless noises and writhing on the desk by the time he raised his face up and showed me eyes that had drowned in blue flame i whispered please jeanclaude please he did what id seen in his head he did what id offered he laid me back against the desk and pulled my hips to the very edge of the wood my skirt was completely bunched around my waist like a belt i was still wearing the thighhighs and the boots and nothing else he used his hands to spread my legs apart then came to me the tip of him sliding against my opening you are wet but you are still tight fuck me i said please just do it please please please please somewhere in the lastplease he began to force himself inside me i was tight so tight and so wet on another night i would have asked for more foreplay to make that horrible tightness loose but tonight i wanted to feel him push his way in i wanted to feel him shove himself inside me he pushed himself between my legs using his hips and legs to drive himself into me it was just this side of too tight and i started to struggle underneath the push of it not struggle to get away but struggle because i couldnt help it my hands and arms swept over his desk and knocked everything within reach off including my gun i wanted something softer to touch something to scratch and hold on to but there was nothing but the cool wood of the desk and that wasnt what i wanted to touch when he was as far inside me as he could go he began to pull himself out slowly as if my body were trying to hold on to him and maybe it was he drew himself out slowly and then began to work himself in just as slowly if he didnt hurry i wasnt going to be tight anymore i wanted that feeling of him forcing himself into my body and we were going to lose that if he kept being gentle fuck me jeanclaude fuck me while im tight please that will hurt he said i want it to hurt he gave me a look then gripped my hips in his hands let me feel some of that otherworldly strength and he did what i asked he drove himself into me and pulled himself out of me as fast and hard as he could it did hurt and i wasnt ready for it and it was exactly what i wanted he drove himself in as deep and hard as he could so that the impact of our bodies tore a grunt from my body and a sound in his that id never heard before he trapped my hips under the strength of his hands and he forced himself inside me fought the tightness of my body as if he were piercing my body making a new hole because this one wasnt wide enough the blood was flowing across my chest in widening lines as my heart beat faster and my blood pumped itself out of those two little holes the blood looked so red so red on the white of my skin he lifted my legs so that my feet were by his face he grabbed my hips and pulled me further down the desk closer to his body and used his weight to push my legs back over my body so that he changed the angle inside me made it deeper sharper i cried out he moved his hands to my waist and pulled me farther into his body and he rode my legs down so that i was almost bent in two wed done gentler versions of this and he knew i was limber enough for it but it was suddenly a much different position because he rode my body into a tight knot fucking me as hard and as fast as he could but he pushed my body together so that he could lick my chest while he fucked me he raised his face up from my chest and his mouth and jaw were crimson with my blood he spilled my legs to either side and jerked me up off the desk so that i was suddenly pressed to the front of his body my legs wrapped around his waist he kissed me kissed me with the taste of my own blood like metallic candy in his mouth he was making low sounds in his throat and he drove us into the wall hard enough that my back slapped against it hard enough that if he hadnt cradled my head it would have hit the wall he drove himself into me again and again and again as hard and as fast as he could i wasnt tight anymore i was wet and loose and it didnt matter his chest and stomach were decorated with my blood startling crimson splashes against the white of his body he pressed his entire body against me as tight and close as he could so that the slickness of blood began to flow between us as he pinned me against the wall i held him with my legs locked around his body my arms locked around his shoulders i held him and he fucked me it was like he was trying to put a hole in the wall behind me so that every thrust felt like it was pounding me into the wall crushing me against his body i almost said enough almost said stop but as i drew breath for it the orgasm came like a huge overwhelming wave it engulfed me and i clawed at him and screamed and bucked against the weight and strength of him so that the orgasm became another kind of struggle another kind of fight my teeth dug into his shoulder my nails tried to find a way through his back and my body rode his while he pounded me into the wall and somewhere in all of that i felt his body convulse felt his hips drive in one powerful effort up and inside me he screamed as he came and i felt him pour himself inside me felt it as he put his hand against the wall and tried to steady us as his knees collapsed and we ended on the floor with my legs still wrapped around his waist him still inside my body his breathing was ragged and his eyes unfocused as he stared into my face mon dieu wow seems too junior high but amazing doesnt cover it i said i tried to touch his face but found that my arms werent working that well yet just promise me we can do it again some night he smiled and it was a tired smile but it held an absolute delight in it that is one promise ma petite that i will happily make ill hold you to it i said oh no he said and found that he had enough strength left to lean in against me i will most certainly hold it against you wed made our plan for the rest of the night when wed recovered enough to walk wed throw on our clothes pick up nathaniel and drive to the circus of the damned wed tuck nathaniel in somewhere and jeanclaude and i planned on a nice hot bath but before wed even gotten to the throwing the clothes on part my cell phone rang i almost didnt answer it because no one calls at three in the morning with good news the number blinking in the little window was detective sergeant zerbrowki shit i said what is it ma petite police i flipped the phone open and said hey zerbrowski whats up hey back at you im across the river in illinois guess what im looking at another dead stripper i said howd you guess im psychic i assume you want me to come down and look at the body never assume anything but in this case yeah i looked down at my bloodcovered chest and the wound that was still seeping ill be there as soon as i get cleaned up you covered in chicken blood something like that well the body isnt going anywhere but the witnesses are getting restless witnesses i said we have witnesses witnesses or suspects he said whats that supposed to mean come down to the sapphire club and find out the sapphire isnt that the high end club the one that calls itself a gentlemens club anita im shocked i didnt know you frequented the titty bars they wanted to use vampire strippers and i got to go talk to them about it i didnt know that was part of your official job description he said if it had been dolph i would have let it go but it was zerbrowski and he was okay the church of eternal life doesnt allow its members to strip or do anything else the church considers morally questionable so the club needed jeanclaudes permission to import vamps from the next territory over he gave it no and you went with him to help decide no you went alone he asked no he sighed oh hell just get down here if you said vampires were supposed to stay away from this place your boyfriend isnt going to be happy just no vamps on stage i said other than that not our business not on stage at least not paid zerbrowski said you said witnesses or suspects and now you say no vamps paid on stage shit are you sitting on some vamps that were in the audience come and see but id hurry dawns coming he hung up i cursed softly i take it a languorous bath is not going to be happening tonight jeanclaude said no unfortunately if not a bath for you then may i offer a quick shower here i sighed yeah i cant go see the police like this he looked down at his own bloodspattered body and smiled perhaps for me as well tonight we could conserve water and share i said he raised an eyebrow at me and smiled again the smile said worlds okay okay i guess wed get distracted i am not sure i have the strength to be as you put it distracted quite so soon sorry i keep forgetting boys dont recover as quick as girls i am not human ma petite with another blood donation i could indeed recover really i said my pulse sped just a little bit at the thought shit i was too tired and too sore to be thinking of it again truly he said i think if i donate any more blood to anything tonight it would be bad it does not have to be your blood he said i stared at him and he stared at me i said what i was thinking which id almost broken myself of so what you take blood from me then we fuck and you have a blood donor standing by and we fuck we could like what have a room full of donors and just screw until we were so sore or so tired we couldnt move i was sort of kidding the look on his face wasnt the look on his face the expression in his eyes made me blush i had a sudden image so strong if i hadnt already been on the floor it would have put me there i saw belle morte stretched in the big bed surrounded by candlelight asher and jeanclaude were on the bed too there were men tied to the big posts of the bed nude and pale they were blood glittered in thin lines on their bodies from neck chest the inside of their arms down their legs not one bite apiece or even two but more than i could count one mans head had slumped forward onto his chest and he sagged against his bonds if he breathed i could not see it jeanclaude pushed me out of his memory it was almost a physical shove i came back to myself on the floor of his office covered in my blood the phone still in my hand i would not have had you see that ill bet he closed his eyes and shook his head we were young and knew no better belle morte was our god you bled them to death so you guys could have some marathon sex session i said it and my voice wasnt horrified in fact it sounded empty because i could still see the memory not in livid detail like it had been but now it was in my head too god i did not need someone elses nightmares there are many things i have done ma petite that i would not have you know things i am ashamed of things that burn inside of me like bile it was your memory remember i felt what you were feeling there was no regret then i pushed you out too soon he didnt pull me in he simply stopped pushing me out and i was back in that room back in that bed i was inside jeanclaudes head when he noticed the man on the bed that wasnt moving he crawled across the bed and touched the cooling flesh i felt his sorrow felt his shame had his knowledge that these were humans that trusted us humans that we had promised to protect give us your blood and your bodies and we will keep you safe i looked back at belle morte stretched nude and luscious under ashers body ashers body before the human church had scarred him i watched ashers face lift up meet our eyes and in the middle of what belle thought was the most sensuous of nights the seed was sown that we must escape that there were things that you did not do and lines you did not cross and she was not a god and i was back in his office with my blood drying on my body and my breast beginning to ache and i was crying he stared at me dry eyed and he expected me to run to turn away and run like i had so many times in the past nothing was pretty enough for me nice enough clean enough i didnt like messy people in my life and once that had been true until i woke up one day and realized that i was one of the messy people my voice was steady and didnt sound like i could have tears drying on my face i used to think i knew what was right and what was wrong and who the good guys are and who the bad guys are then the world got very gray and i didnt know anything for a long time he just looked at me his face closing down hiding from me because he was certain where i was going what i would say there are days hell weeks when i still dont know anything ive been pushed so far outside what i thought was right and wrong that some days i dont know my way back ive done things in the name of justice in the name of my version of justice that i wouldnt want anyone to know i can look a man in the eyes and kill him and i feel nothing nothing jeanclaude nothing you didnt mean to kill and you felt bad about it you take life to protect life ma petite i have taken lives for pleasure for the pleasure of she whom i served he shook his head and slowly drew his knees into his chest hugging himself tight did you ever wonder why i did not replace the vampires that you and edward and even i later killed when we destroyed nikolaos i hadnt really thought about it i said i know were suddenly lousy with vamps when we seemed a little empty before i called vampires home to me because i had taken them long ago but i have not made a new vampire since i became master of the city it had kept us dangerously low if we had truly had another territorys master declare full war we would have lost we simply lacked the manpower so why not make more i asked because he seemed to want me to ask he looked at me and there was something in his eyes that reminded me of someone else it was a look of pain and confusion and centuries of hurt id never seen his eyes so raw so human because to make them vampire i must first take away their mortality their humanity who am i to do that ma petite who am i to decide who will live on and who will die in their appointed time who are you to play god i asked yes he said yes who am i to know what it will change belle used to use our power to change countries wars who ruled who was assassinated there was a time when she ruled more of europe secretly than anyone knew even among the vampire council itself she killed millions through war and famine not by her hand but by her choices what stopped her the french revolution and two world wars even death itself must bow before such wanton destruction now the council rides tighter rein on its members the time when any in europe could build such a secret power structure is finished glad to hear it i said what if i take someone and make them as i am and that person would have cured cancer or invented some great thing vampires invent nothing ma petite we are consumed by death and pleasure and senseless power struggles we seek money comfort safety so do most people he shook his head but not all and my kind are attracted to those who hold power or wealth or are unusual in some way a beautiful voice a gift of artistry of mind or charm we do not take the weak as most predators do we take the best the brightest the loveliest the strongest how many lives have we destroyed over the centuries that could have made some wonderful or terrible difference to humanity to the world at large i looked at him and not that long ago i would have distrusted this sharing but i could feel him in my head i worried about whether i was a monster jeanclaude knew for certain he did not regret what he was for he could not imagine another life but he worried about others he worried about making the choice for others he worried about playing some dark god he worried that one day he would become that which he ran from one day he would become a version of belle morte what do you do when you are suddenly able to see that far into someones darkest fears what do you say to that much truth about someone else i said the only thing i could think of the only thing that would give him any comfort youll never become like belle morte youll never become as evil as that how can you be certain of that he asked because ill kill you before i let that happen and my voice was soft when i said it because it wasnt a lie kill me to save me from myself he said and he tried to make light of it and failed no kill you to save everybody else youd destroy my voice wasnt soft anymore even if it destroys you at the same time yes even if it drags our tortured richard down with us yes i said even if it cost damian his life i nodded yes even if nathaniel died with us i stopped breathing for a second and time seemed to do one of those stretches where you have all the time in the world and none of it my breath came out shaky and i had to lick my lips before i said yes on one condition and that would be he asked that i could guarantee that i wouldnt survive it either he looked at me and it was a long long look a look that weighed me down to my soul and i realized that in a way thats exactly what hed done years ago you told me once that im your conscience but thats not all i am is it what do you mean ma petite im your failsafe im your judge your jury and your executioner if things go wrong not things ma petite me if i go wrong there was a peacefulness in his eyes as if some weight had gone from his shoulders i knew exactly where that weight had gone you bastard id have been happy to kill you once but not now not now if it is too much to ask then consider it unasked unsaid no you bastard dont you understand if you do go mad and start slaughtering the innocent i am exactly who they will send i am the executioner i stared at him but ma petite you were always the one they would send you have always been the executioner i got to my feet my knees werent weak anymore but ive never been in love with someone i had to kill before but you have told me that your love for me would not stop you from doing your duty my eyes burned no it wont if you go bad ill do my duty i closed my eyes and shook my head you machiavellian bastard i would have killed your ass without being in love with you i did not want you to love me because you would be my failsafe as you put it i wanted you to love me because i was in love with you his voice was close and when i opened my eyes he was standing in front of me it is only lately that i have worried that you were so besotted with me that you might forgive me crimes in this lifetime now i shook my head no no i had to know ma petite dont call me that not right now he took a deep breath and let it out anita i am sorry i would not cause you pain not deliberately then couldnt this conversation have waited until the afterglow faded no he said i had to know if you loved me more than your sense of justice i swallowed hard i would not cry i would not fucking cry i could not love thee dear so much loved i not honor more he took my hands and i almost jerked away but i made myself stand there and let him touch me i was so angry so pissed so tell me not sweet i am unkind he said that from the nunnery of thy chaste breast and quiet mind i looked up at him and said the next line to war and arms i fly true a new mistress now i chase he said the first foe in the field i said and let him draw me closer and with a stronger faith embrace he said a sword a horse a shield and the last word was whispered against his chest still looking up into those eyes searching his face yet this inconstancy is such as thou too shalt adore he whispered against my hair i finished the poem with my face pressed against his chest listening to the beat of his heart that truly beat with my blood i could not love thee dear so much loved i not honor more to lucasta on going to the wars jeanclaude said his arms were around me holding me close i eased my arms around him slowly richard lovelace i said always liked his stuff in college i kept moving my arms until they were around his waist and we just stood there holding each other i dont think i would have remembered the whole poem if you hadnt helped together we are more than we are apart anita that is what love is i held him and the tears started down my face hard and hot and choking not anita i didnt have to see his face to know the smile was there i could hear in his voice ma petite ma petite ma petite there comes a point where you just love someone not because theyre good or bad or anything really you just love them it doesnt mean youll be together forever it doesnt mean you wont hurt each other it just means you love them sometimes in spite of who they are and sometimes because of who they are and you know that they love you sometimes because of who you are and sometimes in spite of it the sapphire club is a low wide building and doesnt look that nice from the outside it doesnt look that different from many of the rest of the bars and clubs in the area so why is it a gentlemens club and the others are just titty bars security decor and a dress code for the dancers for starters tonight the vip parking area was so full of official and semiofficial vehicles that you could barely see the front of the club through the flashing lights and milling people there was even a big fire truck and a rescue truck alongside the regular ambulance i had no idea why we needed the big truck but murder scenes always attract more people than you really need more cops and more civvies more everything there was a crowd pressed against the police tape and sawhorse barriers some of the women looked barely dressed for the october cold so it had to be people from the nearby clubs most of the dancers arrived at work in street clothes then changed there so at least some of the women shivering in the cold had left work elsewhere to join the gawkers i actually had to park in the lot of the nearest club the jazz baby live music and live entertainment what could be better sleep maybe it was nearly four in the morning my shower had beaten the record for speed but it was still quite a drive from the riverfront wed managed to get blood on the front of my shirt so i was wearing a tshirt that jeanclaude had found for me somewhere it was white so the black bra showed through or would have if i hadnt been wearing byrons leather jacket again maybe i could just keep the jacket on no itd be warm inside oh well if the worst thing that happened tonight was that someone noticed i was wearing a black bra under a white shirt wed count ourselves lucky jeanclaude had also found underwear again it was thong but it was actually comfortable because it was made of soft tshirt material even the bit that went between your cheeks most of the girl thongs id looked at had had elastic or lace running up your ass and that just didnt look comfy at all i had to flash the badge just to get through the crowd when i got up to the line the officer closest to me didnt really look at me he saw a woman in boots and a short skirt and a leather jacket and said clubs closed for the night you wont be working i shoved my badge into his face and he had to back up to focus on it actually officer and i read his name tag in the bright lights douglas i think i will be working tonight he looked down at me because he was taller than me i watched his face try to wrap around the look of me and the badge in one package he wasnt the first police officer to have a problem putting it all together and he wouldnt be the last i might think like a cop but i dont really look like one especially not tonight im marshal anita blake sergeant zerbrowski called me always good to remind people that i hadnt invited myself into their party i had the authority to do it but i tried to do as little uninvited butting in as i could no cop no matter what the flavor likes someone horning in on their case especially not a big one officer douglas stared at my badge like he didnt believe it was real no one told me that the feds were coming ya know its four in the morning i asked your permission to cross this line as a courtesy but this badge is a federal badge and it gives me the right to cross this line enter this crime scene and do my fucking job if you stop me officer douglas i will charge you with obstructing a federal officer in the performance of her duty he looked like hed swallowed something sour but he waved another officer over he had him take his place at the barrier and held the tape for me ill walk you through maam i guess i couldnt blame him i mean what if the badge wasnt real or wasnt mine of course if id been a big strapping guy he wouldnt have had a problem with it you can always tell a new cop from a veteran new ones still judge a lot on appearance once youve been on the cop for a few years you stop doing that because by then youve learned that whats on the outside doesnt tell you that much about whats on the inside a cute little old lady can pull a trigger just as well as a big scary looking guy rookies dont know that yet they havent learned the lesson that you cant tell by looking officer douglas didnt shorten his stride for me and he didnt need to i was used to walking scenes with dolph who made douglas look petite i kept up with him even in the highheeled boots he looked like he wanted to say something but he didnt probably just as well some of the police on this side of the river dont know me on sight they thought what douglas had thought that i worked here because they catcalled after us hey dougie going to get a piece no lap dances on company time douglas and worse i ignored it all it was four in the morning and i hadnt been to bed yet i didnt care besides id learned the hard way that the more attention you pay to shit like that the more you have to shovel ignore it and it usually goes away because it just isnt any fun if they dont get a rise out of you besides they were teasing douglas more than me i was just the nameless girl who gave them an excuse he ignored it but his face was blazing by the time we got to the main doors he actually held the door for me and i let him thered been a point in my life when i would not have let him hold the door but with his face already burning with embarrassment i wasnt going to arm wrestle him for the door i might have to work with him again so screw it he could hold the door besides if i put him on the spot about the door it would have given his coworkers more to tease him about and i didnt want that we went through the glass doors into a little entry area that reminded me of the front of a nice restaurant complete with a little desk and a maоtre d though that probably wasnt the tall guys official title but hey he was wearing a white suit jacket with a tie he did look like a maоtre d when id seen him last he was tall and selfassured and had taken my name and ashers and called on a phone to have a hostess escort us in now he leaned on his counter head in his hands looking ill there were bathrooms off to the left and a short hallway that led into the club from the door you really couldnt see into the club it gave them a last chance to keep out the undesirables or the underagers before someone saw breasts the color scheme was muted blues and purples and if they hadnt had silhouettes of naked women on the walls it would have looked like a restaurant oh and the poster advertising that wednesday was amateur night i couldnt remember the big guys name just couldnt remember it but it didnt matter because douglas took me past him without a word up the little ramp and the club spilled out around us there was a good solid bar area to the left that would have done any club proud but the rest of the room was all strip club i mean what else do you use little round stages for the room was mostly blues and purples and maybe other colors i couldnt tell for sure because most of the big room was lit by black light or other odd lighting so that the room was lit but it was still terribly dark id been surprised the first time i was here it was as if light could be dark so that though there was no actual shadowed area the whole room seemed like it was in a shadow it was a weekend night the place was packed but quiet theyd had to turn off the music and the djs endless prattle was mercifully absent in fact the room seemed wrong this quiet as if the noise was part of the decor there were men and more women than youd think in the audience huddled now all together like mourners at an unexpected funeral the dancers were all in one corner with a plainclothes detective that i didnt recognize a big man in a uniform that matched officer douglass strode toward us with a notebook in one hand and a pen in the other he still had his hat on as if his round face would have been incomplete without it douglas what the fuck are you bringing me another stripper for we got all the girls that were in the club tonight over there he motioned with his thumb over his shoulder he had small beady eyes or maybe i was just tired of being called a stripper and discounted like i didnt matter just because i happened to be a girl and not in uniform unless you saw somethin outside did you girlie see anything i raised my badge so he could see it and stepped around douglas so i was facing what had to be his boss federal marshal anita blake and you are i could see his face darken even in the odd lighting sheriff christopher melvin christopher he looked me up and down not the way a man will if he thinks a woman is pretty but like he was sizing me up and wasnt impressed you know if you dont want people thinking youre a stripper you should dress better miss thats marshal blake to you sheriff and in the big city this is called date clothes dresses down to your knees went out of style a few decades back his face got a little darker his eyes went from unfriendly to hostile you think youre funny no i said and i took a deep breath in and let it out slow look you stop calling me a stripper and ill stop making cute remarks at you lets both pretend were here to solve a crime and just do our jobs we dont need federal help here i sighed i looked around the room and didnt see anyone i knew fine you want to do it this way we can do it this way if you prevent me from questioning all the vampires before dawn comes i will charge you with obstructing a federal officer in the performance of her duties some of them your friends that it i heard you were coffin bait i shook my head and walked wide around douglas which put me out of reach for the sheriff where the hell are you going to question the witnesses i said and i kept a little bit of an eye on the sheriff because i wasnt sure what he would do how do you know where they are they arent out here or out in the parking lot so theyve got to be in the sapphire room i was almost to the little raised platform in front of a pair of nice wooden doors there was another uniformed officer in front of the doors i had been in there before so i knew the sound was muffled inside the room thats why i hadnt yelled for zerbrowski already i unzipped the leather jacket as i went up the steps i had my badge in my left hand held where the uniform on the door could see it clearly i wasnt really sure what i was going to do if the sheriff told his man not to let me in id learned that just because i had the legal right to be somewhere didnt mean the local police would make it easy they wouldnt actually lay hands on me or boot my ass out but if they wanted to be uncooperative they could be please move aside officer he actually started to step to the side but the sheriff said you dont work for her you move when i say you move i sighed and thought well shit then i had an idea i reached into the pocket of the leather coat be careful what you reach for the sheriff said from far too close behind me i turned so i could see him and the other officer i held up my cell phone no need to get excited sheriff just going to make a phone call he had his hands on his hips above his sam brown belt he hadnt unsnapped his gun so he wasnt serious he was just trying to see if id spook if he thought this kind of shit could intimidate me hed been playing in the shallow end of the pool for too fucking long i hit the buttons keeping an eye on the officers in the room a lot of them had stopped questioning or guarding or whatever they were doing to watch our little show zerbrowski answered on the second ring im in the club just outside the doors and why arent you inside the doors he asked sounding puzzled the sheriff has ordered his man not to move away from the doors not true the sheriff yelled but you sure as hell cant order my man to do shit i sighed loud enough so zerbrowski could hear it a little help here zerbrowski opened the door with the phone still in his hand thanks sheriff christopher i think marshal blake and i have it from here he clicked the phone shut smiled at everybody and moved aside enough for me to pass through but not enough for the sheriff who stood at the bottom of the steps glaring at him i finally realized that the pissing contest had started before i got there and id just gotten caught in it zerbrowski shut the door behind us and leaned against it shaking his head hes with short black hair going more and more gray every year when his wife makes him get it cut the hair is short and neat when he forgets or shes busy its curly and wavy and as untidy as the rest of him his suit was brown his tie was pale yellow and so was his shirt i think it was the first time id seen all his clothes match in all the years id known him okay match and not have food stains on them his glasses were silver and helped hide that his eyes were tired but not that he was pissed he took me off to one side by the fountain with a oncereallive stuffed lion crouching beside it the sapphire room is a cross between a hunting lodge a safari room and other things people think men think is masculine most of the room was carpeted in leopard print so that my first thought was always oh no a leopard blew up and plastered itself all over everything but hey animal prints are in this year people pay hundreds of dollars a night to be back here so they must like it zerbrowski turned his back on the room and motioned for me to move in front of him so that no one would see us talking welcome to the party why are you keeping out all of the sheriffs men when we pulled up they had the vampires in here and were using crosses on them they didnt touch them just made the crosses glow like hell and basically said you talk or we keep crosses out shit use of a holy item on a vampire for questioning was ruled assault what three months ago in federal court yeah he said and he raised his glasses up and rubbed at his eyes with his thumb and forefinger every vamp here could press charges i whispered he nodded and readjusted his glasses like i said welcome to the party before the ruling a lot of police departments had holy items as part of their uniform like lapel pins or tietacks but now they were back to carrying them undercover somewhere on their bodies holy items were now considered weapons when dealing with vampires which meant what the sheriff had done constituted assault with a deadly weapon was it just him or his men too some of his men before we got here they were all wearing little crossshaped lapel pins i got them to remove them but only after i threatened to call the closest fbi office i looked at him because no cop likes to call in what they so affectionately call the feebies id rather let the fbi take this entire case away from us than let crap like this go down the vampires are scared shitless now if there are any guilty ones here i cant tell it because theyre all either royally pissed or scared most of them wont even talk to us and legally they dont have to it didnt really show in his voice but he was as angry as id seen him i could see it in the tightness around his eyes the way his hands kept stiffening up zerbrowski was usually one laid back guy but everybody has their limits we got a hit from new orleans and pittsburgh very similar crimes two in pittsburgh five in new orleans then they moved here lucky us i said yeah he said but that means we have at least three more bodies to look forward to we need these nice citizen vamps to talk to us ill see what i can do do you have anyone you want me to start with i mean its weve got about three hours or less until dawn theyve got to be allowed to go home before dawn unless you can charge them with something weve got a woman dead in the side lot here multiple vampire bites and theyre vampires i could probably get a judge to agree to holding them as material witnesses i know a judge that hates vampires enough to give me a court order i shook my head were trying to smooth this over not make it worse right now they can only sue this city lets not give them a reason to sue us too he nodded then stepped aside and made a sweeping gesture with his hand they are all yours good luck there was a group of vampires around the big fireplace in the center of the main room none of them belonged to jeanclaude some of them were clustered around a table set in front of it the fireplace in huge thronelike chairs some on a cushioned seat near the fireplace one of the vampires was clutching an animal print cushion while he sat in front of the fire his eyes were wide and he looked shellshocked the other five were scared or angry or a mixture of both but they were holding it together better than the cushionhugger i showed them my badge and explained who i was but it wasnt the badge that made the cushionhugger whimper oh god theyre going to kill us shut up roger a tall vampire with sleek black hair and angry hazel eyes said why are you here ms blake we are being held against our wills and we are guilty of nothing except being vampires and you are i asked he stood and straightened a rather nice conservative suit i am charles moffat i know that name i said he looked nervous just for a moment then he tried to swallow it he wasnt twentyyears dead a baby youre one of malcolms deacons for the church of eternal life i said he opened his mouth then closed it and stood very tall and said yes i am and im not ashamed of it no but malcolm has forbidden any of his church members to frequent this side of the river for nefarious purposes how do you know what our master dictates he was trying to bluff and it wasnt going to work because malcolm talked to the master of the city and got him to agree to tell malcolm if any of the churchs members frequented his clubs you guys arent allowed to be anywhere this naughty you must and i quote be absolutely above reproach one of the vamps who was balding and wore glasses started rocking in his chair i knew we shouldnt have come if malcolm finds out she is jeanclaudes servant and she must tell him and he will tell malcolm actually the agreement was just to tattle about you coming to our clubs malcolm didnt ask us to keep an eye this side of the river the bald vampire looked up at me as if id offered him salvation you wont tell if you guys tell me everything you know about this i dont see a reason to the bald vampire touched charles moffats arm charles jerked away from him how can we trust you look im not the one who signed a morals clause with my master and has just been caught in a titty baryou guys have so if anyone is questioning someones word shouldnt it be me i mean a vampire that goes against the express orders of his master what good is he either to his master or his kiss we of the church do not use the wordkiss for a group of vampires malcolm feels that it is too sensuous a word fine but my point stands youve betrayed your master your church and your oath or dont you in the church take blood oath either a barbaric practice charles said we of the church are held by our own moral standards not some magical oath i smiled and motioned around the room hmm nice standards charles blushed which isnt easy for a vamp but it let me know hed fed tonight fed a lot who was your feed for tonight he just glared at me look guys its in the morning we have less than three hours to get your asses back to your homes we want you all out of here before dawn alright they all nodded then answer my questions i can tell which one of you has fed and which hasnt i need to know what dancers or donors you fed on if theyre in the other room i need to talk to them if they arent i need names and a way to contact them tonight the relationship between a vampire and their partner is sacred look charles youve got enough blood in you to blush you want me to start speculating where you got that much blood to waste we have already been threatened and abused you can do no more to us i turned to the rest who wants to answer my questions and get an iwonttellmalcolm card the bald vamp stood up charles yelled at him but baldie shook his head no you arent my master charles we are all free beings in the church its one of the reasons we joined im going to answer her questions because its within my rights to do so lets find a private room i said and motioned for him to follow me there was a truly beautiful saltwater aquarium in a little area that was probably meant to be a smoking room but there were smaller rooms off of it where normally you could take one of the dancers and get a private dance i took baldie into the first room it was actually nice not tacky in the least with a small couch a chair a coffee table and area lighting the room still pulled off that leather and manly den theme without being obnoxious about it have a seat i said he sat rubbing his hands over his knees nervous he was a little plump and soft he looked like an accountant except that when he licked his lips he flashed a little fang the new ones do that how long have you been in the church two years he was shaking his head i thought it would be sexy you know vampires the clothes the romance he clasped his plump hands together but its not like that at all im still a law clerk just at a different office where they let me work nights i cant drink cant eat a steak and dying didnt make me sexier he spread his hands wide look at me im just paler i thought the church required six months minimum of study before they let you take the last step he nodded they do but they made all the moral stuff seem highminded you know were better than those other vampires we arent perverts like jeanclaude and his vamps he looked up and was scared and it showed im sorry i didnt mean i know what the church says about normal vampire society it sounded so noble let me guess there was this woman that happened to be a vampire he looked up startled how did you know lucky guess and after you made the change what happened she was my partner for the first few months but after that she had other duties that was interesting and i filed it away for later if the church deacons were seducing members that might be called illegal at the very least questionably moral whod you feed off of tonight the question threw him and he blinked at me like a rabbit in headlights sasha her name was sasha and you brought her back here he nodded youre a club member he nodded again charles is too nod most of the people at the table are members nod then it was clarkes first time here and clarke is the one with the pillow how did you know i shook my head smiled and said do you remember any other girls that people fed off of names or descriptions he remembered a lot i ended up with four names two descriptions and only poor clarke had not fed of course id known that last part but its always nice to have things confirmed with zerbrowski as my guard we ventured out into the club and fetched the women in question we matched up every vamp with at least one girl charles had fed on three and he was a big tipper two of the girls were his regulars pretty naughty for a church deacon it took me a little more than two hours to match up those who had fed with whom theyd fed on it didnt mean they hadnt snuck out and fed again but it made it less likely i suggested that we could compare bite radiuses on the dead girl with the vamps later if we needed to we knew their names and knew how to find them the most interesting bit of information i found out was given up only by the first vamp i talked to and by clarke who was so scared hed have given up his mother there had been three other church members here earlier in the evening and they were also part of the crowd that liked to frequent the stripper bars but none of them were members of the sapphire room vip club i had their names and an address for the most newly dead of them maybe theyd had something to do with the murder or maybe they just gotten bored and went home early it wasnt a crime to leave a place zerbrowski had actually called in state troopers to back us up as we escorted the vampires to their cars none of them was powerful enough or old enough to be able to fly home when wed gotten the last of the undead safely off in their minivans and compact cars zerbrowski took me to one side and said did i hear you right the vamp church makes their members sign a morals clause i nodded other vamps call them nightshirt mormons he grinned nightshirt mormons really honest oh i will have to remember that one thats good he looked behind us at the waiting ambulance fire truck and all the personnel now that youve helped save the vamps how about looking at the actual crime scene thought youd never ask he grinned and it almost pushed the tiredness out of his eyes i get to go first down the ladder he said i frowned at him what ladder our murder scene and body dump are in a hole left by some overzealous construction workers according to the club manager they broke ground but didnt have all their permits in line so its just a big hole thats why we need the firemen to help us get the body up out of the hole when youre done with it you are not going ahead of me down the ladder zerbrowski what are you wearing under that little bitty skirt none of your damn business and if you dont let me go first down the ladder ill tell your wife on you he laughed and a few people looked our way they were colder than we were and just as tired i dont think they saw anything to laugh about katie knows im a lech i shook my head how messy is it down in the hole lets see its rained its frozen its thawed and its rained some more shit i said where are those overalls you used to wear to all the crime scenes its against company policy to wear crime scene gear to a zombie raising now what i didnt say out loud was that id forgotten and worn overalls that had blood on them to a zombie raising the clients wife had fainted was it my fault that she had a fragile constitution it wasnt bert who said no more it was a majority vote at animators inc so i actually had to pay attention to the rule i didnt plan on climbing into holes and looking at bodies tonight the grin faded from his face me neither lets get this done i want to go home and hug my wife and kids before they go off to school and work i didnt point out that it was in the morning and his chances of making it home in time to see katie and his kids before they rushed off to their days were slim to none everybody needs a little hope who am i to take it away the woman in the hole was beyond hope or fear or whatever had happened to her her face looked empty the way the dead always do you get an occasional one that looks scared but its just happenstance the way their face muscles worked at the moment of death but mostly the dead look empty like something essential is missing something beyond just no breath no heartbeat id seen enough eyes do that last glaze to say that something more precious than breath goes with death or maybe i was just tired and didnt want to be standing ankledeep in mud staring down at a woman that was probably younger than i was and now always would be i get more morbid the closer to dawn it gets if i havent been to bed there were a lot of similarities to the first body this one was lying on her back just like the last one theyd both been strippers they were both killed just outside the clubs that they worked in this one was a blonde and white which was the same as the first one there were a set of bite marks on either side of the neck and one in the bend of her left arm right wrist and chest to see if she had thigh bites i was going to have to kneel in the mud and i didnt want to simple as that i didnt want to i promised myself i would never again be caught out anywhere without a pair of coveralls and mud boots id had to borrow gloves from zerbrowski id been thinking about my date not about my job when i packed the jeep earlier stupid me i stood up and debated on whether i could get away without crawling around in the mud and looking at all the bites shes taller by almost a foot than the last one blond hair but very short the last one had long hair other than that it looks damn similar the bite radiuses are the same who took the measurements i asked he told me and the name meant nothing to me i was across the river and i didnt actually do a lot of crime scenes here i killed vamps for illinois but i didnt do much actual investigative work i couldnt let someone else do it not if i didnt know them if even one bite radius was off it would mean a change of players in our vampire group we needed to know if we were looking for five or six or more i sighed and fetched my little tape measure out of the jacket pocket that id started keeping in the glove compartment with the baby wipes i measured the easytogetto bites first and had zerbrowski take notes then i planted my knee carefully in the mud between her knees the mud was cold i spread her legs and found the inner thigh bites i measured everything i could find the bite radiuses matched or ballparked i was using a different instrument to do the measuring which i shouldnt have done i shouldnt have let the csu technician let me use something i wouldnt have with me next time what you measured with could make a difference in the field the field was not a laboratory i got up from the ground carefully my goal was still not to slide on my ass in the mud highheeled boots were not the best thing to wear to guarantee that so i was careful the sapphire has security people walking their lot at least one security guy at any given time its the weekend there should have been two did they see or hear anything one of them saw the girl come out with her coat on she was headed home done for the night he saw her go toward her carhe riffled back through his notebookthen she wasnt there i looked at him what did you say he said she was walking toward her car he waved at her then something attracted his attention to the other side of the lot hes a little vague on what attracted his attention but he swears he only glanced away then when he looked back she was gone gone yeah why do you have that look on your face like that means something did he check her car right away he nodded yes and when he didnt find her at the car he went back into the club to see if shed gone back inside when he couldnt find her inside he got the other security guy and they started searching the area they found her how long does he think he looked away for he says a few seconds has anyone checked with anyone else inside who might have seen her leave id like to know what time she left the building and how long he was really staring off in the other direction lets just get out of the hole and find someone who saw her leave and actually looked at a clock he was riffling through his notebook again the lights that they had directed down into the pit illuminated everything in fact made it all a little stark and pitiless as if she needed to be covered up and not stared at anymore maudlin i was getting positively maudlin actually one of the ladies inside a customer had liked the blonde a lot she and her husband so she noticed the time when she left and how does it tally with the security guys statement he checked the times back and forth ten minutes ten minutes is an awfully long time to stare at something he isnt even sure he saw you think he lied i shook my head no i think he told what he thinks is the truth im lost what are you getting at zerbrowski asked i smiled at him but not like i was happy one of the vamps has to be a master we figured that but they also have to be able to cloud mens minds enough to pull something like this off i thought all vamps could cloud mens minds i shook my head they can mesmerize one person with their gaze and if they bite them then they can blank their memory if theyre powerful enough they can mesmerize with the eyes and blank most of the memory but the vic will usually have this vague memory of eyes or sometimes an animal with blazing eyes or car headlights that were very bright the mind tries to make mundane sense of whats happened okay so one of the vamps zapped him with its gaze no zerbrowski im betting it wasnt eyes im betting it was from a distance with no direct gaze ill talk to him see what he remembers but if hes bitefree and doesnt have some weird memory then it was done from a nice safe distance with no direct contact so what he asked and he sounded irritated and tired i didnt take it personally it means that one of the vamps is old zerbrowski old and a master vampire were talking fairly major talent here its a limited list names i shook my head lets talk to the security guy and get him to strip down for us he looked at me over the rims of his glasses before he pushed them back up his nose did you just say what i think you just said weve got to check him for vamp bites if hes clean then were looking for a major player vampirically speaking if hes got a bite then not so major trust me itll make a difference in who we talk to is this jeanclaudes people zerbrowski asked no i said how can you be sure he asked how could i be sure i was tired enough that i let that be a question in my head let me wonder what jeanclaude would say would he guarantee that this couldnt have been his people the thought was enough he was suddenly in my head shit he was seeing what i was seeing not good at a murder investigation when the vic had been done in by vamps i started to shield to kick him out but i suddenly knew the answer to my question my blood oath will hold them from this because it is against my express orders to bring us to the negative attention of the human police i thought liv broke your oath once and he heard me i was notle sourdre de sang then my oath is not so lightly shaken off now ma petite id been quiet too long zerbrowski said you okay just thinking i said id known about blood oaths but i hadnt actually understood how important they were or what they were supposed to mean because all of jeanclaudes people have to take a blood oath it binds them mystically to the master of the city hes forbidden his vampires to do shit like this youre saying the blood oath makes this impossible not impossible but harder it depends on how strong the master is that they make the oath to how strong is jeanclaude i thought about a way to explain it and finally settled for strong enough that id bet good money this wasnt his people but you wouldnt guarantee it guarantees are for major appliances not for murder he grinned thats cute i may just have to use that one sometime knock yourself out the grin faded round the edges i still dont really understand this whole blood oath thing maybe im just too tired for metaphysics explain it to me again later let me simplify it thatd be nice he said i just learned tonight from the vamps i questioned that malcolm has abolished the blood oath for the church its too barbaric jeanclaude was still in my head and heard what i said i got a rush of fear from him fear bordering on panic okay and that means what exactly zerbrowski asked i had to take a deep breath to talk around jeanclaudes fear his voice in my head said are you certain of this ma petite i let my out loud voice for zerbrowski answer jeanclaudes question too it means zerbrowski that you have hundreds of vampires in this area that have nothing to keep them from doing shit like this except their own consciences and a morals clause they all sign jeanclaude was cursing in my head in french and though i caught a word here and there most of it was too fast for me zerbrowski smiled and the smile broadened until it was a grin youre saying that the church trusts its members to be good little citizens and your boyfriend isnt that trusting ill look at the new masters that have come to town at jeanclaudes invitation but my money is on the church of eternal life dolph would say its because you dont want it to be jeanclaudes people yeah he would but ill tell you this zerbrowski the thought that all these new little vampires have only their human morals to make them be good makes me almost agree with dolph agree on what kill them all jeanclaude said do not say this out loud to the police ma petite it may come to that and you do not wish your friend to remember this conversation he was right shit anita some of your best friends are bloodsuckers yeah but there are rules to being a vampire and malcolm is trying to treat them like theyre just people with fangs they arent zerbrowski they really arent even if this turns out to be a bunch of rogues that somehow slipped through everyones radar mine jeanclaudes and malcolms we are so going to have to talk to him about his new policy why i do i think when you said we just now you werent including me or any of the cops he was looking at me and the joking lecherous comments were gone i was seeing a very intelligent pair of cop eyes i sighed and took a step toward the ladder id said too much way too much jeanclaudes voice in my head you must say something to take the sting out of your words ma petite out loud to zerbrowski i thought of something to say im tired zerbrowski please dont tell dolph that i think all the vamps in the church should be done in i dont mean it not really i wont tell anyone especially not dolph hed probably start with his new daughterinlaw and wouldnt that be a shit i nodded but if we had hundreds of vamps go bad all at once im still who gets the call i so dont want to ever have to try to take on that many of them im good but not that good for a few hundred even youd need help he said he let out a long breath i can see where the thought would piss you off and make you tired hell it makes me tired and nervous ill try to find out how long this nobloodoath policy has been in effect i said and then what i had my hands on the ladder ill deal with it ma petite you are being uncautious again i whispered get out of my head what does that mean anita youre a federal marshal you cant do the lone ranger shit anymore you got a badge i leaned my forehead on the ladder got mud on my face and jerked back i told him as much of the truth as i could well give malcolm a choice either he blood oaths everybody or jeanclaude does jeanclaude was suddenly louder than ever in my head stop there ma petite i beg you do not say it out loud what i didnt say out loud was that any vampire that didnt want to take the ceremony was probably dead i had jeanclaudes memory of it now and i knew the blood oath was one of their most strenuously observed laws id seen what could happen if the oath wasnt strong enough what would happen if it wasnt there at all i was actually on the ladder when zerbrowski said and what if the vamps dont want to take the oath i stayed frozen on the ladder for a second then lied im not sure im hoping that its just malcolm and not every church of theirs across the country thats doing this youre talking about something thats never been done before zerbrowski as far as i know no master vamp has ever just allowed vamps to breed like this without securing himself as their leader in more than just name its never been done before vamps arent big on new ideas are you talking about killing the ones that wont take the oath anita theyve got rights i know that zerbrowski better than most i was cursing malcolm cursing him for the mess hed started even if the murderers werent his people it was only a matter of time vampires are not people they dont think like people i realized that malcolm was trying to do with the church of eternal life what richard had tried to do with the thronnos rokke clan both of them were trying to treat the monsters like they were just people they werent god help us but they werent jeanclaude whispered we will need to send envoys to the church and see how bad it truly is i didnt answer because i was pretty sure who one of the envoys would be me i started up the ladder and only when zerbrowski whistled did i remember what i was wearing under the skirt blake you have a very nice dont say it zerbrowski why not because if you say it ill put you on the ground ass he said i warned you i said he laughed when we were both on solid ground i footswept him into a convenient patch of mud he cursed me everyone laughed he said ill tell katie you were mean to me shell be on my side and she would be in fact i knew katie zerbrowski well enough to know that her husband wouldnt tell her hed told me i had a nice ass shed consider it rude jeanclaudes echo in my head was but you do i told him to shut up too and this time he listened dawn is near and i must rest we will speak again when i wake pleasant dreams i whispered the dead do not dream ma petite and he was gone the security guy hadnt liked stripping i told him he could do it in privacy with just me and the nice officers watching or he could do it on one of the stages his choice hed looked like he didnt believe me but wasnt willing to risk it he was clean no vamp bites on the one hand shit because a master vamp is harder to catch harder to keep and harder to kill on the other hand great because the list of vamps that could do this was pretty small or it was if i understood the deal between malcolm and jeanclaude okay technically it had been a deal struck between malcolm and nikolaos the old master of the city having met her hell having killed her id sympathized with vamps flocking to the church and not wanting to owe her a damn thing but jeanclaude had honored her treaty with the church on a few conditions one no masterlevel vamps allowed in town without running it by jeanclaude so either malcolm had reneged on the deal or he didnt know that he had someone that powerful in his community or neither malcolm nor jeanclaude had felt someone that powerful enter their territory if that last were true we were in deep deep trouble because that would raise the power level to something none of us would want to deal with or had jeanclaude approved a master for malcolm without understanding that there would be no blood oath to keep control of it i had so many questions that my head hurt and no way of getting them answered until jeanclaude woke for the day i drove back to st louis in dawns early light happy i had sunglasses with me happy that i wasnt driving directly east the indirect brightness was bad enough the circus was closer than my own house so thats where i went i bunked there sometimes to have a date with jeanclaude but often just because it was closer to crash my eyes were so tired they burned and my body had that achiness that feels almost like youre sick but is just your body using up all its reserves to keep you awake and moving i pulled into the employee parking lot of circus of the damned at nearly in the morning there were three other cars in the lot one was jasons and i didnt know the others on sight but it had to be people who didnt just work here but also lived here and knew how to drive that narrowed it down i thought meng die drove and maybe faust but i just wasnt sure and was too tired to care i walked across the parking lot in the fast growing light and fought off an urge to hunch my shoulders i used my key on the back door and i pushed my way into the blessed dimness of a storage room i locked the door behind me leaning against it for a second or two not long ago there hadnt been a lock on the back door at all you had to have someone let you in but id had them put in a better door reinforced steel with a lock without the lock theyd had to keep someone in a little lookout up near the roof the lookout would send someone down if the person at the door needed in i said it seemed silly since there was a lock on the outer doors in front it just made it harder for the employees to get in and besides there was a small window just before dawn when sometimes the lookout was empty and that was often when i was trying to get inside banging on the door at dawn just got discouraging i made sure the door was secure behind me then i wound my way through the boxes that were always there to the big door that led to the stairs the stairs went down a long way down i was tired enough that if thered been an elevator i would have taken it but there wasnt the stairs were actually part of the defenses of the circus one it was a lot of stairs so you had to be fairly serious to go down them two there were places along the way that we could set up ambushes if we needed to three the stairs were oddly made as if whatever theyd originally been made for hadnt walked on two legs or at least hadnt been the size of a human being if you didnt know what awaited you down below you might start wondering what used these stairs actually just vamps and wereanimals but our enemies didnt know that jeanclaude encouraged the rumors that there were other things down here bigger less human things fine with me keep your enemies scared and guessing by the time i got to the big iron door at the bottom my vision was blurry from lack of sleep i dragged my keys back out the key to this door wasnt hard to find it was the only huge oldfashioned key on the ring it looked like a giant among dwarves compared to the modern keys i put the key in and the lock moved smooth and welloiled the hinges were just as quiet though probably if i had only been human strong i might have had to struggle with the weight of the door it was meant to withstand battering by bigger things than hands i closed it behind me and locked it and set the big bar in place if anyone else was dragging their ass in this late they were out of luck but you were usually safe this far after dawn to set the bigger lock in place the fact that it hadnt been set probably meant jeanclaude had figured id come here for the day i passed through the long silky curtains that formed the walls of the living room i actually didnt give much attention to the gold and white and silver furniture or the painting above the faux fireplace sleep was the only thing on my mind now that the outer door was locked i went to jeanclaudes room but i should have known better i found him and asher curled under the sheets both of them beautiful in death as in life ashers golden waves lay like metallic foam upon a white pillow his eyes were closed so i couldnt see his pale blue eyes like the eyes of a siberian husky as pale a blue as jeanclaudes were a dark blue asher lay on his side so that the unscarred side of his face was up to the light theyd left a light on for me probably without a light the room was dark as a cave no windows jeanclaude lay spooning against ashers back one arm over the other mans waist his hand trailing along the scars on the right side of ashers body asher had been the blond beauty to jeanclaudes brunette once then some wellmeaning church officials had captured him and used holy water to drive the devil out of him holy water acts on vampire flesh like acid on ours those same officials had burned ashers human servant and love julianna at the stake christianity is a fine religion but some of the things done in the name of it arent so nice i touched jeanclaudes face moved a stray lock of his hair behind one pale shoulder his skin was cool to the touch and would just get colder i kissed ashers forehead and it was like kissing the dead vampires didnt sleep at dawn they died they truly were animated corpses i just wasnt sure what exactly animated them i couldnt sleep in the bed with two corpses the cooling flesh just creeped me out i wasnt sure id ever be able to sleep with a vampire i mean really sleep which left me wondering what bed to use if thered been a couch in the room i would have used it but there wasnt until id asked there hadnt even been chairs when youve got a bed this big i guess who wants to sit in a chair i walked back out and closed the door softly behind me not that it would wake them but just out of habit i went to jasons room id bunked with him before i didnt knock because i expected everybody to be asleep and i was right jason was curled up tight on the far edge of the bed his blond hair showing just above the covers someone else was curled against his back and for just a second i thought id goofed and it was a woman but i knew that spill of auburn hair nathaniel was bunking here for the night again not the first time theyd left the bathroom light on with the door opened a crack i wasnt sure if it was for my benefit or so nathaniel would know where he was if he woke in the middle of the night the first few times id woken in absolute darkness in one of these windowless rooms it had been claustrophobic i liked a little light id cleaned the mud off my face in the car with the baby wipes and once i got my boots and hose off i was going to be mudfree it was nearly a miracle that i hadnt fallen down wearing the heels in the mud i took off the leather jacket and folded it nicely there was no chair so i sat flat on the floor and unzipped the boots and stripped off the hose putting them against a wall so no one would stumble over them the skirt was stiff with dried blood the fact that none of the vamps in the club had said anything about it said either that they couldnt smell it or they thought remarking on it would have been too barbaric i left the skirt in a pile by itself i wasnt even sure dry cleaning could save it i took off the white tshirt and made a third pile for clothes that were actually clean the bra went in that pile i put the tshirt back on and kept the thong underwear too id have slept better without the thong but the tshirt wasnt enough clothes id never slept nude with nathaniel and i had with jason only once when id passed out that way i needed jammies what i wanted more than anything in that moment was to wrap as much of my tired body around nathaniels body as i could and sleep i crawled under the sheets on the far side of the bed and moved until i touched nathaniels bare back the moment i touched him he stirred in his sleep i slid my body along his until i spooned him from behind which was how we slept most nights at home he wasnt wearing anything it wasnt a comment on sexual orientation for nathaniel and jason it was a comment about them both being wereanimals wereanimals just didnt see the point in clothes not if they could go without them i settled in against nathaniels body and he snuggled himself between my body and jason who never so much as stirred i put my face against nathaniels hair and the vanilla scent of it was enough i was home and i slept something woke me i wasnt sure what i was just suddenly awake in the dimness of jasons bedroom i was still curled against nathaniel and jason was a dim blond shape on the other side of him nothing had changed so what had woken me i lay there straining to listen there was nothing to hear it was just the boys quiet breathing the rustle of a sheet when jason moved in his sleep the room was utterly quiet had i heard something then i did hear somethingwater water running in the bathroom i slid my hand under my pillow and the browning was there in its holster if i wasnt at home with the gun in its bedframe holster then i kept the gun holstered and snapped just in case itd be a shame if someones hand accidentally offed the safety and another hand hit a trigger and well you get the idea i unsnapped the holster drew out the gun and put a hand over nathaniels mouth he jerked awake eyes wide i motioned with the gun toward the crack of the bathroom door he nodded and touched jasons shoulder as i slipped out of the bed and moved toward the bathroom i had the safety off the gun held twohanded pointed at the ceiling it could have been one of the other shapeshifters come to borrow a shower it would be like them not to wake anyone and just assume it would be alright itd be a hell of a thing to kill someone because they used the wrong shower i crossed wide around the door so my shadow wouldnt cross the light though probably with the dark room behind me that wouldnt happen but better careful than not i had to ball the black silk robe up over one arm to keep from tripping over it i didnt remember putting on a robe i was at the hinge side of the door and i went to one knee because if someone was on the other side with a weapon most people aimed higher than my head was when i knelt i kept as much of myself against the doorjamb as i could and began to ease the door open with my hands which were still cupped around the gun i was hoping to give my eyes time to adjust to the light before whoever it was noticed the door moving i knew better than to simply jump into the room from almost dark to bright light id be blind for a second or two if id been sure it was a bad guy id have fired blind but i wasnt sure there was water seeping out from under the door the robe under my knees was wet with it what i thought had been the shower running was the bathtub i could hear the difference now someone had flooded the bathtub what the hell was going on i had the door flat against the wall now and there was no one to be seen there was just the bathtub with water spilling over its sides and the water still rushing out of the faucet at full blast the lower part of my legs were soaked it was cold so cold like theyd turned on only the cold who took a bath in only cold water there was just the sink area a partial wall the stool and the bathtub shower the room was small enough that i could see it all in one glance there was no place to hide was this joke had someone crept in while we slept plugged the bathtub and turned on the water did they think wed notice before it flooded did they care stupid joke i got to my feet and started wading through the water it was ankle deep and that seemed wrong i mean it shouldnt be that deep the hem of the robe caught in the water pulled in the current like i was wading through a stream it was like ice so cold so very cold i was standing over the bathtub now and the water was cloudy i couldnt see to the bottom of the tub and that was wrong it wasnt that deep it was a white tub and this was clear water why couldnt i see through it i kept the gun up but reached to turn off the water i halfexpected something to grab my hand but it didnt the faucet just turned off and the silence that followed was deafening small noises now water sloshing sliding around the room the water cleared like a glass of water from a tap when theres too many minerals in the water that milky stuff settling to the bottom and there was something in the water something swimming out of the murk coming into focus a pale hand a spill of red hair and i was staring down into damians face his eyes were wide and dead but it was daylight he was dead he didnt need to breathe he could be under water it wouldnt hurt him but logic didnt help seeing him floating there i did what i would have done if hed been humani reached for him i dropped the gun to the floor and plunged my hands into the tub i touched him grabbed handfuls of his shirt and i started to pull him up up through the water but it was as if the water was heavier than it should have been so heavy and so cold he was almost at the top almost when i realized it wasnt water it was ice he was frozen in a huge block of ice and my arms were frozen with him trapped with him anita anita nathaniels voice his hand on my shoulder and i woke to jasons bedroom my pulse was choking me i sat up and stared around the bathroom door was open a crack but there was no sound of water dream just a dream i started to shiver except that i was still freezing so cold so very cold i dreamed dreamed of damian he was so cold in ice your skin is like ice nathaniel said jason was sitting up his short blond hair tousled and his eyes heavy with sleep whats wrong nathaniel wrapped his arms around me rubbing his hands against my cold arms when did you eat last anita with you the driveup that was over twelve hours ago he looked at jason she needs food now jason didnt ask questions just crawled over the bed and dropped to his knees beside the mini fridge that acted as one of his bedside tables he pulled out a bowl of fruitapples bananas i dont like cold fruit i said anita you dreamed about damian because youre eating his energy eat a banana nathaniel said i suddenly knew he was right the cold was making me stupid jason handed me the fruit but nathaniel helped me peel it because the shivering had gotten worse and i couldnt peel it shit nathaniel fed it to me in pieces while my teeth started to chatter when id managed to get it down the shivering was a little less but not a lot meat protein nathaniel said jason lifted out a carton of chinese takeout but shook his head without offering it too old he got out a flat foam container and handed it up fajita fixings from el maguey from yesterday nathaniel opened it lifted out a piece of the beef with his fingers and held it close to my mouth eat i ate and the meat was unbelievably good even cold the meat seemed to fill up more than just my stomach i picked through the grilled onions and peppers and ate the beef when my skin wasnt cold to the touch and id stopped shivering i slowed down then shook my head i cant eat any more youve eaten most of the meat jason said he was kneeling beside the bed his arms propped on it his chin resting on his arms did i hear nathaniel say that you were eating damians energy i nodded jeanclaude said that youd formed a second triumvirate with nathaniel and damian apparently i said i take it theres a learning curve he said you could say that this is the second time in less than twentyfour hours that ive almost killed damian jasons eyes went wide how shes trying to do what she always does nathaniel said handing the now closed box to jason barely eat barely sleep not do anything to take care of herself except exercise i cant tell the cops oh sorry i need a nap i said no but i told you that you needed to eat more i told you that you were acting more like a lycanthrope than a vampire all you had to do was go through another driveup there are allnight driveups i didnt like his tone i didnt think of it i just wanted to get to sleep i was so tired i was nauseous or maybe you were nauseous because your energy was bottoming nathaniel said and he was angry but you didnt think of that did you no i didnt happy no he said because once damians dead who do you think youll start draining next he was so angry that his eyes had darkened so they were almost purple i started to be angry back because the nightmare had scared me and endangering damian again had scared me i felt stupid that i hadnt thought to eat when nathaniel had explained it to me id just been so tired come to think of it id been more tired than i should have been hadnt i i wanted to be angry at him because it was my fault i hate it when its my fault i hate being wrong especially this wrong youre right youre right im sorry i am youre not going to argue jason asked why argue when ill lose i was careless its not just the triumvirate or the new one its theardeur ive finally got it conquered sort of what does sort of mean he asked and came up to sit on the edge of the bed he was nude hed been nude the whole time i just really hadnt noticed i noticed now and gave him very good eye contact it means that theardeur doesnt rise on its own anymore thats a good thing right jason said he was studying my face like he was puzzled by my expression thats the good news i said the bad news is that theardeur doesnt rise but it still needs to be fed it wont remind me its time to be fed thats what happened with damian earlier i hadnt fed theardeur in over twelve hours a lot over but it hadnt raised either so you didnt feed it nathaniel said softly exactly i said and you started sucking energy off of damian he said i nodded he called inside my head sort of then you fed theardeur jason said i nodded before you got to the club nathaniel said and his voice was soft yes i turned and looked at him and what i saw in his eyes both made me feel bad and pissed me off he looked hurt and it wasnt my fault but saying it wasnt my fault that i had to have sex with other men sounded wrong somehow so i didnt say it he had every right to be tired of me fucking everyone but him i did the minimum for a snack just to tide me over i said with who he asked and his eyes were wide and careful requiem if you were already feeding off of damians energy then you needed to have fed theardeur earlier right jason said i think he actually wanted to know but i think he was also trying to stop a fight before it started i wasnt sure we were going to fight but i wasnt sure we werent either i thought about jasons question and finally said yeah i guess so you gain energy through theardeur right yeah and now youre the power source for a new triumvirate your energy powers damian especially and to a lesser extent nathaniel why a lesser extent for me nathaniel asked youre alive you make your own heart beat damian doesnt nathaniel nodded okay whats your point jason i know you have one would i have a point he said with a grin i shook my head theres a very fine mind hiding behind those baby blues you just dont let everyone see it so yeah you have a point what is it anita is having to eat more often right we both nodded what if she needs to feed other things more often i think we both took breath to ask what he meant then we both got it at the same moment oh shit i said nathaniel said oh god before tonight it was every twelve hours fourteen if i stretched it i said how much more often could i need to feed jason spread his hands wide how should i know im just pointing it out it makes sense nathaniel said you fed off of requiem about how long before we fed i thought about it tried to do the math in my head and it was harder than normal because that little flutter of panic was so loud two hours maybe less i shook my head no absolutely not i cannot feed theardeur every two hours no but you could keep like snacks in the jeep and eat every two hours nathaniel said like i said if you meet one hunger the other hunger lessens the panic pulled back a little not much but a little are you sure that peanuts in the car are going to do it he shrugged i dont know but i think so he suddenly looked young and not sure at all i hugged him and he hugged me back god nathaniel god we were already low on daytime feeds what am i going to do i let some of that panic out in my voice he squeezed me tighter well work something out im sorry i got mad about requiem its just that everyone gets me and you dont i said he nodded then drew back enough to smile at me that wonderful smile he took my hand and placed it on the side of his neck i felt the marks of my teeth under my fingertips this was good anita this was exactly what i wanted in that moment exactly i had to smile back at him but the smile didnt last what time is it jason answered ten oclock great less than two hours of sleep out loud i said i fed on you at about two in the morning which means its only been eight hours eight hours is too soon nathaniel he looked at me and there was a fierceness there a determination make love to me anita make love to me and then you can feed on someone else but youre right i am tired of watching everyone get there before me he was on his knees and he touched my arms not quite clutching at me not quite holding me make love to me and i wont have a reason to be jealous ill still be having to have sex with other men i said why wont you be jealous because ill know that you want to make love to me and you have to have sex with them my head was beginning to hurt nathaniel often made me feel out of my depth i loved him and wanted him but hell i didnt know what to say to him if it was you in other womens beds id be jealous no matter the why he blushed would you really be jealous of me i wasnt entirely happy watching you get pawed at the club so yeah i think it would bother me i think thats the nicest thing youve ever said to me that im jealous of other women around you he nodded youve had girlfriends be jealous of you before i said he shook his head ive never had a girlfriend i stared at him i didnt know what to say i knew he wouldnt lie about it but i just found it hard to believe youve been in pornographic movies youve been a prostitute he finished for me and his eyes never flinched yeah im sorry but fucking isnt dating anita fucking for money really isnt dating but i said he touched my lips with his fingers hush he said you are the first girlfriend ive ever had i stared at him with a sort of soft horror growing in my mind i was his first girlfriend i couldnt wrap my mind around it how can you do porn and be a prostitute and not date some of the confusion must have shown on my face because he smiled and touched the side of my face the bandage had come off and he traced the healing scratches that barbara brown had given me i told you youre the first person who ever wanted me for me not because of the way i looked and what i could do with my body you love me without sex you let me take care of you you let me organize your kitchen you cook in it more than i do i said he smiled and his eyes were gentle as if i were the child and he was so much older than i was thats it anita you let me buy the tea set even though i know you think its sort of silly you like the tea set i said he nodded you do things not because you want them or enjoy them but because it makes me happy ive had people buy me jewelry clothes weekends in great hotels and spas but no one ever let me buy what i wanted with their money only what they thought i wanted let me remake their schedule let me make a place for me in their life he cupped my face between his hands maybegirlfriend isnt the right word but i think any other word i could think of will make you run away and i dont want that my lips were suddenly dry make love to me he whispered and started to lean in for a kiss i felt the bed move on the other side i had to fight the urge not to grab jasons arm or something anything to keep him with us anything not to be alone with nathaniel ronnie was right it wasnt rational but i felt like if i consummated our relationship i had to keep him she was wrong it wasnt sex that was a commitment for me anymore theardeur had taken that away from me but sex with the right person was still a commitment and the person bending in to kiss me oh so gently was the right one i turned out of that kiss to see jason going for the bathroom ill turn the shower on enjoy sorry to kick you out of your own bed i said and i was for more than one reason he grinned and tried not to as if he were pretty sure it would get him into trouble its not like i wont be back in it i stopped nathaniel from pressing closer with a hand on his shoulder and stared at jason whats that supposed to mean he fought to control his face and failed and finally looked pleased with himself you cant feed on nathaniel its too soon jeanclaude wont wake for awhile yet and if jeanclaude wont wake then asher is out too i narrowed my eyes at him so if theres another shapeshifter here that youd rather feed on than me ill get them for you graham is just down the hall the look on his face said plainly he didnt expect me to take him up on it you arrogant little uhuhuh he said now is that anyway to talk to someone whos going to let you feed on the very essence of his body i scowled at him then looked at nathaniel his face was utterly peaceful and youre okay with this honestly yeah honestly as long as im first yes i could stay and help with the foreplay jason said before i could answer nathaniel answered not the first time jason i want this to be just the two of us jason grinned more for me than nathaniel because he could see the expression on my face caused by nathaniels casual attitude toward making it a threesome later im going to go hide in the bathroom now he shut the door behind him and we were left with the bedside lamp i looked at him sort of outraged thanks for volunteering me for a threesome he looked puzzled i sleep with you and micah almost every night but were not having sex all at the same time he looked at me and the look said that i was protesting too much we dont i said anita you wake up you need to feed and whoever you didnt feed on the day before you touch but the other man doesnt always crawl out of bed ive watched you have sex with micah more than once and hes watched you feed off of me the headache was beginning to pulse behind my eye i was having trouble swallowing and it had the familiar taste of panic i know that you and jeanclaude are with asher together i know that thats a true threesome not all the time i said and even to me it sounded weak he frowned at me theres nothing wrong with enjoying being with two men at the same time anita my pulse was threatening to choke me yes there is and my voice was breathy why why is it wrong he leaned into me as if hed kiss me but i leaned away and it was one of those stupid moments because leaning away put me on the bed so that i was looking up at him there was no logic to pulling away from a kiss and putting myself flat on the bed of course there was no logic to the screaming panic inside my head either he propped himself up on his arms and looked down at me with that smile that said i was being silly i understood in that moment that id been wrong to think of him as a child that one look let me know that in his own way hed been as careful of me as id been of him that he thought of me as sheltered innocent that in many ways i was a child in the face of his experience it was one of those moments when a relationship changes when the way you look at the world suddenly expands or explodes and the world that was isnt the one that is there a heartbeat later we stared at each other and i dont know if it showed on my face or if it just occurred to him too or what but he hesitated and smiled down at me whats wrong he asked the question seemed so ridiculous that i laughed oh i dont know ive almost killed damian twice i thought controlling theardeur would make things easier and it hasnt i had intercourse with byron byron of all people i almost raised the entire cemetery tonight i could feel it like some army of the dead just waiting for me to wake it i could feel it nathaniel feel the power of it i was crying and hadnt meant to be so much went wrong today he kissed my tears as they slipped from my eyes gently so gently lets make something go right he kissed me and the salt of my tears lay on his lips but he kissed me again a little more forcibly anita please stop talking i frowned up at him why so we can fuck he said i opened my mouth and dont know what i would have said because he spoke first make love to me and he leaned over me consummate me i thought he was going to kiss me but his lips moved lower and he kissed the front of my neck then moved a little lower screw me and he kissed the mound of my breast through the tshirt suck me he raised the short shirt up spilling my breasts free i started to protest but the look in his eyes on his face stopped me he put his lips over my nipple just below the bandage that covered jeanclaudes bite he licked a long solid line over my breast and rolled his eyes to meet mine fuck me id like to say that i had something equally salacious to say or something suave but for the life of me the only thing i could think to say was okay it wasnt suave and debonair but when you love someone you dont always have to be suave and debonair sometimes you can just be yourself and okay said at the right moment is sweeter than any poetry and can mean more to someone than all the pillow talk in the world the tshirt and undies went in the first rash of hands but id never tried to touch him when it wasnt a metaphysical necessity id never just turned to nathaniel because i wanted him it wasnt that i didnt find him attractive god knows i did but i hadnt realized until those first few moments how much id come to rely on theardeur id thought of it as only a curse but i appreciated for the first time that it greased the wheels for me it got me over the embarrassment the awkwardness the goodgirlsdontdothis attitude without theardeur it was just me and the inside of my head was ugly nathaniel noticed because he notices everything he propped himself up on one elbow and looked down at me whats wrong i wasnt sure how to say it and that must have shown on my face because he said just say it anita whatever it is i looked up at him and fought the urge to gaze down the length of his body i had to close my eyes and finally said without theardeur its just me its just me and im i sat up im not comfortable with me i started to nod then stopped and said the real truth with myself he moved forward on the bed so that he rested his face against the small of my back he was so warm what does that mean exactly how did i explain something to someone else that i didnt really understand myself i dont know if i can explain it i said the bathroom door opened and we both looked up jason was there with a towel around his waist he wasnt wet but he was wearing a towel id been around the shapeshifters long enough to think that was odd i cant stand it he said i just cant stand it what i said youre going to fuck this up i looked at him and it wasnt a friendly look dont glare at me he came to stand at the end of the bed hands on hips ive told you that id give almost anything to have someone look at me the way nathaniel looks at you yeah but but nothing he said i thought you were growing changing but what you just said blames it all on theardeur you didnt do any of it not your fault if you fuck everything that moves while under the sway of theardeur youre still blameless i started to argue with him but couldnt think how to do it i finally said i sort of agree with what you said what of it god anita its not about blame you act like its a sin something must have shown on my face because he made a sound in his throat that was part growl and part exasperation i had to look away from the expression in his eyes the anger in them i was taught that it was a sin they also taught you that santa claus was real and you dont believe that anymore do you i crossed my arms across my body which lost some of its intended sullenness because i was naked and its never easy to be sullen when youre nude whats that supposed to mean he went down on his knees by the bed it means look at him i looked stubbornly at jason and not at nathaniel turn around and look at him or ill turn you around youll try i said fine you want to wrestle we can wrestle but wouldnt it be less embarrassing and less childish if you just turned around i took a deep breath let it out slow and turned around nathaniel was lying there on his stomach propped up on his elbows his face was what you noticed first those amazing lavender eyes with the remnants of the eye makeup still there making them look darker larger as if they needed any help to be amazing his eyes held such patience a calm surety that id fix this that it would be alright i didnt like anyone looking at me like that because life had taught me that it usually wasnt alright that i couldnt save everyone that i couldnt fix anything his lips held a slight smile there was no anxiety in him no fear that id run he looked at me with the calm face of a saint staring into the face of god secure in his faith safe in his knowledge trusting in a way that i had lost so long ago how could he look at me like that didnt he know better hed lived with me for four months didnt he know by now that i was screwed six ways to sunday and he shouldnt depend on me he ducked his head almost a bashful movement but it drew my gaze across the sweep of his shoulder down the curve of his back id only allowed myself to touch him below the waist once when theardeur was very new id covered his back and buttocks with bites and hed loved it and i had fed and id never let myself touch him that much again until the last two days that first time had been about feeding and i hadnt taken time to really see him really enjoy him because id looked at it as an evil necessity looking at him now i felt guilty for ever thinking of him like that he deserved better id made him put clothes on for months at least shorts even in bed but he was entirely too comfortable nude for me not to have caught glimpses of him even last night at the club i hadnt really let myself look at him not really because if id allowed myself to linger on his body id have lingered on the part that seemed to fascinate me most and no it wasnt what you think his back had a slight sway to it a curve that spilled to a lovely ass but at the farthest line of his back before it became not his back were dimples maybedimple wasnt the right word for them but i had no other word to use i stared at him now let my eyes linger rather than glance and look hurriedly away i let myself see not that he was nude but see his body i reached out to him and let myself do something that id wanted to do for months i traced my hand down the curve of his back and came to rest just there just at the end of his back before the swell of his ass he shivered just a little under the touch of my hand even though all i had done was lay my hand flat against his skin let the weight of my hand rest between those two dimples so low on his body it was as if when the clay had been wet god had placed his thumbs just above the swell of nathaniels rump as an extra sweetness like the idea that a dimple near the mouth is the kiss of an angel before the baby is born so those dimples on his body were like some extra grace i kissed ever so gently each of those smooth hollows like tiny shallow cups in his skin each mark was the size of my lips as if they were meant for me to kiss them i laid my head in the curve of his back rested my cheek on those marks of grace so that my face was slightly up tilted with the swell of his body leading my eyes down the curve of his rump and his distant legs and feet but for the moment i was content where i was i used his body as my pillow and just as my mouth fit to those kissable dimples so my head fit neatly in the curve of his body as if i were meant to rest there nathaniels breath went out in a long sigh and his body seemed to settle into the bed as if some tension that i hadnt even seen had run out of him and left him able to rest i trailed my hand across the curve of his ass and he made a small sound for me i trailed my fingers lower tracing the line of his thigh it wasnt that his legs were offlimits in the way that other areas had been but i realized that id divided his body along a line at his waist like some boundary in a war above the line was us below the line was forbidden his thigh was lush and smoothskinned and firm with muscle i brought my hand back up his leg and allowed my fingers to trace circles on his derriere those small movements drew small quick sounds from him almost sounds of protest i asked and my voice was as lazy and soft as my touch youre almost making pain noises does it hurt no he said and his voice showed a strain that his body didnt even hint at its just that ive wanted you to touch me for so long it feels amazing to have your head resting on me your hands on me god it feels so good i let my hand trace very delicately along the crack of his ass so that if there had been any little hairs i could have played with them but he was smooth utterly smooth it made me wonder if other things were as smooth i brushed my fingers down the line of his ass again tracing the separation between the cheeks until i found that first line of warm flesh that was neither ass nor more but a line of soft silken skin i put a finger on either side of that skin the softest of pinches and slid my fingers up and down nathaniel writhed under the touch his hands struggling against the sheets as if he wasnt sure what to do with them i raised my head from his back and kissed my way up his cheeks until i could lay my head one side of him like a pillow i caressed my hand down his thigh again and this time i made circles behind his knees and kept going until my fingertips could play with his ankles he laughed and struggled against the bed again like he had when i touched much more traditionally intimate places there are so many more erotic areas on the body than the small list that most people make i raised up from the pillow of his body so that i could pay more attention to his ankles drawing my nails lightly across that apparently sensitive skin he writhed for me his upper body coming off the bed and his breath shaking out in something between a sigh and a laugh i sat up so i could run my fingers across the bottoms of his feet and he sighed oh god i touched the front of his feet very lightly and he kicked his feet as if it were almost too much not everyones feet are that sensitive for foreplay but when someones feet are they really are i gazed up the line of his body while he lay gasping against the sheets id barely started so many choices i bent over his ankles and licked along the round bone tracing the skin with my tongue in thick wet circles he made protesting noises and started to kick his feet but i grabbed his foot with both my hands and held him against my mouth he made a sound that was almost a scream and gazed down at me along the length of his body there was something in his eyes that was wild and tender and amazed i bit down on that shallow flesh not hard just a graze of teeth but it rolled his eyes into his head and folded his shoulders onto the bed as if hed swooned i moved back up the bed so that i could lay my head not on one cheek but across that part of his body so that it was indeed my pillow the feel of his cheeks spreading under the side of my face made me close my eyes and have to relearn how to breathe for a moment i spilled my hand down the line of his body until i found that silken skin again but this time i used it like a line to trace to something else i found what i wanted and the skin was so soft softer than anything else id touched on his body his testicles were trapped underneath his body thick and round and delicate only part of them were trapped where i could touch them and the combination of his body weight and the excitement had made them swell so that the skin wasnt as loose as it would have been otherwise id wanted to play with all that fragile loose skin but it was already pressed tight around him to pull on it now might be more pain than pleasure no matter what nathaniel liked in that area i wasnt ready for it i slipped my body over his legs and pushed them farther apart so that i lay between them i laid my mouth against the inside of his thigh but stopped before i could decide whether i was going to kiss him lick him or bite him i stopped because i could see jason over the slope of nathaniels thigh truth was id forgotten he was there was that a bad thing to say or a good thing did it mean i was getting more comfortable with myself or that i was falling into the pit of whoredom whatever but i was suddenly frozen gazing over nathaniels body into those pale blue eyes it was what i saw in them that made me freeze lust would have been embarrassing but logical but that wasnt what i saw jason watched us with something in his face that was close to sorrow and his eyes held a longing a sense of loss i didnt know what to do with that look so i stopped and raised my face up from nathaniels body jason realized i saw him and he ducked his head when he looked back he had his face under control he almost pulled the joke off when he said dont stop on my account im enjoying the show his voice was fine but his eyes the lightness never quite reached his eyes liar i said he gave me an unhappy smile i thought you were too busy to notice me i should know that without theardeur you pay better attention whats wrong nathaniel asked im not sure i said dont worry jason said im not pining for you anita or nathaniel for that matter but i am pining for someone to take that much time and attention with me i frowned at him you can have sex and it can be good but id give almost anything to have someone touch me the way you touch nathaniel well probably have sex later and it will be great but you wont look at me like that i sighed i think i remember us having this conversation before you want to be consumed by love and my goal in life is never to be consumed at all ironic isnt it he said i want just once for someone to look at me the way you look at nathaniel and youve been scared to death of it you keep saying that theardeur is a curse but if theardeur had never come along you wouldnt have nathaniel or micah im not even a hundred percent sure youd be double dating with asher and jeanclaude i laid my arms across nathaniels cheeks and rested my face on my arms and looked at jason i looked at him and tried to hear what he was saying maybe about asher i mean once youve crossed enough lines one more doesnt seem that big a deal exactly jason said so theardeur is what a blessing look at what youre propped up on and tell me it isnt i heard you earlier anita if theardeur hadnt come to you youd still be stuck where you had been youd still be fighting what you want and what you think youre supposed to want i looked at him while i rested against nathaniels body nathaniel had propped himself up on his elbows and was looking at jason we both seemed utterly comfortable with him there was that wrong it didnt feel wrong i wanted to argue but i couldnt well i could but i would have sounded silly if theardeur hadnt come where would i be i thought id still be with richard but as soon as i thought i knew better richard had used theardeur as another excuse to run from me but he hadnt liked any of my life he hadnt liked the police work the zombie raising my comfort with the vampires and shapeshifters strangely the thing hed liked less was that i seemed willing to accept him and his beast id seen too far into his head in that one moment in my own bathroom damian had said it best richard loved his shame more than he loved anything else so where would i be without theardeur no micah no nathaniel no asher my life still nothing but murder cases zombie raisings and vampire slayings hell without theardeur would i have stayed with jeanclaude or would i have found another reason to run from him too maybe it sounded like something id do i looked at jason and settled more solidly against nathaniels body he sighed and laid his head down on the bed so what theardeur is the universes way of getting me where i needed to go maybe he said then grinned i cant speak for whole universe all i know is that i envy you and i dont envy many people i frowned are you jealous nathaniel asked jason looked surprised either at the question or at who had asked it he finally shook his head not jealous of you or anita like in love with you jealous no jealous of what you have together hell yes jealous of not having that many people in love with me hell yes again he smiled and then grinned and it reached his eyes this time besides im not anitas type for a relationship whats that supposed to mean i asked im not submissive enough or dominant enough for you im certainly not domestic enough im also not willing to take on all the responsibilities that micah seems to embrace so easily youve found another person who thrives on his job and taking care of other peoples crises not my idea of fun he spread his hands wide you and jeanclaude well thats something else i know i cant compete with it its not a competition nathaniel said you dont see it that way jason said but im just dominant enough and guy enough to see it that way if any one of them saw it as a competition it wouldnt work i said i know jason said he shook his head im going into the bathroom again and this time im staying there until im called or until i feel theardeur rise you guys have fun sorry if i flattened the mood my moods fine i said mine too nathaniel said jason stared at us both noardeur and ive made you talk and think too hard and youre still okay with this yes i said why because a very wise and dear friend told me i was going to fuck this up and i dont want to do that he smiled and his face softened if you do ever pick one of them to actually marry and its nathaniel i get dibs on being best man i dont think thats going to come up i said but if it does youd be our first pick you didnt ask nathaniel he said she didnt have to nathaniel said jason walked toward the bathroom shaking his head too dominant by half i called after him you know i have to be the better man in any relationship jason i meant it to be a joke he turned at the bathroom door and said fuck anita you are the better man just because you dont have the right equipment doesnt change what you are he closed the door behind him firmly until it clicked we were left alone in the bedroom nathaniel raised up and looked down at me you dont have to finish tonight anita jasons right the way you touched me i know if not this time then next the sooner you feed theardeur the better youll feel i smiled at him then unfolded my arms and slid my face down until i was as far between his legs as i could get he wasnt as excited now and the skin was loose i licked that most delicate of skin and heard his breath go out in a long sigh i drew the loose skin into my mouth pulling it gently out and away from his body the skin didnt stay loose for long and when it was tight and i could lick the balls inside that skin i told him on all fours he did it without being asked twice i drew his balls into my mouth one at a time carefully so carefully i rolled them in my mouth with tongue and lips until they were wet and slick i caught glimpses of the rest of him just in front but not all and not well id only seen him nude from the front three times once when i first met him once when i made the triumvirate between him and damian and earlier in my office roll over i said and he spilled himself over onto his back he lay thick and quivering against his stomach pointing like an exclamation mark against his own body i dont remember you being this big the first time i saw you nude i was in a hospital someone had almost killed me i wasnt at my best i gazed down at him and said i can see that i reached for him slowly and laid my hand against the warmth of him but i was losing my patience another time id be slower but now i wrapped my hand around him let the thick round hardness of him fill my hand his upper body spasmed raising a little off the bed i slid one hand to his balls and massaged them while i stroked the thick velvet warmth of him so soft and so hard all at the same time i stroked him until his eyes lost focus and his neck spasmed so that he was closed eyed and didnt see me bend down i slid my mouth over the tip of him while he wasnt looking and he cried out as i worked my mouth down the length of him i knew what i wanted i wanted all of him inside my mouth down to his balls at least once next time id start with him smaller now i had to fight for it id gotten better at deepthroating because sharing a bed with micah it was either get better at taking more or stop doing one of my favorite things practice paid off i sealed nathaniel inside my mouth in one hard clean line until my lips touched the top of his testicles i could only stay for a moment then i had to come up up to breathe up to let the wetness from my mouth trail down the shaft of his body i raised up on my knees between his thighs and the look on his face was worth all the effort in fact worth so much that i had to do it one more time then i came up more shallow on him so i could move better thrusting him in and out of my mouth licking him rolling him sucking him and when he was making enough noise very lightly i used teeth oh god yes yes please i moved off him enough to ask please what more teeth please i frowned at him most men think that hurts im not most men he said and there was something about the way he said it that made me press my mouth back over him i sucked him pulling hard and firm then forced my mouth down on the shaft not as far as before and bit him not too hard but harder than id bitten any other man id done this with i kept my eyes on his face so i could see if it hurt him the look on his face had nothing to do with pain his eyes were wild and he said harder i looked at him please anita please you dont know how long ive wanted this it wasnt my bits being bitten but i was reminded that nathaniel had once had no stopping point no dangerdonotcross sign i could do what he wanted but it was up to me to make sure it didnt go too far i was finally doing what hed always wanted i was topping him i went down on him fast and hard and this time i bit him hard enough that my teeth closed around that thick meaty flesh i had a momentary flash of not theardeur but of the beast and its craving for flesh between teeth i pushed it away but i also came off of him and didnt do it again but id done enough because his eyes were rolled to whites and he was writhing on the bed his hands had grabbed mounds of the sheet and his body strained and bucked against the bed i waited for him to lie still though his eyes stayed like butterflies eyelashes fluttering against his cheeks when i caught a glimpse of lavender eyes between the fluttering i stroked him gently i stroked him with my hands until i had his eyes looking at me instead of the inside of his own eyelids he looked up at me his lavender eyes lazy and his smile was like the cat who got the cream i wrapped my hand around that warm thick length wrapped my hand and squeezed i want this inside me when his eyes opened he said you havent had any foreplay i squeezed him again watched his spine bow and his head throw back sliding the long braid of his hair off the bed like something escaping off the edge trust me nathaniel ive had foreplay when he recovered enough he said youre not the only one who hasnt gotten to touch someone below the waist i closed my eyes please nathaniel please just make love to me i want you to finish what you started in the office please he looked at me and there was something in that look that was very male and very grownup you liked that did you i gave him a look then said you were there what do you think he sat up and i was suddenly surrounded by his legs his arms he kissed me and the kiss was gentle but not chaste he explored my mouth the way id explored his legs and ass lightly delicately savoring it but one hand was sliding down the front of my body until his fingers slid over me my body reacted to that light touch but his hand didnt stop he traced a finger around the opening to my body you are wet i told you so he slid the finger inside of me and stole my breath then he pushed two fingers inside of me and with the tips of his fingers found that spot he flicked the tips of his fingers just the tips flexing them fast and firm against that spot and it was as if that part of my body had been waiting for him as if all the work hed done earlier was still there because those quick firm touches brought me brought me screaming nails digging into his shoulders and back he caught me with his other arm around my waist or i would have fallen back to the bed he slid his fingers out from inside me and said now youre ready since all i was seeing was the inside of my eyeballs and speech was not an option i tried to nod but i really dont think i needed to as they say actions speak louder than words i watched his face above me as his body worked in and out of mine he stayed propped on his arms his legs were bent toward me so that he acted as a frame for his own body seeing him sliding inside me threw my head back spasmed my body but i fought for control fought to see him to watch him this first time this first time after so many false starts i fought my body fought the amazing sensations that were filling me fought because i wanted to see his face propped up like he was it was shallow and usually i liked it deep but something about the angle or the depth or lack of it or the rhythm which was quick so quick began to bring me i could feel it starting i remembered in time to gasp when i go you go his voice was strangely controlled as if he were concentrating very hard on what he was doing you can go more than once i may not be able to i touched his face held it light between my hands when i go you go no more near misses his eyes smiled down at me agreed and suddenly there was no time for words no time for debate the orgasm tightened my body then spread outward blowing through my body my skin i rode that wave after wave of pleasure his eyes went wide as if they were surprised and his breathing quickened his body hesitated paused almost then he thrust himself deep inside me and if i hadnt held his face hed have thrown his head back but i wanted to watch his eyes they were almost frantic his body spasmed again and this time the orgasm caught me unprepared and my hands lost his face my eyes rolled back into my head and i screamed he collapsed on top of me and thrust as hard and sudden as he could i shrieked under him and clawed at his back his skin gave under my nails he writhed on top of me writhing with his body still thrust deep inside mine caused my nails to dig deeper and i set my teeth in his shoulder screaming into his skin making a gag of his flesh between my teeth nathaniels body liked the pain it was as if as long as i hurt him he wasnt done the more that my nails and teeth dug into him the more his hips pumped into me it was like we were caught in an endless loop of pain and pleasure and the line from one to the other blurred his breathing changed again and when his body threw itself backward in orgasm i still had my teeth in his shoulder he tore himself out of my mouth i released him in time to not take a bite out of him or lose a tooth but not in time to keep from drawing blood i was suddenly drowning in the taste of his blood sweet and salty and metallic and underneath that something else something more id bitten his neck only hours before and i had not been as aware then of the taste of his blood it was like the difference between gulping water because you were thirsty and sipping wine to enjoy the bouquet i let nathaniels blood rest on my tongue licked it against the roof of my mouth played with the taste the texture the warmth of it i let it slide down my throat i made it last as if it were the last sip of liquid i would ever have id craved blood before but as with the beast id thought that one part was all of it in that one sweet taste i knew better id tasted blood before but id never enjoyed it or known that it could taste like this power trailed over nathaniels skin and trapped under his body that power marched over me in a skintingling breathstealing rush it made me shiver and my beast stirred like something furred and halfasleep disturbed from its nap nathaniel bowed down toward me again his eyes were pale gray with a hint of almost blue i stared into his leopards eyes and felt his beast stretch inside his body like it was rubbing against the bones of its cage my beast stretched inside my body id had the sensation before but id never been able to feel it as if my body were somehow hollow and this long shape stretched the length of me it made me shiver and it was hard to breathe for a moment as if something truly was inside me and had reached up high enough to compromise my lungs the pressure lasted for a moment then it was gone but i hadnt liked the sensation of it you smell of blood nathaniel said and there was an edge of growl to his voice its your blood i whispered and my heart was already beating faster but its in your mouth he growled just above my lips his mouth was suddenly on mine his tongue pushing between my lips he kissed me hard and long and deep pushing his tongue so far into my mouth that it was almost like deepthroating but his tongue was neither as long or wide as he was but this had teeth that almost cut at my lips a bruising force that no amount of oral sex could equal his tongue licked along the roof of my mouth the inside of my cheeks he was licking the taste of his own blood from my mouth the leopard screamed through my brain hes eating us i knew better but something moved inside me in places that nothing was supposed to move i felt it not like some liquid amorphous shape but as if something very solid and very real was sitting in the center of my body and moving around it stirred and this time i felt something like a hand stretch upward and something else stretch down it hurt and i was suddenly choking on nathaniels kiss he drew back and the smile on his face was fierce and joyous a savage beauty as if the thoughts behind his face werent very human anymore you taste good he said and his voice was painfully low it didnt sound like nathaniels voice at all the leopard didnt react to that growl it was gone from my head but that thing in the center of my body stretched stretched legs and arms inside my body i could feel it touching things that should never have been touched i screamed and stared up into his eyes and wondered if there was enough of nathaniel in there to help me anita whats wrong with leopard eyes and a voice of a stranger but his face was all nathaniel all concern and worry it hurts what did i hurt you i shook my head and claws tickled along my ribs and made me struggle underneath his body help me he rolled off of me and yelled jason he had to yell twice before jason came out dripping from the shower a towel in his hand he looked at us and the smile was gone instantly whats wrong i dont know nathaniel said still in that low voice she says something hurts the thing stretched again stretched and stretched and my body stretched with it as if it fit inside my arms and legs it didnt hurt exactly it was as if my body were a glove and it was seeing how much room it had did you feel that jason asked his body had broken out in goosebumps nathaniel nodded its her beast jason knelt by the end of the bed yeah but its never felt like this before my beast stretched to the limits of my body then found that there was nowhere else to go id gotten a tiny piece of richards beast years ago and somehow belles line had given me an animal to callthe leopards through that i was nimirra to micahs nimirraj nathaniel had been mypomme de sang but now he was my animal to call as richard was to jeanclaude now that part of me that was beast cat stretched inside my human body id felt it as power before more metaphor than physical but this was very very physical i could feel it feel it struggling inside me looking for a way out it was as if i was a lycanthrope except i lacked that last bit of the puzzle that one last bit that would allow the beast to slip out of my skin and be real it shrank back into that small center of my body where it stayed most of the time but now it was like one of those leopards at the zoo in a small metal cage it paced paced paced and finally rushed the bars slashing and clawing but these bars were my body and i screamed i reached out trying to grab something anything that would help me how do you fight something thats inside your body how do you destroy something that is in the very meat of you jason grabbed my hand and i was suddenly breathing in the sweet musk of wolf but it was as if touching jasons hand acted like a conduit and suddenly i could see richard he was in the bright sunlight of his kitchen cooking something in a pan he wore nothing but jeans with a dish towel stuck into the waistband of his pants his back was covered in claw marks or really serious nail marks it looked more like the result of good sex than an attack his head came up and he sniffed the air and only then did he turn and stare behind him as if he could see me he said anita is that you help me whats wrong now i squeezed jasons hand and it was like that extra bit of contact took me closer to richard it was like i hovered just in front of him he reached out and his hand brushed through me my beast reacted to it screaming and clawing going wild it didnt want the wolf inside us there wasnt room for it there certainly wasnt room for both richard drew his hand back and said anita anita can you hear me i screamed his name because screaming was all i could do it felt like the leopard was cutting me up trying to dig its way out and it couldnt get out give your beast to someone else anita someone whose body can let it out i didnt understand what he meant i started to tell him so but he seemed to feel my puzzlement because he shared a memory with me they say a picture is worth a thousand words a memory with complete sensory surround sound is worth so much more saves so much time shares the pain faster we were in the center ring of the circus of the damned i reached out to richards beast his rage because if we couldnt control it the council would kill him i reached out to that rage that power that he called his beast came at my touch i smelled like home to it somehow and it poured into me over me through me like a blinding storm of heat and power it was similar to the times id raised power with richard and jeanclaude but this time there was no spell to use the power on nowhere for the beast to run it tried to crawl out of my skin tried to expand inside my body but there was no beast to call i was empty for it and it raged inside me i felt it growing until i thought i would burst apart in bloody fragments the pressure built and built and had nowhere to go richard had crawled to me on hands and knees bleeding hed laid his lips against mine in a trembling kiss a sound came from low in his throat and he was suddenly pressing his mouth against mine until it either bruised or i opened my mouth to him i opened and his tongue plunged inside me his lips feeding on mine the cut inside his mouth filled my mouth with the taste of him salty sweet i held his face in my hands my mouth searching his and it wasnt enough we moved to our knees mouths still pressed together my hands slid over his chest his back and something deep inside me clicked and relaxed his power tried to spill outward but i held it back richards hands slid up my legs finding the lace top of the black panties his fingers traced my naked spine and i was undone the power spilled upward outward filling us both it flared over us in a rushing wave of heat and light until my vision swam in pieces and we both cried out with one voice his beast slid inside of him i felt it crawl out of me pulled like a large thick string spilling inside of richard coiling into his body i expected to feel the last bit of it spill between us like draining the last drop of wine from a cup but that drop remained the memory rolled back and left me gasping on the bed nathaniel was leaning over me anita anita are you alright his eyes had bled back to lavender jason was nuzzling my hair you smell like pack richard was standing in his kitchen one hand on the edge of the cabinets as if he were steadying himself now do you remember i remember i whispered what do you remember nathaniel asked cant you smell it jason asked he was rubbing his lips against the side of my face nathaniel leaned over me his face very close to mine wolf he sniffed my skin richard he whispered the name against my skin the feel of their lips against me made me close my eyes for a moment but once sight was gone the scent of them covered me like a blanket the sweet musk of wolf and the acrid sweetness of leopard were everywhere like invisible water and i was drowning in it i expected my cat to complain but it didnt it was strangely calmed by both scents youre still pack anita as much as youre pard give your beast to them richard stared up at me and i noticed for the first time that he had scratches low on his right cheek not usually a place you mark in the heat of passion i stopped seeing richards scratched face in his sunny kitchen i opened my eyes to a wisp of auburn hair across my eyes nathaniel was pressed against the side of my face his mouth just under the line of my jaw his body was back on top of mine laying his weight along me he was so warm jason still had my hand and his mouth was rubbing along the side of my neck on the side opposite from nathaniel i was warm and safe and i realized that richard had given me some of his control hed given me breathing space i needed to use it before my beast shook free of this warm comfortable lassitude i thought back over the memory of giving richards beast back to him how had it worked a kiss why did everything take a kiss or a touch jeanclaude had answered that question last night because we could only use the tools we had available most of our tools came from belle mortes line and that meant that our tools our skills were going to have a certain theme i waited to be tired of that theme and part of me was part of me thought we really needed some new skill sets but most of me was warm and safe and covered in the scent of pard and pack their lips worked gently at each side of my neck soft kisses nathaniels body was so warm pressed the length of mine warmer than any blanket better than simply being held in someones arms jasons hand smoothed along the edge of my hip and i couldnt help but cuddle into the feel of his touch that one small writhing movement seemed to affect nathaniels body he was suddenly heavier than he had been heavy in the way richards kiss had been in the memory nathaniels hips pressed in against me and as with the remembered kiss he pushed against me and i had a choice of opening to him or keeping him outside my body richards beast had left through a kiss i could only kiss one of them at a time the thought came that i could do other things and still kiss but id had enough of threesomes and more my battered morals had had about all the multiples they could handle for awhile that little voice whispered but it feels so good and the voice that id learned at my grandmothers hand yelled slut you work so long and so hard to listen to your inner voice but sometimes guilt or habit makes you listen to those other voicesthe ones that beat you down sometimes you just cant shake them i need to give my beast to my cat i said and my voice was thick slow i tried to draw my hand out of jasons but he held on he whispered into the bend of my neck ill be your cat nathaniel whispered against my other cheek im her cat jasons voice against my skin ill be your doggy then he licked along my neck and it made me writhe but i shook my head just a little turning my head so i could see the side of his face not tonight jason this time when i pulled my hand he let me go his blue eyes came into my vision and he kissed me long and deep and my beast lay quiet you taste like blood and other mens kisses he whispered as he pulled away my beast woke inside me as if it had only been napping it woke and tried to spill upward it filled my body like someone trying on a coat that was far too small i could feel it stretching out inside me feel it filling me like hot water spilling up and up inside me until it filled every inch of me and still there was more to come it poured and poured if water could have bones and muscle and anger because when it found that there were limits that my skin did not burst my bones did not bend my body did not give the beast began to rage inside me it slashed with claws and fought with muscles that should have been metaphoric but felt all too real it was trying to tear its way free of the cage and the cage was my body i screamed screamed and struggled but you cant fight something that you cant touch nathaniel was still on top of me eyes wide and frightened he started to slide off of me but i grabbed his arms and managed to say kiss me if it had been almost anyone else they would have argued but he didnt he put his mouth against mine and the next scream was muffled into his mouth i willed the thing inside me into him i tried to force it but it was panicked and could not hear me it was like a wild animal cornered it heard nothing but its own fear i tore my mouth from nathaniels and simply screamed jason was there a hand on either side of my face and the moment he touched me the beast hesitated the cat paused long enough to sniff the air as if wondering what he was i looked up at nathaniel with jasons hands still holding my head try again kiss me he kissed me and this time i was able to kiss him back but the beast didnt rise it sat inside me sniffing puzzling but it did not rise i broke the kiss and screamed not from pain but frustration richard said to share my beast with someone who can give it release but it wont go it wont leave are you still fighting for control of theardeur nathaniel asked i blinked at him and thought about it was i not consciously but controlling it had become automatic now that i didnt have to control it but had to instead call it into being was i still quashing it was i still shielding the answer was yes yeah stop fighting nathaniel said just let everything go no i started but he touched my lips with his fingers hush anita you can feed off of both of us and it wont drain me that badly its not a good idea but its not a disaster stop fighting and maybe the beast will stop fighting too i opened my mouth with his fingers still touching me he slid his fingertips just inside my mouth playing along the edge of my lips the movement stopped me from talking more effectively than anything else could have done i just lay there and let his fingers play around the edge of my mouth delicate sensual let go anita just let go well catch you jason leaned in against my face im here anita i wont let anything bad happen to nathaniel i promise he laid his face against my forehead we can do this anita but you have to let go you have to let us catch you let go it sounded so simple but letting go of anything was so not my best thing i wasnt even sure i knew how to do it how do you let go how do you open your hand and let yourself fall and trust that other people will catch you that theyll catch you and not let you hurt them or yourself did i trust nathaniel and jason that much sort of did i trust anyone that much maybe okay not really i took a deep breath let it out slow and i let go i let go and trusted trusted even as a small voice inside me whispered stupid stupid stupid hell is claws and teeth and bodies fighting i sank my teeth into someones chest took in as much meat as my mouth would hold and began to bite down i wanted meat i wanted to feed and the leopard was screaming that if we didnt kill them theyd kill us let go theyd said id let go and now instead of the beast being something struggling to get out it was me that was small and trapped and couldnt get out that part that wanted meat and blood and found struggling somewhere between sex and food was in the front of my head id always thought being an animal must be peaceful but it wasnt peaceful it was simpler but it wasnt peaceful i remembered only pieces the taste of blood in my mouth the feel of my teeth sinking into flesh my nails cutting through someones body i was on my stomach and i couldnt move couldnt move someone was on my back and someone had my hands and i couldnt move teeth on the back of my neck a moment of mindnumbing panic then it was peaceful like what had happened earlier in my office when nathaniel bit me there peaceful jason was kneeling in front of me off the edge of the bed holding my wrists the left side of his face was a bloody mess and distantly i knew that my nails had done that his eye blinked out painfully from the bloody furrows his arms were traced with bites and scratches so it looked like he was wearing red gloves all the way up to his shoulders his chest and stomach were bloody too nathaniels teeth on my neck bit down a little harder and my eyes fluttered up and when he growled against my skin my body writhed under him not struggling but offering jason spoke and a trickle of blood trailed from his mouth as he did it next time we do this you get tied up nathaniel growled but i didnt think it was meant for me jason looked past me to meet the other mans eyes and said okay okay give me your beast anita let me swallow it down he leaned into me and the blood that trembled on the edge of his mouth fascinated me i tried to strain toward that trembling drop of red and nathaniels teeth made me stop forced me to wait for jasons mouth to come to me his mouth stopped just out of reach i tried to raise my hands and touch him but his hands forced my wrists down tighter on the side of the bed he laid his mouth against mine and i didnt kiss him i licked the blood from the edge of his lip he drew back laughing youd rather eat me right now than kiss me but he leaned in toward me his mouth halfparted and i could smell the blood inside his mouth id bitten him i remembered the feel of his lip between my teeth i made a sound low in my throat and he laughed again a purely masculine sound with his lips so close to mine that my tongue could touch them his voice held that masculine laughter and an edge of growl god shes eager nathaniel growled again with his teeth still tight on the back of my neck the growl was low and deep and vibrated down my spine like my body was a tuning fork it made me push my body against his my mouth reached for jason but my body was offering itself to the hard weight against the back of my body alright but if she bites my tongue off im going to be pissed and he pressed his lips against mine but i didnt try to bite him because his mouth was full of blood and tasted of meat id already started this meal all i wanted to do was finish it my beast was right there under my skin only nathaniels hold kept it peaceful the taste of fresh blood of meat and the feel of jasons mouth on mine brought the beast like heat against my skin i could feel my body cooking with the heat of it as if my skin was a container for something so much hotter than human flesh something that was almost there almost ready almost nathaniel raised his mouth and only his weight and jasons hands held me down he whispered something against the wound in my neck i think he said now but i would never be sure because in that moment my beast rose it rose up the line of my spine like heat it spilled out my mouth and into jasons in a scalding burning wave of power it tore his mouth off of mine forced his head back in a scream and nathaniels body bowed on top of mine and he screamed too my beast was like a sword thrust through both of them i poured my energy into their bodies until their bodies burst with it i saw jasons skin split and i felt nathaniel tremble above me one moment they were there and the next i was drenched in liquid warm so warm like being dipped in fresh blood but it wasnt blood it was clear and viscousthat fluid that the shapeshifters leave behind when they pull their bodies from one shape to another i was covered in it dripping with it and because jasons claws were still pinning my wrists i couldnt wipe it away from my face i blinked at the wolfman kneeling in front of me his fur was dry like it always is like magic i stared into wolf eyes the color of early spring grass his fur was thick and shades of pale gray he opened a jaw that was longer than a humans and full of teeth that any wolf would envy he ran an impossibly long tongue over those teeth and stared at me with eyes that held things that id only begun to guess at a claw curled into the wet sheets on one side and that claw was a blackfurred hand i turned back and did that slow horrormovie take where you know whats behind you but you just cant keep from looking you have to look even with the feel and press of fur against your naked body i knew what id see and still i turned and looked nathaniels face was a strangely graceful mix of human and leopard the face shape was closer to human than the werewolfs but when i met those grayblue eyes there was no one home to talk to id gotten rid of my beast by bringing theirs and now i was suddenly covered in warm liquid that mimicked blood with two freshly turned lycanthropes holding me down nathaniel put his furred hands against the bed on either side of me and he flexed those hands and claws like white knives sprang out from his fingertips just seeing them lying there unused made my pulse speed just a little i knew they wouldnt hurt me i trusted them but part of me trusted jason and nathaniel more than i trusted their beasts i tried not to be afraid because fear is like spice for their meat fear excites a lycanthrope it just does so i lay very still and tried to calm my heartbeat tried to think how to ask them to let me go without sounding like a victim nathaniel moved his hands so that they lay on either side of my body with the fur of his thumbs caressing my skin my heartbeat didnt like it neither did i he flexed his hands again and the claws vanished into the fur he caressed that fur down the sides of my body and that brush of warm warm fur brought my breath in a shuddering line his voice was more growl than anything else when he said ive never had hands before when i shifted he put those hands back on either side of my body so close that the edge of the fur touched the sides of my breasts he pointed the claws downward and i felt his muscles flex against the side of my body his hands were right next to my breasts and i felt his claws grip into the bed he began to pull those claws downward the sheet ripped but it was the sound of the mattress tearing that brought a sound like a whimper from my throat the mattress made a meaty sound as his claws tore through it easily he moved his body so that he could trace the outline of my body against the mattress and sheets he carved the outline of me with his claws and i couldnt not be afraid jason laughed and strangely that masculine chuckle translated just fine through the wolfs throat the sound made me look at him he flashed fangs as he said dont be afraid anita then let me go i said and my voice was nicely calm barely a tremor if theyd been human they wouldnt have been able to taste my speeding pulse or smell my fear but they werent human nathaniel collapsed his body on top of mine and he was taller broader more muscled or muscled in places he hadnt been before it was like a different body pressed against mine one id never touched the fur was thinner on his chest stomach groin but the skin was warmer almost hot against my naked body as if in this form his blood ran hotter he licked my shoulder and a sound very like a small squeal came out of my mouth i closed my eyes and concentrated on my breathing just my breathing not on the feel of his body or of jasons hands with their notsoretractable claws tickling my wrists i breathed breathed while a tongue that was rougher than nathaniels licked in long thick sweeps across my shoulders and upper back when i opened my eyes again my pulse was normal and i realized that nathaniel was cleaning off the clear goop that he and jason had gotten on me he growled next to my ear we got you messy yeah i said and my voice was a whisper he settled his hips against my thighs and did a small powerful movement somewhere between a wiggle and a push he was suddenly resting against my ass and i could feel that he was different there too bigger it felt like but i might just have been scared everything seems bigger when you feel threatened he made a sound by my face sort of a snuff not like he was sniffing me but like it was a noise that i should have understood youre hungry hungry like we are i can feel it i fought to keep my pulse nice and normal my breathing even i wasnt going to do anything to escalate this not if i had a choice im not hungry i said he leaned harder against me sliding lower between my legs not inside but moving that way the thought sped my pulse i couldnt help it he rubbed his furred cheek against the side of my face you need a shower okay i said at that point id have agreed to anything that would get me on my feet and out from under the two of them were not going to eat you anita jason said if that was really an option jeanclaude wouldnt have trusted me with you you should know that i raised my face and met those wolfish eyes sorry but you guys going all tooth and claw on me makes me wonder we wont hurt you jason said then let me go i said and my voice was even normal my pulse slowing down not yet nathaniel said with his face still pressed against my face jason looked at him why not he asked before i could because she still needs to feed theardeur i wouldnt have thought that a wolf face could show that much incredulity but jasons did anita doesnt do furry the leopardman on my back moved his hips another fraction of an inch down he pushed against me not inside but knocking at that most intimate of doors you are empty inside i can feel it i couldnt feel it before saying it once was wishful thinking twice and i tried to look inside myself tried to see theardeur without raising it i needed some kind of metaphysical gas gauge but all i could find was an emptiness in the center of me a place where something should have been and there was nothing i feel it i said i dont feel tired now anita i feel new he moved gently against me say yes let me go and maybe i said i like holding you down i like us both holding you down he growled against my skin i thought you didnt like to be in charge i said i dont usually but today i do today i love the feel of your body under mine i love feeling you fight not to struggle not to panic i can taste your selfcontrol on my tongue i want to lick it away nathaniel i said say yes anita just say yes feed theardeur then you can shower while we go looking for other things to eat what other things i asked there are supplies deeper in the underground jason said weve got too many wereanimals in here now not to be stocked up stocked up on what i asked he leaned in hands still on my wrists nothing human nothing illegal promise he licked my face a quick flick of the tongue and then he laughed and it wasnt masculine it was just jason making a joke jason who would make a joke on the way to hell even if it meant extra time and a worse punishment no matter what form he was in he was still jason that thought made a tension go out of my shoulders out of my body that i hadnt even realized was there it was still jason under all that fur and claws it was still nathaniel rubbing his cheek against me once upon a time id begged richard to show me his beast but when he did it i hadnt been able to deal it took me a long time to realize that richard had shown me his beast in the worst light possible because part of him didnt want me to be able to accept the beast because he couldnt id run from him after seeing him eat marcus id run from him to jeanclaude because the vampire had seemed less the monster that night was i still the same person who hadnt been able to deal was i still the person who could deal with the handsome prince but not the beast was it beauty more than love that moved me nathaniel pushed gently against me if you dont feed now who will you feed from graham really is just down the hall jason said hell be in human form because meng die wont do him furry she wont even sleep with him furry i didnt want graham was it just the human form i was in love with was it some anthropomorphic idea that i loved shit these were just not the kind of relationship questions that the magazines gave you answers to did miss manners have an answer for being freaked by your boyfriends animal form i doubted it jason drew his claws delicately away from my wrists ill get graham and send him down no i said and reached for his furred forearm the fur was so soft and his arm was so real no i dont want graham jason gave me another of those looks that said youre joking you dont do furry anita but i do nathaniel and i do you on occasion he grinned though it wasnt exactly the same coming from the wolf muzzle on occasion he sank back down in front of me you want me to be your puppy tonight i was thinking more that wed just fuck i said his face was either more expressive than any wolfman id met or it was still enough jason that i could read his face he was still under there somewhere id surprised him not in a bad way but id truly surprised him nathaniel pushed against me and he whispered against my cheek is that a yes yes i said he made a sound that was halfgrowl and half pure eagerness he raised up just a little and then plunged himself between my legs i was screaming before hed finished and not in pain he was bigger thicker more and all those extra bits were plunging inside me he brought me with the size of his body the rhythm of his hips and the flash of white claws like small knives against the tenderest parts of my body the thought of what those claws could do to me if they wanted to brought me struggling under him everything that id fought not to do i now let myself do i struggled i screamed i fought and he held me carefully delicately but with no doubt that he could have torn me to pieces if hed wanted to it was both the most delicate of lovemaking and the most dangerous not because of what he did but because of what he could have done he raised me to my knees cradling me against his body with his arms and i caressed my hands over those arms those muscles that fur so soft and so different from the wolf i pet him not like youd pet a dog but like youd pet a lover i felt his rhythm change knew he was close felt his body strain not to claw me to pieces felt the dainty press of the tip of each of those claws as he held them against my flesh i came watching the pinpoints of those blades begin to crease my skin almost almost cutting almost almost piercing almost almost killing at the last moment he retracted the claws and held me hard and fast against his body with the fur and padding of those hands lost somewhere between leopard and man theardeur fed fed on the strength of his body the heat of his skin and the spill of his seed which spilled hotter inside me than anything id ever felt from a man a thought cut through my mind he isnt a man the words werent angry but the emotion that came with them felt like it would burn a hole through my skin rage such rage and i knew who it was before the door opened richard strode through the door and his energy flung across the room like hot sparks from a fire it hurt where it touched my skin like small biting insects what do you say when you find your exfiancée fucking a leopardman richard knew just what to say the last time i saw anything this sick was in one of rainas porno movies jason rolled off the bed and faced him i think he was trying to give nathaniel time to stand up without me attached to him or maybe he was trying to give me time whatever his motive he stood between me and his ulfric and that wasnt the wisest thing hed ever done brave even gallant but not wise richards power filled the room like scalding water nathaniel rolled off the bed and i wondered if the air was as heavy and hard for him to breathe as it was for me the thought was enough i knew that he felt richards power like something you had to fight to walk through like richards power was some sort of storm a blizzard or a sandstorm something that would blind you and take your life unless you found shelter my shelter was crouching between the bed and the door the wolfman was tall and broad and dangerous richard in his human form should have looked frail but he didnt he could have been a foot shorter and with that much power rolling off of him he would have seemed huge get out of my way jason i wont ask again tell me youre not going to hurt her or nathaniel and ill move he said it in a deep growling voice that would have given any redblooded human pause but richard wasnt human nathaniel was off the bed and moving toward them richard would hurt jason enough to get him out of the way but hed hurt nathaniel for other reasons reasons he might never admit out loud but i didnt want to see it i called nathaniel back to me i had a gun under my pillow but i didnt want to shoot richard and unless youre willing to shoot a gun is just a rock made of metal i was still trying to think of something to do that would make this less awful when richard backhanded jason blood flew in a little arc sparkling in the lights but jason stood his ground he didnt offer to fight back but he didnt get out of the way either i yelled richard no he picked jason up like he was a dumbbell clean jerk richards arms bulged with effort as he lifted the werewolf over his head and held him there for a heartbeat we had one of those frozen moments where everything slows down and you know bad stuff is about to happen and you cant stop it you can make choices and change what gets damaged but you cant save it all i was drowning in richards rage his power boiling like a sea id touched his rage before his beast and this wasnt it not exactly i had a second to realize that his rage tasted like an old friend it was my rage or tasted more like mine i only had time for my aha moment then he threw jason not across the room but at the bed maybe he meant to hit me but i rolled off the bed and when jason landed hard enough in the middle of it to collapse the frame no one was on the bed but him i was on the far side of the broken bed and nathaniel was with me hed put himself a little in front of me he hadnt pushed me behind him like i was a damsel in distress but it was close i was his nimirra and supposedly his dominant shouldnt i be in front jason lay on the collapsed bed stunned hed been thrown from less than eight feet onto a bed and he was breathless frozen while he recovered i didnt have the recovery power that jason and nathaniel had maybe me being in front wasnt bright but shit i didnt know what to do like so often with richard i didnt know what to do why dont you all get back on the bed im sure its a hell of a show raina and gabriel would have loved it since id had to kill both of them so they wouldnt star me in a rapesnuff film it was a truly vicious cut but the time when that kind of shit from richard could make me angry was passed i was afraid to add my anger to his his power was everywhere as if the very air stung and burned but it wasnt just his rage i could feel disgust horror and under that the thing that fueled the rage envy why envy and he was too wide open he was hardly shielding at all i got my answer it was as if someone threw a puzzle into the air and i saw pieces clair and richard in bed richard doing his usual vigorous job of it clair shifting in the middle of it her claws cutting up his back and shoulders clair in human form screaming richard shoved his anger at me and i stumbled as if hed actually pushed me stay out of my head then stop projecting so hard that i cant help but hear it he screamed a fullthroated cry of rage it echoed in the big room and i heard running out in the hallway i knew who this was too or at least what three people spilled into the room one woman two men all with guns they pointed them at richard claudia who was almost as tall as dolph and had broader more muscular shoulders than most of the men in my life did quick eye flicks around the room taking in everything her tight ponytail flicked as she moved because it was high on her head a girl ponytail to offset the lack of makeup and those amazing arms i didnt recognize the men with her except that they held guns like they knew how but id come to expect nothing less than professionalism from raphaels people the wererats didnt recruit amateurs what is happening here anita claudia asked her voice was even just a little tight as if she were gearing up to do her job and shed have less qualms than i would about that job a difference of opinion i said she laughed not like it was funny a difference of opinion well hell this is not rodere business richard said it concerns the pack and the pard not the rats claudias gaze went around the room again took in the bleeding werewolf and the collapsed bed my hand on nathaniels arm to keep him with me and away from richard she came back to richard and smiled again not like it made her happy this doesnt smell like pack or pard business it smells personal thats not your call he said and his voice was lower not growling but lower she smiled again and this time it was just a baring of teeth it is when we were being paid to guard the circus and everyone in it youve already bloodied one of the people in our care ulfric we really cant let you harm anyone else he defied me no one gets to defy the king raphael would agree with that hed turned to face her and i realized that he was one of the men in my life that didnt look frail next to claudia what our king would agree with and what he wouldnt is not in question she sighed and lowered the gun to point at the floor the two men followed her lead richard turned back to stare at the bed and the rest of us he even took a step toward the bed no ulfric you dont just go back to abusing them we may not be able to shoot you without political problems but we also will not stand by and let you abuse those we have contracted to protect he looked at her and all that burning power seemed to draw away from the rest of the room to concentrate like some great weapon i wasnt close enough to feel it but i was betting that all that power was now focused on claudia she shook her head like shed been slapped the two men with her moved back from richard as if they wanted more room to maneuver if things went wrong claudia answered him her voice warm with the beginnings of her own anger no one disputes your power ulfric it is great it is your selfcontrol that i question richard was mad so mad and he was looking for a fight id rather it not be me but i didnt think things would escalate as far with us as it would with the wererats someone could get seriously injured or worse richard being in a pissy mood wasnt worth someone dying over i know i know it probably wouldnt go that far but the wererats were usually exmercenaries or exmilitary they fought for keeps when they fought richard wasnt either of those things he got mad but he didnt really like going for the kill it could all go so badly so fast everybody ease down i said its not worth dying over richard looked at me no ones talked about killing anyone except you richard all three of the guards that are looking at you wondered about killing you the moment they hit the door ask them go ahead ask them he glanced at the wererats still with their guns pointed at the floor is she right the three of them exchanged glances then claudia answered yes you thought about killing me just like that we didnt know it was you doing the damage ulfric but we are allowed to use any means necessary to do our jobs we cannot allow you to harm anyone under our care youre not allowed to interfere with me disciplining one of my wolves either she nodded you are right it is not allowed for one animal to interfere in the internal disputes of another if you can prove that this is pack business and not personal we can leave and you can finish this but you must prove it is business one of the other men who was small and dark and looked like hed spent a little too much time in rat form said smells like jealousy to me roberto you are not helping claudia said her eyes still on richard jason rolled over and started to sit up he moved like it hurt he defied me richard said pointing at jason how claudia asked he refused to get out of my way what would you have done if id moved jason said and his voice held something thicker than normal as if he was still bleeding inside his mouth if you didnt throw me around who would it have been nathaniel anita she doesnt heal like we do richard i wouldnt when you hit the door you were going to hurt someone jason said and let blood trickle from his mouth because he couldnt spit in wolfish form i thought it was better it was me some of that burning power began to fade richards shoulders slumped and he screamed again a fullthroated allout scream as long and as loud as he had breath for he dropped to his knees and smashed his hands into the floor apparently he liked doing it because he kept smashing his hands into the carpeted floor over and over only when the stone floor underneath began to buckle visibly did he stop the sides of his hands were bloody where hed scrapped them on the carpet like really bad rug burns he raised those bloody hands up and just knelt there staring at his hands he didnt cry didnt swear didnt do anything we all froze waiting for him to do or say something at least a full minute passed and he hadnt moved claudia looked across the room at me i shrugged id been engaged to him once and id been his lover but i had no clue what to do that was one of the problems with richard and me we so often didnt know what to do with each other i started to walk around the bed but jason grabbed my wrist close enough i didnt argue i just stopped and looked down at him he was still staring at his scrapedup hands richard richard are you in there he laughed then but it wasnt a good laugh it was one of those laughs that held more bitterness than humor everyone in the room except me jumped when he laughed as if theyd expected anything but that id learned not to try to guess what hed do i want to lick the blood off my hands he said in a strangled voice then do it i said he looked up at me what its your blood its your hands if you want to lick your own wounds then do it wont you be disgusted i sighed richard it doesnt matter what i think it matters what you think youd think it was disgusting he said i sighed again no richard actually no the licking will make the scrapes feel better and youll enjoy the taste of blood he frowned up at me you wouldnt have said that a year ago it was almost a whisper i might not have said it six months ago but im saying it now lick your wounds richard just dont live in them whats that supposed to mean he asked and his anger flared like a small hot whip against my skin dont get pissy richard im trying to live the life ive got not some dream of a life that im never going to have and you think i am youre ulfric of the thronnos rokke clan and youre afraid to lick your bloody hands because someone else might think its not very human so yeah i think youre still pretending that youre going to get another shot at a life this is it richard this is who and what we are this is it you need to embrace that he shook his head and his eyes glittered in the lights as if there might be tears in those perfectly brown eyes his voice when it came was even no hint of those glittering eyes i tried i was shielding as hard as i could i didnt want any more peeks into his and clairs love life but i could guess with clair he looked up and the anger was winning over the tears id never seen him this out of control of his emotions id seen him angry bitter sad but never this seesaw it was like angry and sad were the only emotions he had left you saw it then im shielding like a son of a bitch right now i saw that you had a fight a bad one but thats about all i saw he opened his mouth then glanced behind him i wont hurt anyone but this isnt a conversation for a crowd the wererats looked at me i sighed and wondered if i was being stupid maybe but i was going to do it anyway you guys can go claudia gave me a look i dont think its a good idea anita neither do i i said but do it anyway she shook her head but motioned the two men through the door she turned with the door halfway closed she looked at me and said well be right outside you yell if you need us i nodded i will i promise she gave me a look that said she didnt believe me but she went and closed the door behind her get out jason richard said its his room richard i said he doesnt get to hear this richard said jason got off the bed slowly like he still hurt if i leave and you hurt her neither you nor i will ever forgive you richard stared up at the tall wolfman they had a moment of simply staring at each other and whatever they saw in each others faces seemed to satisfy them both richard said youre right i wont hurt her what about nathaniel richard looked past him to the tall dark form of nathaniel he needs to leave too only anita can order me to leave nathaniel said richard looked at me then down two requests clothes for you and everyone leaves please the clothes were hard because i was still covered in goop what few clothes i had i didnt want to get messy what i needed was a robe but i didnt have one in this room i hesitated too long for richards mood because he said dont make me have this talk with you naked anita please he said theplease like he had the first time like it was its own sentence not an afterthought but as if the please was more important than normal and needed to be set apart id love to get dressed richard but im still covered in that clear goop id rather not get it all over my clothes ive got a robe hanging on the back of the bathroom door jason said it should fit since when do you wear a robe i asked it was a present i looked at him jeanclaude thought i looked cold i think he tried to grin at me but the wolf muzzle just wasnt made for it let me guess black silk blue to match my eyes he started toward the bathroom not exactly limping but close ill get it everybody stay put and be nice until i get back i went for the bathroom though search me if i could remember a robe on the back of the bathroom door but it was there hanging exactly where jason had said it was a lovely blue sort of soft and bright all at the same time id been more tired than id known to miss it last night i put the robe on and caught sight of myself in the mirror the remnants of yesterdays makeup still outlined my eyes though it had smeared a little so it looked a little more goth than my usual the lipstick was gone the clear goop had dried one side of my hair into a case of bed head that only a shower would cure my body was covered in more of the drying goop so that it was beginning to flake as i moved if you have sex with condoms you forget that what goes in eventually comes out and i took the time to clean up just a little because it was too embarrassing not to the blue was too pale for my coloring and too big through the shoulders it was one of those moments that i wondered why anyone wanted me i just didnt see it of course feeling this bad about myself might have had something to do with dreading richards little talk maybe i took in a lot of air let it out slowly and opened the door it was one of the braver things id done in awhile id much rather have dealt with bad guys than with richard bad guys were simple kill them before they kill you richard was a lot of things but simple was so not one of them jason left without a word but nathaniel said hed wait outside with the wererats no one liked leaving us alone not even me hell i wasnt sure richard liked being left alone with me but hed asked for it and i hadnt richard stayed on the floor as if hed never move again since there was no chair i stripped the stained sheets from the bed and sat on the edge of it i sat sort of halfcrosslegged with one leg dangling off the bed but i made sure the robe covered as much of me as it could we sat that way in total silence for at least a minute though it felt like longer i broke first because just watching him kneel there head bowed made me want to comfort him and that would go badly richard didnt take comfort from me anymore or at least he didnt without making me pay for it later that was a game i was no longer willing to play whats up richard you wanted privacy for a talk weve got the privacy now talk he moved just his eyes up at me and that one look was enough angry it didnt spill out into his power or fill the room but i think that was because he was shielding probably as hard as i was you make it sound easy i didnt say it was easy i just said you wanted to talk so talk just like that hell richard youre the one who asked for this talk i didnt invite you into a private conversation you asked about the fight with clair i dont want to share that with everyone you dont have to share it with me i think i need to whats that supposed to mean he swallowed hard enough for me to hear it then shook his head lets start over ill try not to be mad if you try not to pick at me im not picking at you richard im trying to get you to talk to me he looked up at me full face not so much angry anymore but not happy if a friend had something hard to tell you would you say so talk i took a deep breath and let it out no no i wouldnt okay hows this im sorry you feel like you have to tell me something that is so obviously painful for you but what i said before is still true you dont owe me an explanation about a fight you had with your girlfriend richard you really dont i know that but its the quickest way i can think to explain everything i wanted to say explain what but fought the urge he was obviously hurting and i tried not to rub salt into anyones wounds but the call for privacy and the big buildup was making me nervous as far as i knew richard and i didnt have anything this important to say to each other the fact that he thought differently made me downright uneasy i sat on the corner of the bed one hand going to the top of the robe because even with it belted tight it was gaping too big through the shoulders so it just didnt fit quite right i kept one hand on the top and the other hand in my lap so i didnt accidentally flash him id been buck naked in front of him for minutes but suddenly i was all worried about him catching a glimpse i think it was his comment that he couldnt have this talk with me naked would i find it hard to talk seriously if he was naked in front of me i wanted to answer no but truthfully in my own head the answer was yes shit i did not need this he was back to staring at the floor i couldnt stand it i had to prompt him but i tried to prompt him more kindly than before i tried to think of him as my friend and not as the ex who always seemed to rain all over my parade what do you want to tell me about the fight with clair i even managed to keep my voice neutral points for me he took in a lot of air and let it out then raised a pair of sad brown eyes to me maybe thats not where to start okay i said voice careful start somewhere else then he shook his head i dont know how to do this i wanted to yell do what but i resisted but my patience had never been limitless and i knew that if he continued to be obtuse id blow it or my temper would that gave me an idea maybe if i started talking hed just jump in its been a while since i felt your rage i said im sorry about that i lost control i dont its not a complaint richard what i meant to say was that it felt different than the first time i touched it he looked at me what do you mean it felt no it tasted like my anger like me almost more than you i had his attention now i dont understand im not sure i do either but follow my thought asher once told me that jeanclaude had become more ruthless because i was his human servant but with damian being my vampire servant i gained some of his emotional control you can only gain what your partner has to share he was looking at me and the sadness was fading under him thinking there was a good mind in there somewhere he just didnt always seem to use it alright i understand that if jeanclaude gained some of my practicality making him more ruthless then what did you gain i mean i got some of your beast and your hunger for flesh i got jeanclaudes blood lust and theardeur what did you gain from us he seemed to think about that i gained some of jeanclaudes blood lust blood is as attractive as flesh to me almost it wasnt before he moved so he was sitting indian fashion on the floor its easier to talk mindtomind with you lately and last night i interfered with you controlling that zombie he shivered just a little like something about that scared him guess i couldnt blame him but the mindtomind thing being this easy and the zombie stuff is recent richard what did you gain the first time he frowned at the floor i dont see what if you gained some of my anger he looked up then your anger cant be worse than the rage of the beast i laughed and it was closer to humor than his earlier laugh had been but not by much oh richard you havent spent enough time in my head if you believe that he shook his head stubbornly a human isnt capable of the kind of mindless rage that the beast is you havent researched many human serial killers have you you know i havent he said and he sounded grumpy dont go all grumpy on me richard im trying to make a point here then make it he said see thats exactly what im talking about that sounds more like me than you youve been quicker to anger for the last bit and ive been less quick to anger why what if you got some of my anger and i got some of your calmness he shook his head again youre saying that your human anger is worse than my beasts rage thats not possible it was my turn to shake my head richard you seem to think that human is better than lycanthrope i dont know where you get that idea humans dont eat each other shit richard yes they do i dont mean cultures that have ritual cannibalism neither do i comparing lycanthropes to serial killers isnt going to make me feel better about being a lycanthrope my point is that humans can be just as rage filled just as destructive the difference is that a werewolf is better equipped for mayhem than a mere human if human beings had the fangs and the claws that you guys do then wed theyd be just as destructive it isnt lack of wanting to do it its lack of the right tools that make humans less scary if this is your rage anita its awful its worse than almost anything ive ever felt its like being crazy so angry almost all the time i cant believe its something that was in you not past tense richard trust me i had to embrace what i operate on a long time ago what you operate on what does that mean it means that at the heart of me is this deep seething bottomless pit of pure rage maybe i came with it i know my mothers death helped fill it up but as far back as i can remember its been there he shook his head youre just saying this to make me feel better why would i say something that wasnt true just to make you feel better anger filled his eyes like magic one moment trustworthy brown the next moment serial killer dark thank you thank you very much for reminding me that i dont mean shit to you anymore i shook my head and let my hands fall into my lap if you meant nothing to me richard nothing at all we wouldnt be in this room alone youre right youre right im sorry i just get so angry so angry he tried to rub his arms but the bloody scrapes hurt you said you wanted to lick the wounds go ahead it wont bother me it will bother me he said no richard licking your wounds would make you feel better youd enjoy it and thats what bothers you not the wanting to do it but how good it feels when you give in to it he nodded staring at his hands i tried to embrace my beast anita i really tried i felt you feeding on a deer i felt how happy you were in wolf form it felt like you had embraced it when im in animal form yes but its being human on the outside and not human on the inside that gets me confused does it getyou confused or clair he gave me a look that wasnt exactly angry i thought you didnt hear the fight i got one word when she was screaming at youanimal am i wrong was she complaining about herself and her beast no you got it exactly right he laid his hands in his own lap and his eyes were back to being sad like someone had hit a switch angry sad angry sad it was like some sort of demonic baby hormones she accused me of raping her his voice was soft when he said it i gave him very wide eyes and let just how impossible i thought the idea was to show in my face he gave a very small smile just the look on your face now is worth something you dont believe it just like that you dont believe i could do that to her i dont believe you would do that to any woman but thats beside the point no he said and his voice sounded more relaxed than it had since he entered the room thats not beside the point not for me after what a bastard ive been to you that you still believe in me that means a lot i wasnt sure what to say to that if i agreed that hed been a bastard would that start a fight if he thought i believed in him was that going to give him the wrong idea i mean not believing that richard would rape someone didnt mean that much to me he was a decent person thats all im glad it makes you feel better but remember i saw the beginning of the lovemaking session you cant rape the willing richard his eyes looked haunted as if there was something id missed she said that i always make love like its rape that made my eyebrows go up again excuse me tell that to me slowly because it made no sense fast he looked up at me and there was something in his eyes some demand something he wanted me to say or do but i didnt know what do you mean that i mean explain what she meant by it she said im always so rough that its like rape that i dont know how to make love that i only know how to fuck his eyes looked raw as if the pain in them had been skinned naked to shine out of his face it hurt me to see it but i didnt look away i gave him my eyes and let him see what i thought of what clair had said is she still your girlfriend i dont think so good because id hate to say shes crazy if you were still going to date her why is she crazy he asked what kind of head job has she done on you richard rape isnt a word that anyone should use lightly she didnt use it lightly richard said and the small smile was bitter she meant it how he looked at me and the pain was still raw did i ever hurt you when we were together i started to ask emotionally or physically then decided to just ask you mean physically i mean did i hurt you when we made love he shook his head im sorry to ask you this i dont have a right to ask but i didnt know who else to ask i knew you wouldnt lie because i was your ulfric or because you didnt want to hurt my feelings i knew that if i asked you would give me a real answer i looked at him and hoped i didnt look as amazed as i was feeling after everything wed done to each other all the fights the hurts and he still trusted me he trusted me not to lie not to make it worse than it was or better than it was but to tell the truth i wasnt sure if i was flattered or insulted i decided to be flattered because anything else would have pissed me off but the amount of trust he was putting in me scared me not for me personally because he was right id give him the truth but a lot of people wouldnt a lot of people would have used it as an excuse to twist the knife a little deeper he was damned lucky i wasnt one of those people i opened my mouth closed it stroked my hands down the silk of the robe and finally had to look away from those painfilled eyes while i tried to think how to answer not truth or lie but how to say it he stood up suddenly abruptly thats alright i shouldnt have asked sit back down richard im just trying to think how to say it so it doesnt sound stupid he stood there his face all set to be angry as if he didnt believe me fine stay standing but you asked if youd ever hurt me when we made love right he nodded yes and no the scowl turned into a frown what does that mean yes and no it means that mother nature has made it almost impossible for you to be anything but rough unless youre very careful he frowned harder i dont understand of course he didnt of course he would make this as embarrassing as possible richard you are aware that youre wellendowed right i felt the blush start creeping up my neck and there wasnt a damn thing i could do about it id always blushed fairly easily but id seldom hated it as much as i did in that moment raina said i was it was one of the reasons she wanted me for the movies you didnt know you were large before raina it was his turn to blush i was a virgin before raina i shivered and the look on his face was so raw that i said out loud the thought of a virgin with raina is just frightening she was one very sick puppy he nodded i know that now did you know it at the beginning with her i asked i didnt have anything to compare it to he said i had an idea raina had been his first lover and raina had been into sadomasochism on a scale that made a joke out of safe sane and consensual shed done porn hell snuff films shed been one of the scariest and most twisted people id ever met and id met a lot richard had nothing to compare it to what exactly did that mean i tried to lead up to it obliquely my version of subtle i went back to my original point youre big richard which means when youre making love unless youre careful it can hurt i did hurt you he said and he sounded desolate i didnt say that yes you did richard listen to what im actually saying dont editorialize in your own head okay i stood so i could pace this was not a conversation for sitting still ill try he said good enough i came to stand in front of him and tried again a lot of women dont like their cervix bumped during sex he gave me that puzzled frown again how did i end up giving my exfiancé sex education how does anyone end up in these kinds of conversations just unlucky i guess if you go too deep you reach the end of most women you bump into the end of the vagina you hit their cervix he nodded then said i always come to the end i made avoilа gesture thats my point whats your point i put hands on hips because either he was being deliberately obtuse or he really wasnt getting it youre big enough that you always bump someones cervix if youre in a position that allows all of your penis to go inside her i cant be any plainer richard so please make the connection here you mean it hurts them he said yes it hurt you he said no i like having my cervix bumped i have a whole different kind of orgasm from it so i dont mind he was frowning again but more like he was thinking youre saying that if you didnt like it that it would hurt it would just hurt i said because in some positions with someone as wellendowed as you are it is a sort of pain but for me and im betting for raina it was more pleasure than pain i hated putting myself in any category that contained raina but i would have bet good money that i was right i hurt you but i didnt i sighed look this is an area that ive only recently embraced myself sometimes my pain and pleasure centers get confused what would hurt most people feels good to me at least during sex it was my confession so i didnt have to meet his eyes since it was my pain and not his me too he said i looked at him well that would explain a lot what do you mean by that the sex was always great richard even when everything else was going to hell the sex never stopped being great you mean that i nodded yes he smiled and it was almost a real smile except for that flinching in his eyes so you think i was too rough for clair because of my size and your technique is vigorous he gave that frown again richard havent you ever been with anyone where you werent as vigorous he gave me a look that said more clearly than any words that the answer was no okay a friend of mine told me that men are ducklings they tend to imprint on their first lovers which means they tend to make love the way they are first trained to make love you were trained by a woman who was a sexual sadist and made porn movies violent porn movies he looked shocked then horrified youre saying clair is right i was too rough i did hurt her i shook my head did she ask you not to be so vigorous during the lovemaking she never asked about my technique at all she just blew up and said i was too rough that i enjoyed making her beast come that i enjoyed her clawing me up that i enjoyed making her a monster that i always made love like an animal no matter what shape i was in eeeah i said what i was thinking did clair mean to hurt you as much as possible or was it just an accidental hit what do you mean i mean that if i were trying to hurt you as much as possible i couldnt do better than that i think she just meant it i mean if im having sex rough enough for raina then how can it be anything but rape to anyone else i shook my head and waved a hand in front of his face so hed look up and at me dont ever use the wordrape to me again richard because you dont do that if youre with someone who likes sex the same way you do then its just good sex but rough he said i shrugged you dont start out rough but yeah you usually end up there but it was never anything i didnt want to do all clair had to do was ask for what she wanted but she treated you like so many women treat men like you should be able to read her mind you arent a mind reader richard just a man and men are usually less able to read a womans mind than another woman is im not a man anita im a werewolf im an animal i grabbed his upper arms dont let me hear you say that ever again you sayanimal like its a dirty word richard its not but until you own that its not dont let anyone make you feel that bad about yourself he smiled then a little sad around the edges but it was a real smile he touched my arms with his hands and i pulled away i was so not going to hug and make up i would help him through this if i could but we were not a couple anymore if i didnt hurt you then why did you pull away just now i hugged my arms tight and paced a little farther away from him you came here for truth fine heres truth were not a couple anymore richard but that doesnt mean i dont feel oh hell i dont want you to get the wrong idea and what would that be his voice was back to being guarded you were very clear at my house yesterday i was in your head richard i know what you were thinking what you were feeling i was there inside your head then you saw what i wanted to do to you he turned away so that all i could see was the back of him in jeans and the jean jacket that was a few shades bluer than the jeans his hair was beginning to have waves but it still looked shorn to me it was sick anita i wanted you afraid of me having you afraid while i fucked you would have been would have just flat done it for you i finished for him he turned and looked at me his eyes were desolate as if something in them had died yes yes exactly richard every lycanthrope i know is a little confused about the fear response food and sex he shook his head and it must have been too vigorous because he winced but no lycanthrope ive met except for raina and gabriel thought fear was an aphrodisiac since ive met some of the same lycanthropes that youve met i know thats not true what is true is that gabriel and raina were the only ones willing to admit it to anyone and everyone no no he said and stalked toward me his anger starting to rise in a warm prickling wash no one else wanted what they wanted not like that not the real thing aha i said then apologized for saying aha but the point is you saidnot the real thing ive met a lot of shapeshifters who are into the bondage and submission scene but its a game with rules safe sane consensual there are safe words and once that agreedupon word is uttered then it stops its over there was no word that would keep you safe from raina and gabriel exactly richard exactly but you can enjoy the game without doing what they did he grabbed for me and i tried to be out of reach but in the end i had only a shadow of his speed not the real thing he got one wrist instead of two but he still got one he jerked me a little toward him not hard but enough that i planted my feet and set up for not being pulled any closer just principle instinct nothing personal what if its the reality i want anita what if the reason raina liked me so much was that im just like her he didnt hurt me didnt do anything but keep holding my wrist keep me so that i knew i couldnt get away easily if at all i was stronger than a normal human but i wasnt as strong as a real lycanthrope i let out a breath that was even and my voice sounded normal but i couldnt help it i started with let go of me richard youre afraid of me he said no but you arent my boyfriend anymore you dont have the right to touch me without permission the fact that youre trying to pull away and i know you cant excites me there was a time in my life that i would have argued but wed argue about it later if we needed to i didnt repeat my request because i wasnt sure what would happen if i upped the physical stuff i knew i didnt want to find out so i talked all you need is a submissive of your very own who likes to play these games and youre all set but i am not your anything so let go of my wrist okay i couldnt not ask again he let go of me so abruptly i stumbled a little i guess id been pulling harder away from him than i thought fancy that i resisted the urge to rub my wrist never let them see that theyve hurt you its a rule youre nothing like raina richard yes he said i am i carry her munin remember ive had her in full technicolor glory in my head and ive been in your head too trust me you dont think like she did sometimes i fantasize about horrible things anita what i wanted to say was i wasnt his mother confessor but i didnt because i didnt know who else to send him to for this talk who else would i trust no one damn it so dont we all richard the difference isnt what you think its what you do about it most of us know the difference between fantasy and reality we know that what works as pretend doesnt work in the real world what if i want things that would hurt other people i so didnt want to be having this talk but looking into his face i knew that this was part of the demon that had driven him to nearly destroy himself and us if its going to permanently maim scar or kill someone you dont do it outside of those parameters you talk to your lover and see what they want to do what theyre willing to do he was frowning at me no maiming scarring or killing and everything else is okay just like that i shook my head no everything else that your partner says yes to is okay if youre on top dominant then you have to hold it together and make sure its all safe and not too scary i want it to be scary he said i shrugged i said not too scary through friends im beginning to understand that a little fear goes a long way as foreplay you dont mean friends you mean nathaniel if id meant just nathaniel id have said just nathaniel he cant teach me how to be a good top to learn to be dominant youve got to talk to a dominant not a submissive you sound like youve researched it most of the wereleopards in my pard are into bondage and submission i cant be a good nimirra for them if i dont understand them he looked at me considering something i wasnt sure exactly what he was thinking but at least it wasnt sad or angry at this point id take almost any emotion that wasnt one of them i know that before today you werent fucking nathaniel i was in your mind and i know you really did research to try to understand your leopards not just for your lover you sound surprised i said because raina was our lupa for so long a lot of the werewolves are into bdsm too but i learned everything i ever wanted to know about it from raina and gabriel and their accomplices i almost didnt say it but he said hed come to me for the truth id see if he really wanted truth or just some of it richard you say you like fear with your sex you like the game of fear and you like your sex rough he was looking at me the look was a warning those dark brown eyes were willing me not to finish but if i didnt tell him who would you enjoy the scene too richard i dont i held up a hand you dont do what raina and gabriel and some others did but you can be a little in without being a sexual sadist some people think just enjoying teeth and nails during sex is sadistic he was shaking his head over and over if it hurt the scratches on his face he didnt show it this time just because i like teeth and nails doesnt mean im like that im not like them if you mean raina and gabriel no youre not but you didnt run from me just because you thought i was bloodthirsty you ran because with me you couldnt keep pretending pretending what im not pretending anything its not just you thats been pretending richard pretending what his anger started to fill the room hot and close like a storm that hadnt broken yet i like teeth and nails during sex hell i like biting alone without much sex i like the feel of flesh between my teeth he looked away thats my fault and jeanclaudes its our hungers in you maybe but theyre still in me and its still something i enjoy i may never be as comfortable around the scene as nathaniel is and that worries me because if hes mine then i want him to be happy but ive had to stop pretending that i dont like rough sex jason said that i like dominant men because they sort of take charge and i dont have a choice the reason i was able to avoid nathaniel for so long was he tried to get me to do all the moves i need a little dominance play or i dont play i thought he was crazy but its been a busy twentyfour hours and im tired of running he looked back at me running running from what same thing you are myself youre not i stopped him with a hand again yeah i was maybe i still am there are parts of my life that i dont want to look at someone told me that its okay that i like two men in bed with me i argued with them richard i argued that no i didnt i took two steps closer to him but arguing is pretty silly dont you think i dont know what you mean im dating jeanclaude and asher i was dating you and jeanclaude not at the same time in the same date he said i waved it away fine ill leave you out of it but im still dating jeanclaude and asher im living and sharing a bed with micah and nathaniel yes it was sort of accidental i didnt try to get into either situation on purpose but im there and now with damian and nathaniel ive got another threesome where im the only girl not on purpose but after awhile richard arguing that i dont enjoy two men together with me just sounds silly do you he asked i didnt owe him the answer but maybe i owed myself one id only admitted it to myself seconds ago yes being in the middle of two men just flat does it for me just the feel of them on either side just flat does it for me i waited for the blush to start or at least the embarrassment but it didnt it was true and it was okay i was okay i had men in my life that thought it was okay richard looked at the floor as if whatever he saw in my face he didnt want to see or maybe there was something in his face he didnt want me to see i could never do that no ones asked you to he looked up then and his anger lashed out almost like hed laid a hot whip across my skin i jumped from the feel of it ow i said sorry i didnt mean to hurt you but the hell you say no ones asked me alright to my knowledge no ones asked you everyone everyone in the preternatural community whatever animal or thing they are thinks that i was doing jeanclaude and you that we were some happy little ménage а trois ive run into that rumor i said you know what you were doing and who so what does it matter he let out a shadow of that inarticulate scream hed done before anita how do you think i feel when almost every leader in this town that i have to do business with thinks im shagging the master of the city are you saying that people thinking youre bisexual hurts your standing as a leader yes it doesnt seem to hurt jeanclaudes i said thats different i dont think so he made fists and that hurt and he made that sound again you dont understand anita youre a girl and you dont understand im a girl and i dont understand what does that mean it means its still more socially acceptable for a girl to be bisexual than it is for a man who says i asked everyone his anger flared outward like hot water and it was about waist high and rising youre homophobic i said i am not yeah you are if it didnt bother you so much that people thought you were bisexual then you wouldnt care what they said youd know the truth and it would be enough i moved closer to him pushing through the heat of his power his anger his frustration besides whats wrong with being bisexual or homosexual or whatever what does it matter richard as long as youre happy and no one is getting hurt you dont understand he said i was standing close enough to touch standing so close that his power bit and sizzled almost against my skin as if the robe wasnt there god he was so powerful more than the last time id touched his power hed gained from jeanclaude and me just like jeanclaude had like i had if we could get our triumvirate to truly work the way it was meant to no one would touch us no one would dare that one thought wasnt my thought not exactly jeanclaude wasnt awake yet id have felt it but the thought was more his than mine i remembered last night at the club and how wed been joined tighter closer than ever before id done things last night that hadnt been possible before id reached new levels of power both with jeanclaude and with my own abilities id also had sex with a vampire id known less than two weeks and only requiems gentlemanly ways had kept it to one that wasnt like me and standing this close to richards pain i was thinking about the power and not the cost to him that wasnt like me either but they were both very like jeanclaude whats wrong richard asked youve thought of something just wondering what other parts of jeanclaude im carrying around inside myself you told me theardeur the blood lust i shook my head ive never been very practical with relationships or sex and lately like the last twentyfour hours or so i have been at least a lot more practical than ive ever been before is it true that you had sex with two of the new british vampires at guilty pleasures last night my my the rumor mill does grind fast he relaxed some tension going out of him then it was just a rumor i sighed and was getting tired of doing that but it seemed like richard just brought it out in me half true which half he asked i didnt like the look on his face it wasnt angry exactly which should have been an improvement but it wasnt neutral either one vampire not two i shook my head but you know what i dont think i owe you an explanation richard i dont keep track of the swath youre cutting through your own pack and vernes pack when youre in tennessee he was looking at me studying my face as if he was trying to figure out what i was hiding if you werent ashamed of it then youd just tell me richard you arent my dad or my boyfriend i dont owe you an explanation about who i do or dont sleep with you slept with nathaniel for four months before you had sex with him what changed why these two vampires why now i heard it was a hell of a show last night what the hell happened are you asking from some macho possessiveness no as the third of your triumvirate or should i say one of your triumvirates as the third of our triumvirate he had a right to know how close wed come to losing control of primo and some other choice bits he had helped me last night even if it had gone wrong hed tried hed really tried i sat down on the edge of the bed and he sat on the floor with his knees drawn up to his chest while i gave him a thumbnail sketch of the near disaster and an edited version of what id done to help jeanclaude feed i didnt leave much out i just didnt elaborate i cant believe you fucked byron i didnt even think he liked girls he took one for the team i said and tried to keep the irony in my voice to a minimum he actually blushed i didnt mean it that way i meant if i was shopping for men for you among the new vampires he wouldnt have been high on my list truthfully hes not high on mine i mean hes a nice enough guy but as a friend not as more then why he was the person that was there richard if i accidentally sucked someones soul out through their mouth jeanclaude thought id be less cut up if it was byron and not nathaniel is primo like some kind of trojan horse he asked and him asking that made me think better of him lots better it was a very good question you mean did the dragon let jeanclaude have primo so she could try and take over here or just cause enough destruction that jeanclaude got up on charges or his business was ruined something from what jeanclaudes been hearing from europe the council isnt too happy with him it must have shown on my face because richard said out loud i have been paying attention anita im sorry im really sorry i didnt think you had i admit i wasnt before maybe like a month before but i am now i told you ive decided to live and not die by inches that means ive got to pay attention to business and i may not like it i may hate it but being part of this triumvirate is business i dont know about primo he might be as you so aptly put it a trojan horse i left one of the wererats on guard outside his coffin i gave orders that if primo breaks out hes to be killed no third chances because hes already on his second why would jeanclaude bring in something that dangerous i saw primo fight and i saw him heal more damage than any vampire ive ever seen heal it was impressive weve got a lot of powerful vamps but most of them are belles line and that runs high to beauty seduction which is great for the clubs i mean we have some really choice people to strip and to dance with the tourists at danse macabre but if we had a war a real war then we have almost no soldiers you have the wolves he said and through two treaties the wererats yeah but its unusual to have such close ties with other groups vamps scouting us for takeover wont count beyond the wolves it wont occur to most of them that a treaty with an animal that isnt the masters to call will come through when the going gets tough so you approve of primo being here no definitely not not after last night i think we should shoot his ass but i understand why jeanclaude took the chance we need some vamps that can fight not just look pretty as if on cue the door opened and it was my favorite pretty vampire we both turned to look at the door though my turn was less turny than richards jeanclaude was in the doorway wearing the black robe i was so fond of the one that was edged with real black fur at the lapels and framed his pale chest so nicely his long black curls had been combed out so that he looked fresh and lovely i still needed a shower oh well i didnt feel you wake i always feel you wake you are both shielding very very hard he said as he strode into the room his bare feet were very pale against the dark carpet i heard your last comment ma petite should i take it as an insult sorry but we need soldiers not seducers weve got plenty of those he gave that wonderful gallic shrug that meant everything and nothing it was a graceful movement sometimes i wondered ifshrug was the right word if what americans do is a shrug whatever jeanclaude did wasnt the same i told your nathaniel to go and feed his new and surprising form he will be even more popular when the ladies see this new shape of his he was being very pleasant very casual his face held a smile and his movements were graceful and a little flamboyant he was hiding something id learned long ago that this wasnt the real jeanclaude this was one of his many faces that he used when reality would be too harsh or too shocking or too something whats up jeanclaude whatever do you mean ma petite he asked and came to sit down on part of the bed near me part that id removed the sheets from so we were sitting on the relatively clean mattress the bed bobbed unevenly as he settled on it he looked at richard as the bed moved oddly i think you are going to owe mypomme de sang a bed frame richard richard actually had the grace to look embarrassed i lost my temper i am sorry for that ill replace the frame good he crossed his legs one a little higher than it needed to be so he could lace his hands around the knee and expose a line of pale leg was he flirting no that wasnt it it wasnt me who said the next part but it was like my thoughts came out richards mouthscary cut the act jeanclaude just tell us whats happened now the face he gave us was way too innocent whatever do you mean mon ami richard and i exchanged glances that said worlds richard spoke for us no games jeanclaude remember you are beginning to sound painfully likema petite thank you ill take that as a compliment that earned him a smile and a nod from me richard smiled at me and it was the first real smile id seen on him since he stepped into the room it was good to see it and i found that i had one of my own to give back there we were all being friendly youre doing your flamboyant happy casual act i said cut the act and tell us whats up you do realize ma petite that richard has become almost as blunt at times as you are and im starting to have moments when i sound like you jeanclaude let me guess the closer binding last night has had some interesting side effects not just us being closer ma petite but your binding of a new triumvirate to you that has upped the side effects i believe his face was still lovely but the nearly pretentious movements were fading changing to a seriousness that i didnt like seeing he wasnt happy about something i didnt know what it was but it had to be something that he either thought both or at least one of us really wouldnt like he started by confessing that my being willing to do byron and feed requiem was probably his lessfinicky tastes coming out through me i stopped him before he got through it if i hadnt fed on byron and requiem you wouldnt have had enough energy to control primo he would have slaughtered the audience my virtue versus the lives of dozens of people hmm let me think i shrugged its okay though id rather not make a habit of it you surprise me ma petite but he relaxed against the bed his posture was still perfect a lot of the old vamps had good posture but it was more relaxed all the same ive learned that a little sex isnt a fate worse than death jeanclaude is that all richard said or is there more that youd rather we dont know but feel that we need to know see see he is like you now two of you i do not know if i can just tell us i said he gave me a small frown you seem to have figured out that we are mixing and mingling our abilities in more than just a metaphysical way i do not know all we will gain or lose depending on how one looks at it only that it is happening i think that nathaniel and i traded a little dominance and submission i saw the look on richards face and added i mean that ever since we became a triumvirate nathaniel seems a little more dominant and i seem to enjoy being a little more submissive admittedly nathaniel was trying to be more dominant before but he really seems to be taking to it saying it made me want to squirm with discomfort but i fought it off id be damned if id apologize even by a gesture im nothing if not defiant especially if im uncomfortable then apparently we can expect a mingling of our basic personalities as well jeanclaude said and he tried for casual and failed this could get really strange i said and it was my turn to draw my knees up to my chest though for richard i think it had been comfortable for me it was comforting myself is that all the bad news richard asked and looked directly at him i do not see it as bad news mon ami but the two of you might spill it i said knees hugged to my chest you have turned mypomme de sang into his animal form one of them anyway i like you until recently prefer my food without fur i did my best not to look at richard who did you have in mind requiem told me of the amount of blood you lost last night ma petite i think it is wiser if you do not donate more quite so soon i heard richards sigh from where i was sitting and he wasnt sitting that close to me i would say its always me but its usually not i know that anita isnt your regular feed but i know she lets you feed he put his face against his knees and sighed again fine but only if anita is here too no just you and me define anita beingwith us thats not what i said richard said is that not what you meant jeanclaude asked richard seemed to think about it for a second then gave a small nod i guess it is but hearing you say it it seems ill second jeanclaudes question define me beingwith you guys richard blushed he didnt blush often and this was two in one conversation i dont mean it the way you make it sound then tell us how you do mean it mon ami i dont want i mean he made that sound again wordless frustrated why is it that every time i do anything that includes both of you i always end up feeling like im wrong i made one of those mental leaps because i was remembering richards problem with everyone thinking he was or had been doing jeanclaude i decided to rescue him he was after all going to open a vein for jeanclaude that deserved some consideration considering that his rules about feeding vamps used to be the same as mine richard was still trying to explain and failing look i understand what richard is trying to say they both looked at me richard doubtful and jeanclaude amused as if he too understood richards discomfort but couldnt afford to let the other man see that he saw it or maybe something else amused him you never can tell with jeanclaude you dont want it to be just the two of you when jeanclaude feeds i said richard looked relieved and nodded i did not say out loud no youre not homophobic because if richard wasnt as comfortable with having another man touch him then he was entitled id never fed a female vamp voluntarily so who was i to bitch jeanclaudes smile deepened just a touch and why is it such a problem for it to be just the two of us i gave jeanclaude a dirty look and richard was back to not knowing how to explain jeanclaude you know the old american saying about not looking a gift horse in the mouth oui youre checking this ones teeth he laughed that touchable laugh which even through the hardest shielding i had made me shiver and not from fear i caught richards movement out of the corner of my eye hed shivered too for the first time i wondered how much of jeanclaudes abilities worked on richard i was terribly heterosexual and sometimes i just didnt think outside that box richard didnt like boys so jeanclaude didnt affect him the way he did me thats what id believed now i wondered if richard had more problems with jeanclaude than id thought if you were terribly hetero but jeanclaudes powers could affect you you had a problem if you were a man the fact that it had never occurred to me before proved beyond a doubt that sometimes i just wasnt bright about the men around me but before we get up close ive got to get this stuff off of me its flaking and i just dont feel clean that would give us time to have the sheets changed perhaps jeanclaude said he touched the drying caked sheets i have never seen a bed where more than one lycanthrope has shifted it is how do you say a mess his english was better than that even for slang he was back to being pleased with himself and i didnt know why if i dropped shields enough for him to talk inside my head id also have more of richard in my head i didnt want that so id have to ask him later or id figure it out whatever ill make the shower quick i said and started for the far door if it was him going into the shower richard jerked a thumb at jeanclaude i wouldnt believe quick but you ill believe that one comment made me wonder how much time richard had spent with jeanclaude when i wasnt around i didnt say it out loud though i am getting smarter richard was uncomfortable enough with jeanclaude i didnt need to add to it we will be here when you are finished ma petite hopefully with the bed in better order he was standing looking down at it as if he wasnt sure it could really be fixed why not use your room richard asked asher is in my bed now he is dead andma petite finds that disturbing if he woke in the middle of the feeding i think you richard would find it disturbing richard stood and just huddled in his jean jacket disturbing you could call it that he didnt sound happy and i wondered if there was some incident between him and asher i should know about probably not none of my business i had to walk back to the bed and hunt for my holstered gun underneath the pillows i sort of waved it at them both i wouldnt want this thrown down the laundry chute jeanclaude waved me toward the bathroom go shower ma petite we will be ready if you are not too quick we will be ready hed said didnt i have enough wes in my life i went for the shower and left them debating on whether the bed would hold or whether it would be safer to simply remove the frame entirely it wasnt until i closed the door behind me that i thought to wonder why we needed the bed jeanclaude could feed on richard kneeling on the floor couldnt he if this was my first chance to touch both men at the same time in months then i preferred not to be covered in drying goop but once i was clean we could still all do it on the floor we didnt need the bed i thought about going back out and telling them that but didnt no matter what else they were both still men and men feel better when they have something to do they could straighten the bed and sheets and get everything all neat and tidy it would keep them from having any more of those awkward silences or that was the hope when i stepped out of the shower my black robe was hanging on the back of the door how had i not seen that or heard it if jeanclaude could do that while i was in the shower and me have no hint then i was shielding too tight in shielding this hard i was losing some of my awareness of my surroundings not good i dried off wrapped a towel around my hair and put the robe on id have given a great deal for clean underwear but hell if i tied the sash tight and the little string tighter the robe didnt gap i checked that nothing showed in the mirror but a little upper chest very proper id washed away all the makeup i looked pale and clean and with my hair up in a pale blue towel i looked sort of too pale almost sickly i started to take the towel down because i knew i looked good in the robe with my hair down wet or not but i resisted the urge first my hair was too wet and silk doesnt like being wet second i had only one boyfriend in the other room not two i wasnt trying to look my best just help richard not have a fit about letting jeanclaude touch him i looked at my face my eyes so dark and wondered if i could admit even to myself that i still cared that richard thought i was attractive yeah to myself i could say it but i left the towel on they were arguing about candles when i came out jeanclaude had had some brought in for the bedside tables and richard was saying we dont need candles jeanclaude youre just feeding thats it i vote with richard we dont need candles the two of you are not romantics this isnt about romance its about food i said richard motioned to me see anita agrees with me of course she does mon ami jeanclaude didnt sound too put out he still had that catwhoatethecream sound to his voice the mattress and box springs sat on the floor covered in new bloodred sheets even the pillowcases had been changed so that the bed shimmered scarlet in the subdued light the bed frame being gone probably explained why richard had removed his jean jacket and was just in an olive green tshirt i had not realized how dark jasons room is jeanclaude was saying i have no extra places to put lamps but we could have more light with candles i would prefer a romantic reason but in truth it is simple practicality i would like more light youre a vampire richard said you see in the dark better than i do true but if you were allowed to touch someone who rarely allows you to touch them in any intimate fashion would you not wish light to see what you are doing he gave richard a look then his eyes slid past him to me it was a quick look but richard followed it and suddenly he didnt seem to know what to do with his face so he turned it back toward the other man have i missed something here i asked or am i about to miss something you miss very little ma petite candles are fine richard said still not looking at me i was shaking my head but i felt a small touch against my skin i knew that touch i dropped the tiniest edge of my shields jeanclaudes voice blew through me like a caressing wind does it mean nothing to you ma petite that the mere sight of you in your robe has changed richards mind i shook my head and tried to answer back as silently as he did i still wasnt great at it what i tried to think back was me in this robe with this towel is not worth him changing his mind you still do not value yourself as we value you ma petite there was that we again i started to open my mouth to add something out loud when a warm rush of energy danced through my body it stopped me in midstep talking in someones head when the other person isnt allowed into the conversation is rude richard said its like whispering and pointing i couldnt argue it but wanted to trust me richard its not worth repeating id like a chance to be the judge of that he said i sighed for what felt like the thousandth time today what had i been thinking i should have told jeanclaude that we didnt need the bed that richard could kneel down and he could just feed voilа and wed be done with it richard took off his tshirt its too pale if you get blood on it it looks like blood he explained it out loud and it made sense but i was glad he wasnt looking at me when he pulled the shirt off because seeing him shirtless had its usual effect id said before that the day i could walk into a room and not have my body react to richard i knew it was over between us but hormones are traitorous little bastards they dont care how broken your heart is only that theres an attractive man in the room shit jeanclaude was moving from candle to candle with one of those long batteryoperated lighters i could never get them to light he moved effortlessly from candle to candle the other hand holding the draping sleeve of his robe back out of reach of the flame richard sat down on the corner of the bed his blue jeans and the solid line of his black belt looked fine against the red sheets his tanned upper body looked better and as if hed heard me think it he lay back against the sheets not flat but propped on his elbows so that the shimmering scarlet framed his muscular upper body there were tiny folds in his stomach like there are on real people unless they have washboard abs and richard had better things to do with his time than do that many situps his stomach was flat and perfect but perfect doesnt mean perfectly flat lines are flat people had curves and bumps and places to explore richard turned his head and looked at me his face wasnt neutral anymore his dark eyes held heat and it wasnt his beast or at least not just that it was a look id seen before a look that said he knew exactly the effect he had on me and enjoyed it of late that look had been to tell me i know you think im gorgeous and you dont get to touch this anymore now i wasnt sure what the look meant but i didnt like it jeanclaude moved to the other side of the bed his tall blackrobed figure breaking richards and my stare when jeanclaude cleared the way though richard had pulled himself farther onto the bed so that his legs were no longer touching the floor so that all six feet one of him was on the bed framed by sheets the color of fresh blood and the flickering light of candles my mouth was dry not good ive changed my mind i said you guys dont need me not really my voice sounded breathy jeanclaude turned from lighting the last candle he smoothed the sleeves of his robe down around his longfingered hands and stood looking at me his eyes glittered like dark sapphires catching the flickering light in a way that human eyes just didnt ah but we do ma petite we most certainly do you are the bridge between us you are the third of our power does that sound like someone we do not really need i dont mean like forever just not now not here i mean you can feed without me here you can i was having trouble concentrating richard rolled over onto his stomach and he did a little head movement that showed me that his hair had grown out just enough to fall a little forward around his face not long but thicker than id thought the candlelight didnt dance on his jeans but richards body in tight jeans didnt need anything else it was sort of selfexplanatory im going now im leaving now yep thats what im doing i was babbling and i couldnt stop it but i did start for the door so many points for me that i cant count that high jeanclaude called ma petite do not go please i turned back and i dont know what i would have said because hed sat down on the bed but hed done something to the top of his robe so that it gapped and i could see almost his entire chest framed by the black fur of the lapels the burn scar looked very black against the white of his skin and the shimmering black of the fur his nipples were palest pink and from that alone id have known he hadnt fed his hand touched his chest as if he knew where i was looking the hand moved down and so did my gaze so that i looked at the flat line of his stomach the line of dark hair that started just below his navel and swept down to vanish into the shadow of the robe i had an almost irresistible urge to go over there and rip open the sash and see his body pale and perfect against the dark of the robe and the crimson sheets i knew just how hed look against it all because id seen it before that thought moved my gaze to richard because id never seen him against red silk id never seen him by candlelight he rolled onto his side as i watched propped up on one elbow one arm slung low across his hips as if to bring my attention to his jeans and what i knew was in them but no richard wasnt that aware of his body at least not for seduction it was something jeanclaude would have done not richard then i had one of those horrible thoughts what if one of the things that richard had gained with the tighter binding of the marks was some of jeanclaudes skill at seduction oh that just wouldnt be fair i closed my eyes and started for the door again it was better if i couldnt see either of them jeanclaude called ma petite you are going to hit the wall i stopped abruptly and opened my eyes and was inches away from the wall the door was about two feet to my left great just great ma petite do not leave us his voice crawled through the tiny hole id made in my shields for him it crawled inside and played along my skin made me shiver and god help me i turned back and looked stupid me jeanclaude had crawled up on the bed near the pillows he was lying full length across the red silk with the robe gaping open barely covering anything his white white shoulder was framed at the top with scarlet silk his long legs spilled half in the black robe and half on the scarlet of the sheets only the barest fringe of fur covered his hips richard was still on his side they were lying in almost identical positions except that richards head was pointing away from the door and jeanclaude was angled toward it this isnt fair i said not both of you not at the same time whatever do you mean ma petite but he looked entirely too pleased with himself to really need to ask you bastard you knew i knew nothing but one lives in hope i was having trouble breathing or rather breathing nice even breaths i was shaking my head and the towel started coming unwound i caught it and stood there with it in my hands the cloth was wet and cold i was shivering but it was only partly from the wet hair sliding down my neck richard you are getting your shoes on the silk sheets has no one taught you that you do not wear hiking boots on silk he didnt even try to make it sound real it was teasing but it wasnt richard he was teasing richard just sat up bunching his stomach muscles nicely and put one foot on his jeans and began to unlace the short boots he didnt look at me while he did it but he knew i was watching i needed to leave now i really did i knew that but somehow i was still standing there when richard threw his first boot onto the floor the sound made me jump he watched me while he took off the other boot or watched me watch him i felt like one of those little birds that they say are fascinated with the snakes movements so pretty so sinuous so dangerous he was just taking off his shoes damn it it shouldnt have meant this much to me hell to anyone when both boots had been thrown to the floor he took off his thick socks without any prompting from anyone he lay back on the bed on his stomach with his feet naked against the sheets he watched me over his shoulder with that wave of hair barely curling around his eye the look managed to be both coy and knowledgeable like a fallen angel innocence and the promise of sin all in one look it was a very good look it was not a look id ever thought to see on richards face it didnt seem very much like him how much of this is you richard and how much of it is him he lay flat on the silk and rolled over onto his back in a movement that was doglike and catlike at the same time or maybe im just prejudiced that dogs dont move with that same liquid grace when they withe on their backs he stretched his arms over his head stretched his whole long body out from toes to fingertips stretched until his body shook with the effort then he relaxed against the bed he laid his hands across his stomach and smiled at me with that same mix of innocent sin im not sure he said in a voice that was thicker than it should have been this early in doesnt that scare you i asked and my voice was breathy for a different reason now richard frowned just a little between those dark dark brown eyes then he shook his head im not scared in fact i feel calmer than ive felt in days i looked past him to jeanclaude who had laid back against the mound of pillows so that the crimson of the sheets framed his black curls perfectly oh stop being so damned picturesque youre messing with his mind not really what does not really mean i mean that i did not mean to do it i am still adapting to this new power level too ma petite i was worried for you earlier today i was afraid what would happen with nathaniel and damian i thought iwish she was not so afraid of nathaniel and what he wants from her i swear to you that is all i thought nothing more but today i find that you have crossed several lines with him that you swore never to cross are you saying you made me do it non ma petite i am saying i wished you to be less afraid of what you wanted and you were i did not realize that it could possibly have had an effect upon you until just moments ago when i simply thought i wish richard was not so afraid of what he wants and now he is not did you hear all that richard hes using vamp powers on you richard gave me a lazy smile i feel calmer less afraid less conflicted i hadnt realized how bad i was still feeling until now fine im afraid enough for both of us if you really did mess with me earlier today then why am i about to walk out of this room i thought merely that i wished you would be less afraid of what you wanted from nathaniel and what nathaniel wanted from you i was not so specific with our richard you wondered if it worked the first time so you tried it again and voilа you have your empirical evidence because it worked twice perhaps or perhaps it is merely coincidence it will take us weeks or months to decipher what is true power and what is simply all of us coming to terms with ourselves i didnt like the sound of that at all i cant do this why ever not jeanclaude asked because once i would have given nearly anything to have you both like this i need to know what this means richard sat up enough to prop himself on his elbows you said it yourself anita youre already dating jeanclaude and asher and living with micah and nathaniel you said that the thought of a man on either side of you just flat does it for you whats one more pair i glared at jeanclaude do you have like some metaphysical fist up his ass like hes some kind of ventriloquist dummy because that doesnt sound like him that sounds like you dont talk to him when you want to talk to me richard said he sat up and the sleepy smile was gone does it bother me that youre with micah and nathaniel and jeanclaude and asher hell yes does it bother you that im with clair and half a dozen women in my pack he looked at me when he said it i looked back he finally said that was a question anita can i have an answer yeah it bothered me to see clair and to meet your girlfriend for the first time while i was nude yes that was a special treat i try to know as little about your personal life with the ladies of your pack as possible so the rest i didnt know about i felt how much you wanted me earlier at your house and you know how i felt about you so lets not pretend anymore about that i hadnt known we were pretending but i didnt say it out loud i dont know what you mean by that richard it means we both want to be able to touch each other again you fucked byron for gods sake why are you okay with doing him and not about thisus he motioned as if taking in the whole bed i didnt think the us meant him and me for the first time from richard i was pretty sure that he was talking about him and jeanclaude i clutched the cold towel and tried to say out loud something that made sense im notchange thatbyron was emergency food once upon a time i thought you and i were going to be it for each other when you dumped me it broke me up touching you is still not like touching other people for me i feel the same way you know i do he said i know you want me but i also know that youll be ashamed later when jeanclaude isnt there to calm your fears youll start to drown in them again i laughed god for the first time i understand what asher was saying about me and theardeur i dont want this to be a good time now then we go back to cutting each other up i couldnt bear it there that was the truth i had a glimmer for the first time why some people do casual sex with people they dont care about if you dont care and it goes horribly wrong its not that important i dont want us to keep cutting each other up either anita i really dont he rolled to the edge of the bed and stood up the dozen or more candles painted his upper body in shadow and light i missed the thick fall of his hair around his shoulders but it was still richard still the man who had come closest to making me try for the picket fence and the twopointfive kids you still need at least one more daytime feed the topic change was too quick for me i pressed myself against the door so that the doorknob was in reach if i had to run for it i wanted to hit the door not the wall yes though i found out that i can feed on human form then feed again on the animal form and its like two different feeds jeanclaude crawled closer to the end of the bed the robe more framing his body like lingerie than hiding anything so in effect you now have four daytime feeds yes sort of right now nathaniel and i are estimating i need to feed theardeur about every six hours or i start draining damians life energy since i cant feed on the same person every day that still leaves me short it may leave us as you say short at night even youd fought to push your feedings to every twelve hours i dont know jeanclaude but i seem to need to feed more often you are the energy for your new triumvirate it takes energy to maintain it richard turned and looked at the other man are you saying that anita and i drain energy from you he turned back to me before he got his answer and the look on his face said he wasnt happy with the show jeanclaude was putting on not precisely but in a way oui all power comes with a price richard and that price can be high i think until i understand how to distribute the power among the three of us that its every six hours i hadnt thought about the fact that only you and asher feed me at night shit i said the last with feeling you have damian now richard said wont three be enough i looked at him tried to see jealousy or anger but he seemed to have offered it as simply a fact i dont know maybe i trustma petite to control what she can jeanclaude said nearly from the end of the bed the robe sliding over his upper body until almost everything above the stilltied sash was naked to light there was something about the way his body caught the flames shining and pale almost unreal as if he were some kind of living work of art that you would touch and he would fade too beautiful to be real richard snapped his fingers and the sharp noise brought my attention back to him he was frowning are you actually turning me down this was too hard a question for me i closed my eyes so i couldnt see either of them not exactly but i need to know what to expect richard i need to know what this changes every third day or so i come to your house and you feed theardeur i opened my eyes then just a little sex and thats it what do you want from me anita i pushed away from the door because now i was getting angry not dating just fuckbuddies is that it youre living with two men now i dont think theres room for me in your life what i wanted to say was if you can just fuck me and nothing else then we were never really in love what i said out loud was its not just the sex i miss richard i miss weekend movie marathons i miss going places with you i miss you not just your body richard i almost kept the next part to myself but i had to know it was time do you miss me richard or just my body i managed to make it neutral very neutral brownie points for me he looked down and emotions fought across his face his power flared like a warm wind then died down when he looked at me there was pain and anger in his eyes youre the one who said it first anita we dont work as each others one and only im working hard to accept my life as it is but i cant live like you do i still want one woman to be my forever person i still want marriage and maybe kids i want a life anita i know now that i cant have what i want with you he reached out toward me then his hands curled into fists but i miss you not just the sex i miss the smell of you on my pillow on my skin i owe you an apology when everything happened in tennessee i blamed my beast first then i blamed you it took six weeks of therapy to get me to see that i was pissed at you for saving my mother and brother when i couldnt do it you would have given your life to save them i said yes but then wed all be dead it wasnt just pain in his eyes it was anguish the kind of emotion that eats you up and spits you back out you did horrible things anita horrible things to find out where they were in time you tortured a man cut him up to get the information i couldnt have done that i wouldnt have let anyone do it in front of me it wasnt just that you saved them and i didnt it was when i heard all that happened i realized that even if id been there with you they would have died my mother and daniel would have died because i wouldnt have let you do what was necessary to save them i just looked at him because i couldnt think of anything good to say i wasnt proud of what id done in tennessee not all of it anyway but i didnt regret any of it because to save charlotte and daniel i would have done worse my only true regret had been that i didnt get there before they were raped and tortured i would go to my grave regretting that part because id seen charlotte break into tears in her kitchen she would say i dont know why im crying so silly it wasnt silly and id recommended a good therapist i knew the one i usually recommended to people wanting to join the church of eternal life as a forever member youre the bolverk for my pack the evildoer the one who does what the ulfric wont or cant do raina was bolverk for marcus yeah i said see i could still talk but i still didnt have anything good to say i want the white picket fence anita and i know you dont its not that i dont want it richard its that its too late for me my life wont fit in that picture he nodded i know and maybe mine wont either but i still want to try there are ulfrics that have a wife and family separate from the pack ive been trying to find a new lupa for the pack and no one measures up no one is you i was back to not knowing what to say so i said nothing i rarely got in trouble keeping my mouth shut i think the reason your beast got out of control today is that youve been spending too much time with just one animal i think if you have personal contact with something besides leopards that your beast will go back to being just amorphous more metaphysics than physical i want your permission to send some of the wolves over to bunk with you richard i dont mean fuck them but sleep with them or take some wererats home pick an animal but if your power only touches leopards its going to think its a leopard and youre one of the wolves that will be stopping by i couldnt keep the irony and the unhappiness out of my voice i dont mean it to be casual anita i mean be our lupa bring the leopards with you and they can hunt with us on the full moon ill be your lupa which means what what changes were a couple within the lycanthrope community youll have more contact with my wolves outside of just crisis situations micah has really been working his tail off helping everybody out we need at least one other person full time on the hotline hes running himself ragged i didnt know you were keeping track im trying to pay attention anita im trying to see whats there not what i want to be there i couldnt share you the way micah shares you with nathaniel not every day every night i dont think i could tolerate you dating jeanclaude and asher i certainly wouldnt be able to play blood donor on as regular a basis as micah and nathaniel do i just blinked at him because this was a talk i never thought id have with richard it was way too logical i agree with everything you said in that last bit but it doesnt change anything does it i felt the power of your triumvirate with damian and nathaniel damians not a master and nathaniel is no nimirraj but the three of you together are an amazing amount of power what would we be the three of us if we did this right if we did this the way it was meant to be done that so doesnt sound like you i said tell me you havent thought about it since you did the other triumvirate i couldnt in all honesty so i didnt try i felt what jeanclaude and i could do at his club when primo got out of control i felt what jeanclaude could do when i let him feed theardeur in a way that was closer to a full feeding with other women so yeah i thought about it sort of you said it yourself anita we dont have enough soldiers we need to look strong and not just for the vampires that might want this territory our pack has a bad rep thanks to me and raina and marcus before me my reputation is shit among the other ulfrics they think im weak and ive had some scouts from other territories that have too many dominants and not enough land so far our pack is so screwed up that they leave without a challenge no one wants the mess ive made of it but as i get a better handle on my wolves that may change if we all joined together the way you and jeanclaude did last night if we were really a triumvirate of power no one would touch us anita no one would dare it was almost a direct quote from something id thought earlier i looked past him to jeanclaude were parroting what youve been thinking for months arent we he shrugged those lovely bare shoulders oui but i did not put the thoughts there ma petite i believe that both of you have come to the same conclusion at the same time is that so hard to believe i dont know i said and i was tired tired of the games tired of hurting tired of being scared richard lay back on the bed one knee up the other down so that he looked winsome as hell against the red sheets im scared again anita i dont want everything were building to go down in flames because were mad at each other let jeanclaude take the edge off my fear it felt great i looked past him to the vampire who was still draped against the pillows did you pull back from his mind non ma petite he simply fought a little and i was cast out both of you have the power to thwart me if you wish to i dont wish to richard said and that smile came back it was lazy and sleepy and filled his eyes with that knowledgeable innocence again i realized in that moment that it wasnt jeanclaudes look it was richard if he wasnt afraid or angry or conflicted it was what he might be if he didnt get in his own way all the time ma petite jeanclaude raised his hand toward me join us i was shaking my head richard reached out toward me too you want to you know you want to my life is as close to working as it ever has been i dont want that to go to wrack and ruin either im not offering to go back to what we had anita i understand that that wont work for us you are harder and more ruthless than i will ever be and i can let you be that but not if youre my only sweetie i need a little distance from the worst of it so i can pretend a little not much but just enough so i dont lose my mind he snuggled back until his head was resting against jeanclaudes side jeanclaude was all black fur and velvet against white skin his hair spilled around his naked upper body like a dark dream he turned his head so he could look at richard lying there richard was all tan and jeans and seemed to burn with how very alive he was they looked like theyd stepped out of two very different porno movies jeanclaude looked up at me and there was a pleading in his eyes without a word he asked please ma petite please do not spoil this no fourth mark i said agreed jeanclaude said for now richard said i looked at him right now a lot of things seem like a good idea no dont frown anita if a little vampire magic can take the edge off my anxiety im all for it it works better than the pills the doctor gave me lycanthropes bodies work too fast for most medicines to stay in the body long enough to help i said i know richard said and he raised his head up just enough that he was resting directly on jeanclaudes bare back it was probably just as well that he couldnt see jeanclaudes face when that thick hair touched his skin he probably wouldnt have liked any man looking like that because of him come ma petite let us be a true triumvirate at last be lupa in more than just name for richard and his pack keep your living arrangements as they are but allow richard to visit while he keeps searching for ms right among the human population you will have your men and he will have his woman it is fair ma petite i wasnt sure how i felt about the fairness of it i dont know how i feel about all of this some great but others i dont know if ill be able to live like that we can but try jeanclaude said richard held his hand out to me anita please please if you leave you know i wont stay you were able to let jeanclaude get closer without me being there to buffer it but i need you to help me he pushed up to his knees and held out his hand please anita i promise not to run no matter how dark my fantasies get just feeding for jeanclaude and some slap and tickle i asked and couldnt help but sound suspicious richard glanced back and he and jeanclaude had one of those rare guy moments the looks they exchanged said plainly that that hadnt been what they had in mind jeanclaude said voice mild if that is all you wish from us we can restrain ourselves i closed my eyes was that all i wished from them no was that all i could stand right now maybe it was a wonderful offer it seemed to fix most of the problems that wed raised with the new power so why was i still hesitant you know finding a wife that would be okay with you sleeping with another woman isnt going to be easy nothing worth doing is easy richard said and maybe ill find that the white picket fence isnt for me after all all i know is that right now right this moment i know what i want and what i want is you a lot of women would have run to him thrown their arms around him and said something like oh richard but that just wasnt me what i was thinking was that if clair had been his little fuckbuddy he wouldnt be here now he wouldnt want me now i dropped the towel on the floor and was shaking my head im not sure this is a good idea richard was still holding his hand out to me neither am i then why are we doing it again because we want to doesnt seem like a good enough reason but i moved slowly toward the bed because when im near you all i can think about is the smell of your skin and the way your hair spreads like black foam on my pillows because when im near you all i can remember is how your body feels against mine i have to be a bastard to you so that i dont fall down at your feet and beg you to take me back tell you that it wasnt you i hated it was me and im sorry that i took that out on you sorrier than i can say that you had the courage to make a life that worked for you regardless of how far that life was from where you wanted it to be help me have the courage to do the same anita help me be who i am he moved his hands just a little closer to mine his fingers brushed mine i think i would have jerked away like you do when your skin brushes something so hot it will burn but he grabbed my hands wrapped them in the warmth of his hands his hands that were so much bigger than mine so that he could hide my hands in his as if i were a child id never really liked that about richard he was so much bigger than me that sometimes i felt overwhelmed like now id learned a long time ago that if something sounds too good to be true it is if someone promises you everything your heart desires they lie he drew me into the circle of his arms so that the front of my body was pressed against his he buried his face against my chest still covered by silk but the weight of his face against me made me close my eyes and when i opened them i was looking at jeanclaude he looked not at richards bare back but at me at my face i watched him be afraid be afraid that id say no richard rubbed his face against the silk and his breath came through the cloth like something that should have burned but it didnt it made me shiver as if i were cold but held in the circle of his arms with his breath hot on my skin i felt as if i would never be cold again i couldnt stop my hands from stroking his hair still woefully short but thick and heavy and just richards jeanclaude was on his knees he didnt raise his hands but he put the wordplease into his face those eyes his voice whispered through my head ma petite we endanger everyone that depends on us by this hesitation everything we have worked so hard to build hangs upon the next challenge to my power or to richards if we do not embrace our power as a triumvirate there will come a night when someone sweeps over us and we will not prevail the worst that could happen is not that richard may come to your bed then come no more or that you may grow discontent with micah and nathaniel the worst is that we are dead and our people will be at the mercy of others that do not love them he held his hand out to me come to us ma petite come to us and let us build a fortress behind which our people all of our people may be safe that last he said out loud richard raised his face enough to gaze up the line of my body please anita dont punish everyone because ive been a bastard jeanclaude was close enough that i could have taken his hand while richard still held me in his arms please ma petite if there is word or deed that would move you i would say it or do it tell me only what to say or what to do and it is yours i took in a lot of air and let it out slow i reached out and let his fingers brush mine he came that fraction closer so he could take my hand and that was the deed he took my hand and i knew that nothing hed whispered in my head had been a lie what would i do to keep my leopards safe anything what would i do to undo the damage that richard had done to his wolves almost anything what would i do to keep jeanclaudes vampires from being at the mercy of masters like belle morte anything a night of metaphysical or not so metaphysical sex with one man that i loved and another man that kept breaking my heart so i must love him too or he couldnt keep doing that seemed a small enough price or maybe i just wanted to be with them both in a bed for the first time yes the first time contrary to all the rumors maybe i feared the chance would never come again and i simply didnt want to be the one who said no maybe we stayed on the corner of the bed as if there was no more bed to use i was still not sure it was a good idea i think richard was uncomfortable with jeanclaude being in the bed jeanclaude was just being patient biding his time because he knew if he pushed one of us would bolt when richards mouth first found mine and i drank in the taste of him like some almost forgotten addiction i thought id be the one to run screaming for the hills but the third time richard winced when jeanclaude brushed his bare back i began to think it wouldnt be me that screwed this up he cursed in french then said in english i put my hand on your shoulder to steady myself nothing more you are acting as if i am after your virtue i assure you that i am afterma petite s virtue not yours richard sighed and looked down so that even sitting in his lap i couldnt see his face you keep touching me jeanclaude made a sound low in his throat how am i to touch her if she is in your lap your arms kissing you without at the very least brushing your body with mine i am not such a magician that i can share a woman with another man and never once touch the other mans body trust me he hasnt been doing much more than holding me i said i touched richards chin and he let me raise his face up to me i looked into those solid brown eyes and all i saw was pain confusion whats wrong you were the one who was all hot for this you talked me into it remember im sorry he said he pressed his forehead to my shoulder im sorry he said again jeanclaude and i stared at each other over his bent head i asked the question with my expression what the hell is going on tell us what is wrong mon ami and we will try to help the last time i was in a bed with another man and a woman it was raina and gabriel id known that raina had been his first lover but that hed ever let gabriel touch him that i had not known i was so astounded that i was glad he couldnt see my face raina had been bad enough but both of them at the same time uckies uckies uckies rainas munin was usually quiet behind its metaphysical cage bars but my reaction gave her a tiny opening raina had behaved herself for so long that it caught me off guard made me a little less quick to squash her back down and protect us all or maybe it was the fact that i was touching one of her pack one that she knew in every way i saw gabriel like a technicolor ghost with his black curls just long enough to touch his pale gray leopard eyes the silver ring through his nipple glinted in the lamplight i was lying back in the middle of a big bed and gabriel crawled from one side and richard crawled from the other both moving in that graceful stalk as if they had muscles in places that humans did not it was a younger richard less muscled face a little less sure of itself his hair cut neat and clean richard when he was twenty before i ever met him his face so open eager laughing wed told him it was a game raina wanted to have two men ravage her a little rape fantasy among friends he pinned my wrists her wrists and as requested there was no foreplay it was supposed to be rough i could see through her eyes as she watched gabriel come in behind richards back it was a rape fantasy alright but raina wasnt the victim richard screamed and stood up dumping me to the floor he took two shaking steps and collapsed to his knees something about what rainas munin had done had torn down his shields i wasnt getting the memory just his reaction to it shame anger rage i got glimpses of gabriel and him fighting not struggling but beating the hell out of each other both of them nude slick with each others blood raina watching from the bed her mouth wet her tongue playing along her lips enjoying the show richard tried to shield but he couldnt it was as if the emotions had stripped him of his shields it was jeanclaudes cool touch in my head that shut it down he shielded richard from me and i think from himself he gave him back his metaphysical clothes so that he wasnt raw before us i too have my memory of gabriel jeanclaude said his voice was soft we both looked at him richard said you and gabriel the look on his face showed his disgust not by choice it was her price for convincing marcus that he should continue to ally with me a night with both of them i asked jeanclaude nodded did you know richard asked before did you know what they wanted you for he nodded again i negotiated that night as completely as any night i have ever bargained for richard was still on his knees on the floor he looked back at jeanclaude and you knew you knew that she wanted to watch gabriel have you she wanted many things but that was one she was most adamant about how could you let him do that to you a strange look came over richards face oh but you dont mind you like men jeanclaudes face went blank him hiding away actually yes i did mind i minded very much but it was one of the points that raina would not give up she wanted certain things and that was one of them he raised his robe around his shoulders as if he was cold and would not look at either of us i talked her out of a great many things that would have hurt a great deal more you didnt enjoy it richard said jeanclaude gave him a look such a look it sent the vampires power like cool water through the room rape is rape richard is a woman less raped because she likes men thats a question richard no of course not he said then why is it less rape for a man who likes men to be raped by another man richard looked away at that i was left sitting on the floor not knowing what to say or who to comfort or even how to start comforting i didnt know any of this my bargain with raina was based on it not being known it would have undermined my authority which would have defeated the purpose of the bargain i got up off the ground and went to jeanclaude i reached out to him halfafraid hed move away no ones good with this kind of pain but men seem especially bad at it i think its because they have a hard time thinking of themselves as potential victims women are raised with the possibility most of us understand from an early age that we are not the biggest or strongest its why when women fight they fight dirty somethings got to make up for the lack of upper body strength i touched his face and he gave me that blank beautiful look as if he were a painting that held color and line and beauty but not life as if telling the secret sucked something precious away from him im sorry i said softly he smiled and some tension left him and something of him began to seep back into his eyes i thought you might be upset find me sullied goods i raised eyebrows at that you never blame the victim jeanclaude dont you know that by now he smiled a little wider and laid his face against my hand i have never thanked you for killing them both they were trying to kill me at the time and film it for a snuff flick trust me it was my pleasure to whack them both richard got to his feet and came to stand near us just out of comfortable reach that night was why i broke up with raina he laughed and it sounded bitter as if he would choke on it broke up god that sounds so high school gabriel and i nearly beat each other to death while she watched he was shaking his head and even with his hair barely grown out it was already longer than it had been in the memory i wondered if that was one of the reasons that he grew it long so it would help him feel different i can find other food jeanclaude said you do not have to do anything you are not comfortable with richard looked at us my hand still on jeanclaudes face what i said earlier is still true we need the three of us to be as close as the two of you are i do not believe you are ready to do what is necessary for such a binding jeanclaude said what is necessary exactly he asked jeanclaude licked his lips this is magic not science in truth i am not sure we could do the fourth mark that i know how to do but what happened at the club last night was not the fourth mark it was as ifma petite slipped into me we were joined as never before and it made us unbelievably powerful how did it work we touched we were in the middle of a crisis of police proportions i said oui but i think it will work with touching we are of belles line and most of her magic can be reached through physical closeness physical closeness richard said and he shook his head define physical closeness jeanclaude smiled tell me what you would have of me richard what rules and restrictions would make you feel safe if i said dont touch me then i say we are wasting our time ma petite and i were touching when it happened not intimately but the contact was important physical contact makes most of my powers easier define not intimate i think he was holding my hand i said richard smiled a quick flash in his tanned face handholding i can manage jeanclaude smiled and it was nice to see them smiling at each other for once i would ask that if i need to touch you for balance that that be allowed richard narrowed his eyes a little depends on where youre touching me but okay jeanclaude shook his head that is not richards look that is your look ma petite your look from our richards face well you know what they say couples start looking like each other after awhile richard looked at me couple i shrugged if im going to be lupa to your ulfric then yeah thats how your pack will see it he nodded then smiled again just like that you agree to it all i reached out my hand and after a moments hesitation he took it there was no flash of munin or raina it was just his hand so warm in mine well try it see if it works depends on what i have to do as your lupa i just want you to know that you can walk out the door right now and ill still try to play lupanar with you he squeezed my hand you wont force me not my kick nor mine jeanclaude said i have been victim too many times over the centuries it has given me no taste for it richard took in a big breath which moved his chest and shoulders and raised his stomach up and down as if hed drawn air all the way down to his toes he let it out slowly then nodded lets try if i cant do it then i cant do it but ill try i kept my hand in jeanclaudes but stepped away from him until i was standing in front of richard i went up on tiptoes and he bent down so i could kiss him gently on the mouth have i told you recently that i think you are very brave his eyes filled with something warm and good never then im saying it now thank you he said and his arm slid around my waist the warmth of his skin pulsing even through the silk no not his warmth his power jeanclaude stood up and i drew him into the back of my body richard tensed when jeanclaudes body pinned his arm but he fought it fought to relax he wasnt entirely successful but he tried a for effort now lets get naked i said i actually made them both choke and laugh at the same time ma petite what has made you so bold it takes the three of us forever to do anything we discuss it we argue it we fight we make up we fight i dont want to discuss anymore if were going to do this lets do it just like that richard said off with the clothes no sweet talk first i leaned into the circle of his arm and the weight of jeanclaude behind my back i looked up richards face and said i want to see if i can deep throat you he blinked at me then started to laugh then stopped and finally said in a strained voice you couldnt before it was great but you never quite ive been practicing i said i smiled up at him that smile he said what smile i said jeanclaude answered the knowing smile the one that says youre thinking dirty thoughts and you want to do them all with me youre the only woman i know that can put innocence and evil into the same look evil i said am i supposed to be offended i just never expected to see that smile directed at me again he kissed me on the forehead for that smile id do a lot i still dont get the idea of innocence and evil in the same smile you have the look of a fallen angel ma petite an angel does not stop being an angel merely because they fall from grace their wings are not so easily taken i remembered thinking almost the same thing about richard earlier like a fallen angel should it have bothered me that jeanclaude and i were using the same analogy yeah but out loud all i said was i thought you were the dark angel here i turned so i could see his face he smiled and whispered nothing i could have offered would have gotten him out of his pants i heard that richard said jeanclaude laughed and will you refuse her offer he looked from jeanclaude to me then back to jeanclaude richard laughed a very masculine laugh no i was suddenly very aware of the two of them pressed on either side of me enough foreplay off with the clothes the clothes came off then richard argued with me on what position id be better able to deep throat him like i said the three of us together have to argue about everything jeanclaude settled the argument by simply saying letma petite try her way and if it does not work we can try yours i began to realize that richard and i as a couple was truly impossible but as a threesome if the third was our diplomat it might work what does it say when you need another adult in the bed to referee nothing i wanted to think about too deeply not at that moment at that moment i let all the doubts go all of them i knew richard and i too well not to suspect that we would wreck this later but for now right now we had this moment i tried to get out of my way and enjoy it and had to trust the men to do the same id seen richard nude and recently but it had been a long time since id seen him stretched nude on a bed on his back with the long length of his body spilled out in front of me i made him spread his legs so i could lie down between them rest my head against the muscled swell of his thigh and gaze up the length of him it was a form of teasing myself almost so close to his groin but not touching but it wasnt that i just wanted to look it was the whole package and it wasnt just that he was lovely to look at it was that after id looked at the groin only partially erect and still impressive the flat plain of his stomach with its perfect dimple of belly button the swell of his chest with his nipples like dark brown punctuation to all that permanently tanned muscle the swell of his shoulders and finally his face his face gazing down at me the pure brown of his eyes like chocolate the look in them already a little unfocused when all id done was lay my cheek against his thigh and breathed out along his testicles a feather of a touch and already his face was showing the effect as were other parts of his body it wasnt just the body it was richard looking down at me the weight of him in his eyes him staring down the line of his own body while i lay between his thighs i used to think that only death would take someone away from me but i had learned that so many lesser things can steal someone away just as completely just as forever they live they breathe but you never get to touch them you never see them nude you never wake to their smile the smell of their skin on your sheets there are things so much less dramatic than death that are just as permanent if i never got to be here like this with richard again i wanted it to last i wanted to take my time where was jeanclaude sitting in the far corner of the bed opposite us he was nude but sitting with his back against the wall one knee drawn up so that he was covered for the most part even if you looked directly at him he looked like a great pale cat curled on the pillows once i would have said he looked utterly relaxed but i knew him too well now i saw the way he held his shoulders the tension in one leg he was holding himself in check being oh so careful i settled my cheek against richards thigh the way a cat will scent mark you rubbing back and forth just that nothing more but it made him writhe his legs tensing around me so that his legs flexed on either side of my body the feel of even that much made me close my eyes and rest my cheek between his legs so that my face was cradled oh so gently against the soft warmth of his testicles i nestled my mouth against that silky skin the tiny stiff hairs tickled along my face as i licked that soft moveable skin more hair to tickle along my lips i preferred smoother skin a little less fuzzy but of course i could have that by simply moving up i went up on my knees and licked along the front of his shaft licked it like it was a big piece of candy and i didnt want it to melt licked it back and forth up and down just on the front of the shaft until he cried out and his hands convulsed on the red sheets anita please no more teasing i raised up so i was kneeling between his legs teasing thats not teasing thats foreplay he swallowed and it looked like it was an effort or maybe his throat was dry then less foreplay at least for me i dont need it i looked down at him the eagerness in his eyes his face his whole body i could feel what he wanted feel it almost like he was yelling it in my head i looked at jeanclaude some men like a lot of foreplay jeanclaude gave that gallic shrug but it is not me that you are pleasing now i thought you said we had to all three be touching for this to work i thought i would give you and richard a chance to reacquaint yourselves before i joined you i climbed over richards thigh so i could kneel beside his hip sometime during all this sex the boundaries between us will come crashing down if we arent all three touching when it happens we may miss our window to bind ourselves closer perhaps jeanclaude said what do you propose come hold richards hand anita richard began i wrapped my hand around the base of him and found that he wasnt quite as hard as he had been a moment before the thought of jeanclaude joining us did not do it for him i was sorry that it bothered him but i hadnt crawled into this bed for just sex it was an allornothing deal sex and more metaphysical muscle not just sex i squeezed him one quick pulse and it stole his words made his breath shudder from between his lips richards going to need something to hold on to soon and theres no headboard richard found his voice that was oversharing and he sounded a little angry you know you like to hold on to something solid while i do this he gave me sullen eyes it was not a look i wanted to see today not from him hold his hand richard thats all im asking right now just hold his hand or let him hold yours is that so much to ask i turned so that i was facing away from him but facing directly another part of his anatomy which also had a head i kept my hand on the base of him and slid my mouth over him he wasnt completely hard yet and i fought to take as much of him in as i could before he stiffened it was easier a little softer less hard to swallow past a certain point even soft there came that moment where my body said no were choking that nothing this big should be coming down this far in one piece it was as if i was swallowing him down but because he was still attached and so big it was more like i walked my throat over him up him id found that if i didnt struggle that i could breathe with this much down my throat i could breathe if i didnt struggle i could fight my way down the long thick shaft of him if i relaxed while i fought for it it was a struggle to get all the way down but at the same time the trick was not to fight only i could make oral sex into a zen moment when my lip felt the solid touch of the front of his body then and only then did i let myself begin to slide back up it was always so much easier going up than coming down i came up off of him breathless but pleased id only recently been able to do that with micah after some very embarrassing failed attempts like in throwing up embarrassing its one of the reasons you should never try this stuff with people unless you love them people who love you dont point and laugh i didnt give him time to catch his breath only for me to catch mine i slid my mouth back over him swallowed him down until the back of my throat convulsed around the end of him and i could feel my throat close around the end of him so deep so terribly deep i slid back up the long thick shaft of him then forced myself down down until i met his body with my lips and there was nowhere else to go no more of him to take inside me then it wasnt that i tried to squeeze him in my mouth but that my throat convulsed on its own tightening down around him my body trying to get rid of something so big so impossible to swallow i swallowed my own saliva so i didnt choke on it only when i knew i couldnt take anymore that one more time shoving him so deep in my throat would hurt did i let myself stop swallowing i let the wetness of my own mouth trail behind my lips slide down the thickness of him trail in thick wet lines down the shaft of him until he was as wet from my mouth as he would have been between my legs richards voice god anita god i raised my mouth off of him my own saliva trailing in thick lines from my mouth to his body i raised up and turned carefully slowly so hed get the full visual he was staring down his body at me his eyes too wide face almost frantic anita and then he saw me and the visual threw his head back spasmed his hands out searching for something to hold on to hed already thrown off every pillow near him richards hands searching for a headboard that wasnt there searching for something to hold on to his hand hit jeanclaudes hand with a sharp smack of flesh on flesh richard stopped his frantic flailing looked at the other man who had been so quiet so still pressed against the wall and the top of the bed they had a moment when they were meeting each others eyes i dont know what richard would have said or done because i rolled my hands up and over his groin used the thick liquid to smooth over him to glide over the head of him it closed his eyes and bowed his spine i turned so that i was facing them i wanted to watch their faces i wrapped my hand around him about halfway down then bent my face back over him and slid him into my mouth until i came to my hand it was easier to take him in faster harder with all of him it had been a fight and no matter how good it felt having him in my mouth down my throat i was still fighting my body to keep him down to breathe to swallow so that saliva didnt build up and make me choke there was so much to concentrate on that i didnt have time to enjoy it as much as i wanted to with only about half of him to work with it was just fun it wasnt just the feel of him so ripe and hard in my mouth but the skin was so soft softer than any other skin on the body it was like rolling muscled silk on my tongue pounding it inside my mouth i watched richards body while i did it his whole body writhed his frantic breathing making everything from his stomach to his shoulders move both his hands were clasped in jeanclaudes hands now richards hands convulsed until the muscles in his arms bulged and he came up off the bed crying a sound that was both a moan and scream that ended with my name he settled back to the bed his eyes closed and i had a moment to look into jeanclaudes face without richard watching for an instant jeanclaude let me see how much this meant to him the feel of all that strength in his hands that richards struggles had pressed more of his body up against jeanclaudes legs that he was able to be here while richard gave himself over to such abandon for an instant it shone in his eyes and i knew in that moment that as patient and careful as hed been with me it was nothing to how careful he had been with richard stop richard said stop or ill go oh god stop he raised his head up laughing breathless and the look on his face was joyous free in a way that he seldom looked these days i slid him out of my mouth while i watched his face he let his head fall back to the bed his arms shoulders beginning to relax beginning to slide away from jeanclaudes hands i licked the head of him and he convulsed again muscles cording in his arms and chest his hands crushing around jeanclaudes if thered been a headboard it might not have survived but vampires are made of sterner stuff than wood or metal please anita please stop let me catch my breath or i wont last i stroked my hand up the wet thickness of him he shuddered and said hand too god just stop please the last please did it an element of franticness i took my hand away and knelt beside his body my hands in my lap its hard to be demure when youre naked in a bed with two men but i did my best richard let himself relax into the bed let the tension of pleasure slide away his head rested against jeanclaudes thigh his hands still loose in the other mans hands either he was too high on sex to think about it or he didnt mind as a shapeshifter he shouldnt have minded mere physical contact with someone hell the shapeshifters slept in big naked puppy piles but richard had always made a very clear line between vampires and shapeshifters vampires didnt get the upclose and personal stuff period he turned his head found that he needed a better angle and used jeanclaudes thigh like a pillow to raise his face up enough to look at me comfortably he moved his hands out of the other mans but he kept his head propped there and the two of them were framed against the dark of the wall and the crimson of the sheets both nude both so terribly right it was as if id waited a long time to see them like this if we hadnt been shielding so tight id have wondered if it was my thought or someone elses give me a few minutes or the next thing we do will be the last thing we do and it wont last long god you were good before but not like that he rolled his head back so he could look up the line of jeanclaudes body to his face did you teach her that why is it that all men assume that only men can teach a woman how to have good sex i said richard turned back to me and smileda smile more relaxed than any id seen in so long from him are you saying you learned this from another woman he was teasing and let it show in his voice the teasing tone made me smile no i figured it out on my own thank you very much like i said ive been practicing he rolled his head back to look at jeanclaude who obliged him by looking down to meet richards gaze on you jeanclaude smiled non man ami i am wellendowed but not so blessed as to helpma petite learn such technique richard looked back down toward me there was a look on his face that id seen all too often lately a nothappy look who ill make you a deal richard you dont ask me about my lovers and i wont ask you about yours whats that supposed to mean it means if you werent a lycanthrope i would never have gone down on you like this until you proved you were disease free you can get aids gonorrhea hepatitis all just from oral sex but lucky for you you cant get anything the lycanthropy destroys everything but itself so youre disease free do you even know how many of the women in your pack and vernes youve slept with yes he said and the anger was still there do i want to know the number no he said but ill bet ive never even come close to a number that large in my bed i thought you said you hadnt kept track of what i was doing ive heard a little enough to know youve cleared three digits or close to it so lets agree not to get too possessive or too selfrighteous neither of us has the room for it he covered his face with his hands and made a sound almost a growl jeanclaude looked at me his face was fighting for neutral but not quite making it we were closer than wed ever been to being a true triumvirate and richard and i were blowing it fine youre right youre right if this is going to work youre right richard said i was the only one who saw the relief and surprise on jeanclaudes face by the time richard lowered his hands and sat up jeanclaudes face was back to pleasant and unreadable i guess my face was surprised enough for both of us richard smiled at me though his eyes were still not happy i wanted you in this bed im not going to throw it away being stupid his smile brightened and finally filled his eyes alright ill try not to be too pigheaded but lately i cant seem to help it welcome to my world i said the smile got warmer trade me places he said i frowned what trade me places he scooted away from jeanclaude and patted the bed next to the other man you here i was still frowning but not unhappy i was more puzzled than anything why i want to return the favor the favor lay down he said and patted the bed again let jeanclaude hold your hands i couldnt help frowning harder im not a headboard rider he doesnt need to hold my hands i felt how strong he is strong enough that when he holds your hands down you wont be able to get free i looked at his face i am to be your ropes jeanclaude said richard nodded but kept looking at me and what will you be doing while jeanclaude holds me down whatever i want to do i frowned harder uhunh i need more of a clue than that dont you trust me and just the way he said it the look in his face made me want to say no if wed been alone i dont think id have let him tie me up without a detailed list of planned activities but jeanclaude i trusted to referee this new more reasonable more seductive richard i wasnt sure of yet anyone whos said trust me or dont you trust me to me couldnt be trusted so you dont trust me he said and the smile faded at the corners i didnt say that what did you say ma petite jeanclaude asked yes richard frowned at me jeanclaude made a small line in his forehead for him a frown when he was trying not to show anything yes i said jeanclaude smiled it took richard a moment longer to get it yes he said i nodded yes he said again i nodded again he smiled and the smile was that wonderful smile the one that made him look younger more relaxed more himself somehow i felt a smile spread across my face a smile that i couldnt stop and didnt want to yes he said still smiling yes i said at last jeanclaude said and he was smiling too jeanclaudes hands on mine his body spilled out along the head of the bed the pillows had all been thrown to the floor so there was nothing but the silk sheets and the three of us trade places richard had said it had seemed so simple i should have known nothing about richard was ever simple he put his hands on my arms just under where jeanclaude held me he wrapped those big hands around my arms then began to slide his hands down my arms he was only touching my arms such an innocent place to touch but he made the movement slow and sensuous trailing an edge of fingernail like the tiny press of something harder and so much more dangerous against my skin his hands reached under my arm the trail of nails tickled and made me writhe and giggle half because it tickled and half because of the slow sure movements of his hands id forgotten what it was like to have all of richards attention in a bed when you think youll never be able to touch someone again you try to forget i waited for him to curve his hands over my breasts but he didnt he moved his hands just a little lower on my sides so that his hands barely brushed the edges of my breasts and kept moving down my body that one small brush against the edges of my breasts caught my breath in my throat and closed my eyes to shudder under his hands his hands so large they cupped my ribs and nearly met at my waist his thumbs pressing over my belly button my lower stomach i waited for his hands to go lower and just as he had above he moved his hands to the sides of my hips swept that sure heavy glide of skin and nails away from even the beginning of my pubic bone so that he was only touching my hips my thighs but nothing more his hands kept sliding downward but hed skipped the parts i most wanted him to touch it left me making small noises low in my throat not from what he was doing but from what he hadnt done from what i wanted him to do it made me raise my arms or try to but jeanclaudes hands were there he kept my hands pressed to the bed i put more effort into it and found that i could raise my hands off the bed an inch or so but jeanclaude pressed me back to the bed going up on his knees to get the leverage he needed id made him change positions made him work a little harder but that was all i put more effort into raising my wrists freeing my arms i dont know why maybe because i hadnt really thought about not being able to get away being trapped in theory is one thing knowing it for a fact is different or different for me why struggle richard asked in a voice that held a tone id never heard from him you know that jeanclaude wont let anything bad happen his big hands finished their glide down my body to end with his fingers wrapping around my ankles he didnt press them to the bed just held them held my ankles in his hands i tried to get away from him i couldnt help it it was just one of those things tell me i cant or show me i cant and i have to try i wasnt trying as hard as i could but i was trying trying enough to feel the strength in his hands a strength that could bend steel i couldnt get away he spread my legs using his hands on my ankles he spread my legs wide and wider while i tried to stop him it was a game because wed all agreed to this i wanted him to make love to me but game or not there was something about the way he spread my legs with the strength in his hands while jeanclaude pinned my arms that sped my pulse and made the struggles go from halfhearted to not so halfhearted it was stupid but i couldnt help myself i had to try to stop him from spreading my legs from exposing me and the fact that i couldnt both scared me and excited me the two feelings should have been mutually exclusive but they werent tell me to stop richard said and his voice had grown deeper i shook my head no then why are you struggling he asked and there was a look in his face eager dark happy all at once he pushed my legs farther apart until it was just this side of hurting until the muscles in my thighs began to ache with the stretch why are you struggling if you dont want me to stop i said the only thing i could think of i dont know my voice was breathier than i thought it would be as if my pulse was interfering i realized then that hed spread my legs so far apart that i really couldnt struggle not unless i wanted it to hurt it made me push harder against jeanclaudes hands i raised up a few inches so that he actually had to come to his knees and press down to hold me secure him coming to his knees meant that suddenly his body was exposed just above my head he hung loose and soft just above me and until he fed he would stay soft i loved the sensation of him in my mouth when he was like this because it didnt last except when he had not fed now i could explore the softness of him as long as i wanted and it wouldnt change i strained back for him neck bowing mouth reaching and he was out of reach dangling just above me but his hands held me down and i couldnt get to him jeanclaude had to know what i was trying to do but he kept his weight on my wrists and his body arched above me out of reach my voice came out strained breathless please please what richards voice from the other end of the bed ma petitehas a penchant for men when they are soft until i feed she could indulge this desire and youre keeping it just out of her reach richard said his voice dropped an octave lower so that it was almost painfully low his voice just before it began to growl oui why he asked is that not the game that you wish to play a thin line of growl trickled from richards throat yes yes it is he was up on all fours too but unlike jeanclaude he was thick and heavy against the front of his body but i dont want it to be you shes begging for i want it to be me why can it not be both of us jeanclaude asked the two men stared at each other and i had a moment to feel their not power but almost as if their wills were suddenly power i could feel the strength of their wills aimed at each other you chose not to let me feed jeanclaude said deliberately you thought she would not have a use for me until i could be erect he smiled you underestimatema petite s love of the male body she loves us in all our many forms that last held some note some jab that i didnt understand i should have but the feel of their hands on my body and the view of both of them nude had me distracted i never seemed to think as clearly around them when they were naked embarrassing but true richards face darkened with anger and the first trickle of his power slipped past his so tight shielding it danced along my legs like a breeze off the plains of hell hot so hot it raised goosebumps in a shivering line down my body me shivering brought their attention back to me jeanclaudes face was pleasantly neutral hiding richard looked down at me and the anger was still there but underneath that was something else it held sex but it also held something darker something that promised things beyond sex beyond anything safe and sane a moment to glimpse in his eyes things he probably didnt want to see in any mirror before he turned away so i couldnt see his face as if he knew what id seen if youre going to fight get off of me i said it was a little tough to put much authority in my voice when i was naked and they were holding me down but i managed my voice was suddenly mine again not breathy not sexy just mine that is not up to me ma petite jeanclaude said are we going to fight richard that hot hot wind eased out from his body again a line of heat to trail like something solid and reaching across my skin it was like fingers fingers made of heat climbing up my skin touching places richard had very deliberately avoided when that seeking heat caressed between my legs i gasped and managed to say stop it whatever it is stop it the heat climbed higher using my body like a fleshy ladder does it hurt richard asked but he was looking at jeanclaude not me no and the power caressed my breasts as if some great monster had breathed their breath hot across them i shuddered under that touch eyes closing neck bowing i opened my eyes staring up into jeanclaudes face his face was still pleasant unreadable hidden are you well ma petite i nodded i might have said something else but richards power caressed my throat flowed over my lips so that my mouth felt hot as if some hot thick liquid lay on my tongue i looked up into jeanclaudes midnight blue eyes and whispered richard jeanclaude lowered his face over mine more of his weight pressing in his hands against my wrists so even as he came closer i was held more tightly i opened my mouth for him but he paused just short of a kiss he licked the air above my mouth i thought at first hed missed but he raised up enough to look down my body to richard what game is this you and she arent the only ones who gained power when she bound herself to damian and nathaniel his voice wasnt happy when he said it in fact the anger was back the anger fed directly into his power so that a line of scalding heat flashed up my body and tore a scream from my throat jeanclaude put his mouth to mine and his power was in his kiss a blessed coolness to glide over my tongue down my throat to spill in a chilling line through my body and quiet all that heat and as if richards power had been waiting for that very thing it surged forward and i was suddenly covered in their power it was as if my body was the wick for richards candle and the spout for jeanclaudes cool water to flow down but you cant be both flame and water you cant burn and drown not at the same time my body tried it tried to be cold and hot flame and water life and death but wait that last that last we understood my power and me life and death especially death my power didnt simply rise it burst my shields like a dam smashed and the power of that torrent so long contained poured over us all it swept us not away but together we were on our knees on the bed with richard pressed to the front of me and jeanclaude against my back they say there is no light without dark no good without evil no male without female no right without wrong that nothing can exist if its direct opposite does not also exist i dont know if thats true but in that moment i understood that though each opposite needs the other they also cant exist simultaneously they are two sides to a coin but what of the coin what is the coin that separates good from evil light from dark what is it that binds them together yet keeps them eternally apart good and evil light and dark i dont know but with richard and jeanclaude it was me i was the metal that both separated them and bound them together i was their coin and they were my different sides always apart always together different but all of one piece richard pressed to the front of my body and it was as if he burned as if his body was so hot it should have burst into flames as if the sun itself lay within his skin jeanclaude pressed at my back like water cool cold water that had risen from the very depths of the sea where it runs cold and black and slow and strange things glide there if you look at the sun too long you go blind if you swim too deep into the sea you drown i screamed screamed because i didnt know what to do with the power i was their coin but i didnt know how to forge us into one piece it was like trying to fit three people into one body how do you start who gets shoved in where but i wasnt master here it wasnt my job to find a way to fit three such huge pieces into one jeanclaudes cool power flowed over me soothed the burning touched the edge of richards power and brought us all back up to the surface of our metaphysical sea he said almost exactly what i was thinking i can only hold it back for a moment when next we drown we must not fight it we must embrace it and each other define embrace richard said and his voice was thick with effort as if he were holding back his side of some huge weight and maybe he was you into anitas body and i will feed upon yours we didnt have time to say yes or no or anything the power was just suddenly back as if wed opened a door and found the building falling down around us we were out of time we either rode the power or it would bury us bury us along with everyone we loved everyone wed vowed to protect distantly i had the thought if we would but take the fourth mark it would be easier to ride but the thought vanished under the press of richards body his body was ripe and thick and ready and hed made certain that jeanclaudes wouldnt be there might have been other ways to bind us but richard had taken some of jeanclaudes choices and mine by simply not allowing the other man to feed funny how you try to avoid one evil and fall headlong into another richard pushed himself inside me i was tight and he was thick but the moment he began to push inside me the terrible weight of power eased it was as if richards body broke the plane of some barrier as if my body were a door and wed pushed inside richards voice came strained tight so tight i dont want to hurt you he was above me in a sort of pushup and the view between our bodies was perfect perfect for watching him push his way inside me i grabbed his arms and said dont stop god dont stop youre too tight not for long i said is she wet jeanclaude asked richard gave him a look and it wasnt friendly yes then you will not hurt her you said it yourself jeanclaude you arent this wellendowed you dont know how you can hurt a woman without meaning to i slapped richards shoulder because i couldnt reach his face he looked down at me anger so ready in his eyes i am not clair i want you richard i want you inside me please richard please dont stop please dont stop he looked down at me and the look on his face was very male and very richard all at the same time i watched him felt how much he wanted to shove himself inside me but that part of him that was still richard still thinking so hard was afraid not afraid that hed hurt me but afraid to see the same look on my face hed seen on clairs i tasted the fear of that on my own tongue felt the pulse in my neck speed not with lust but fear fear that clair was right that he was an animal if i could have slapped her around in that moment i might have the last thing richard needed was more emotional shit to shovel if you will not do it mon ami then let me feed so that we may finish this i am not your friend richard said and his anger spread like hot oil on my skin it didnt hurt like earlier and i knew that was jeanclaudes doing he was dulling the edge of richards power or rather turning it from burning pain to something more fun heated oil rolling down my skin instead of biting bits of fire how could i argue be my enemy then jeanclaude said but one of us must do this if you will not then you must help me do it i sat up and he wasnt far enough in for it so that he slipped back out that pressure came crashing back jeanclaude grabbed a handful of my hair pulled my head back and kissed me hard deep tongue searching my mouth i melted into that kiss gave my mouth to his my face to his hand my head to the hand still wrapped in my hair his other hand slid from my face down my neck my shoulder to caress the front of my breast he bent me back against his body and i understood as wed discussed his power lay in seduction he was literally building a deeper binding on the foundation of sex each touch each caress each penetration another stone to keep us safe id have argued with his choice of building materials but i wasnt master here this was his ball game not mine of course there was more than one way to play ball jeanclaudes hands slid over the front of my body until he held my breasts he squeezed them between his hands squeezed them hard and sharp i came away from his mouth with a gasp and a sound low in my throat you will not hurt her richard richard hadnt moved back he was still sitting where my body had left him his body between my knees close enough that he could have joined jeanclaude in the foreplay but he just knelt there i stroked my hand over him found him not as hard as he had been i wrapped my hand around him tight and hard brought a small sound from him i want this and i squeezed him again watched his eyes lose focus this inside me i could feel that he wanted to but his fears held him closer than any lovers arms ever would i let go of him and turned with a cry to jeanclaude i felt suddenly halfcrazed with need a need to have someone inside me jeanclaude hadnt fed yet but there was still something i could do for my own pleasure i turned my back on richard and laid a light kiss on jeanclaudes mouth but that wasnt what i wanted he rose up on his knees as if he knew where i was headed i licked my way down his body and his hand on the back of mine guided me to him i drew him into my mouth and the texture of him so small so loose was wonderful i sucked him rolled him with my tongue small i could have my way with him and not have to fight for it i sucked him as hard and fast as i could in and out in and out until he cried out above me i used my hand to lift the loose tenderness of his balls up so i could draw them gently into my mouth it was hard having all of him in my mouth at once even this small there was barely room i had to be so careful of him so careful not to hurt him not to crush such delicate pieces like rolling some precious priceless work of art between your teeth when i didnt trust myself not to bite down on those tender bits i spilled them out of my mouth but i kept that soft flexible givable forgivable bit to roll and coax until he cried out above me and his body thrust forward but he couldnt complete it i could have teased him all night and he couldnt have finished it i was ready to offer to open a vein myself when i felt hands on my hips i felt richard push himself against my body he wasnt soft now he was oh so hard he kept one hand on my hip and used the other to guide himself in he pushed against the opening in my body i started to raise up but jeanclaudes hand pushed on my head kept me where i was kept my mouth wrapped around his body sucking him deep into my mouth as richard pushed his way into my body i was wetter now more open but richard still had to work his way in push and shove for each tight wet inch the feel of him inside me forced small sounds from my throat made me whimper and moan all of it with jeanclaude still in my mouth richard pushed his way in until there was no more until he hit the end of me and had nowhere to go but to draw himself back out of me slowly so slowly i didnt want slowly i wanted fast i wanted hard i wanted richard at his best not this careful dance i raised my head up off of jeanclaude and this time he let me but he kept his hand against my hair i raised up enough to gaze back over my body and see richard there on his knees seeing him with his body inside of me rolled my eyes shut for a moment but the feel of all that thick potential being so carefully used made me want to scream at him fuck me richard he looked at me and the control on his face in his body stopped for a moment he looked at me and said anita fuck me i said fuck me god fuck me just fuck me fuck me fuck me fuck me fuck me please please please just fuck me i am i shook my head hard enough to send my hair flying around my face jeanclaude moved his hand enough for me to do it no no no no freed of jeanclaudes hands i could move i shoved myself onto him i shoved myself down hard and fast until the sound of our bodies hitting slapped together having him shoved that hard fast deep inside me made me cry out but not in pain i leaned my upper body forward and angled my hips and i fucked him as hard and as fast as i could it wasnt quite as good as he could have done on his own but it was still good still so good richard caught the rhythm of my hips and started shoving himself inside me as hard and fast as he could harder and faster than id been able to manage on my own so hard so fast so deep hitting that spot deep deep inside my body until i cried out around him jeanclaudes hand pushed me back down and helped my mouth find him again helped me feed on his soft soft flesh while richard pounded himself inside me jeanclaude moved up high on his knees and his hand helped me stay where he wanted me it wasnt until i heard richards voice jeanclaude and felt richards rhythm falter that i suspected what jeanclaude was doing up there behind my back jeanclaude was suddenly not soft or limp he grew in my mouth like ripened fruit like something sweet and tender that had waited a very long time to spread and grow thick and heavy he filled my mouth i drew back to breathe and he forced my head farther down forced himself deeper into my throat i suddenly had both of them as deep inside me as my body could hold richard pounded himself between my legs and jeanclaude thrust himself between my lips they found a rhythm together so that they mirrored each other i fought to open my mouth wide enough to keep teeth out of the way while jeanclaude mouthfucked me id never let anyone do that before not like this not so that what was happening at my mouth was almost exactly what was happening between my legs richard had taken me at my word he pounded into me so fast and so hard until the sound of it was like a continuous thud of flesh on flesh and though it felt wonderful if jeanclaude hadnt been in my mouth i might have begged him to go it was almost too much almost pain jeanclaude was more careful up front because he had to be but he still forced me to hold the same rhythm fast hard thudding swallowing almost continuously barely time to breathe between one thrust and the next one minute i was fighting to breathe fighting not to start begging the next orgasm hit me and i was screaming but it wouldnt stop i screamed my orgasm around jeanclaudes body still shoved deep in my mouth i screamed and my body spasmed around them both i sucked hard and harder i drove my hips into richard a moment before id been ready to stop and now i helped them fuck me i drove my body into them both as hard and fast as i could while my body danced between them the orgasm grew grew until it wasnt enough to just scream and i raked my nails down jeanclaudes thighs i felt their bodies tighten at the same time richard spasmed at my back driving himself so deep inside me that i screamed for real this time but jeanclaude drove himself down at the same moment and my scream was lost to the sensation of him spasming inside my throat he wasnt as long as richard but he was far enough down that it wasnt a matter of swallowing it was simply a matter of not choking it back up of letting that hot thickness go down my throat and not struggling against it i let them have my body in that instant i let their pleasure fill me and pour down me through me it was at that moment when our bodies were joined sharing things as intimate as blood that it clicked into place that wed done enough to bind us without bleeding jeanclaude maybe it was what it needed to work or maybe we just all three had to let down our guard enough to stop fighting we collapsed in a breathless panting heap jeanclaude drew himself out of me gently and lay on his back with me on top of him pinning his legs richard was still on top of me still inside me but now he was almost dead weight and i was short enough and he was tall enough that he was lying partially on jeanclaude i was just pinned between them richard got to his knees just enough to pull himself out of me then collapsed onto his side halfspooning me but not quite touching jeanclaude in a voice that was still breathless he asked did i hurt you i couldnt help it i laughed i laughed even though my jaw was beginning to ache as the endorphins faded i laughed as i began to feel the ache of him between my legs i laughed not because it hurt but because it felt so good jeanclaude started to laugh too what richard said jeanclaude and i lay on top of each other too tired to move and laughed it took richard a few minutes but finally a deep chuckle escaped him he moved his body enough to throw an arm across mine and laughed the three of us lay unable or unwilling to move and we laughed we laughed until we could move then we moved up on the bed and lay quiet in a big warm naked puppy pile me in the middle but when jeanclaudes head touched richards arm neither of them moved away it wasnt perfect but damn it was close id tried to call my friendly neighborhood vampire hunter in new orleans to see what i could learn about the vamps we were after but denisluc st john vamp hunter and federal marshal was in the hospital still in intensive care theyd damn near killed him before they left town worse and worse the sun was a bloody strip of red against the western sky when zerbrowski and i got out of his car to question the first witness i always felt like i should have to wash my jeans when i got out of his car the backseat was so full of paper and old fast food bags that it looked like a landfill the front seat wasnt actually dirty but the rest of the car was so messy that it just felt like the entire car was icky do katie and the kids ever ride in this thing i asked as we started up the steps to the first apartment on the list naw she and the kids take the minivan i shook my head has she seen the inside of it recently youve seen our house its perfect everything in its place even our bedroom is immaculate the car is the one place thats mine it gets to be as messy as i want it to be strangely it made more sense to me now than it would have a few months ago i understood the fine art of compromise between a couple in a way that i never had before im not saying i was good at it just that i understood it more zerbrowski read off the number of the apartment and it was on the second floor in a line of concrete walkway and metal railing the doors were all identical i wondered if the neighbors knew that they had a vamp living next door youd be amazed at the number of people that dont figure it out vampires hit my radar hard so they dont pass unnoticed for me more humans than im comfortable with get fooled i dont know if its because they want to be fooled or if it really is harder for them to spot a vamp i dont know which would bother me more that normal humans cant spot them thus implying that i am even more outside the norm or that people want to be fooled that badly since we were looking for vampires that had killed at least two people i stretched out that part of me that sensed the dead it wasnt the same part that raised zombies though explaining the difference was like explaining the difference between sky blue and turquoise they were both blue but they werent the same color zerbrowski reached for the doorbell and i touched his hand not yet why not he asked his hand swept back his wrinkled trench coat and suit jacket to touch the butt of his gun on his hip you hear something ease down its okay hes just not awake yet zerbrowski looked puzzled at me what does that mean i can feel vampires zerbrowski if i concentrate or theyre doing something powerful hes not awake yet i was hoping he would be hes supposed to be the oldest one of the three longest dead longest dead usually wakes up first unless one of them is a master masters wake up first i knew the part about longest dead he said so a master vampire that is two years dead can wake up before a vampire that is five years dead but not a master yeah though some vamps dont accumulate enough power in five hundred years to rival masters ive met that were under five years thatd be a bummer a flunkie for all eternity i nodded yeah i felt that instant spark inside the room it hit me almost like a punch to the stomach or lower once i could only sense vamps that i had a connection to to this degree and once it was just a small quiver of recognition apparently id gone up a power level or two you okay zerbrowski asked yeah just yeah now you can use the doorbell he gave me a look i was concentrating too hard when he woke up okay my bad i dont know if he really understood the comment or was just used to me being weird but whatever he pushed the button we heard the strident sound inside the room beyond so many people think that being a vampire automatically gets you the big house on the hill or a coffin in a dungeon somewhere but most of the vamps i knew had apartments houses and lived pretty much like everyone else vampires living in a central location surrounding their master the way jeanclaude had it was becoming a thing of the past i missed it not nostalgia if i had to kill a bunch of vamps having them spread miles apart made my job harder but we werent here to kill anybody not yet of course that could change all we needed was proof or depending on the judge strong suspicion once id been okay with that now it bothered me to my knowledge id never killed vamps that hadnt done the crime but i had to admit that at the beginning of my career i hadnt checked as carefully as i did now they were just walking corpses to me once and making them lie down and be still hadnt felt like murder to me my job had been easier then fewer conflicts nothing helps you sleep at night so much as being absolutely certain that youre right and everyone else is evil the door opened and the vampire stood blinking at us his blond hair was tousled from sleep and hed thrown jeans over his boxers or maybe slept in both they were wrinkled enough he squinted at us and it took me a second to realize the squint was permanent like someone whod worked outdoors all their life and not worn sunglasses his eyes were pale and washed almost colorless he looked tanned but he was five years dead and it couldnt be a tan artificial tan was starting to be big business among the recently dead the ones who hadnt gotten accustomed to that paler than pale look his looked better than most a professional job not homegrown jack benchely zerbrowski made it a question who wants to know he flashed his badge and i flashed mine sergeant zerbrowski of the regional preternatural investigation team federal marshal anita blake jack benchely blinked harder like he was really trying to wake up shit what did i do to get the spook squad and the executioner at my door just after sundown lets go inside and talk about that zerbrowski said with a smile the vampire seemed to think about that for a second you got a warrant we dont want to search your place mr benchely we want to ask you some questions thats all zerbrowski was still smiling the smile didnt even look strained i wasnt trying to smile i didnt feel like it what kind of questions he asked i said the kind about you being across the river at a strip club when i know for a damned fact that malcolm has ordered you all to stay away from shit like that now i was smiling but it was a smile the way a flash of teeth is a smile sometimes its a smile and sometimes its not put your hand close to the dogs mouth and find out benchely didnt look like he wanted to find out he looked awake now awake and almost scared he licked his thin lips and said are you going to tell malcolm that depends on how cooperative you are i said what marshal blake means is if we get enough information from you there wont be a need to trouble the head of the church of eternal life zerbrowski was still smiling and pleasant i guess i was bad cop for the day that worked for me i know what she meant the vampire said he moved to one side of the open door and was careful to keep his hands where we could see them jack benchely human had a record minor stuff a few drunk and disorderlies an assault charge that started out as a domestic disturbance call nothing too serious and all of it involving too many drinks and not enough common sense when we were inside he shut the door and went to the couch from a coffee table that had almost as much crap on it as the backseat of zerbrowskis car he fished out a cigarette and a lighter he lit up without asking if we minded how rude there were no other chairs in the room so we stayed standing again rude though the place was so messy that i wasnt sure id have taken a seat if it had been offered there was so much clutter that you expected it to smell stale but it didnt it did smell like the inside of an ashtray but thats not the same thing as dirty ive been in houses that looked spotless but still reeked of cigarettes being a nonsmoker my nose isnt dulled to it he took in a big drag on the cig and made the tip glow bright he let the smoke trickle out through his nose and the corners of his mouth what do you want to know whyd you leave the sapphire early last night i asked he shrugged it was after eleven i dont call that early okay whyd you leave when you did he looked up at me eyes narrowed as smoke oozed past them it was boring the same girls same acts he shrugged i swear that strippers were more fun when i could drink i bet i said zerbrowski said what time did you leave exactly benchely answered we asked the usual questions what time why with whom was there anyone in the parking lot that could verify that he got in his truck and didnt linger in the parking lot linger benchely said and he laughed laughed hard enough to flash fangs the fangs were as yellowed from nicotine as the rest of his teeth i didnt linger officer i just left i debated on whether i could tell him to put out his cigarette in his own house and if hed do it if i asked if i ordered him and he didnt wed look weak if i grabbed the cig and smushed it out id be a bully i tried to hold my breath and hoped hed finish it soon he took another healthy pull on the cig and spoke with the smoke coming out of his mouth what did i miss one of the other vamps get out of hand with a dancer one of the other upstanding church members trying to frame me for it something like that i said softly he fished an ashtray out of the mess it was an older one pale green ceramic with upturned sides and a tray of cig holders in the middle like dull teeth he stubbed out his cig and didnt try to hide that he was angry or maybe five years dead wasnt enough time to learn to hide that well maybe hell it was charles wasnt it i shrugged zerbrowski smiled we hadnt said yes we hadnt said no noncommittal that was us hes a member of their damn club did he tell you that he didnt volunteer it i said ill bet he didnt damned hypocrites all of them he ran his hands through his hair made the thickness of it stand up even more did he tell you that hes the one that recruited me for the damn church i fought the urge to share a glance with zerbrowski he didnt mention that zerbrowski said id tried to quit drinking i tried just quitting twelve steps you name it i tried it nothing worked id lost two wives more jobs than i could count ive got a son whos nearly twelve theres a court order against me seeing him isnt that a hell of a thing my own son zerbrowski agreed it was a hell of a thing moffat was at the club one night he made it sound so easy i would have to stop drinking because i couldnt drink anymore simple he reached for another cigarette can you wait until were gone for that i asked its the last vice i got he said but he stuffed the cig back in its pack he kept the lighter in his hands playing with it as if even that was a comfort im what my counselor calls an addictive personality do you know what that means officers it means that if you cant drink youve got to be addicted to something i said he smiled and really looked at me for the first time not just like i was a cop come to hassle him but like i was a person yeah yeah my counselor wouldnt like that definition no siree she would not but yeah thats the truth some people are lucky and its just theyre addicted to drinking or smoking or whatever but for those of us who are just addicted to being addicted anythingll do the blood lust i said he laughed again and nodded yeah yeah i cant drink liquor but i can still drink i still like to drink he slapped the lighter down on the table and both zerbrowski and i jumped benchely didnt seem to notice everyone thinks you get to be pretty when youre made over that you get to be suave and good with the ladies just because you got a pair of fangs you get the gaze with the fangs i said yeah i can trick em with my eyes but legally thats not a willing feed he looked at zerbrowski as if he represented all the laws that had held him down all his life if i use vampire tricks and she comes out of it yelling force im dead he looked at me and it wasnt exactly an unfriendly look its considered sexual assault as if i slipped her a date rape drug but im a vampire and i wont see trial theyll give me to you and youll kill me i wasnt sure what to say to that it was true though theyd amended the law so that you had to have more than one count of gazeinduced blood taking to execute someone thats what they called it gazeinduced blood taking the far right was crying that it was letting sexual predators loose on our communities the far left just didnt want to agree with the far right so theyd help push for the change in the laws those of us in the middle just didnt like the idea of a death warrant being issued on the sayso of one date who woke up the next morning with a bad case of buyers remorse i dont have the money to throw around that the church deacons do benchely was saying ive got to get a woman to donate her blood throughcharm he said the last word like it was curse i know drink ruined my life but i am a hell of a lot more charming when ive had just a few drinks thats not usually true i said he looked at me what isnt true a lot of drunks think theyre charming drunk but they arent trust me ive been the only teetotaler at a lot of parties there is nothing charming about a drunk except maybe to another drunk he was shaking his head maybe but all i know is that im reduced to feeding off the church the church makes taking blood as tame as it can something that should be better than sex and they make you feel like youre at one of those places where you only get your food after youve listened to the sermon it makes the food taste bad he picked up his lighter again turning it over and over in his hands until the gold of it swirled in the dim light shining nothing tastes good when you have to swallow your pride with it are you saying that moffat a deacon of the church misrepresented what life would be like after you became a vampire i tried for as casual a question as i could make it misrepresented not exactly more like he let me come in believing all the stuff in the books and movies and when i talked about it like it would be that way he didnt tell me different but it is different real different if you were belle mortes line you spent eternity with people lining up to donate if you were from some of the bloodlines that gave power but not beauty or sex appeal then in a country where using vampire tricks was illegal you were screwed the only vamp i knew well that was descended from a line like that was willie mccoy i had never wondered what willie with his ugly suits and uglier ties and slicked back hair did for food maybe i should have the church of eternal life didnt promise much more than most churches promised but you could join the lutherans and if you didnt like it you could quit joining the church of eternal life as a full member meant never being able to do anything about regrets you might have zerbrowski got us back on track you didnt see anyone in the parking lot who could confirm when you left the sapphire he shook his head did you smell anything those washed out eyes flicked up to me he frowned what you didnt see anything or anyone but sight isnt the only sensory input youve got he frowned harder i bent down so i could meet him eyetoeye i would have knelt but i didnt want to touch the carpet with anything but my shoes youre a vampire benchely a bloodsucker a predator if you were human id just say what did you see or hear but youre not human if you didnt see or hear anything what did you smell what did you sense he was looking positively perplexed what do you mean i shook my head what did they do make you a vampire then not teach you anything about what you are were the eternal children of god he said bullshit bullfuckingshit you dont know what you are or what you could be i wanted to grab him by the shoulders and shake him he was five years dead i didnt think he was involved but hed walked through that parking lot damn close to the time of the killing if he hadnt been such a pitiful excuse for the undead he might have been able to help us catch the bad guys i dont understand he said and i believed him i shook my head i need air i went for the door leaving zerbrowski to mutter thanks for your help mr benchely and if you think of anything call us i was on the cement walkway breathing in all the night air i could when zerbrowski came to find me what the hell was that he asked you just decide we stop questioning a suspect he didnt do it zerbrowski hes too damn pitiful to have done it anita listen to yourself that doesnt even make sense you know as well i do that murderers can make you feel sorry for them some of them specialize in pity i dont mean i felt pity for him i mean hes too damn pitiful a vampire to have pulled it off zerbrowski frowned at me youve lost me i wasnt sure how to explain it but i tried its bad enough that they let him believe that becoming a vampire would fix everything that was wrong with his miserable life but then they killed him they took his mortal life but theyve done everything they can to cripple him as a vampire cripple him how any vampire that i know would have noticed things zerbrowski theyre like this hyperfocus predator predators notice things benchely may have fangs but he still thinks like hes a sheep not a wolf would you really want every member of the church to be a good predator i leaned my back against the railing its not that its that they took his life and didnt give him another one hes not better off than he was before hes not getting arrested for drunk and disorderlies anymore and how long will it be before he cant take it anymore and he uses his gaze on somebody drinks their blood and blows it they wake up and decide they were abused hes not a good enough vampire for them not to wake up and regret it what do you mean hes not a good enough vampire anita youre not making sense i dont know if itll make sense to you zerbrowski but ive seen the real deal theyre terrible or can be but theyre like watching a tiger at the zoo theyre dangerous but they have a beauty to them even the ones that arent from a bloodline that makes them prettier after death even those have a sort of power to them a certain mystique or an aura of confidence or something they have something that every member of the church that weve talked to since last night lacks i say again would we want them to be powerful and mysterious wouldnt that be bad for stopping crime and keeping the peace yes but zerbrowski the church talked these people into letting themselves be killed killed for what ive tried to talk people out of joining the church for years but ive not really talked to many of the members once i cant save them he was looking at me funny i guess i couldnt blame him you still think that vamps are dead youre dating one and you still think theyre dead jeanclaude hasnt made a new vampire since he became master of the city zerbrowski why not i mean its considered legal now not murder i think he agrees with me zerbrowski he frowned harder at me took off his glasses rubbed the bridge of his nose put them back on and shook his head i am just a simple cop and you are making my head hurt simple my ass katie told me you double majored in law enforcement and philosophy what kind of cop has a degree in philosophy he looked at me kind of sideways if you tell anyone else ill deny it say sleeping with the undead has made you hallucinate trust me zerbrowski if i hallucinated it wouldnt be about you that is a low blow blake i wasnt even picking on you his cell phone rang he flipped it open still smiling about my low blow zerbrow he never even got to finish his name before his smile vanished say again arnet slower shit were on our way holy items out theyll glow if the vamp is close he started to run as he flipped the phone closed i ran with him what happened i asked we clattered onto the stairs before he answered woman dead at the scene vamp missing apartment appears empty appears i said vampires are tricky bastards he said i would have argued if i could have but since i couldnt i saved my breath for running and beat zerbrowski to his car if we hadnt both been afraid of what wed find when we got to the scene i would have teased him about it the apartment was so much nicer than the one wed just come from it was clean and neat enough to have pleased even my stepmother judith well except for the dead woman on the carpet and the blood trail leading back to the bedroom other than that the apartment looked freshly scrubbed i know by now that murder happens in the best of neighborhoods i know for a fact that economics or neatness or niceness are not barriers to violence i know that because ive seen dead bodies in some of the nicest houses everyone wants to believe that violence only happens in horrible places where even the rats fear to go but it isnt true i didnt think i had any illusions left about murder and murderers but i was wrong because the first thing i thought when i saw that neatasapin welldecorated apartment with the dead woman on the carpet was the body would have fit in jack benchelys apartment better hell you could have hidden her body in the coffee table debris the body lay so close to the door that theyd had to move her arm just to open the door enough to let arnet and abrahams inside abrahams had transferred over from sex crimes i glanced at him across the room standing near the neat sparkly kitchen he was tall and thin with dark hair and an olive complexion brown seemed to be his favorite color because id never seen him when he wasnt wearing it he was talking to zerbrowski who was taking notes so far i hadnt learned enough to need to take notes maybe it was because the body was right at our feet arnets and mine dead bodies can be a real conversation stopper the body was on its stomach legs slightly spread one hand reaching out toward the door the other arm folded back where arnet had moved it when she opened the door arnet was standing beside me looking down at the body she looked a little pale around the edges maybe it was only the lack of makeup but i didnt think so she was actually wearing a little eye makeup and pale lipstick but her eyes were a little big and her skin pale against her short dark hair not like pale with contrast but pale like i was ready to grab her elbow in case she started to faint on the body i wanted to ask her if she was alright but you dont ask cops that so i tried to get her talking how did you know she was in here i asked she jumped and turned startled eyes to me she was seriously spooked why dont we step outside and get some air i said she shook her head and i knew stubborn when i saw it so i didnt argue i saw blood under the door or what i was almost certain was blood then what i called for backup and we kicked the door open you and abrahams i said she nodded the door bounced into her arm but we didnt know it was her until we shoved the door again i took low and i was kneeling on the ground so i saw her first saw that we were trying to shove the door through her her voice shook a little at the end lets move over there by the kitchen okay im alright she said and was angry suddenly why is it that you think youre the only woman that can handle this kind of shit i lifted eyebrows but didnt say anything for a count of five i wasnt mad i just wasnt sure what to say i finally tried the truth im not the one thats pale and looks ready to faint im not going to faint she hissed at me angry whispers always sound so evil fine then well stay right here fine she said still angry i shrugged strangely not angry fine you checked the woman found she was dead and then you know i dont have to report to you youre not my boss that was it look arnet if youve got a personal beef with me fine have a personal beef with me but not on her time i pointed down to the body what do you mean her time shes dead she doesnt have any more time bullshit were on her dime right now this is her murder and catching the son of a bitch that did this to her is more important than anything else right now you stonewalling me and acting like some damn rookie is just giving him more time to run we dont want him to run we want him to be caught right she nodded i am not acting like a rookie i sighed i apologize for that and if you want to fight we can fight but later when were not wasting valuable time when were not wasting her time arnet looked down at the body again mostly because i pointed again maybe it was overly dramatic but i already spent time fighting with dolph at crime scenes i didnt need another prima donna on my hands murder first personal stuff later that had to be the order of things or you lost your way zerbrowski was behind her i noticed him walking up but i dont think arnet did go outside arnet get some air he said smiling trying to take some of the sting out of it im a detective on this team she isnt she pointed at me with her thumb outside now zerbrowski said and his voice had lost all of its hailfellowwellmet cheer arnet stood there glaring at him if i have to tell you to go outside again arnet it wont just be for air whats that mean she asked and her hands were starting to tremble she was so angry she was shaking what the hell had i done to make her this pissed about me was it about nathaniel hell shed never dated him shed never met him before he was already living with me do you want to be off this case zerbrowski asked voice low and suddenly not at all like zerbrowskis voice no she said and she looked sullen but surprised as if she hadnt known that he had a voice like that in him me neither he looked at her it was a look to match that new voice then what should you be doing she opened her mouth then closed it until her lips were a thin pink line she turned on her sensible twoinch heels and marched out zerbrowski sighed loudly and frowned at me what did you do to arnet me nothing he gave me a look i swear i didnt do a damn thing to her katie says arnet was pretty pissed at something you said at the wedding how does katie know she was pissed his look got really narrow you did say something didnt you i opened my mouth closed it and glanced down at the body were wasting time with all this personal shit i said okay i also hadnt wanted to discuss my boyfriend situation with zerbrowski but we really did have a murderer to catch true but when this slows down you fix this between you and arnet me why me because youre not wicked pissed at her he said and his face was as matteroffact as his words i wanted to argue with the logic but as far as it went it made sense ill do what i can what did abrahams tell you arnet saw the blood under the door they called backup and entered searched the place and didnt find one avery seabrook the bed was unmade and the blood trail seems to start in the bed not in the bedroom but the bed i said he nodded do we have an ident on her funny he didnt ask who her referred to purse is beside the bed with her neatly folded clothes sally cook age twentyfour and i never believe the weight on a womans drivers license yeah women fudge the weight but men will add an inch to their height he grinned at me most of us just arent smart enough to remember how tall we are i smiled at him and resisted the urge to punch him on the shoulder he can have that effect on me even at murder scenes i noticed you were doing fingertip pushups looking at the body you messed up our blood pattern i wasnt doing pushups and i touched as little as i could but i know why she bled out at least partly why talk he said he was starting to sound like dolph not a bad a thing just a little unnerving shes got a partial bite mark on her very inner thigh looks like it punctured her femoral why did you say partial bite mark either he bit her or he didnt i shrugged he bit her but it looks almost like he started then either she jerked away or he wasnt able to finish for lack of a better analogy its like being bitten by a snake if its not poisonous youre better off not jerking away vampire fangs are recurved not as much as most snake teeth but still if you pull away abruptly youre going to tear yourself up worse than if you just let it chew on you and try to pry it off sort of gently its instinct to pull away from something thats biting you anita im not arguing that zerbrowski im only saying that its not a good idea you will tear yourself up so he bit her and she pulled away and that tore her femoral open are you saying he didnt mean to kill her i shrugged im saying that you can bleed out from your femoral in about twenty minutes maybe less most people dont understand that anita dont do this to me do what i asked i saved the best for last shes got a little case in there with what sure as hell looks like a stripper outfit to me all fringes and not much else if shes a stripper then weve got one of our vampires but youre standing here telling me that he didnt mean to kill her if thats true then he isnt one of our guys im in the process of getting you a warrant of execution for his ass id hate to have you killing the wrong guy i shook my head he was responsible for her death zerbrowski the way the law is written hes dead either way if hes part of our serial killer team hes dead if he accidentally nicked her femoral and either didnt know enough to call or panicked or maybe dawn caught him before he could finish it doesnt matter which it was by accident or by design the law says its murder when a vampire kills a human being using its bite there is no charge of manslaughter if youre a vampire zerbrowski looked at me and his eyes were very serious behind his wire rimmed glasses you think it was an accident dont you i shrugged again if he meant to rip her femoral open i think the bite would be different more vicious ive seen a lot of vamp kills zerbrowski a lot this looks like a new vamp a really new one that doesnt know how to use its fangs yet someone whos two years dead shouldnt make mistakes like this so he did it on purpose i sighed im beginning to wonder what kind of education the little vampires at the church of eternal life are getting what do you mean i mean that i thought their mentoring system was like most of the wereanimals that i know you teach the rookies how to hunt how to kill clean and efficiently you confessing to something for your furry friends he asked and he wasnt smiling enough for the comment not for my peace of mind animals zerbrowski animals jeanclaude hasnt brought over any new vamps since ive been hanging with him but ive seen other vamps that were around two years dead and they arent rookies they arent experts but this is a rookie mistake remember when jack benchely said that theyll give the vamps victims but they make it clean and neat and not fun yeah what if feeding on the femoral the inner thigh is considered too taboo too sexual for the church to teach its members what do you mean you know the theory that if we dont tell teenagers about sex that they wont think of it on their own yeah he said and smiled and shook his head speaking as someone who was once a teenage boy and who will one day have a two teenagers on my hands its a nice theory but it doesnt work that way yeah i know that but what if the church is like the rightwingers if you dont talk about it or tell the new little vamps about the dirty stuff they wont do it or think of it on their own feeding from the inner thigh is too much like oral sex for the church he said and there was no teasing in his voice when he said it he was working thinking i nodded exactly but avery our newish vampire did think of it and did try it but didnt know what he was doing yes and because hed had no information he didnt know how dangerous it could be its like the kids who came up pregnant in junior high because they used candy bar wrappers for condoms zerbrowski looked at me youre joking my hand to god i am not making that up the point is that if you dont educate the newly emerging vampire just like the newly emerging teenager you end up with them doing stupid shit dangerous things that get them or others killed or hurt ignorance is not bliss when it comes to basic sex ed or beginning blood donations for vampires ignorance will get you killed in both he looked down at the body she fits the physical profile of the first vic if you ignore the difference in height shes even blond which fits all three vics but this ones not a natural blond zerbrowski frowned at me i dont mean that i mean her roots are showing i didnt really check that closely but it looks like she either shaved everything or had very little body hair to begin with a lot of strippers shave like your new boyfriend he said his voice was mild but his eyes werent i shook my head none of your damn business zerbrowski you guys were getting pretty cozy on the dance floor but then hes living with you now isnt he somebody talks too much hey im a trained detective i detected that youre shacking up with a stripper whos what seven years younger than you as the detective in charge at the scene shouldnt you be solving this murder im thinking teasing you always helps me think glad to hear i inspire you what are you thinking about im thinking that i want to talk to avery seabrook before he gets executed if hes part of the other murders then i want the names of his friends if he did this by accident then i think we need to know that too if youre right and the church isnt teaching basic vampire safety to its members then weve got hundreds of potential accidental deaths walking around out there tonight that aint good legally we cant do anything to force the church to change its teaching methods separation of church and state and all that he nodded i cant and federal marshal blake cant but anita blake sweetie to the master of the city might are you encouraging me to encourage someone else to put undue pressure on an upstanding member of the community would i do that i nodded yep my heads sore he said i give up how the hell do we catch a vampire and hold him for questioning without getting anyone else killed hes only two years dead zerbrowski hes not that big and bad he glanced down at the body tell that to her he had a point if this was an accident then he might just might run to the church for sanctuary or absolution or whatever what if it wasnt an accident then hes off joining up with his killer friends and i have no idea where to start looking for him we know his hunting ground is across the river in the clubs zerbrowski nodded sheriff christopher who you met is putting all his men on alert the staties are helping out trying to keep it low profile youre not going to keep it out of the media much longer he shrugged i know so if extra people are patrolling the clubs then we can check out the other theory the church he said i nodded ill talk to abrahams let him know whats up you go outside and make nice with arnet zerbrowski do it anita i dont have time to babysit any more feuds youve got less than five minutes to fix this id go outside and get started if i were you he had that strange unzerbrowskilike tone to his voice again not hostile but no room to debate it was a voice that expected to be obeyed and strangely i did at least i went outside i had no idea how to fix things with arnet you cant fix something until you know whats broke i couldnt believe she was that pissed about not being able to date nathaniel and if it wasnt that i was clueless yet another interpersonal relationship that i had no clue about was it just me or are people really this confusing a glance out the partially open door didnt show arnet there was a forest of uniformed officers plain clothes and the coroners wagon complete with coroner waiting to take the body away we were still waiting for the crime lab csu it was rare for me to arrive on the scene this soon i peeled off my bloody gloves at the door but no one had set up a trash bag for debris i ended up holding the gloves between two fingertips by a clean edge awkward but i couldnt just drop them the newest detective on the rpit payroll came around the door frame with an open but empty trash bag in his gloved hands his name was smith and id met him once at a crime scene long ago when he was in uniform it had actually been one of the very first times id met nathaniel smith had been comfortable enough around the lycanthropes that id remembered it remembered it enough to tell dolph apparently dolph had remembered it too seeing smith in plain clothes had been a reminder that dolph didnt really think i was evil and might even still value my opinion he smiled at me looks like im just in time he held the bag open so i could drop the gloves in i smiled back the nick of time zerbrowski yelled smith smith moved toward zerbrowski with the bag still in his hands he was the newest detective on the squad and that meant he was their version of a grunt it wasnt as bad as being a uniformed rookie but it was still low man on the totem pole i walked outside without waiting to see what zerbrowski wanted smith for not my problem no my problem was waiting outside i actually expected arnet to be somewhere in the hallway with all the extra personnel but she wasnt i went down the stairs and out the glass doors of the little entryway she had taken zerbrowski literally or maybe she really needed the air the october night was soft warmer than last night but still cool enough to feel like autumn the air tasted like it was time to go somewhere and pick apples arnet was sitting on the curb the halogen light was bright enough that her pantsuit still looked the same shade of brownish burgundy that it had in the apartment i would have looked sickly in the color but it brought out highlights in her short hair that you didnt see when she wore black or navy she had her arms around her knees not exactly clutching them but obviously not happy even from a distance i took a deep breath let it out and kept walking toward her i so didnt want to do this i stopped short of her and said is this seat taken she jumped and glanced back at me she scrubbed at her face trying to hide tears oh great she said just great you catch me crying now you must think i really am a loser she hadnt said i could sit down but she hadnt said i couldnt either i decided to take it and sat down close enough to talk privately without being overheard but not so close that i invaded her personal space more than i could help it sitting down on the curb i was happy that i was wearing jeans jogging shoes and a tshirt they were perfect curbsitting clothes whats wrong arnet i asked nothing okay why are you mad at me she glanced sort of sideways at me why do you care because we have to work together you know almost any other woman would have led into this conversation chatted a little zerbrowski said i had less than five minutes i dont have time to chat why less than five minutes were going on a road trip do you know where avery seabrook is no but i thought of people to ask she looked away from me and shook her head and how did you come up with people to ask not through police work i frowned but she couldnt see it whats that supposed to mean she licked her lips hesitated then said i could work for years as a cop on this kind of crime and i wouldnt have your insight into the monsters she looked at me sideways again but this time she held the look do i have to fuck the monsters to be as good at this as you are i gave her wide eyes please tell me that you are not this pissed just because im dating nathaniel and you dont get to i saw you at the club last night there was a time in my life where i would have said guilty pleasures but the time when i would volunteer information was past what club i asked her eyes were suddenly cop eyes maybe a little more hostile than they needed to be but cold and looking at me as if she could see into my head it was part lie and part truth she didnt know as much as that look seemed to say but she probably knew more than i wanted her to dont play games anita oh goody we were going to have a fight on a firstname basis im not very good at games jessica so i dont play them much her hands gripped her knees tighter i think to keep from gripping me fine guilty pleasures i saw you at guilty pleasures last night my face showed nothing because shed given me plenty of time to brace for it i just blinked at her and had a slight smile on my face pleasant empty on the outside inside i was thinking hard how much had she seen at the club how much did she remember had she been there for primos part of the show i almost said i didnt see you but stopped myself i wasnt going to help her fill in any blanks so you saw me at guilty pleasures im dating the owner she looked away then off toward the parked cars and beyond that a news van the uniform that was still putting up yellow crime scene tape to help block off the parking area paused and looked at the van would someone warn zerbrowski arnet turned and yelled marconi go tell zerbrowski weve got a news van marconi said shiiit with real feeling to it and went for the entryway great it was like all i had to do was think and someone else did it for me cool i would try to use this power only for good she looked back at me how can you be dating him and nathaniel at the same time just lucky i guess if looks could have hurt me that one would have thats not an answer thats an evasion i sighed look jessica i dont owe you an answer to that particular question who i date and why or how is none of your business her hazel eyes got dark almost solid brown i realized it was her eyes version of going black with rage i thought id go down and see nathaniel without you there i thought maybe if you werent there to interfere she looked away then stared out at the parked cars and the gawkers being kept back by the uniforms stared at them as if she were really seeing them which i doubted it was just somewhere for her eyes to go while she talked but you were there oh my god were you there her voice broke not with tears but with emotion i didnt understand this depth of emotion from her youre acting like i stole nathaniel from you you never dated him hell when you met him he was already living with me she looked at me then and it was unnerving to see the anger because i didnt understand it but i didnt know that you let me believe that he was just your friend he let me believe it nathaniel likes to be nice to people is that what you call it look arnet sometimes nathaniel flirts without really meaning to i think its like an occupational hazard you mean because hes a stripper i nodded yeah i didnt know what he did for a living until the wedding reception i should have known he was some kind of hustler that pissed me off he isnt a hustler the hell hes not ive got a friend in juvie he was picked up for prostitution twice before he hit fifteen male prostitution she said the last like it made it all somehow worse i hadnt actually known hed been picked up for it but i didnt give her that i know what nathaniel was doing before he got off the streets which was sort of true and sort of not true but not completely a lie did you save him did you see him and take him home are you his sugar mama sugar mama you made that up thats not really a word she had the grace to look embarrassed i almost got a smile out of her but she fought it off whatever you want to call it are you is he your i didnt help her if she was going to say it i wanted her to say it my what i asked and my voice was a few octaves lower cold clear it was a voice that if you knew me you might worry when you heard it if arnet was worried it didnt show gigolo she said she threw the word in my face like it was something solid and hurtful as if shed thrown a fist at me i laughed and she didnt like it whats so damned funny i saw you on stage with him blake i saw what you did to him you and that vampire of yours i gave her wide eyes then because i finally thought i had a glimmer of why she was so pissed at me are you under the impression that i whisked nathaniel off the streets as a child and made him my boywhore she looked away then when you say it like that it sounds stupid yeah i said she turned back to me still angry i saw what you did to him last night you chained him up you hurt him you humiliated him in front of all those people it was my turn to look off into the distance because i was trying to think how to explain without explaining too much i was also wondering if i even owed jessica arnet an explanation if we didnt need to work together and i hadnt been afraid shed share what shed seen with the rest of rpit i might not have explained anything but we did work together and i didnt want her version getting around the squad room not that my version was going to be that much better if it got spread around at their core most policemen are closet or not so closet conservatives how do you explain color to the blind how to explain that pain can be pleasure to someone who isnt wired that way you cant not really but i tried anyway it took me a long time to understand what nathaniel wanted from me she looked at me horrified youre going to blame him youre going to blame the victim this was not going to go well have you ever met someone whos been blind from birth she frowned at me what someone whos never seen color ever no she said but what does that have to do with nathaniel youre blind jessica how do i explain to you what blue looks like what are you babbling about she asked how do i explain to you that nathaniel enjoyed being on stage that he sort of forced the situation on me yourethe victim please you werent chained up i shrugged im saying there was no victim on stage last night just a bunch of consenting adults she was shaking her head no i know what i saw you know what you would have felt if it had been you chained on stage and treated like that and youre assuming that because thats how you would feel that thats how everyone would feel not everyone feels the same way about things i know that im not a child then stop acting like one she stood up then and stared down at me her hands in fists at her sides i am not acting like a child youre right youre being way too judgmental to be a child zerbrowski called anita we need to roll i stood up brushed off the back of my jeans and yelled im coming i looked at arnet and tried to think of anything that would make this better nothing came to mind nathaniel is my sweetie jessica i would never hurt him i saw you hurt him she said and she sort of threw the words at me like she had the wordgigolo he doesnt see it that way he doesnt know any better she said i smiled and fought the urge to give one of those laughs that is half nerves and half exasperation you want to save him you want to ride in and save him from a life of degradation she didnt say anything just glared at me anita we need to go now zerbrowski yelled he was standing in the open door of his car i glanced back at arnet i thought nathaniel needed saving once too needed me to fix him what i didnt understand is that he isnt broken well not more broken than the rest of us and that was probably more truth than i owed detective jessica arnet i left it at that and jogged for zerbrowskis car he asked me how it had gone with arnet i told him it could have gone better how better he asked as we eased past the news van and a crowd of gawkers oh like the valentines day massacre could have been a better party he gave me a look jesus anita it isnt enough that you and dolph are pissed at each other youve got pick a fight with arnet i didnt pick a fight with either of them you know i didnt pick one with dolph we were easing past the tape and barriers that the uniforms had moved for us the television crew had the camera pointed straight at us great i resisted the urge to give them the finger or something else equally childish i shouldnt have said that about dolph i know you didnt start that thanks whats eating arnet if she wants you to know shell tell you youre not going to tell your version first no one ever believes my version zerbrowski im fucking coffin bait if youll fuck vampires youll do anything right and just like that i started to cry not loud but tears real tears i turned away and stared out the window i had no idea why i was crying stupid so stupid did i really care what arnet thought of me no did i care if she trashed my reputation to the rest of the squad yeah i guess i did shit zerbrowski was either so astounded that i was crying that he didnt know what to say or he was treating me like hed treat any other cop if they dont want you to see them cry you dont see it zerbrowski drove to the church of eternal life concentrating on the road like a son of a bitch i stared out the window the entire time and cried the parking lot was full and i mean full so full that zerbrowski parked in front of the church in the fire only zone we had marconi and smith in a car behind us along with two marked cars apparently zerbrowski had been planning our strategy while i was trying to fix things with arnet apparently abrahams or arnet had been left in charge of the murder scene i was betting on abrahams i wouldnt have left arnet in charge of a little league team tonight of course i might have been a little prejudiced right that moment he had two uniforms station themselves at the doors and he told them to get their holy items out nobody leaves unless you clear it with me is that clear it was clear i suggested that there was another door at the parish hall entrance and since we had enough manpower to cover it zerbrowski just nodded and said do it it was like he was channeling dolph but it worked everyone just did what he said marconi shook his head and said what id been thinking commanding presence tonight zerbrowski youre just jealous that hes better at channeling dolph than you are i said marconi smiled at me and gave a nod but his hand was at his belt and he was moving his gun a little more forward sometimes the more jokes you do the more nervous you are smith was new enough that his eyes were all sparkly and he was almost vibrating with eagerness like a dog straining at a leash he hadnt been a detective for a month yet and that can make you eager to prove yourself i hoped not too eager since id recommended him zerbrowski noticed and gave me a nod like hed keep an eye on him he asked my advice about only one thing do we go in bold or quiet i thought about it for a second then shrugged they know were here zerbrowski at least the ones near the back they can hear us i nodded but lets ask an usher near the back to get malcolms attention being polite doesnt cost a thing he nodded then went to the big polished wood doors before he could push them open a man opened them from inside he was young with short brown hair and glasses id seen him before on another case his name began with ab like brandon or brian or bruce or something bruce i thought he eased the door shut behind him before we had more than a glimpse of people turning to stare his brown eyes were still lovely behind his glasses and there was still healing bite marks on his neck it was as if no time had passed but it was nice to know that he was still among the living you are interrupting our worship service his voice was soft measured youre bruce right his eyes widened just a little im surprised you remembered me ms blake marshal blake actually i smiled when i said it his eyes did that little widening act again do i say congratulations is he stalling zerbrowski asked not in the way you mean i said he doesnt want us to interrupt the services but i dont think hed deliberately hide a murderer that got me another eye widening murderer what are you talking about ms marshal blake we of the church do not advocate violence in any aspect of our lives theres a dead woman in the home of one of your members who would argue that if she could zerbrowski said a pained expression crossed bruces face are you certain that it is the home of one of our members we both nodded bruce looked down at the ground then nodded as if hed decided something if you will remain near the back of the church i will tell malcolm what has happened zerbrowski looked at me as if to ask if that was okay i shrugged and nodded sure bruce smiled obviously relieved good good please keep your voices low this is a church and we are having services he led the way through those highly polished doors the uniforms stayed outside but marconi and smith followed us in there was no vestibule inside the doors the doors led directly into the nave so we were just suddenly facing pews packed full of congregation members the vamps close to the doors were already glancing our way bruce motioned for us to stay where we were then walked wide around the pews up the side underneath the red and blue abstract stained glass windows where there should have been saints or the stations of the cross or at a least a cross or two there was nothing but the bare white walls i think that was why the church always looked unfinished to me naked like the walls needed clothes its never comfortable for me to be standing in front of a group of people unexpectedly to be on display especially when its a potentially hostile group zerbrowski had his smile in place the goodtomeetyou smile the one that id finally realized was his version of a blank face marconi looked bored a lot of cops perfect that iveseenworse boredom after a few years on the force smiths face was all shiny with excitement like a kid on christmas morning he was looking around at everything and totally not bothered by the staring crowd i guess most cops dont get to see inside the church of eternal life much or see hundreds of vampires in one place at one time hell even i didnt usually see that many at one time in one place the first few pews had had their looksee at us but the glances spread upward from there quick glances with whispers so it was like a wind moved through the room a wind that turned faces toward us widened eyes sent more furious whispers spreading through the room until it crashed against the pulpit and the strangely empty altar area at the front of the church malcolm was standing at the white altar but had already stepped out from behind it and moved to one side so he could meet bruce as the young man came up to one side of the raised area even the steps leading up to it were white the only color was a strip of blue cloth that hung in the back of the sanctuary a brilliant royal blue that moved slightly in the central air as if the cloth didnt sit flat to the wall i wondered what was behind the cloth it was the only thing that was different since id last been inside the building some three years ago about two years ago the building had been firebombed by rightwing extremists the attack hadnt stopped the church the attack had gotten the church of eternal life some of its best national and international coverage ever and donations had flooded in from people that were not so much for vampires as against violence id seen what had been left when the fire department had gotten through with the building standing here now i would never have known there had ever been even a small fire in this white white space let alone a bomb malcolm spoke with bruce at the side of the altar area i wasnt at all surprised when he came down the wide main aisle between the pews bruce trailed after him the first thing you notice about malcolm is that his short blond curls are the bright yellow of goldfinch feathers three hundred plus years in the dark will do that to bright blond hair the next thing is hes tall and almost painfully thin so that he looks even taller than he truly is he was wearing a black suit tonight modest cut but thanks to jeanclaudes fashion sense i knew that that simpleseeming suit was tailored to that lean body and probably cost more than most people make in a month the shirt was a blue that helped point out that his eyes were the blue of a robins eggs his tie was narrow and black with a silver tie bar unadorned up close once you can look past the hair and the eyes malcolm has a very angular face almost a homely face as if the angles needed smoothing out to make them work together the first time id ever set eyes on malcolm id thought him beautiful but with even one vampire mark on me id known differently he prided himself on not using his vampire powers on us mere mortals but he wasted enough to make himself seem handsome that bit of mindfucking he allowed himself vanity all is vanity id also thought him one of the most powerful vampires in st louis once now as he moved toward me he seemed somehow diminished or maybe i was just shielding too well now for his power to creep over me maybe he held out one of his big hands which always seemed like they should belong on a beefier body he held it out sort of in between zerbrowski and me as if he wasnt sure who was in charge and didnt want to offend anyone the last time id seen malcolm he hadnt offered to shake hands hed known i wouldnt take it tonight i took his hand because zerbrowski was only human and whatever i was only human didnt cover it malcolm hesitated in the middle of the handshake as if id surprised him but he recovered smiling his blue eyes glowing with pleasure at the opportunity to help the police it was a lie he didnt want us here he certainly didnt want a murder involving his church i felt nothing as our hands touched except that he was cool so he hadnt fed recently other than that i felt nothing because i was shielding id gotten really good at shielding lately i realized that id been shielding almost as hard as i could since jeanclaude richard and i had bound ourselves together in that bed it wasnt just guilt that had made me afraid so malcolms hand was just a hand cooler than human normal but just a hand good i think we would have been fine if malcolm hadnt tried a little vampire power on me maybe i was shielding too much hiding too much of what i was or maybe he was simply that arrogant whatever he pulsed a little power down his hand into mine i was dizzy for a second and he got an image of the dead girl in the apartment before i pushed back i was still a little fuzzy on the whole psychic thing i tend to overcompensate when i feel attacked yeah i know of course i overcompensated it was so terribly me malcolm stumbled back and only my grip on his hand kept him on his feet his eyes were wide his mouth open in a littleo of surprise if he had just been some powerful vamp that tried to mindfuck me then id have taught him his lesson and wed have gone on about our investigation but he was their master i learned something in those few seconds something i hadnt guessed every human in the church had a mentor and id assumed their vampire mentors were the ones that would bring them over when the time came i knew the mentors took blood from their human trainees but when push came to shove malcolm did those last three bites malcolm had brought over most of those hundreds personally which meant when i shoved my power into him it went through him like some huge sword through him and into the rest it was as if i could suddenly touch them as if my hand shot through malcolms palm through him and into their bodies i felt their pulses some hearts some wrists some necks i felt the pulse of all those vampires felt it sluggish and oh so slow so long so long since some of them had fed as they were meant to feed he didnt let them hunt he didnt even let them go to the clubs and take willing food there i saw an endless stream of church members garbed in white like virgin sacrifices offering their necks only taking a little blood just enough blood never enough to be satisfied just enough not to die i saw the thick viscous punch in the parish hall and i knew that it contained just a little blood from at least three different vamps malcolm made sure of that he didnt want to accidentally blood oath them to someone else but he never used his own blood for fear of what it would mean malcolm jerked away from me but it was too late i didnt need him anymore i looked past him at a girl with long dark hair and glasses it was the first vampire id ever seen with glasses she grabbed her chest and i knew why her heart was beating but i saw other things i saw that once shed been human here and shed knelt and given herself over but it was a thing of chaste hands on her covered shoulders no one had ever held her close gripped her against their bodies fed so powerfully that her body bucked against them and sex was a pale thing compared to it stop it malcolm said stop it let them go i turned slowly to look at him and whatever he saw in my face made him take a step back you gave them to me i said and my voice had a slow honeyed feel to it power such power id learned only last night that vampires could act as a sort of witchs familiar to me id thought it needed to be a vampire that i had some connection with but i was wrong i could feed on them all use them like some kind of giant undead battery zerbrowski came up close to me though even he shivered when he was close enough to whisper anita whats happening he tried to use vampire powers to find out what i knew i said in that same slow luxurious voice it was as if my voice was something you could hold in your mouth and suck like candy jeanclaudes trick and the thought was enough he was suddenly aware of me and what was happening but most of what was happening he needed to know he was the master of the city not malcolm he had tolerated the treaty that the old master had made before her death but now well wed see but that was for another night this night was about murder are you hurt zerbrowski asked he sounded like he didnt think so but knew something was wrong no i said no im not hurt i thought if i can feel some of their emotions if i can look into their faces and see memories what else can i do i thought avery avery where are you i felt an answer like a small play of wind against my face i turned toward that wind and the lefthand side of pews avery avery avery i spoke his name each time a little louder not yelling but with force in it a vampire stood up in the middle of a row he was average height with short brown hair and a face that was handsome in a soft unfinished way as if hed been barely legal when they killed him i held out my hand to him avery come to me come to me avery come to me he started to push his way through the crowd of other people a hand grabbed his wrist a human woman shaking her head saying dont go he jerked away from her and i heard his voice as if hed been standing next to me i have to go shes calling me and he turned eyes to me that were lost in vampire light burning like brown glass in the sun but the look on his face was one id only seen on humans humans that were bespelled by vampires humans that couldnt say no malcolms rich voice filled the room children stop him stop him from answering her call shes is the master of the citys whore she will corrupt our avery i have to say the whore comment pissed me off i turned to malcolm and i let my anger fill my voice illcorrupt them my god youve ruined them all you stole their mortal lives for what malcolm for what i yelled the last and the words held heat like the wind from some great fire all those little vampires that were still held on the lines of my power cried out id hurt them and i hadnt meant to i tried to make it up to them and the problem was that the anger was mine but i wasnt very good at comforting people but jeanclaude was in a way it was that old old problem of his and his line of vampires if the only tool you have is a hammer all your problems begin to look like nails if the only tools you have are seduction and terror and youre trying to be nice well there you go i could taste their pulses on my tongue not just one but hundreds as if id suddenly had a truckload of candy shoved in my mouth candy that was hard and sweet and melted slow across my tongue but it wasnt just cherry or grape or root beer it was like a thousand different flavors filled my mouth so that instead of being delicious it was overwhelming i couldnt pick one flavor one pulse to follow i literally couldnt pick just one because i couldnt sort them out i was choking on too many choices until i could choose one thread to follow i couldnt swallow any of them i collapsed to my knees drowning in a thousand different scents different skins i could smell their skin that wonderful smell at the side of the neck where the skin smells sweetest when youre in love but it was a different scent for each neck aftershave perfume cologne soap sweat it was as if id walked up to each of them and put my face just above their skinclose enough to kissand breathed in the scent of them zerbrowski was beside me his gun out but not pointed at anyone sort of ceilingward anita whats wrong did he hurt you who i thought who washe there were so many hes which one did he mean i tried to swallow past all those pulses in my mouth but i couldnt i couldnt get this bite down it was too much jeanclaudes voice was in my head ma petite you must choose i managed to think cant who did you go there to find he asked who did i go there to find that was a good question who it all went back to who zerbrowski grabbed my arm hard anita i need you here whats happening he needed me i saw smith and marconi both with weapons drawn they needed me because they couldnt feel it i had to function to think to speak or things were going to get out of hand i was a federal marshal tonight i had to remember that i remembered something else something that had been washed away in all that scent avery i needed avery i thought the name and just like that it was his pulse on my tongue his skin smelled like cologne something expensive so that it was powdery and sweet almost like good perfume but underneath that was sweat he hadnt showered tonight the thought made me wonder what else besides sweat he hadnt washed away it was as if i was close to him again as if my face passed down his body just above his skin my breath was warm against his skin and helped blow the scents back from his skin to my nose my mouth i didnt simply smell the scents down his body i tasted them a faint taste as if smell was the more important but smell and taste were aligned differently than ever before more intimately somehow that part wasnt jeanclaudes power but richards and i fought not to think of him not to open the links between us farther than they were already i did not want richard in my head right now jeanclaude let me know without words or if with words it was too quick to register like a kind of telepathic shorthand that he would guard me from richard he would not let me drown in still more sensation but it was thanks to closer ties with richard that i could smell and taste my way down averys body and enjoy it or rather not be disgusted by it wolves like dogs do not think of scent and taste as a human does they like it when we smell like live things avery had had sex and hadnt cleaned up afterward i wasnt disturbed by that more curious because thanks to jeanclaudes marks and my own power i knew avery was as neat and meticulous in his person as he was in his housekeeping zerbrowski squeezed my arm hard enough to bruise anita damn it we cant shoot him the warrant doesnt have our name on it were not executioners anita wake up i blinked at him and saw avery standing just on the other side of him marconi had stepped up and had his gun pressed against averys chest avery wasnt doing anything threatening just standing and trying to walk forward against the press of the gun he was trying to come to me his face wasnt empty like a zombies in fact he was smiling and so very present in his skin but id called him and even a gun barrel against his heart hadnt stopped that order stop i said avery stopped trying to move forward and just stood there waiting he stared down at me with a look that only your best boyfriend should have given you but i didnt mind i wanted to pull his shirt out of his pants and rub his skin along mine it was sexual true but it was also that urge that makes dogs roll in smelly stuff it just smelled so good and i could carry the scent with me and explore it at my leisure i knew in that moment that wolves and dogs collect scents the way people collect rocks or houseplantsjust because they like them and they think theyre pretty some smells just make you happy like a favorite color the fact that sweat and stale sex was pretty to that part of me that was richard was a puzzle for another day now i just tried not to question it too closely and not to do physically what id already done metaphysically im alright zerbrowski but my voice was distant and lazy with power that i couldnt help but when he pulled me to my feet i was able to stand yea for me i took a step forward and said its okay marconi i told him to come to me marconi had a funny look on his face not out loud you didnt i shrugged sorry about that but i wasnt looking at marconi i was looking at avery i was looking at him like youd gaze on a lover but it was all tied up with food and smell and things that were so nonhuman that i was having trouble processing them i wanted to scent mark him he was mine i wanted to wrap his scent on my body and think about those smells and what they meant it was as if scent was like a photograph of a murder scene i could carry it around and look at it over and over again think about it the sense of smell had jumped from somewhere near the bottom of my sensory list to just behind visual and the only thing that kept it lower than sight was that i was too much a primate to trust my nose that much put up your guns zerbrowski said welcome to the wide world of weird vampire shit he didnt sound happy but i didnt look to see what face went with the tone because that would have meant looking away from avery and i didnt want to do that he was a little cleancut for my taste his hair was a soft medium brown cut short the way a father or grandfather would cut it the male hairstyle that has never really gone out of style for fifty years his eyes matched his haira soft brown his eyebrows were darker than his hair and arched in that way that mens eyebrows will perfectly while most women have to pluck for that line above the eye he didnt have enough eyelashes but they seemed thicker than they were because they were dark his face was a soft oval only the dark scattering of beard stubble saving him from looking even younger than he was he was almost six feet but seemed shorter though i wasnt sure why everything about him said that here was someone whod never had anything too bad happen to him it wasnt just his face and coloring that was soft and undramatic it was him he had that flavor in my head of someone whod never really been tested how did you get to be a vampire and not lose that soft edge i got sadness from him but he didnt feel like someone who had just killed a woman on purpose or by accident was i wrong or had he not been the only vampire in that spotless apartment avery stood in front of me with a look that was sad so sad did he know had he done it there was a knock on the church doors the sound startled all of us i think you just didnt knock on the doors of a church you came in or you didnt but you didnt knock a voice called sergeant zerbrowski zerbrowski went to the door and peeked out when he came back through the door he had a piece of paper in his hand it was thicker than it used to be but most of the additions were things that would keep me out of jail and wouldnt do a damn thing for averys health zerbrowski came toward me holding out the paper i opened it up and read it though i already knew what it was it was my warrant of execution the days when any vampire hunter would kill someone without seeing the warrant first were past but id gotten cautious sooner than some id also never been successfully sued one of our fellow hunters was still in prison for doing his job before the paperwork came through everyone who worked with me knew that without this little piece of paper there was no vampire hunt with it i had almost carte blanche i scanned it it was pretty standard i could legally hunt down and execute the vampire or vampires responsible fori read the names of the victims it helped me focus helped me remember why i was doing this kind of workand any other murder victims that might follow i was empowered to use any force necessary to find and stop the murderers of these people i was further empowered to do anything within my abilities to execute this warrant with all due haste the bearer of this warrant is allowed to enter any and all buildings in pursuit of the suspects any person or persons human or otherwise that stand in the way of the lawful execution of my duty forfeit their rights under the constitution of these united states and the state of missouri there was other legalese but what it all boiled down to was that i could have turned back to avery put a gun to his head pulled the trigger and not only would the police not stop me but legally they had to help me carry out my duty the entire idea of warrants of execution was drafted when vampires had first gotten legal rights and you couldnt kill them on sight just for being vampires the warrant had seemed like a step up once now i looked at it and thought huh what if avery hadnt done it what if he was innocent i looked at zerbrowski and he knew me well enough to frown i dont the like that look it always means youre about to complicate my job i smiled at him and nodded sorry but id like to make sure that im serving the warrant on the right vampires malcolm came forward i would like to see that warrant if it concerns my church and my followers i fished it out flung it open but held on to it his eyes flicked down the page and he shook his head and you callus monsters dont take it personally malcolm some of my best friends are monsters i folded the warrant up and tucked it away how can you make jokes when you have come here to kill one of us the congregation stirred and started to stand there were hundreds of them and only a handful of us this could get out of hand and i didnt want that legally if anyone interfered then i could kill them too the last thing i wanted on my hands was a church full of martyrs it was as if malcolm read my mind or i read his because he moved toward the door marconi stopped him with a hand up not quite touching we dont want any trouble zerbrowski said and you dont either malcolm am i supposed to simply let you escort one of my congregation out of here knowing that you could make him kneel in the parking lot and execute him what kind of person would i be to simply stand by and let that happen shit i thought who are you here for avery said and his voice was like the rest of himsoft uncertain was it an act you for starters i said his brown eyes went wide why if you try to take him we will stand in front of the door you will have to climb over our bodies to take him with you i glanced at malcolm and i knew that he didnt mean it he was gambling gambling that we wouldnt be willing to climb over the bodies of church members to execute this warrant here and now gambling that wed go away and get avery some other time usually i like having the warrant fast but tonight it would have worked better to get it later and not in front of the undead billy graham and his flock zerbrowski looked at me youre the vampire hunter anita it has to be your call thanks i said but i had an idea i could still taste avery he hit my radar as innocent could i find out malcolm had tried to pull specific knowledge from me and id turned it back on him id gained knowledge from his vampires id gotten very specific images about how they fed and lived could i concentrate and get something even more specific it felt like i could it felt like if i touched avery i could know anything in his head his body his soul that if i touched him hed be mine mine in a way that until tonight i hadnt wanted suddenly it wasnt such a bad thought i leaned into zerbrowski and whispered i can feel him in my head i think i can find out what he saw last night how i shrugged weird necromancy stuff metaphysics magic whatever you want to call it the warrant does not allow you to use magic on my people i looked at malcolm it was beginning not to be a friendly look i am allowed to use whatever force or abilities i deem necessary so yeah i can do magic if it gets the job done i will not allow you to bespell him has it occurred to you that i dont want to kill him if he didnt do it if i take his heart and his head then we find out hes innocent tomorrow what am i supposed to do say sorry oops i was getting angry again i took a deep breath and counted slowly to five i didnt have the patience for ten i dont want to kill him malcolm that last wasnt angry that last sounded almost like a plea malcolm looked at me and it was a look i hadnt seen before he was trying to decide if i was lying i feel your regret anita you grow tired of the killing just as i did see thats the problem with vampires you let them into your head an inch and they take a metaphysical mile i didnt like that he could read me like that especially not with my shields up of course i wasnt sure how far up my shields were had i dropped them to taste the vampires i thought about my shields and yeah theyd dropped or had been breached under a wave of smells and tastes and blood flowing in sluggish veins i started to raise the shields back up but i had something to do first i looked at malcolm im going to touch avery im going to look inside him and see what i can see i am not going to hurt him not on purpose i want the truth malcolm thats all give me your word that if hes guilty youll let me take him how will i know what you discover from him i smiled and again it wasnt a pleasant smile when i tell you to if i tell you to touch me and youll know what i know he looked at me and i looked at him we had one of those moments of unspoken questions i knew that hed tried to get information about a vampire murder when he shook my hand there were states where that alone would get him put on a short list a list of vampires that were getting dangerous i knew what hed done and i had a warrant that allowed me enough leeway that i could pretend he was trying to hide his own involvement with the killings i mean thered never be a trial i would never have to prove my suspicions in court malcolm took a breath deep enough to make his shoulders rock up and down he nodded once short curt and almost awkwardly as if he wasnt sure it was a good idea but he was going to do it anyway you may touch avery if he wishes you to touch him you may use your marks with jeanclaude to try and find the truth i didnt correct him that it was my own necromancy more than jeanclaudes powers that i was about to use everyone needed a few illusions even master vampires i turned to avery do you agree to what im about to do he frowned and looked puzzled i was beginning to wonder if he wasnt as bright as he looked and wouldnt that be a shame what do you want to do touch you i said his lips curved upward the barest of smiles but it filled his eyes with more laughter than showed on his lips yes he said yes please i held my hands out to him and smiled come to me avery and just like that he took those few steps forward he went to his knees in front of me without being asked he raised his face up to me and there were two things in his face eagerness and a complete and utter trust it wasnt him who wasnt bright it was me id rolled him id rolled him the way a master vampire could roll a mortal in that moment before i touched him i wondered if id drawn a gun and put it to his head would he have flinched or stared at me with those trusting eyes while i pulled the trigger his skin was soft even the beard stubble was softer than it looked so black against this white skin just by touching the beard i knew his hair would be soft that nothing on his body would be harsh or wiry he was soft he smiled up at me and it was beatific as if he saw something wondrous since he was looking at me i knew it wasnt wondrous because it was me i was a lot of things but wondrous wasnt one of them movement made me look up away from averys face there were other vampires out of their seats some were standing in the pews looking confused as if they werent sure why they were standing up a handful of them were already in the main aisle but theyd stopped as if theyd known where they were going but now they werent sure but there were others a dozen or so that were in the main aisle who didnt look confused they looked at me the way that avery looked at me as if i was the answer to a prayer it made me nervous to see that look on anyones face but this many all vampires all strangers nervous didnt describe how it felt scared maybe yeah scared about covered it you have bespelled them malcolm said he sounded angry like you do humans i said i do not use my powers on humans are you saying you dont use any power to make yourself prettier to the humans or even the lesser vampires he blinked the blue eyes at me set into a face that was a good face but it wasnt the face that hed shown me the first few times id met him that would be vanity he said at last in a very quiet voice he hadnt denied it but i let it go my main concern about the vanity was if he was using vamp powers to look better what else was he using them for but that was a problem for another night avery laid his cheek against my hand not rubbing like the wereleopards did but reminding me he was still there i looked down at him then up at the other vampires waiting in the aisle it was almost a line as if once i finished with avery it would be someone elses turn i hadnt done this on purpose and i didnt know how to undo it i thought jeanclaude his whisper ran through me shivered along my skin and that shiver ran through my hand and into the vampire at my feet it made avery close his eyes and almost sway i whispered that didnt help jeanclaude i want to stop this not make it worse i have no talent for reading anothers thoughts and feelings ma petite not to this degree it is not my power that you are borrowing then whose my surmise is malcolm for he used it on you first and just like that its mine for keeps perhaps not for keeps as you say but for now use it quickly ma petite for it may fade what about the attraction thing gain your information from this one then i will help you tame that particular power for now i will withdraw so i do not make it worse and he was as good as his word he was just gone once his leaving would have cured the attraction problem but not now now i was still left with avery at my feet and the others still staring at me still waiting still wanting wanting what what in the name of god was i supposed to do with them i took a deep breath and let it out slow one problem at a time one disaster at a time or you get overwhelmed i looked down into averys pale brown eyes and thought what happened in your apartment last night i got a glimpse of a woman the dead woman but alive this time i got a glimpse of another woman but i couldnt see her clearly as if part of the image was misty avery pressed his face against my hand and the mist lifted a little but i still couldnt see the other woman i was borrowing malcolms power but most of what was in me was a much more intimate kind of magic i put my other hand up and cradled averys face between my hands and the mist thinned even more but it was like watching a movie where part of the screen was scratched i was so busy trying to see the other part of the screen that i wasnt really watching the rest avery and the very alive woman were getting up close and very personal either my ability to be embarrassed was lessening or when im working im working i was working i knew vamps could make people forget hours or even days but id never known anyone that could make just their part of a memory fuzzy that was a level of control on their power that was new to me scary new touching his face more had helped because like it or hate it jeanclaudes power and mine grew with physicality i leaned over averys face leaned into him with my hands framing him he didnt close his eyes as i came in to kiss him but i closed mine i always closed mine my lips touched his and the woman on the other side of the bed had brown hair the kiss grew into a press of mouths and the womans hair was soft brown waves that filled averys hand softer even than it looked her face turned to his eyes and that mist settled over his vision again i couldnt see her face fine i thought her name avery give me her name but there was a roaring silence in his head as if there too whatever shed done to him kept her safe or at least anonymous the memory wasnt like a camera view it was from averys eyes i had a glimpse down his body that he was nude that both women were nude but still her face i couldnt see her face i slid to my knees still kissing him his hands wrapped around my body and when he pressed us together i let myself melt into the feel of his arms his body i gave myself to the kiss the embrace and it was like a stroke of lightning cut through the memory the colors were brighter i knew what sally cooks mouth tasted like i could smell perfume one that was sharper more alcohol content and the other that powdery musk of something expensive the vampires face was like crystal in my head in his head her name was nellie and she was a master vampire and she had met him at the strip clubs not at the church shed brought the stripper who avery knew as morgana it was like i suddenly had access to everything that nellie had said to him as if id unlocked a computer file and suddenly the information poured in shed talked about her master whom avery had never met her master who was a real master vampire not like malcolm someone who knew how to hunt how to feed how to be a true predator avery had tried to distance himself from her but shed pursued him hard the thought led to a memory of nellie and another woman vampire the second vampire looked enough like nellie to be her sister almost twin her name was nadine and she was much younger much weaker but they looked alike and the moment i saw that i realized that they looked like avery they all had the same soft brown hair the same soft oval faces pale brown eyes they could have been siblings nadine and nellie had fought after they had had sex with him nadine didnt want to share nellie on a regular basis avery had used that as an excuse to distance himself again but then nellie showed up that night at the club and she had morgana in tow and they offered and he didnt say no i tasted his guilt it was real enough hed broken so many rules of the church the club the stripper and nellie was dangerous he knew that just not how dangerous hed fed on the woman fed at her neck then had sex with nellie he thought the evening was over but nellie started to go down on the other woman she wanted him to feed from her thigh feed in that most intimate of places but something about it panicked him maybe it was the look in the other vampires eyes soft brown in color but what we both saw in those eyes was hard and he knew that if he didnt get up and go that she would talk him into anything everything he grabbed his clothes fled the bedroom dressed in the living room and left morgana alive and happy in bed with nellie he went to the church and took one of the coffins they had in the basement for emergencies hed been working up to telling malcolm about nellie and her scary offer about a master vampire who knew how to hunt a master who was actively recruiting church members for his scary little group but avery had been waiting until after church services then i had come and plans changed i broke the kiss the way youd break the surface of a pool fast and hard when youve been too long under water and you need to breathe it brought me gasping away from his mouth and left me inches from his face so that we were left staring into each others wide eyes if id been thinking clearly id have tried to get the next question answered the same way id asked the rest by touch and vampire trickery or would that be necromancer trickery whatever staring at his face from inches away and seeing something close to devotion on a strangers face threw me jeanclaude might have been used to it but i wasnt and so i did what i always do when im scared by some new bit of metaphysics i resorted to something human and ordinary i spoke out loud is there anyone in the church tonight that joined nellie and her master yes he said in a voice that was still whispery from the kiss jonah nellie said jonah had met her master and liked him she offered a threeway with jonah and me and her i said no i was still hooked up enough to know that he said that last defensively the idea being of course he wouldnt go to bed with another man not even with a woman in the same bed at the same time if he thought that was going to win points with me he was wrong i liked men who were secure enough in their manhood to share me with another man in fact lately it was damn near a prerequisite for dating me avery was frowning at me as if hed gotten some of what i was thinking but i didnt have time to worry about it because zerbrowski was yelling hes running for it i was on my feet in time to see one of the vampires bounding over the backs of the pews his feet barely touching the wood using it to bounce himself farther away almost levitation but not quite he didnt know how to fly yet i like the young ones theyre easier to catch he couldnt fly so he wouldnt try for the tall windows i didnt chase him i ran to the aisle against the far wall there was a door that led into their parish hall he couldnt fly he needed a door i had my gun out i hit the safety with my thumb and chambered a round as i ran the vampire leapt off the back of the last pew and landed light as air on the floor he took one step toward the far door and i yelled stop or i shoot i had the gun aimed at him twohanded its hard to walk forward and keep a bead on someone but i was farther away than i wanted to be in a crowded church yeah the innocent people were nicely to one side but bullets are determined little things once you pull the trigger they will hit something i wanted to be close enough to be secure enough to pull that trigger and not endanger anyone else of course once the guns came out people panicked usually they panic sooner but for some strange reason i was in the far aisle and had a clean shot before the crowd started screaming and scattering some of them scattered the wrong damn way i suddenly had civilians screaming and hesitating between me and the vampire i was chasing i yelled get down damn it get down catch him damn it he made the door because i couldnt risk the shot but there were two vampires just behind him they were two of the ones that had been in the aisle had i done that when i said catch him were they being good citizens or was it my fault shit i started through the screaming crowd with zerbrowski at my back and marconi and smith just behind my gun was pointed at the ceiling as i tried to get through them they screamed at the guns they screamed at me they screamed because they could i heard zerbrowski behind me giving the uniforms at the back door a headsup and a description of our bad vamp wed almost waded through the panicked civilians i heard different yelling over the highpitched screams men yelling but not screaming i brought my gun up as i cleared the side of the door with as little of my body showing as possible no i did not stand in the fucking middle of the doorway and make myself a perfect target that kind of shit is great for movies but in real life take cover worry about looking like a hero later after youve survived there was a fight at the end of the hallway our civvies one dark and one blond had caught up with the bad guy they seemed to be winning they had him on the ground though the darkhaired civvie was on the ground too i cleared the door gun in a twohanded grip with zerbrowski right behind me he yelled police everybody freeze the civilians hesitated in the fight because they were upstanding citizens upstanding citizens tend to listen to the cops it wasnt much of a hesitation they just stopped fighting as hard and they glanced at us that was it then they turned right back to the bad guy but he was a bad guy and he hadnt looked at us or hesitated in the fight after all he had nothing to lose i already had a warrant that let us kill his ass the two vampires had him down but when they hesitated one of them must have loosened their grip just a fraction i saw something silver glint in the bad guys hand i yelled knife but it was too late the blade hit the dark one in the chest something about that blow seemed to stagger the blond because he went to his knees beside his friend maybe he thought we had the bad guy covered he knelt and reached for his fallen friend and if the bad guy had done the usual and stood up and run through the door wed have had clean shots at him but he didnt he pushed the door wide with his hand and halfcrawled halfrolled through the door the two civilians were blocking our shots completely i yelled fuck and started to run we cleared the far door me going low zerbrowski high marconi and smith a weight at our backs waiting for a clear angle we were in the parish hall and in the middle of all those long tables was the vampire he was using his leather jacket to shield his face from the whitehot glow of the two uniforms crosses they had their guns in one hand and the crosses in the other almost like youd hold flashlights so that they were able to maintain a twohanded grip and still show the crosses training will tell i yelled hes got a knife i saw one of the mens eyes flick to me but only for a second well cover him you pat him down dont be a wussy roarke smith said from behind me call me a wussy when youre standing this close to him i kept my gun on the vampire and walked slowly toward him i talked while i moved slowly drop the knife the vampire didnt move except to cower behind his jacket i stopped moving and looked down the barrel of my gun at him i felt myself going quiet inside slipping away inside my head to that distant strangely peaceful place i went when i killed and had time to rev up for it ill ask one more time jonah drop the knife or i put a bullet in you i wont ask again all the air slid out of me and my body went as still and peaceful as my head i didnt hear that white noise tonight that static it was just quiet the world had narrowed down to the crouching figure and nothing else i wasnt really aware of the police zerbrowski behind me even the glow of the crosses had pulled back so that my vision was sharpened down to the man i was about to shoot something dropped from that dark figure something silver that glinted in the white glow but it didnt really register i didnt think knife i had passed the point of no return i was committed zerbrowskis voice brought me back knife anita he dropped the knife his voice was gentle as if he understood that i was on the edge the edge where a sharp voice might have pressed that trigger for me my breath came back in a sharp hiss of air i pointed the gun at the ceiling because i had to stop pointing it at the man i had to point it elsewhere or i was going to shoot him legally i could have done it but we needed him to talk to us the dead the true dead arent a chatty bunch ive got him zerbrowski said he had his gun nice and steady on the vampire i nodded and pressed the back of my gun to my forehead it didnt feel cool it was warm warm from being tucked up under my arm wedged next to my breast if i wore the wrong bra i scraped the edge of my breast as i drew so id learned that all those minimizer bras that spread the breast to the side are not my friend wearing a shoulder holster pushup bras actually keep your breasts up and out of the way you just had to make sure that the bra actually covered the front of you so you could run without falling out of it why was i thinking about bras when we had a double murdering vampire still to be subdued because id almost killed him id almost shot into the mass of his body not because it was time but because thats what i did i rarely looked down the barrel of a gun without being able to pull the trigger id almost killed him before we tried to question him id almost killed him because my body and mind fell into it fall into this is what we do we look down the barrel of a gun and we pull the trigger and we shoot to stop dead is stop anita how you doing zerbrowski asked i nodded and lowered the gun to point at the floor i trusted zerbrowski to get a shot off and slow the vamp down i trusted me to get my gun up in time to finish it i wasnt sure in that moment that i trusted me to stand there with a bead on the vampire funny but i didnt im fine zerbrowski he kept his eyes on the vampire along with his gun okay its your warrant yeah i said my dime i looked at the vampire still hiding behind his leather jacket and felt nothing he was just something that i wanted information from i couldnt offer him a deal for it the law didnt allow deals with vampires who had murdered but that was a problem for another hour slowly put your hands on your head and lace your fingers now his voice came strangely muffled have them put the crosses up do you want to die right this second he was quiet for a moment then his voice again no then do what youre told hands on head fingers laced right fucking now now he tried to keep his face hidden in the jacket eyes squeezed tight shut as his arms came up and he put his hands on top of his head lace the fingers he did now on your knees can i use my hands i had my gun back up and pointed you are beginning to get on my nerves drop to your fucking knees he did it goodie cross your ankles what one ankle over the other cross your ankles he did it which meant it was time to actually pat him down i hate patting down someone whos alive so much easier to search the dead for weapons how can you tell when youve been killing maybe a little too much when you think its a pain in the ass having to pat down someone who can still move i put the barrel of my gun against his head if you move i shoot is that clear yes he said in a strained voice the other nice thing about only touching them after theyre dead is that you dont hear the fear in their voices or feel that fine tremble in their hands and arms you dont have to know that what theyre afraid of is you you dont have to think about the fact that the person youre touching is going to have to die and that nothing they can do or you can do will stop it the law isnt about justice or mercy the law is about the law and law didnt give jonah nolastname or me options he had another knife this one was at the small of his back in a sheath on the inside of his belt he had a wrist sheath empty and a larger sheath at his neck hidden by the jackets collar id never known a vampire to carry that many weapons when he dropped the knife i thought id been wrong about seeing the knife in the other vamps chest but no the bastard had stabbed him and had plenty of knives left i remembered the knife like an exclamation point in the vamps chest it made me wonder i looked at one of the knives hefted it touched the flat of it with my thumb shit its silver i didnt run back to the vampire i waited and helped them get jonah the vampire handcuffed though i knew that they would only slow him down if he really wanted free we just hadnt come up with anything that could hold up against a vampires strength it was one of the reasons that they were killed instead of held over for trial one state had tried crosswrapped coffins but it had been shot down as cruel and unusual if id been asked i would have asked the legislators that decided the coffins were too cruel if they themselves would rather be held in a small confined space until trial or just killed id have bet theyd have chosen the coffin but then no one asked me id been invited to speak before a senate subcommittee on undead rights but the date kept being switched or the committee chairperson kept changing or it was almost as if someone didnt want the committee to finish its report probably political but whatever i hadnt been called id just been asked a date to be specified later funny but i think the committee would have liked my testimony better if theyd let me come talk when they first issued the invitation lately i had nothing comforting to say sit him in a chair if he tries anything funny shoot him where are you going zerbrowski asked the knives are silver so so our good samaritan vampire may be dead or dying i was already moving for the door if hes going to survive weve got minutes to save him save him how zerbrowski asked i just shook my head and went for the door go with her smith smith just changed his grip on his gun so it was pointed twohanded at the floor i got your back i didnt argue with smith coming along zerbrowski and i were partnering tonight we trusted each other to watch the bad vamp but i had to check on the wounded vamp so zerbrowski stayed on the suspect and gave me backup because neither of us trusted anyone else to cover jonah the vampire zerbrowski got the murderer and i got the hero life had been so much simpler when vampires didnt come in heroflavor i couldnt see our hero for the broad back of his friend the blond was still kneeling there holding his hand the blonds shoulders were slumped and he turned a tearstained face up to me faint reddishpink tracks down his face where the blood in his own tears had marked him the tears made me fear the worst until i moved around the feet of the other vamp the hero lay on his back but he blinked wide gray eyes up at me the eyes were the only thing pale about him longish dark hair and the beginnings of a beard around a wide mouth i almost said out loud what i was thinking oh good youre not dead but i managed not to point for me i knelt on the other side of him across from his friend the knife was sticking out of his chest like an exclamation point id stabbed my share of vamps in my time and i knew a heart blow when i saw one blood welled out around the blade soaking into the darkhaired ones clothing it was bleeding a lot which meant either hed fed tonight or it was a bad injury or both i didnt realize the knife was silver until we disarmed him id have come back sooner smith said we got company sooner or later a voice said behind us it matters not malcolm was behind us other church members were behind him you always get gawkers i guess it matters i said he is dying anita and nothing we can do will save him i looked back at the hurt man and caught the look in his friends blue eyes blue eyes framed by the blue of his shirt collar ive seen vampires survive worse you have seen master vampires survive worse he is not a master he gets power from his line his master i said it isnt always about personal power truth and wicked have no masters do you the blond looked at malcolm and there was such hopelessness in his face i couldnt even make remarks about the names i mean who gets named truth and wicked but in the face of such raw pain i couldnt do anything but say if you have something important to say malcolm say it they are masterless anita the master that made them died and thesourdre de sang that created their line was destroyed too they survived the destruction of their line but it weakened them i looked up at the blonds face truth or wicked i didnt know which he was he was staring at malcolm but the look in his eyes said it was the truth if you had bloodoathed them theyd have a master right now i allowed them into my church most masters would kill them why the vampire on the ground answered they fear us in a strangled voice the blond said dont talk brother i will talk for you they fear that if other vampires knew we survived the slaying of our entire bloodline then others might wonder if they could kill those that enslave them too and survive brother i said the blond looked up at me fresh tears giving his blue eyes a reddish cast truth is my brother shit i thought is malcolm right if we remove the knife will truth not heal it once yes but the death of our line did weaken us when a silver weapon is used we heal like a human i looked down at the hilt sticking out of the vampires chest if he was human hed be dead already hes not he is dying anita can you not feel it malcolm said i put my hand on the vampires chest near the blade in the cooling blood in his clothes and i concentrated i felt his energy for lack of a better word fading he took a deep gasping breath and had trouble getting the next breath shit hes bleeding to death he was losing so much blood his body was beginning to shut down shit i looked at the blond if we just sit here he will die if we pull the blade out i may be able to save him how the blond asked i just couldnt think of anyone as wicked not as a name how that was the question if jeanclaude were here we could bloodoath him of course now with the marks wide open between us truth could take my blood and be bound primo had found that out by accident now it had possibilities im going to contact my master the master of the city if he agrees ive got an idea i called in my head jeanclaude i had a sense of movement around him he was in the club oui ma petite you rang i didnt use words i let him riffle through my head in a kind of shorthand we ended with him feeling amazed the wicked truth here in america you know them they are the only vampires in our history to purposefully hunt down their line and murder them that threw me what why i knew their master and his master thesourdre de sang they were warriors ma petite such warriors they were to battle what belle morte is to sex so are they too dangerous to bring on board do you know what happens when the source of a line goes mad it seemed like a trick question but i said something bad he laughed inside my head and it made me shiver all in their line suddenly began to slaughter people without pay without politics or motive of any kind i was still with belle at the courts i know that the council was planning on sending assassins but two of the vampires in the line took action they saved us from coming to attention in england and for that the council was grateful but they slew their source of bloodline their creator and that is a death sentence among us so why arent they dead because some on the council interceded i do not know why or even entirely who only that belle voted for them to live but they were masterless and sent to roam as they would with the hand of any master that met them turned against them if they could slay their fountain of blood and survive then most considered them too dangerous to survive how do you feel what are you offering ma petite remember what happened with primo you will feed truth and he will be bound to me and to you is that it yeah they are not the brutes of the dragons line but they are warriors that have survived centuries with every hand turned against them i met them once when their master came to the courts they were men of honor what does he say wicked asked i held up a hand hes thinking about it no one will risk it truth said in that horribly strained voice jeanclaude breathed through my mind shivered over my skin i moved my hand back from the wounded vampire so the effect didnt spread i opened the marks between us wide and he filled me he spilled through my body over my skin his power hit mine and it was like flame laid into some huge waiting bonfire it spilled my head back bowed my spine and spilled out from my skin it went out and out and out and i could feel every vampire in the hallway feel them like individual lights in the dark as if with closed eyes i would know them all back my children malcolms voice came distant as if he were talking through the roaring in my head we must leave this place to her black magic i opened my eyes and knew instantly that my eyes had bled to brown fire edged with black whats about to happen smith asked i looked up at him and he let out a surprised yelp he licked his lips and stared at me pale and frightened if you dont want to watch then go back to zerbrowski smith shook his head ill stay you wont like it i said he was fighting not to hug himself and i remembered that he could sense the energy of shapeshifters nothing like being a little psychic in the middle of a metaphysical event i dont like it now but ive got your back at least against anything that a gun will stop that last made me think he might be more sensitive than id thought he knew there were dangerous things in the hallway now but nothing that guns could help with that was almost too smart id have to be careful around smith with the metaphysics he might figure out more than i wanted him to know i turned back to the two vampires i am jeanclaudes human servant we truly are blood of my blood to each other what do you propose wicked asked the knife comes out then i let truth feed and we bloodoath him to jeanclaude he would truly take us he said yes wicked looked down at his brother do you agree to this to being bound to another master felt her power her call he had another of those gasping fits if this is servant then the master must be more is that a yes i asked wicked nodded but if you take my brother you have to take me too i simply knew that jeanclaude was okay with that there was no need to ask agreed though whether i can feed you both tonight is a different question we have fed already this night for truth it will need to be a true feeding but for me a taste will do okay i said i thought will this work and jeanclaudes answer was almost certain he was almost certain that it would work would it work better to bloodoath him then take the knife out i asked perhaps ma petite but the silver may also interfere with the process we are hoping to bring him back to health and this will not happen with the silver still in his body i blinked and looked at wicked with the eyes gone all vampire his bone structure was very clear and i realized that he was very manlyman handsome very masculine and when i looked at his brother i could trace that same bone structure underneath all the facial hair how had i not seen the resemblance before we need to take the knife out first then he feeds i looked down at my wrists my left was still healing from primo and the zombie last night i was not offering up my right wrist never injure your gun hand if you can avoid it i touched my neck requiems bite was still there though almost healed damians bite was faintest i wasnt taking my top off so breast was out neck it was i was going to end up looking like a vampire junkie always carrying a fresh bite mark oh well sorry im going over all the injuries right side of the neck for feeding he cannot sit up ill lay down i gave my gun to smith his eyes widened whats this for im going to let truth feed on my neck id rather not have to worry about whether he can touch my gun or not you dont trust us wicked said i dont trust anybody i started to lie down on top of truth but the knife was very much in the way jeanclaude said inside my head the knife first ma petite i knelt back and looked at the brother do you want to do it or do i do it he seemed to understand without extra talknice for a change i will do it he took his free hand because the other was still wrapped around his brothers hand he gripped the hilt of the blade and hesitated its time brother truth said i moved my hair to one side so the right side of my neck stretched clean once the knife was out we had a minute maybe to make him live or let him die wicked stayed immobile hand on his brother and the hilt do you want me to do it i asked he shook his head but still didnt move either you do it or i do it wicked were running out of time do it truth whispered do it wickeds arm tensed forgive me brother he said and pulled the blade out in one harsh jerk blood welled up from the wound thick red his body spasmed i did what i said id do how do you lay your body on top of a wounded man the same way you do any man if you dont want to roll off i laid myself on top of him legs on either side of his body while he spasmed under me and fought for his life i laid my neck in front of his face and he couldnt control his body enough to feed oh shit i looked up and met his brothers eyes help me how hold him up enough so he can feed wicked didnt argue he just moved around behind his brother and raised his head and shoulders just enough off the ground the spasming was growing less but that wasnt good that wasnt good at all jeanclaude breathed through my body kiss him what i said out loud what is it wicked asked give him enough energy to feed how he was just in my head not words not exactly images i just suddenly understood because he understood the vampires had a kiss of life long before we humans had artificial respiration once id thought you had to be asourdre de sang or the person who made a vamp to share energy like this but id proven that it wasnt true if jeanclaude hadnt been so certain that it would work i would have argued id only done something similar to this once and that had been with asher who was our sweetie and who had fed on me before this vampire was a stranger to me and not one of our line but jeanclaudes certainty filled me as if it were my own i looked into truths face and his eyes were beginning to glaze as his body went still i called power or maybe jeanclaude did or we both did it was hard to tell where one magic ended and the other began i leaned over the vampires face what are you doing wicked asked there was no time to explain i pressed my lips to the other vampires mouth his lips were so still against mine i kissed him and felt his death felt that spark flickering like a match in the wind i breathed power into his mouth i forced it inside him the way you force air into the dying i breathed into his mouth and thought wake wake to us truth wake to our magic jeanclaude used me to thrust power like a sword down the line of his body it was sharp and painful even to me it brought truth gasping sitting up off the floor yelling yelling something in a language id never known feed i said and it was jeanclaudes words but it was my hand that swept my hair to the side and bared my neck to him he grabbed me his hands digging into my shoulders i saw his head coming forward but the rest was lost to my sight he bit me sudden hard fangs tearing my flesh i yelled because it hurt there was no mind trick or sex to soften it it just hurt i heard a startled male voice in the direction of the closest door shit another one she volunteered smith said to save his life hes a fucking corpse you cant save his life marshal blake made the decision roarke go back to the others shit he said again i couldnt say anything couldnt help explain my hands were on truths arms i think i was going to start struggling it just fucking hurt jeanclaude was there harder in my head relax ma petite do not fight him im not fighting i thought yes you are you are fighting his powers you must lower your shields not just between yourself and me but between him and yourself quickly ma petite quickly or we will lose him i dropped my shields the ones that kept out all the other vamps the ones that were so automatic that i didnt usually notice them the shields that i had naturally as a necromancer they fell down and suddenly it didnt hurt anymore it was like suddenly being thrown into that part of sex where pain is pleasure where the bite that youd have slugged someone for is just the best thing youve ever felt id let him feed on my neck but id been straining away from him now i relaxed into him it was like melting into a kiss that caught you offguard and suddenly you give in to it you stop thinking it to death and just let it be i gave myself to the feel of his mouth on my neck the strength of his hands on my back the press of his body against mine his hand slid lower down to my lower back and farther so that he cupped my ass he pressed us together bowing his neck and shoulders to keep his mouth sealed to my neck and pressed our lower bodies tight against one another tight enough that i could feel him hard and thick against the front of his body id lowered my shields all my shields the only miracle had been that theardeur hadnt tried to rise sooner but it rose now rose with the press of his body the sucking of his mouth rose through my body across my skin and into him he drew back from my neck with an exclamation mother of darkness save us its belle morte i met that wideeyed gaze his eyes were bluer now than they had been or seemed so not belle truth just me just jeanclaude just us i whispered the last against his lips theardeur wanted me to kiss him to press our mouths together and feed energy for energy i spoke with my mouth almost touching his jeanclaude help me help me put the genie back in the bottle help me stop this if i help you shield theardeur may spread here in the club where i am then feed like you did last night feed on the willing but let this cup pass me by tonight i need to catch a murderer not fuck everyone we bring over help us truth said help us master i felt jeanclaudes surprise thrill along my skin as if curiosity was a touch does he want to stop his question came out of my mouth in my voice yes truth breathed it against my lips so that i could smell my blood on his breath yes help us stop this why jeanclaude asked this question i stopped because id had enough satisfy your curiosity about him later jeanclaude ive got police waiting in the other room i need this over with very well ma petite it wasnt like he reached out to me he was already in me almost as deep as he could go butreaching was the only word i had for it he didnt shield me or truth he didnt shield anything or anyone he took theardeur that was rising in us and did two things at once he swallowed theardeur and he shut down the link between him and me tight and final like slamming a door between us i was left alone pressed against truths body our faces still inches apart but suddenly it was just us we both let out a breath in shaking unison as if wed both been holding our breath he moved his arms away so i could get out of his lap there was no teasing no sense of loss from him at the touch of theardeur and its going away he seemed as relieved as i did if id had time and could have figured out a way to ask why he was relieved without sounding like my pride was hurt i would have but i had work to do so i stood up and swayed and only truths hand on my arm kept me from bumping a wall are you alright smith and wicked asked at the same time smith glared at the vampire but wickeds face was neutrally handsome just been donating a little too much blood lately im fine to prove it i stepped back from truths hand i took a few deep breaths and i was steady but i was really going to have to see if i could go at least a night without opening a vein i felt your masters power wicked said my brother is bound to him but i am not you promised you would take us both i will jeanclaude will but not tonight this blood bank is closed for the night wicked gave me a look that said he neither believed nor trusted me his brother was simply standing beside him as if hed levitated to his feet maybe he had he hugged wicked onearmed across the shoulders shell do what she promised truth was smiling why because she helped you fight off theardeur partly wicked shook his head you must be even better than that felt for truth to trust you this much i saved his life that tends to impress people not him not truth fine but ive got to go question a murder suspect right now well go with you truth said sorry police business thanks for trying to catch the bad guy your power called to us when you touched avery truth said so when i said catch him you had to do it they both nodded sorry about that im not truth said wicked gave me another cynical look ill let you know im not sorry yet look i give you my word that as soon as humanly possible i will give you to jeanclaude give me i frowned i give my word that as soon as humanly possible i will see that you will be bound to our master of the city good enough promise me that you will bind me as you bound my brother i just did no you didnt for all i know you could pass me off to someone else in your masters household my brother and i go together to go together we must go in the same way i wished id had jeanclaude to ask was there a problem with this promise but he was busy making all the customers at guilty pleasures happy i thought about what hed asked and i couldnt see the problem with it so i said okay i promise that ill bind you like i did your brother happy now he gave a small nod with an even smaller smile then leave a card or number at one of jeanclaudes clubs and well arrange another meeting well be there wicked said yes truth said yes we will be there i turned toward the door and the other room smith came at my back i reached my hand out to him gun i said he handed me my gun i holstered it and kept walking toward the other room and the waiting bad guy and police i had a vague feeling that id missed something just now with wicked and truth the wicked truth jeanclaude had called them why just because they killed their bloodline or had i missed something something id regret missing later i ran it over in my head and all i had promised was to let wicked take my blood and bind himself to jeanclaude and me thats all id promised so why did i feel like the brothers were going to expect more than id offered i thought jeanclaude what did i just do to my surprise he answered carefully as if he were shielding me we have our warriors ma petite just as you wished you cant be done feeding theardeur yet non but i remember wicked of old and i thought it foolish not to check on you one more time youre holding theardeur in check while you talk to me mindtomind in a room full of lusty women oui nice to know our little threeway gained you something you make it sound as if you gained nothing ma petite it is you who called the wicked truth to us to you before they came to my hand you said only last night that we needed people that could fight not merely seduce and less than fortyeight hours later you have called two of our most legendary warriors to you that ma petite is not just impressive it is frightening i ignored the frightening comment and concentrated on the other part i didnt remember wishing for fighters or warriors i remembered thinking we needed more muscle then we have more muscle just as you wished i couldnt argue with him but id have to be more careful what i wished for lately it seemed i was getting it no matter what i wished suddenly the phrasebe careful what you wish for had taken on a whole new meaning i guess id just have to be damned careful what i wished for of course what i was wishing the second i entered the next room was that we could catch our serial killers before they killed again i was pretty secure with that wish it seemed like a wish we could all live with they had sat the vampire in the chair with his hands cuffed through the rungs again just a delay but if it went really wrong a seconds delay could save lives i stared at the vamps face his hair was darker than averys a brunette that some would have said was black if i hadnt been standing in the room his eyes were brown and dark he was good looking in a standard haventiseenahundredfacesjustlikethatway but that wasnt what made me stare i knew him at first it was just a niggling in the back of my head that his face was familiar then suddenly it came full blown youre jonah cooper i got interviewed about how i felt that one of my fellow vampire hunters had been slain by the vampires what was that nearly two years ago now three his look which had been neutral went to hostile four he said that last word like it was a bad one theyre legal now cooper why didnt you come out of the closet and tell people you didnt die in that fire he looked down then up and his eyes had gone dark sparkling with anger and vampire powers i leaned into him with a smile i knew what smile i was giving him it was the cold one that left my eyes dead my gun was pressed not too hard to his chest just over his heart or is it that you let what was it six policemen die in the fire anita whats going on zerbrowski asked i told him i didnt have to look up to know that zerbrowskis face wouldnt be friendly nothing pisses off the cops like someone who kills one of their own howd you survive cooper i asked he glared up at me you know how you sold them to the vampires you were hunting didnt you he just looked at me but he didnt deny it that was enough he took money to betray cops marconi asked no i said not money no cooper said not money what then smith asked immortality i said right cooper not just that what then i said youre the master of the citys human servant you know what else i blinked at him not sure what to say but i leaned back enough so that i wasnt pressing a gun into his chest i knew what it was like to finally be seduced by the thing you hunted mine just happened to be a more traditional seduction okay at least i was still among the living what does he mean smith asked malcolms rich voice filled the parish hall with its tables and punch bowl everything was all set out for cookies and punch though the punch looked a little red for my tastes a little thick power officer power and sex that is what jeanclaude offers be careful about the stones you throw malcolm sometimes they get thrown back is that a threat no just a friendly warning that only the pure of motive should cast stones ask your friend there ask him was it sex with one of us that lured him i have watched mortals come to this life for centuries for the sake of sex first i said hes not my friend second it doesnt matter why only that he did it id touched cooper while i searched him for weapons and id gotten no flashes of information no images i hadnt acquired malcolms ability to see through touch id only borrowed it i wanted to borrow it again i guess i should at least pretend to try to do it the normal way i turned to cooper where is your master where is he now feeding most likely where is the daytime lair he shook his head with something like a smile on his face i wont tell you anything anita blake i would no more betray my master than you would yours but see my master doesnt ask me to butcher helpless unarmed women like yours does he shook his head again i will not betray him now technically the vampire had no more rights i could have put a bullet in his brain now legally the warrant read that i could use the force i deemed necessary no one talked about it much but i knew and the rest of us legal hunters knew that some of us used that part of the warrant to justify torture i didnt like torture not on either side of the chains besides cooper had had a reputation for being tough we didnt have the time for him to be tough we needed to know where his master lived i walked over to malcolm he didnt look happy to see me that close to him what do you want ms blake you have your villain take him and go i lowered my voice so only we and the soontobedead cooper would hear try to read my mind by touch again i did not if you deny it ill make sure that all those people that youve done negotiations with over the years know exactly how you outsmarted them a shake of the hand and you had them i did not bespell anyone no but you read their minds took knowledge from them against their will thats illegal is that a threat again ms blake negotiation is simple with me malcolm if you use your little clairvoyant powers on me now its our little secret if you dont then it wont be our little secret see very simple how can i trust you maybe you cant but what choice do you have i felt his power then like water filling the room once id worried id drown in his power now i knew i could swim in it or simply ignore it grandstanding wont win you any points with me i will do this but not because you forced me i want these killings stopped and if we harbored vipers among us unbeknownst then i want to know who they are i will not have such things done in my church or by my church members fine i held my hand out to him talk is cheap he frowned at me but he gave me his hand and the moment his fingers touched mine i felt him riffle through my head i felt him get a second image of the dead woman a more complete image i thrust my power outward like a defending blade he was prepared this time he simply drew his hand away and stepped back may it give you all the joy it has given me over the centuries it sounded like some kind of blessing turned curse but i ignored it malcolm and i could squabble later i had to use his gift while i still had it i turned back to the vampire that was still cuffed to the chair hed heard at least part of what malcolm and i had said his face was angry defiant i wont talk i wont ask you to whats happening anita zerbrowski asked im going to find out what we want to know how he looked positively suspicious it made me laugh god zerbrowski what do you think im about to do i dont know that made the laughter fade and the smile went with it its always hard to see your friends look at you like they dont trust you not to be monstrous im not going to do anything you havent seen me do already tonight he widened eyes at me this guy doesnt like you the other one did it wont matter he made a small gesture as if to say help yourself but he looked like hed believe it when he saw it i guess i couldnt blame him i reached out toward coopers face dont touch me would you rather i shoot you he just glared at me then hold still if i hadnt been afraid that hed either try to hurt me with his hands or his teeth id have touched him from behind but he was a vampire and you dont cuddle one if you arent sure about your safety i touched him from the side so if he tried to bite me id feel it and could move i touched the side of his face he was clean shaven but he was also cold he hadnt fed tonight i thought who is your master he fought me he tried to think random thoughts i got chaotic images i saw the second stripper the one from last night i saw her alive and dancing on the stage i saw a cloaked figure huddled by her stage no he jerked his head away from me i pressed my hip against his arm and put a hand on either side of his head his hair was soft but not as soft as averys coopers hair had the texture of someone who if they let it grow out at all it would have body and wave to it dont he said but it wasnt a shout this time he tried to think of anything everything but somewhere in those confused images i recognized a face a womans face i remembered her at a banquet table i remembered her at belles court it wasnt my memory i thought jeanclaude he whispered through me and this time i got a sense that he was busy or about to be do you need me to come to you ma petite i can put this off i said it out loud but for his ears though more heard it who is she gwenyth vittorios lovely gwennie vittorio i said and i had a face with the name he was darkly handsome and i doubted hed started life with an italian name he looked very dark arabic maybe vittorio i must have whispered it out loud because cooper screamed and stood up he stood up still cuffed to the chair he stood up and the last thing i got from him was a very clear thought ill make them kill me i was the closest but id had to put my gun up to do my little hand trick i did the first thing i thought of i hit him i hit him as hard and fast as i could i hit him the way id been trained for years in martial arts you dont try to throw someone to the floor you aim for three feet below the floor my target wasnt his cheek it was the other side of his face when i was merely human it was just a way to concentrate to get the maximum punch out of your body now suddenly aiming to punch a hole through someone had a whole new meaning blood spattered and his cheek gave under my fist i thought i heard his jaw break the blow spun him around and he fell onto his side chair and all he fell on the floor and didnt get back up jesus one of the uniforms said jesus you broke his neck had i i stood there for a second with my right hand covered in blood and i realized that my hand hurt id cut myself on his teeth hes not dead i said and my voice was hoarse everyone was staring at me and not in a good way more like id sprouted a second head and it was a big scary one i looked at malcolm does this work while hes unconscious malcolm just nodded i knelt beside the fallen vampire i touched his hair and tried not to look at what id done to his face i hadnt literally punched a hole through him but id split the skin away from his teeth as if id used a dull blade i closed my eyes and thought daytime retreat where is the daytime retreat he couldnt fight me now his thoughts came like smooth silk and i knew in that moment that malcolm could read people easier in their sleep i let the thought go and followed coopers thoughts images it was a big building a condo a fucking modern condo i wanted to see the front of the building i saw it i had the address wait number and name on the condo and i was looking at the little boxes with all the names and numbers i was looking at it from higher up than i would have seen it street i thought what street are we on i said the address out loud street and name that the condo was under got it zerbrowski said i opened my eyes and took my hands off of cooper his eyes fluttered open he made a sound a low groan the look he flashed up at me as i stood over him was one of surprise and fear i was as surprised as anyone but i couldnt let anyone see that id known that joining with jeanclaude and richard would up the metaphysics but hadnt thought what it would mean to the physical if cooper had been human my punch would have snapped his neck shit zerbrowski was already on his phone who are you calling i asked mobile reserve well want the fire power wait i said zerbrowski hit the button on his phone killed it wait for what if we give them the address they may go in tonight we dont want that we want to catch these bastards smith said yeah but theyre out hunting now they wont be home or at least most of them wont be well miss some of them or all of them and once weve got that many police around the place theyll know it theyll never come back to the place again and we wont know where to look for them we cant withhold the address roarke said not if were asked if the address leaves this room more women are going to die if the address leaves this room maybe cops are going to die his master is someone so powerful that no master vamp in this city sensed him that means hes really really good mobile reserve is who i want in a firefight but they arent immune to vampire powers they go in at night when hes at his best and they may all die everyone was looking at me except zerbrowski he had already moved on and didnt need convincing marconi would be cool it was the uniforms and smith i had to convince zerbrowski call mobile reserve get me captain parker zerbrowski raised an eyebrow at me you sure thats a good idea no but he knows me and hes the man in charge of mobile reserve get him for me zerbrowski made a face your funeral lets hope not i said i looked down at jonah cooper vampire exvamp executioner he blinked up at me hed have probably had something to say to me but a broken jaw cuts down on the chitchat zerbrowski clicked his phone shut ive left a message hell get back i nodded i looked down at jonah again i had everything he knew all of it id seen him helping murder women id seen his own memory of it i sighed while we wait for the call back help me move our prisoner outside zerbrowski gave me a look i gave him one back it was his turn to sigh smith take his other arm were going to escort him outside smith was looking at us sort of funny but he helped zerbrowski lift the vampire to his feet cooper made small protesting noises and hissed curses under his breath maybe i hadnt broken his jaw or at least not badly zerbrowski and smith got him on his feet and started him for the door i got my gun out and followed them one of the uniforms said what are they going to do go outside if you want to see the show marconi said ive seen it he sounded tired roarke and the other uniform whose name i couldnt remember followed me it was like a parade ive got over eighty kills most of them actually legal but i usually whack the bad guys when theyre dead to the world i usually havent had to question them touch them i usually dont know who they were in life or if i do i feel like im putting them out of their misery or did once when i believed vampires were truly dead jonah cooper had been what i am and he had betrayed everything he stood for hed sacrificed law enforcement officers that had gone in as his backup hed murdered innocent women for kicks i knew all that but id have liked it better if i didnt know that his hair had nice texture or that hed gotten a heros funeral theres a reason that executioners through history usually only come in at the end when its time to kill if hed run for it or fought then the other cops could have shot him killed him for me but he wasnt going to run now and no one else here had the legal authority to do what i was about to do we were outside in a small side area near the far parking lot cooper had figured out what was happening because even with an injured jaw he was trying to talk to me the words started out stiff but got faster as he talked fear will override pain youre jeanclaudes human servant how is what im doing any different from that i havent killed innocent civilians because my master doesnt like strippers i killed more people as a hunter than ive killed as a vampire he said he tried to turn around and look at me but apparently that hurt too much we were on a plot of grass with flowers to one side and the parking lot to the other good enough i said zerbrowski turned and smith moved with him they turned the vamp around so i could see his face i kill because the law says i can not because i want to i said liar knees i said he fought them and i didnt blame him i shot him in the leg and he collapsed to the ground i hadnt expected to have to shoot him so soon or for wounding the echo of the gun up my arm thrilled through my body like the gun was where all the adrenaline came from tingling up my arm smith looked pale zerbrowski grim but they still had his arms even with him on the ground i can make this quick cooper or i can make it slow your choice my voice was empty nothing showed on my face i just looked at him and knew that if he struggled i would shoot him by inches until he was too wounded to get away and i could let zerbrowski and smith move away without risking cooper getting away he struggled and i shot him again smith let go of the arm i cant do this this isnt right then get the fuck away from him i said and there was anger in my voice now because i agreed with smith zerbrowski yeah his voice was very careful i had the gun on cooper and my body had gone quiet the anger sliding away on the nice white static in my head move he moved cooper tried to levitate i figured he would i put two shots into the center of his body and he collapsed back to earth he hadnt been able to fly in the church when he was healthy i hadnt expected him to get better wounded he didnt i walked up to him gun in a twohanded grip aimed on the center of his forehead youre enjoying this he said and he made a sound in his throat there was blood on his lips his blood no i said im really not liar he said again and tried to spit blood at my feet but apparently his jaw hurt too much and it made him writhe on his knees i dont want to kill you cooper and i dont enjoy it he looked up at me puzzled you feel empty inside i enjoyed killing bully for you i said and i knew i should have pulled the trigger should have ended it never let them talk you really dont enjoy this do you he asked no i said looking into those brown eyes then how do you stay sane i let all the air ease from my body as the world narrowed down to the center of his forehead but i could still see his eyes so alive so real i answered him i dont know i squeezed the trigger and the impact knocked him backward he fell on his side and i moved up on him gun still held twohanded because whether he was dead or whether he wasnt i wasnt done he had a smallish hole in the middle of his forehead above his surprised eyes i fired into his forehead until the top of his head exploded in brains and bone decapitation was nice but spilling the brains all over the grass works too i switched my aim to his chest and fired until my gun emptied then i got a second clip from my belt reloaded and fired into his chest until i could see light through his body legally i could not carry my vamp executioner kit in the car unless i had a current warrant id left home without a warrant so my sawedoff shotgun was at home with my stakes and machete handguns will do the job but it takes longer and it wastes a hell of a lot of ammo the last gun shot echoed into the night my ears were full of that ringing silence that happens when youve fired that many shots from that close a range without ear protection i was standing over the body one foot on its shoulder pinning it to the ground i must have kicked him over onto his back sometime during the chest shots i didnt remember doing it but shooting into the ground was a hell of a lot safer than shooting out into the night not all the bullets would stop in his body not when you were trying to punch a hole through the person the first sound that came back was the sound of my blood in my ears the pulse of my own body then some sound made me turn malcolm had brought his flock to watch or maybe they had come on their own and he couldnt stop them so hed come with them whatever they were there held back by the uniforms the vampires and the few humans among them stood staring at me there was a little girl in front and for a second i thought what the fuck are her parents thinking then i realized she was a vamp i had trouble concentrating but she was old older than the woman holding her hand and pretending to be her mommy i popped the clip in my gun and checked how much ammo i had left i couldnt remember how many shots id fired id only brought two clips with me silly me i needed to load up i needed my jeep or home i put the clip back in and slammed it home with my hand some of the vamps jumped at the small sound it made somehow with all of them standing there staring at me i didnt want to put the gun up i didnt think theyd really rush us but it was definitely not a friendly crowd zerbrowski came up to me lets get you out of here he said and either he whispered or my hearing wasnt all the way back but i didnt argue i let him take me to his car and i let smith and marconi watch our backs i saw avery in the crowd as we moved he didnt look happy to see me anymore guess the honeymoon was over zerbrowski got me into the passenger seat movement caught my eye it was wicked and truth they were by the entrance to the church they didnt look upset truth gave me a nod and wicked kissed the tip of one finger in my direction i buckled my seat belt raised a hand in their direction you made some new friends tonight zerbrowski said as he put the car in gear and drove us slowly forward we had to ease close to the waiting group of vampires they watched us with blank empty faces yeah i make friends wherever i go he gave a small dry laugh jesus anita did you have to blow a hole clean through his chest yes as a matter of fact i did my voice wasnt the least bit friendly id stay away from the church for awhile if i were you theyre going to remember what you did tonight i put my head back against the seat and closed my eyes yeah me too you alright with this no did parker call back yet yeah i told him you were blowing a hole through a vampires chest he said you could call him back i opened my eyes and looked at him is that really what you told him he grinned at me yeah i shook my head give me your damn phone he handed it to me just hit this button itll ring him back i hit the button and the phone started to ring i was numb i felt nothing but a vague shockiness parker answered on the second ring and i started to talk about business about solving murders and saving lives i concentrated on the fact that we were trying to save lives but my mind kept jumping around it kept jumping over a vision of jonah coopers eyes and his question how do you stay sane the answer the real answer was you dont an hour later i was home i had a date with mobile reserve for just after dawn captain parker had told me to get some sleep as if i sounded like i needed it hed even agreed to letting me go in with them i was to their vampire raids what hazmat was to their meth lab raids an expert who could help them stay alive and not accidentally blow themselves to hell vampires wouldnt blow up like some of the chemicals used in methamphetamine labs but lack of knowledge could make you just as dead i would be their johnnyonthespot expert and no you dont want to know how much arguing i had to do to get both the invitation to go in with them and to keep the address until i met them at dawn i sat at my kitchen table sipping coffee and staring off into space the coffee was sloshing against the sides of my cup like it was trying to escape that shouldnt be happening micah was suddenly at my side he put his hand on my coffee mug youre going to drop it i stared up at him and didnt know what he meant it must have shown on my face because he explained your hands are shaking im afraid youre going to drop the cup he eased it out of my hands and set it on the table i stared at my hands and he was right they were shaking not a fine tremble but a fullblown quaking as if from the wrist down i was having a fit i stared at my hands like they belonged to someone else micah knelt in front of me he put his hands on mine held them tight between his anita what happened it felt good for him to hold my hands it helped the shaking to slow but it didnt go away what happened what had happened what made this one different everything nothing it took me two tries to talk i had to talk to him him who the vampire i killed tonight the trembling was quieting under the press of his hands my voice didnt show the trembling at all it was empty why did you have to talk to him interrogation had to interrogate him micah touched my face and it startled me but it made me look at him his eyes were very green in the dimness of the kitchen with that yellow around his pupils more like light gathering around a single point did you learn what you needed to know i nodded still staring at his eyes and why couldnt you wait until dawn to kill him i shook my head he was one of our serial killers couldnt risk him getting away and warning them then you had to kill him he put his hand on the side of my face and that made me look at him more not just fascinate on his eyes i saw him now all of him saw micah id known he was there but it was as if i was only getting pieces of things i looked at that face that was at once so familiar to me that i knew every curve and line and yet i was still surprised sometimes to look at him and realize that he was mine that this was my sweetie it still caught me offguard sometimes like a really good surprise as if he was too good to be real and i kept expecting him not to be there why should he be different he reached up to me and i slid off the chair and into his arms i wrapped myself around his waist his chest his shoulders i hugged him as tight and close as i could with legs and arms and he got to his feet with me still wrapped around him we were the same height and weighed within fourteen pounds of each other if hed been human he might not have been able to do it but he wasnt human and he stood up and began to walk through the darkened house i knew where we were going and i couldnt think of anything better than crawling under the covers and letting him hold me the phone rang micah kept walking the machine caught it and ronnies voice came on nita this is ronnie i need help micah froze because it didnt sound like ronnie i hopped down to the floor and was running for the phone while she was still slurring her words ronnie ronnie its me whats happened anita its you ronnie whats happened my pulse was thudding in my throat again adrenaline had chased the shock and the numbness away im drunk she said happily what im at a club across the river i am watching men take their clothes off what club something dreams incubus dreams i said thats it and she slurred her s why are you at a strip club getting drunk i asked the adrenaline was easing away louie wont live with me he says marriage or nothin and i said nuthin oh ronnie i am drunk and the bartender says i need a ride can i have a ride micah was standing close enough that hed caught some of it ill go get her anita why are men such bastards i wasnt sure that men were such bastards but i knew better than to argue ill come get you just stay there and dont do anything youll regret when you wake up tomorrow she giggled ronnie never giggled oh i want to do something that louie will regret tomorrow shit sit tight dont do anything stupid well be there as soon as we can she hung up still laughing i filled micah in on the parts hed missed you need to rest anita ill go get her first shes in the menarebastards mindset and shes wanting to do something that louie will regret tomorrow i think you alone wouldnt be a good idea besides shes my friend but im letting you come with me he was frowning at me i touched his arm going to bed with you beside me is the best idea in the world right now but going to bed without you is like the worst idea in the world i think alone my heads going to turn ugly maybe going out is exactly what i need he frowned harder you can just call her a taxi ronnie and i just made up from a fight thats lasted for months i dont want to lose her again im not going to talk you out of this am i no he smiled then though his eyes still werent happy then lets go i smiled at him thank you what for not arguing yeah but im driving i didnt argue i did get my vampire hunter kit and my equipment bag the equipment bag was new but it held more weapons it carried lots of guns lots of ammo pointy weapons and it all looked like a medium sized black duffel bag luggage thing micah didnt argue about the extra firepower he just held the door for me since i had a bag in each hand we met nathaniel coming up the sidewalk he grinned at me until he saw my face and the bags whats wrong whats happened i looked at micah and he looked at me shes got a warrant so she can carry her entire kit with her you arent going to catch vampires with her are you i sighed right now were going to go rescue ronnie shes drunk as a skunk over the river at incubus dreams the bartender took her keys nathaniels eyebrows went up why go to that dump i laughed and dropped a bag so i could hug him he hugged me back come with us and well discuss it in the car i want to get there before she does something stupid you mean like get drunk at a strip club where i know the dancers will do a lot more than just strip for money i looked at him and my eyes were wide tell me you dont mean he shrugged thats the rumor and i believe the person who told me oh shit i started to run for the jeep because having sex with a prostitute stripper would qualify nicely as something louie would regret in the morning the trouble with that kind of revenge is that you regret it so much more than whoever youre trying to hurt i threw the bags in the back micah drove and nathaniel got in the back we were off to try to save ronnie from a fate worse than death or something like that incubus dreams sits by itself in the middle of an open field a distant stand of trees and a gravel parking area it sits by itself partly by accident and partly because it is the only allmale show on this side of the river bright multicolored neon surrounded the entrance there was a large printed sign on the door that read allmale dancers it was a last chance for the drunks to make sure that this was what they wanted to see and they werent about to stumble into the wrong club the three of us stepped into the foyer or whatever you call an open space with an empty display case and a little desklike area there was no one behind it no one to ask if we wanted to check our coats i was actually the only one wearing a coat it was mild for october and lycanthropes tend to run warm i had the short leather jacket on mostly to hide the gun under my arm more than to protect against the autumn chill but whatever bouncer was supposed to check people out at the door wasnt at the door we entered the club unmolested and unchecked out bad security no cookie of course maybe they were counting on you being deafened and stunned for a moment by the music it was so loud you could feel the bass in your bones and not in a good way you literally stood a moment on the raised area inside the doors just trying to adjust your senses to the damn music who needs security when the music is like a blow against the side of your head a headache started almost instantly faint but promising to be a real bitch i went over how much money i had on me and how much it would cost to get them to turn the music down twenty dollars itd be cheap at twenty dollars of course the dj in his raised booth would probably be offended i tried to ignore the music and looked around the room trying to spot ronnie how many tall leggy blond women could there be here more than youd think the room was packed shit we must have hesitated too long because the dj leaned down over his booth wall which happened to be above us and to the left he yelled pay at the bar what i yelled back he repeated himself still yelling i took the opportunity to ask if he could turn the music down he smiled shook his head and vanished behind his wall i started to reach for my pocket and nathaniel touched my arm he leaned in so that his face was almost touching my ear dont offer money for him to turn it down you might offend him i yelled back from an inch away like i care nathaniel smiled and yelled he could turn it louder i gave him wide eyes and let my hand fall back away from my jacket pocket i didnt really think the music could get any louder but just in case i wouldnt tempt fate there was a dance floor to the right and several small raised stages with shiny poles in their centers a pool table to the left and little tables scattered around hither and yon bathrooms were strangely prominent against the far left wall there seemed to be no door to the mens room and no doors on any of the stalls so even standing at the door you could see directly into it that seemed weird the bar was of course at the far side of the room there seemed to be a large group of women clustered around the nearest stage though the stage itself was empty at the moment but other than that one group of women the rest of the customers were men there were three blondes who could have been ronnie but when they turned i realized they were so not ronnie the last blond was a man who either liked the way he looked or nature had been cruel hed have made a lovely women but junior high must have been hell for him micah got us both moving down the little steps and into the crowd a hand on either of our arms we threaded our way through the happy mostly drunken crowd and finally made it all the way across the room to the bar we paid our cover charge mostly by pantomime because the bar was too wide to get close enough to yell in the guys ear i tried to ask him where ronnie was but he just smiled shook his head and managed to hold an empty glass up asking if we wanted a drink since i didnt have a blonde to hold up to ask if hed seen one of those i just shook my head and we moved far enough away from the bar so that we werent blocking those that did want a drink a man wearing only loose boxers and socks came out of a blackdraped area to the side of the bar that must be the dressing rooms we huddled and i yelled bathroom ill check the bathroom they both nodded and we began to work our way around the bar toward the womens bathroom which had a large piece of cloth suspended from the ceiling covering the door maybe it was to hide the fact that the womens bathroom had a door so the men wouldnt feel cheated there was a commode in the middle of the room across from the sink it was just sitting there in the middle of the floor no stall no nothing it held water and seemed to work but it was just sitting there there were two stalls against the wall one had an out of order sign there was also a line none of the women in there was ronnie the walls must have been thicker than they seemed because i could hear myself say ronnie are you in here no answer i finally turned to a tall brownhaired woman and said my friend called me for a ride home five feet eight blond gray eyes attractive too drunk to talk right the woman shook her head a womans voice from inside the stall yelled hell that could be almost every blonde weve seen tonight i explained that id seen the blondes in the bar and they werent ronnie and asked whether theyd seen her earlier no one had one of the women was using the commode in the middle of the floor as i left oh well i opened the door and either the music had actually been turned down a notch or i was getting used to it or going deaf micah and nathaniel were where id left them but theyd been joined by a man i didnt know he was taller than either of them but so thin all over that he looked smaller somehow he had short curly brown hair and was wearing a tshirt shorts and socks no shoes interesting nathaniel took my hand as soon as i got close enough to be touched the stranger touched micahs shoulder and let his hand linger there just a second too long he was smiling and asked do the two of you like dick i kept nathaniels hand and moved up in front of them both so that it forced the man to step back from us he actually reached around me and touched micahs shoulder again i had to let go of nathaniels hand but i moved up two more steps for a moment the man was almost pressed up against me he started to smile at me then saw my eyes and the smile faltered and he stepped back i dont know what look was on my face but he stumbled a little over his words they said they liked dick i said i liked my own micah said if anyone else asks nathaniel said just say no i said weve had a misunderstanding here the man nodded sorry he started to move away i said were trying to find our friend she called drunk needs a ride home i described her he gave me nervous eyes he knew something and id been scary so he didnt want to tell me i should really learn to tone down the whole silent threat thing but damn ive just gotten so good at it nathaniels hand snaked around my shoulder the hand had a twenty dollar bill in it he said ask again i took the twenty and creased it down the middle the man watched me do it he seemed less nervous but i could tell he still didnt like me or what was happening things hadnt gone the way they were supposed to go and it had thrown him do you know where our friend is i held the twenty up maybe he said and his voice sounded rough nathaniel leaned over my shoulder his voice was low and calm we want to find her before she does something shell regret she had a fight with her boyfriend theyll make up but not if she crosses too many lines do you understand me this will get you a lap dance a good one i have to do something for the money or hell know i told on him he wouldnt like that and hed make sure i didnt like it who i asked nathaniel was standing so close to me i felt him sigh ronnie is already in the back anita the back i asked wherever they go shes already back there shit take us to her i said dallas would kill me we dont get that many beautiful women in here we could just start asking where dallas is i said something close to real fear went through his eyes dont do that please i hate when i start feeling sorry for them whats your name owen nathaniel said he said his name was owen alright owen we dont want to get you hurt but if you keep us talking and something bad happens micah said give him another twenty then he can take us to the back i looked at him we can find her on our own and he can pretend that he took us to the back for business my look said it all he shrugged he wont get hurt and well all get what we need i wanted to argue but nathaniels hand had already appeared with another twenty in it i had a good night he said what did that mean a good night good tips or did nathaniel do lap dances when he wasnt on stage id never asked i hadnt wanted to know hell i still didnt want to know i took the twenty and folded it together with the first one take us to the back owen another dancer appeared in what i finally realized was the outfit loose shorts tshirt and socks this one had more meat on him and was cute in a boyish unfinished sort of way need another hand it was nathaniel who moved up hugging me from behind smiling suddenly weve got all the men we need dont we owen owen nodded and i watched his face remold itself so that when he turned to his coworker he was smiling and at ease he took the forty dollars from my hand and tucked it into the top of his white socks he made the movement strangely graceful and more feminine than it should have been as if in his mind he was tucking a hundred dollars into the tops of silk stockings it was a good moment and made me think better of him in the job hed chosen before that one movement id wondered what the hell he was doing here of course with guilty pleasures as my measuring rod everyone here looked too thin too fragile not muscular enough not anything enough i didnt manage a smile but i kept my face pleasant and unreadable yeah we have enough men we dont have women here the other dancer said there was something in his eyes something about the way he glanced at owen as if he didnt believe us we brought our own nathaniel said and moved up between owen and me so he could drape an arm around us both he was smiling his lavender eyes shown with eagerness it was an oscarworthy performance and the other dancer seemed to buy it he did glance back at micah whats he going to be doing watching silly owen said and began to guide us around the other man we threaded our way through the tables with micah trailing behind i swear i could feel the other dancers eyes on us as if he still didnt buy it or maybe he was jealous god alone knew because i didnt want to ronnie was so going to owe me for this one a dancer stepped out onto the bar as we passed it he was so not in shape not fragile sort of like a computer geek or accountant he had glasses and short hair that didnt flatter his face he was ordinary and so didnt look like anyone that should be stripping i wondered what he was doing here like this then he grabbed a set of bright chrome bars that were suspended above the bar and proceeded to roll his entire body up and through his own arms proving that he was every bit as doublejointed as nathaniel okay the audience screamed behind us and i couldnt help it i glanced in that direction the dancer was tall thin and a brunette and wearing only the white socks he grabbed the bar in the center of the stage and began to writhe around it i turned away fast and found that the dancer at the bar was nude now too i came almost facetoface with the other reason he was stripping here he was wellendowed i nearly tripped us all trying to get some room between us and the bar owen laughed a high girlish laugh and nathaniel joined it with a masculine chuckle micah followed silent and i waited to stop blushing they did total nudity across the river how could i have forgotten what i wanted to do was run screaming but instead i let owen maneuver us toward the blackdraped area across from the bar nathaniel was plastered between us still smiling still laughing if nathaniel could keep playing nice so could i i glanced back to check on micah and saw the dancer at the bar proving that it wasnt just his shoulders that could bend in amazing ways a woman was holding up money micah was staring straight ahead as if if he didnt look it would all just go away it wasnt just me that ronnie was going to owe owen parted the black drapes and in we went there was a small open area just inside the drapes a man was leaning against the far wall he straightened up as we came through the curtain he was wearing a muscle shirt exercise pants and white socks the clothes were slightly different but the socks gave it away he was another dancer there was more muscle under the shirt and he had a body closer to the kind i expected from a stripper need a hand he asked it was exactly what the other dancer had asked coincidence or code for something didnt know wasnt sure i cared no thanks we got it covered owen trilled he clung to nathaniels arm and nathaniel let him i tried to help i said sorry but i think im at my limit for men for the night after three dont they make you throw one back the new guy laughed shook his head and motioned us toward a hallway that seemed to stretch the length of the club owen moved us all down that narrow corridor there wasnt actually room for us to walk three abreast so nathaniel dropped ahead and kept his arm around owen owen must have taken that for a good sign because he was suddenly draped around nathaniel like some kind of tall thin fashion accessory micah caught up with me his arm sliding around my waist like i was his new security blanket i guess i couldnt blame him i wasnt exactly comfy myself there were small booths on either side with curtains that could be drawn in front of them though not everyone seemed to be bothering to pull curtains most of it was perfectly legal a private lap dance rules for a lap dance are the customer keeps their hands to themselves the dancer does the touching and even then there are rules about what kind of touching can be done funny how living with a stripper and dating someone who owned a strip club had made me pay attention to things i never thought id want or need to know but once you go in private its a negotiation between the dancer and customer i dont mean just sex jason had one woman who wanted to lick the back of his knees and was willing to pay fifty dollars for the privilege not my idea of fun but not sexual not legally or by most peoples standards at all i hadnt really thought how to find ronnie once we were back here most of the booths were closed i couldnt just start yelling her name without maybe getting owen in trouble with this dallas person shit but i didnt have to find ronnie i damn near tripped over her leg when it shot out from underneath a drape i thought i knew the leg but i was sure of the voice i fell down god im drunk a mans voice murmured and i think he was helping her to her feet i fought the urge to knock and said ronnie is that you though i knew it was sometimes you just have to say the stupid shit giggling was the only answer she offered i took a deep breath and pulled the drape aside ronnie was on her knees in the back of the booth there was a flash of pale breasts her shirt was up and there was no bra in sight a man was leaning over her breasts like he owned them the dancers are allowed to touch but not that much if the management found out hed be booted out or at least that was the theory ill wait down the hallway micah said i nodded yeah nathaniel took owen by the arm and said ill look after micah i was left alone with my friend and her friend ronnie giggled and drew him up for a kiss i dont think she realized that the curtain was open if shed been sober id have turned on my heel and left her to it shes over twentyone but she was drunk and depressed and confused and my friend so i moved a little into the booth close enough that she could see me over his shoulder she smiled up at me anita why are you here you called me to give you a ride home remember she frowned up at me as if to say no she didnt remember the man who was on his knees in front of her turned and looked up at me you want to join us i wont charge extra ill just bet you wont come on ronnie lets go home i dont want to go home not yet i just found dallas were having a private dance i see that i said but if youd planned on doing private dancing you shouldnt have called me i need to get to bed and so do you but isnt he cute she put her hands on either side of his face and turned him to face me again truthfully he was okay but the face wasnt the show he had the first body id seen since we got to the place that looked like a mans body and not that of a preadolescent boy he had broad shoulders nice waist hips muscles in his arms and legs that showed he lifted weights the tattoo on his arm was a marine tattoo what was an ex marine doing in a place like this yeah hes cute now lets go i reached for her arm dallas didnt touch me or try to keep her by force he was sneakier than that and smarter too he buried his face in her chest and nibbled gently on the edge of her breast ronnie threw her head back and made a noise that i never wanted to hear my friend make while i was in the same room micah called not quite a yell anita whats taking so long ronnie doesnt want to leave then lets go something in his voice made me want to see what was happening with him ill be right back dont do anything that you can get arrested for dallas gave me a look that said plainly he was going to try and do just the opposite but it was the best i could do unless i wanted to drag ronnie out of the booth by her hair i wanted to see why micahs voice sounded the way it did micah was very politely but firmly saying to an older gentleman thank you but no were waiting for a friend ill be your friend the man said he flashed a wad of bills about waist height so you wouldnt see it from farther into the club the bill that showed was a twenty leaving the implication that it was a roll of twenties micah shook his head the man peeled off two twenties no micah said i was almost up to them when the man peeled off two more twentieseighty bucksand held it up to micah no one else is going to offer you more tonight oh i dont know i said im throwing in room and board and sex with a girl i put my arm around micahs waist and he did the same to me the mans eyes flicked to me then back to micah then to me youre his friend i nodded you really were waiting for a friend the man said i did tell you that micah said the man frowned and started folding his money away i didnt think you meant this kind of friend he did i said and gave him the smile that was bright and cheerful and never reached my eyes i looked around for nathaniel and found that i could barely see him around the backs of a couple that had him backed into a corner he raised a hand so id be sure to see him or maybe he was asking for help like a drowning man i took micahs hand and brought him with me i think safety in numbers was our best bet excuse me boys and girls i said the couple turned and looked at me the man was tall and dark the girl was a little taller than me and blond she was wearing a halter dress that needed to be lined better her nipples were dark imprints against the pale fabric i carefully kept my gaze above her waist not even wanting to know if there were other dark imprints lower down i dont mean to give the idea that they were cheap looking they werent the girl was wearing a diamond in her engagement ring big enough to choke a puppy and her bracelets were gold and more diamonds her makeup was artful which meant she looked like she was wearing almost none but was actually wearing a lot the man was dressed in a suit that had been tailored to his body and had probably come from the same shop that micah and nathaniel got theirs from it had the look im sorry but we were talking to the gentleman first the man said i took in a lot of air through my nose and let it out slow the womans perfume was powdery and expensive actually i was talking to him first because i brought him here they gave each other surprised looks nathaniel started trying to ease past them sorry he said i did tell you i came with somebody when he was safely beside me and i was holding both micahs and nathaniels hands i figured we were safe from any more propositions silly me the woman went up on tiptoe and the man bent down so she could whisper i didnt care anymore i started trying to maneuver us back to ronnie the area was just a little narrow for three people to move easily wait the woman said i turned back because thats what you do when someone speaks to you all three of you with us she said i blinked at her the long blink that gave me time to process information when i just didnt believe what id just heard once upon a time id have asked her what she meant but id grown up since then and i knew the answer no i said and sort of pushed micah in front of me and pulled nathaniel behind we came to an abrupt halt because nathaniel stopped moving i knew what i was going to see before i turned back i was half right the man had grabbed nathaniels arm id thought it would be the woman again silly me i moved up beside nathaniel let go of him now and i put a lot of force in the now he dropped nathaniels arm my wife really likes your friend im happy for her but its not my problem dont touch him again dont touch any of us again is that clear youre here for the same thing we are he said lets go back to our place weve got a bathtub big enough for all of us he stepped a little closer to us i just know that youll look even better out of your clothes than you do in them i gave him the look the one that makes bad guys flinch at twenty paces and the weaker ones run for their mommies his wife was smarter than he was she pulled on his arm and said honey i dont think they want to play listen to your wife shes the smart one i thought that was a nice parting shot and we turned to go and again nathaniel stopped moving i turned back and found that the man had grabbed nathaniels braid that was it no more nice i brought my badge out and shoved it at his face he had to back up to look at the badge as if he should have been wearing glasses but wasnt but it made him let go of nathaniels hair he laughed ive got one at home if you want to play cops and robbers were into that i had the badge in my left hand so i had to use just my fingertips of the same hand to spread my jacket wide enough that i showed him the gun in its shoulder holster you got one of these i asked the woman was pulling at his arm dont honey i think shes for real he glared down at me who are you federal marshal anita blake asshole back it up and leave us alone the look on his face said clearly he didnt believe me maybe he was one of those men who just didnt believe women in authority or maybe he just wanted to see nathaniels hair spread all over his bed so badly that he didnt want to believe it id been willing to buy that it was his wife that liked nathaniel right up to the point where hed been the one that grabbed his arm touched his hair his wife might like nathaniel who wouldnt but it wasnt her who had a serious hardon about it i let my jacket fall back into place and used my body to sort of push nathaniel between micah and me no way was i leaving him at the end of the line by mr touchie i put the badge up and started moving us down the narrow hallway but i moved sort of backward so i could keep an eye on the couple alright on one half of the couple the wife was pulling at his arm trying to get him to move away he jerked away from her and just kept looking at me it was not a friendly look in fact there was enough heat in his eyes to cross that line to hate i hadnt done anything to make him hate me except tell him no there are men that see no as the ultimate insult but usually it takes more than a rejection during a bar pickup attempt to get this level of reaction i kept my attention on him until we were swallowed by one of the curtains that hid the deeper rooms that was just creepy i said i know him nathaniel said in a small voice i looked at him how he licked his lips and his eyes looked haunted when i was on the streets he used to pick up the older boys the ones that were almost too old for the trade too old i asked most of the men that came down there werent looking for men anita they wanted boys once you looked too grownup you had to move where you worked a different clientele he said the last with a bitter little twist of his mouth hes older now and he didnt recognize me but i remember him i remember one of the older boys warned me about him warned you nathaniel nodded yeah did he hurt them not yet but sometimes everyone gets a feeling about a customer he can ask for really standard stuff but after awhile everyone just gets creeped its like you can smell the sickness on them like you just know that its only a matter of time before they hurt someone i touched his face and he looked at me and his eyes held that sadness that hed come to me with that look that said hed seen it all done it all and it had destroyed something inside him i put my hands on either side of his face and kissed him gently it helped chase some of that lostness away but not all of it some of it clung around the edges micah made a sound anita shes your friend but i turned and found that dallas the dancer was on the floor with ronnie on top of him she was still dressed from the waist down but he wasnt her shirt was unbuttoned and if shed started the night with a bra it was gone now id had enough enough of strangers pawing my boyfriends enough of ronnie dragging our asses down here enough of her selfdestructive indulgence i got enough of that kind of shit from richard i didnt need it from her veronica marie simms i said she blinked up at the voice and the sound of all three of her names who are you my mother i grabbed the belt of her jeans and lifted her bodily off of the man it startled her and me because i didnt have to fight to lift her she was bigger than i was taller just bigger and i lifted her like she weighed nothing i got her stumbling to her feet dallas said hey we werent finished i showed him my badge yeah you were i kept the badge in my left hand and threw ronnie over my shoulder i had to bounce her once up in the air to get her settled better then we were fine i walked down the hallway nathaniel got the curtain and followed us micah brought up the rear she didnt struggle but she argued anita put me down the creepy couple was not waiting for us in the little area in front of the rooms i was glad i had my badge out but id have to throw ronnie on the floor to go for my gun i scanned the room as we entered it and the couple was nowhere in sight even better anita i am not a fucking child put me down the bouncer came our way and i flashed my badge at him he held his hands up as if to say no trouble here we kept walking for the door the music was still blaring loud enough that it hurt my skull but the people noise died down as they watched us pass i dont know if it was the badge the fact that a girl was carrying a girl the fact that ronnie was probably flashing breast to the entire room or everybody was mourning the fact that i was taking the two best looking men in the room with me whatever we walked in a strange well of stillness as everyone stopped dancing stopped talking stopped drinking stopped and watched us i had to use my badge hand to help steady ronnie as i went up the steps to the platform in front of the door but we made it just fine nathaniel went ahead and got the door that led into the cloakroom micah went through the door and hurried in front of me to get the outside door we went out into the cool autumn air the door shut behind us and the silence left my ears ringing put me the fuck down this time she struggled not well not like she could have but id lost patience she wanted down i put her down i dumped her on the gravel on her ass i think she might have yelled at me but a funny look crossed her face and she was suddenly scrambling to her feet and running stumbling toward the grassy field that edged the parking area she fell onto all fours and started to retch shit i said softly and with feeling i started walking toward her and the men came at my back i motioned them to stay by the last line of cars as i waded out into the grass to ronnie the dry autumn grass made that whishwhish sound against my jeans ronnie was still on all fours the sour sweet smell of vomit reached me before i reached her she had to be my friend because i went to her and i swept her hair back from her face and held it like you do a child only true friendship would have kept me there while she threw up everything shed drunk that night i was trying to think of something else anything else while i stood there im not good around people who are throwing up something about the sound of it and the smell of it leaves me fighting not to throw up too i looked out across the field trying to find something else to think about nothing was interesting enough until i looked almost straight out from where i was standing at first i thought it was a deadfall a tree but my eyes made more sense out of it and i realized it was a person a pale line of arm one hand pointing skyward as if it was propped on something i couldnt see it didnt have to be a dead body someone could have come out here and passed out i looked back at micah and nathaniel i motioned them over ronnie was starting to slow down shed reached the dry heaves at least stay with her i knew that by walking up to it i might be destroying evidence but i also knew that it could be a mannequin or someone passed out i had to be sure before i called in the cavalry what did it say about my life that i thoughtdead murder before anything else that id worked on homicides too long i walked through the dry grass and i was moving slower watching where i put my feet the grass didnt make a sound against my jeans because i was creeping along if there was a weapon anywhere i didnt want to step on it the more i saw of the body the more i thought dead the skin had that paleness in the distant halogen lights and the cold light of the stars it was a man lying on his back with that one arm propped up against a dead tree branch if the hand hadnt been propped up i might not have seen it so quickly like the girls hair at the first scene someone had taken a little extra effort to say hey look at me yeah it was a man instead of a woman but he was wearing a leopard skin thong that had been pulled aside so we wouldnt miss the fact that he was shaved very shaved the chances of him not being a stripper that worked at incubus dreams were almost nil vegas wouldnt take those odds the fang marks on his neck were black against his skin more at the bend of his arm his wrist i didnt touch him to move his head to see if he had matching marks on the other side of his neck i didnt move his legs and see if theyd marked him low i just squatted down beside him trying not to touch the ground any more than i had to and touched his arm yeah id like to say i was searching for a pulse but that wasnt really it he was cold to the touch but his arm moved when i pressed oh so gently rigor had either not set in or it had come and gone different things can affect that but i was betting that hed died earlier tonight that theyd been killing him while we questioned jonah cooper at the church of eternal life looking at the dead man boy almost he looked so young i didnt feel so bad about killing cooper funny i stood up and fished in my jacket pocket for my cell phone i dialed a number i knew by heart zerbrowski here i hope youre not at home i said why and he sounded positively suspicious because im over the river and through the strip clubs looking at another damn body no one notified us im notifying you are you telling me that you found the body he asked yep tell me what happened i told him a short version i didnt leave out that the bartender had told ronnie to get a ride home just that she was shitfaced about breaking up with louie i left out the creepy couple but that was it shit he said ive got to call this in the staties or the local sheriff are going to get there before we do the sheriff didnt like you much i remember i said i could almost feel him thinking on his end of the phone id almost say send your people home but well need them to corroborate your story you dont believe me i do but i wont be first on the scene anita do you understand i think so im going to need an alibi to explain how i just happened to find the next murder victim when theyve got people patrolling all the clubs theyre going to think that someone tipped me to it yeah he said you believe me zerbrowski yeah but i know you if any woman could go out to a strip club trolling for guys and accidentally find a murder victim its you i was not trolling for guys i said oh yeah ill be sure and tell all the guys here at rpit that you were just doing a favor for a friend you bastard dont tease me about this would i do that fuck you zerbrowski id say yes but what would katie say his voice got serious all of a sudden ill put the call in tell them that one of our people is on the scene but if the sheriff gets there first be nice im always nice i said he laughed yeah and hell is cool in the summertime just try to behave until we can get there to back you up ill behave if he does i said great ill be there as soon as i can anita i know you will long damn night he said yeah i said he hung up i hung up and started walking i heard sirens before ieven made it back to the parking area i had time to give nathaniel and micah a thumbnail sketch of what had happened and what was about to happen ronnie was sitting on the ground moaning and holding her head im not sure she would have heard me even if id tried to talk to her then cars squealed into the gravel parking lot and in the lead car was sheriff melvin christopher there wasnt a state cop in sight perfect the emts emergency medical techs had given ronnie a blanket they seemed to think she was suffering from shock that wasnt it she was sobering up sobering up in the middle of a murder investigation when shed drunk more in one night than shed consumed in the entire six years id known her they had her sitting in the open back of their ambulance i think partly it gave them something to do its good to keep busy physically ronnie felt the worst but none of us were having a good time sheriff melvin christophers opening shot to me had been almost didnt recognize you with more clothes on miss blake i smiled sweetly and said thats marshal blake to you sheriff and you are awfully interested in womens clothing for a heterosexual man in a rural area it had gone downhill from there i even admit that part of it was my fault i shouldnt have made the comment about womens clothing or questioned his sexual orientation but hey his face got all the way to this awful maroon color before he started yelling at me for a second i thought id given him a stroke or something deputy douglas had to separate us and take his boss for a little walk around the parking lot it gave me time to go check on micah and nathaniel micah was saying calmly patiently but in a tone that said it wasnt the first time hed said it or the second i do not work at this club the deputy who was questioning him was too tall for his body as if his joints and hands and feet hadnt had a chance to catch up yet he was either well under twentyfive or needed to eat more what club do you work at then micah looked at me the look said help me i tried deputy i said he looked at me his eyes flicked to the badge in my hand but since his boss hadnt been too impressed with the badge it was hard for him to be impressed either the boss sets the tone he had pale bluish eyes they werent friendly almost mean im questioning a witness here i smiled and tried to push it all the way up into my eyes but probably didnt manage it i see that but deputy and i read his name tag patterson the witness has answered your question several times he wont tell me where he works you never asked where i worked micah said deputy patterson looked back at him pale eyes narrowed in what he probably thought was a hard look it wasnt i did ask where you worked and you wont answer you asked what club i work for i do not work at a club of any kind i do not strip for a living is that clear enough micah asked his voice had an edge of impatience he was one of the most easygoing people i knew what had patterson been saying to put that tone in micahs voice pattersons face showed that he didnt believe it he was really going to have to work on the blank cop face right now everything he thought spilled across his face then what were you doing inside this place a look of near evil joy crossed his face oh i get it you like to look at other peoples beans and wienies beans and wienies i said what the fuck does that mean dick and balls he said with a tone that implied everyone knew that micah looked at me and even through the dark glasses i could picture the look i was beginning to see what had gotten on his nerves patterson i allowed you to question my friends out of courtesy this is my crime scene not yours and if you cant ask a single question that could help us solve this crime then you need to go somewhere else i dont know what he would have said but i felt sheriff christopher coming up behind me even before i saw the look of satisfaction on the deputys face his look said clearly that the sheriff would sort me out and hed enjoy a ringside seat patterson said he wont tell me where he works sheriff says hes not a stripper says he just came to watch a little fag wag i made a small sound in my throat im going to say this just one more time we got a call from my friend veronica simms that the bartender at this club told her she was too drunk to drive and she needed a ride home micah came along so that he could help me with her and what about the other one patterson asked he says hes a stripper at guilty pleasures nathaniel came along to keep us company i said sheriff christopher gave me a flat cop look it was a real look he might be a prejudiced womanhating good ol boy but he was a cop too underneath all the crap was someone who could be good at the job when his personal agenda wasnt getting in the way it made me feel better that look but of course his personal agenda was raining all over us whyd you need two friends and he stressed the friends to help pick up one drunk girlfriend nathaniel had just gotten off work and we hadnt gotten to talk so he came along so we could visit sheriff christopher frowned at me you said you were home i was i thought this one was your boyfriend he pointed at micah he is so whats that one he asked pointing a thumb in nathaniels direction nathaniel was talking to the last deputy he seemed to be having an easier time of it than micah or me maybe his deputy was smarter or just less prejudiced my boyfriend i said theyre both your boyfriends i took in air let it out slow yes well my my he said i said a small prayer that zerbrowski would get here soon weve got another victim sheriff or dont you care yeah thats another thing he said and he put those hard cop eyes on me if he thought it was going to make me flinch he was wrong but it was still a good look you just accidentally found our serial killers next vic yes i said bullshit bullfuckingshit believe what you want sheriff ive told you and your people the absolute truth i could make stuff up if it would make you happier he looked past me to micah i like to see a mans eyes when i talk to him take off the glasses shit micah looked at me and i looked at him i shrugged patterson has never actually asked what micah does for a living hes been too busy trying to get micah to admit that hes a stripper or a homosexual to worry much about the facts fine im askin what do you do for a living mr callahan i am the coordinator for the coalition for better understanding between lycanthrope and human communities youre the what patterson said shut up patterson christopher said so youre one of the bleeding heart liberals that think the animals deserve equal rights something like that sheriff christopher was giving micah all his attention suddenly take off the glasses mr coordinator micah took off the glasses patterson backed up and his hand actually touched his gun butt not good the sheriff just stared into micahs kittycat eyes and shook his head bestiality and coffinbait that is pretty damn low for a white woman and the white woman comment took care of any worries i might have had about what other prejudices the sheriff happened to be carrying around he was an equal opportunity bigot he hated everybody that wasnt male and white and straight what a terribly stark and empty worldview my mother was hispanic from mexico does that help half spic he said i smiled and it went all the way to my eyes perfect i said just perfect you look awfully happy for someone whos about to have a really bad night and how is this night supposed to get any worse sheriff you knew the body would be here because your boyfriend and his people did it thats how you found it and why did i bring my boyfriends and how did i arrange for my friend to be here getting drunk you were going to move the body hide it thats why you needed this many people theres something about this one that will lead to your fag vampire friends i wondered how jeanclaude and asher would like being referred to as my fag vampire friends better not to know i shook my head how many lawsuits do you have against your department none he said i laughed but it wasnt a happy laugh i find that hard to believe i get the job done and thats all people care about it wasnt my business but i had to wonder how many of his arrests were people not white not straight not like him i would have bet almost any amount of money most of his arrests fell into those categories i hoped i was wrong but i doubted i was you know the line that if all you have is a hammer all your problems begin to look like nails he frowned at me not sure where i was going yeah i like mr ayoobs writings yeah so do i but my point is this if all youre looking at is the monsters then thats all youre going to see he frowned harder i dont follow why was i even trying youre so busy hating me and everyone with me that youve done almost no real police work or dont you care about this one is that it sheriff is this just some little fag stripper that got himself killed so its not as important as the white women earlier something flinched through his eyes if i hadnt been staring right at him id have missed it you must really hate this club his eyes were cool and unreadable when he said my experience has been that what goes around comes around marshal you engage in highrisk behavior and it catches up with you and paybacks a bitch i shook my head no one so blind as those that will not see what he said nothing sheriff just wasting my breath the radios on the black and whites crackled to life and what we heard was enough to stop the squabbling officer down officer down location was just down the road at the first strip bar that the vampires hit ambitious bastards i yelled to micah and nathaniel take ronnies car and go home i was already opening the jeeps drivers side door anita micah started i love you i said and i slid behind the wheel i backed up and had to wait for one of the other police cars to get out of my way nathaniel was still leaning against the car where the deputy had questioned him i hit the button for my drivers side window i blew him a kiss he smiled and blew one back then i was in line between two of the black and whites and we were gone officer down was it the vampires or had some drunk gotten lucky no way to know until we got there the only bright spot was that i wouldnt be alone with just the sheriff and his men for long police would come from all over for this one officers that wouldnt normally have any business or jurisdiction here would be driving up within minutes the ambulance was behind us with its lights and sirens going they could have been simply following the polices lead but i took it for a good sign emts only do the full cherry when they know theres someone hurt but still alive i said a quick prayer and concentrated on driving the sheriff was a bigoted asshole but he knew the roads and i didnt heres hoping i didnt end up in a ditch we were the first officers on the scene because wed been less than ten minutes away the sound of sirens wailed off into the night more help coming there was an illinois state trooper car standing in the parking lot with one door open and the officer slumped sitting by the door his face was just a white blur one arm looked injured and his gun was clasped awkwardly in his other hand there was blood on the shoulder of his uniform the black and whites hit their doors and they took cover behind the doors or the engine block while they looked around no one just ran straight at the injured trooper we all took cover we all had our weapons out we all assessed the situation before we ran in you never know about bad guys sometimes they use bait i hugged the front of my jeep with my back gun out pointed skyward i had the engine block at my back so no matter what the bad guys were using i was okay as long as i was on the right side of the jeep there were so many things to think about and no time to think deep you had to let training and experience do some of the thinking for you the sheriff did something with his arm and suddenly all the sirens cut off the silence was suddenly loud just the strobing of the lights to let people know something was wrong we were all scanning the parking lot and the surrounding area there was a privacy fence behind the dumpsters there were other buildings within a few yards the parking lot was packed the bad guy could be hiding behind any of the cars or they could have fled when they heard the sirens no way to be sure nothing moved except the trooper who blinked at us he was alive and i wanted him to stay that way we had to move up as if sheriff christopher had read my mind he moved up he kept low which with his stomach and his height was impressive a lot more limber than he looked i pointed my gun not at anything in particular but in the directions i could cover that might potentially have someone hiding who wanted to shoot at the sheriff a white plastic bag rolled near the dumpster pushed by the wind nothing else moved sheriff christopher gave the all clear his men all stood up broke cover and converged on him i was more cautious scanning the area as i moved to join them my gun pointed at the ground but held twohanded ready to go back up there was a crowd starting at the door to the club until i stood up i couldnt see the doors over the hood of my jeep but i was betting the crowd had been there all along people have no sense or they knew something we didnt naw i heard get the emts up here patterson trotted off to let the medics know it was safe to come up sheriff christopher glared up at me it was one of your vampire friends looks like a knife wound to me how do you know it was a vampire the trooper spoke in a voice that was strained low with pain and shock bastards flew off with her flew up like fucking birds straight up okay alright vampires who did they take one of the dancers the trooper said i was making a drivethrough like were supposed to saw her come out and saw them just come out of the shadows one on either side of her she started screaming i got out pulled my gun but there was another one i didnt see him i dont know why but it was like he just appeared behind me he put the knife to my throat told me to watch then the others just flew away with the girl they fucking flew away he closed his eyes and looked like he was struggling with the pain the emts were there pushing us all back the trooper opened his eyes and he looked at the sheriff he had the knife at my throat why didnt he kill me he switched the blade drove it into my shoulder why why didnt he kill me i answered while the medics went to work on him he wanted you alive so you could tell us what you saw why he asked and he looked at me its a message what message i shook my head they want us to come and save her they want to force us to move tonight while theyre strong not wait until dawn when the advantage is ours sheriff christopher stood up and reached out for me but seemed to think better of it and just motioned for me to follow him i followed him last i knew we didnt know where these bastards are hiding you sound like you know i blinked up at him and thought what can i tell him that wont get us all in trouble ive got a date with mobile reserve for just after dawn but if theyve got a hostage we cant wait until dawn i dug my cell phone out of my jacket pocket and dialed zerbrowskis cell give me captain parkers number zerbrowski why the vamps took a stripper alive they even made sure we had a wounded but living state trooper to tell us about it jesus anita its a trap probably but give me the number anyway he gave me the number and i punched it in captain parker came on the line with sheriff christopher watching me i gave parker the rundown is it a trap he asked maybe or maybe they know were coming and theyre just trying to rush us so we will come in at night when theyve got the upper hand but yeah its probably a trap i dont want to send my men in to die blake im not wild about it either but she was alive when they took her and if we wait for dawn she wont be of course she may already be dead i dont know its a trap and the woman is bait parker said i know i said you still demanding to go in with us wouldnt miss it for the world he gave a small dry chuckle you argued your way into this operation i hope you dont regret that i regret it now but if youre really going in at night then youre going to need me more than ever are you really that much better with vamps than we are yes captain yes i am i hope youre as good as advertised marshal blake better i said then get over here were going to hit the target in less than thirty minutes if youre late we go without you he hung up i cursed as i folded the phone shut i started walking for my jeep where the hell are you going to take the bait i said he frowned the stripper i nodded and was still walking with him dogging me mobile reserve is really taking you in with them if you dont believe me call captain parker yourself i was at the door to the jeep he caught the door edge before i could close it isnt this a conflict of interest for you shooting up your boyfriends vampires these are bad guys sheriff they dont belong to anybody i shut the door and he let me i didnt exactly peel out but close i knew parker and i knew how mobile reserve operated if i didnt make the time schedule they would leave without me the vampires wanted us to go in tonight they knew we had the address they knew we were planning on hitting them they assumed that we meant to hit them after sunrise and they were forcing our hand they wanted us in there on their terms that meant tonight but why not run if they knew we had their location why not just vacate it why not just run and find another daytime retreat why take a hostage and go to such elaborate lengths to make sure we knew about it it was a trap but even knowing thats what it was we still had to go the dry erase board was covered with diagrams sergeants hudson and melbourne had done a recon of the area before the rest of us got set up in our nice safe blockaway location theyd covered the whiteboard with entries and exits lights windows and all the minutiae that i would never have noticed or rather id have seen it but i wouldnt have been able to make use of it i could have reported what id seen but one of them would have had to interpret it for everybody else i simply hadnt had the training my way of doing it would have been to do a front entry and kill everything that moved it wouldnt have occurred to me to get a diagram of the condos interior or have the landlord of the building there tell us what he knew of the woman who owned the apartment theyd already evacuated the condos adjoining ours and they had the nearest neighbor again give us information about the interior and the owner it was useful to know that there was almost no furniture in the condo because the owner jill conroy was waiting for a shipment that had been delayed twice that she worked as a lawyer in a large downtown firm and had just made partner fascinating but i didnt see that it was useful they were still trying to find someone who would answer the phone at her job to find out when she was last at work no one at work at nearly two in the morning fucking slackers it was all interesting but our victim was in there alone with vampires who had murdered at least ten people in three states i wanted to get her out and i was having trouble concentrating on the trivia it must have shown because sergeant hudson said we boring you blake i blinked up at him from where id finally curled up on the street i was tired and didnt see a reason not to sit down some of the mobile reserve guys were kneeling a little i said the two men closest to me killian of the white buzz cut and jung who was the only greeneyed asian american id ever met both moved away from me as if they didnt want to be too close when the blood started to fly i noticed that melbourne stayed where he was next to hudson as if he expected the blood flow to be onesided theres the street blake start walking you asked the question sergeant if you didnt want an honest answer you should have warned me someone laughed low enough that i wasnt sure whod done it and neither apparently was hudson because he didnt try to find out whod laughed he just used it as an excuse to be more pissed at me hudson took a step toward me i stood up if were boring you blake then go home we dont need your attitude we got enough of our own his voice was low and even and every word was very carefully enunciated i knew that ohsocareful tone it was the voice you used instead of screaming or hitting something dawn morgan may still be alive in there i said but every minute we wait cuts her chances of survival you can hate that your captain let me come you can fucking hate me i dont care but lets get this done id like to get to dawn before its too late sergeant hudson just once id like not to be the cleanup crew and be there early enough to have something left to rescue he blinked solid brown eyes at me that matched the mustache and closecropped hair my own hair was back in a ponytail they had handed me a helmet and hair nearly to your waist just didnt fit in helmets without being pulled back in some fashion id have cut my hair months ago but micah said if i cut mine hed cut his the threat had left me with the longest hair of my life i looked like a short curvy hippie among the militaryesque haircuts and very masculine figures around me even stuffing me into one of their vests couldnt hide that i so didnt match everyone else there are moments when i suddenly feel awkward again not a cop not a man not part of this great brotherhood just a girl just a voodoo dabbler who no one trusts at their back it had been years since id felt this bad about it maybe it was the borrowed equipment which didnt really fit or maybe it was arnet and dolph being mad at me or maybe it was just that i believed what was in hudsons eyes i didnt belong here i wasnt a tactical anything i didnt know how they did business i wasnt part of their team and part of me understood that no matter how many friends i had that were cops and no matter that i had a badge that there would always be more cops that thought i didnt belong than ones who did i would always and forever be the outsider no matter what i did part of it was gender part of it was my day job part of it was fucking the monsters and part of it was just simply that i didnt belong i didnt follow orders or keep my mouth shut or play the political game i would have never survived as a real policeperson i just couldnt play the game by anyone elses rules police real police understand and live by the rules i spent most of my life going rules what rules i stood there and looked at hudson held his gaze his anger and i just wasnt angry too much of me agreed with his anger for me to get angry back a badge doesnt make you a cop blake you have no discipline if you get any of my people killed because you were hotdogging it you will not like the next talk we have i wasnt really enjoying this talk very much but i didnt say that out loud either i was getting smarter or more tired or maybe i just didnt care enough anymore who the hell knew i stood my ground and i felt nothing my voice was empty of all the emotion his was carrying when i said what if you get your people killed because you didnt let me do my job to the best of my ability do i get to have a talk with you then all the men around me just moved back in unison as if minimum safe distance was suddenly a real concern he spoke through his teeth and the anger turned his brown eyes nearly black and what exactly is your job blake im a vampire hunter he came toward me slowly and melbourne actually touched his shoulder as if it was getting out of hand hudson just looked at the hand and the hand went away everyone was treating hudson like he was a very scary guy he wasnt the biggest or the most muscled or anything but he wore his authority like some sort of invisible coat it was just there if he hadnt hated me id have respected it but he made it impossible for me to see him as anything but an obstacle he spoke from inches in front of me each word pushed into my face careful as a blow youareafuckingassassin i looked up into his face almost close enough to kiss and said yeah sometimes sometimes i am he blinked at me puzzlement filling his eyes chasing back the anger that was an insult blake i try never to get insulted by the truth sergeant i gave him mild eyes and willed myself to feel nothing because if i let myself feel anything i was going to be sad and if i teared up or worse cried that would be it they wouldnt let me play not if i cried id cried because jessica arnet thought i was corrupting nathaniel id cried because of having to kill jonah cooper what the fuck was wrong with me tonight usually the only thing that made me cry was richard he shook his head you will just slow us down blake im immune to vampire powers i said we will clear this entire structure in less than a minute we know not to make eye contact and we are cleared to treat all approaching vampires inside as hostiles there wont be time for them to do any tricks on us i nodded as if i really understood how they could possibly clear an entire condo the size of a small house in less than a minute fine you dont think you need me to help with the vampires fine he blinked again and he couldnt hide the fact that id caught him off guard a second time in almost as many minutes youll wait outside what happens to your speed record if you have to treat the vampires like human beings i asked theyre legal citizens that makes them human beings yeah but can you clear the place in less than a minute if you have to take the time to subdue maybe upwards of seven vampires at least one a master if you think ill slow you down hudson trust me theyll slow you down a lot more than i will melbourne spoke over hudsons shoulder weve been greenlighted everything vampire in there is target i shook my head and looked at melbourne as if hudson wasnt still looming over me when warrants of execution first came into existence one of the main concerns was that they would turn the police of this country into nothing more than fucking assassins so the warrants are worded very carefully if the legal executioner is with you and we are in danger then you may use any and all means to execute this warrant but if the legal executioner is not with you then the warrant is not in effect i turned back to look at hudson and i was beginning to get a little angry at last good that was better than tears which means if you go in without me and shoot any damn body that youll be up on review or leave or some motherfucking shit hesitate against vampires and you risk your life and the lives of your men dont hesitate against the vampires and you may lose your job your pension or even see jail time depends on the judge the lawyer the political climate of the city at the time of the incident i was almost smiling because i was telling the absolute truth hudson gave a smile that was more snarl than anything or we can just sit this one out and let you take the order of execution all on your own little shoulders howd that be you go in by yourself i laughed and it surprised him again made him back up killian i said turning to look for him he came up to me sort of hesitating glancing at his sergeant killian was only an inch or two taller than me it was one of the main reasons that his extra gear had nearly fit me help me out of this i dont want to mess up your gear thanks for the loan why are you taking off the gear hudson asked if i go in without you i dont need the vest or the helmet or the damn radio thats attached to it i go in alone like normal i get to take the equipment i want to take not that im ordered to take i started looking at the straps help me out here killian you helped me get into it hudson shook his head and killian backed up ms blake thats marshal blake to you sergeant hudson he took in a deep breath and let it out slow marshal blake we cant let you go in there alone this is my damn warrant not yours i shared my information with you guys not the other way around none of you would have even known where to look for this woman without me do you know what theyre saying you did to get this information marshal just the way he said it i knew i didnt want to know but i said no what that you fucked the suspect fucked him in front of other officers and he told you everything then you blew his brains out with a gun defuckingcapitated him you shot him so many times i laughed again jesus id love to know who made that one up youre saying its a lie that i fucked him yeah wishful thinking on someones part but i did vamp it out of him as in vampire not whore and yeah i did shoot him until his head wasnt there anymore because i didnt have my vampire hunting kit with me the handgun was all i had so its what i used i shook my head and felt that faint anger fade away this warrant is my damn party sergeant hudson i invited you to the dance not the other way around i would like you to try and remember that when were dealing with each other he looked at me really looked at me i dont think hed seen me until that moment id been some woman some zombie queen slut forced on him by the upper brass id been a civilian with a badge but i hadnt been real to him not a person now he looked at me and he saw me and i watched that unreasoning anger fade you really would go in there alone wouldnt you i sighed and shook my head im a vampire executioner sergeant im usually alone just me and the bad guys he gave a small smile barely more than a flex of his mustache not tonight marshal tonight you go in with us i smiled at him it was a good smile not flirting though some men take it that way just a good open honest happy to have you smile he smiled back he couldnt seem to help it good great i said but can we move it along were burning moonlight he gave me a look like he wasnt sure how to take me then he laughed the moment he laughed all the other men relaxed i could feel it like a sort of psychic sigh of relief you are a pushy damn woman yes i said yes i am he gave a smaller laugh youll follow orders once were inside yes i sighed ill try he shook his head if i just say yes itll be a lie but i will do my utmost to do what im told i promise thats the best im going to get isnt it i nodded yep unless you want me to lie to you no truth from a federal agent is downright refreshing well then i am just going to be a breath of fresh air he looked at me shook his head and started back toward the dry erase board now that i do believe marshal that i do believe they went back to their briefing and i went back to counting the minutes and wondering if there was going to be anything alive in the condo by the time we hit the door at my suggestion they put the sniper where he could see the windows not at the front door one we didnt know what they looked like so the sniper couldnt just drop the people coming out the front there might be lawabiding vampire citizens in the building so the sniper couldnt even just shoot vampires if he could tell for dead certain they were vamps even i wouldnt want to say yes or no on the vamp question through a scope i mean what if youre wrong high silver content there would be no apology but anyone that flew out of the windows of our condo they would be bad guys and the sniper could drop them with impunity greenlight city the rest of us were huddled around the van in the movies the van is sleek and roomy in real life its narrow cluttered and looks like a cross between a plumbers van and the good humor truck if it sold guns instead of ice cream there wasnt room for us and the guns hell as empty as it got most of us wouldnt have fit it was an equipment van not a transport vehicle i was still in the vest even though id pointed out that nothing we were about to go up against would be shooting at us and vests were useless for stabbing or tearing id run into this before with both military and law enforcement they just couldnt wrap their heads around the fact that the body armor their best defense didnt help against someone that could crush steel it was like going up against superman and thinking kevlar would keep you safe finally sergeant melbourne said what few special tactical units will ever admit out loud were using bullets bullets can ricochet and wed just feel better if we knew you were safe from friendly fire the microphone was integral to the vest and attached to a little earpiece like the secret service wear they showed me the button for the mike in the center of the vest near your gun when you were holding it they made sure the mike worked someone patted me on top of my helmet and i was good to go or as good as it was going to get not going in would have been the good thing but the vamps had kidnapped that option away from us the woman theyd taken was dawn morgan twentytwo and had only worked at the club about three weeks they had a picture of her up on their web site and wed all seen it it was a publicity shot for a stripper bar so we tried to look at her face brown hair about shoulder length and enough makeup that it was hard to really see her face she was all blue eyes and red pouting lips i didnt ask if the men had a harder time looking at her face than i did she was covered by hands and a few wellplaced pieces of cloth but the illusion was that more skin was showing than really was distracting and meant to be im sure if ms morgan had been told shed be kidnapped by murderous vampires shed have left us a nice less glamorous face shot but you just dont plan for these kinds of things we memorized the face of the hostage so we wouldnt accidentally shoot her during the action yeah that would be bad i think that if i hadnt had my own dangerous toys to play with they would have taken me in unarmed most of the tactical team seemed to think i was a civilian and treated me that way they werent rude just didnt like the idea of me having a loaded gun at their backs i guess i couldnt blame them i hadnt had their training theyd never seen me use a gun theyd never seen me do this kind of work they seemed to consider me almost more dangerous than the vampires my biggest problem with the vest was that it made it impossible for me to carry the browning and the firestar in their current holsters and have any hope of drawing them officer derry had thrown me a thigh holster with velcro straps itll hold the browning and an extra clip derry looked as irish as his name except for his coloring which was dark i had to take the vest off to thread the upper part of the thigh holster through my belt then the other straps went around my leg the thigh holster wasnt bad actually though i wouldnt have wanted to try it unless i had pants on to protect my thighs my thighs rub together when i walk thank you very much but with jeans it wasnt bad it was a different draw though not just the angle or where the gun was but the actual hand movement was different i wouldnt be as quick because id have to think about it of course for tonights work the handguns were secondary i had a new mossberg a bantam thirteeninch lengthofpull lighter weight overall it meant more recoil but once you adjusted for it it was the shotgun of my dreams no more heavy barrel out there hanging while you tried to aim leaving me feeling top heavy i had a sawedoff that had started life as an ithica but now was just used for inclose vampire blasting the ithica had a strap fitted for it so that it fitted across my body sort of like an awkward purse to keep it from moving around until i wanted it for infighting edward my friend and the only person id ever seen use a flamethrower had helped me rig velcro to the thigh holster on my left thigh that thigh holster was mine but it was for extra ammo not for holding guns the velcro strap fit over the ithicas shortened barrel so that it was held tight against my leg but not at an angle where if something went terribly wrong id shoot my kneecap off one quick hard pull and the sawedoff would be in my hands and it would be time to be very very close with the vamps the mossberg had an urban ops sling from us tactical supply it had become my preferred sling for the bigger guns unfortunately you couldnt carry two guns on two different urban slings because the sling was designed for switching hands ease of movement which meant the gun would move around more edward who was truly the assassin hudson had accused me of being wasnt as fond of the urban sling as i was but then he didnt do as much close in undercover work with the monsters most of the time he went in like a oneman demolition team the sling also worked better if you had a heavier jacket over the sling to keep it from sliding off your shoulder if id had broader shoulders it would have stayed put better and since most of the people who test this stuff are male and thus have broader shoulders i couldnt really complain much it was still a sweet piece of equipment i had a stock mag attached to the butt of the mossberg id started carrying extra ammo in a thigh holder but the browning was on that thigh id found that if i wore the extra ammo on my left thigh it was harder to get to it cost me a second or three if i couldnt have my right thigh for it then the stock mag was the next best thing i went ahead and put extra ammo in the left thigh holder you know that old saying id rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it that applied to ammo better than anything else i knew derry said thats almost the exact same thigh holder as i gave you for your browning if you had it already you didnt need to borrow ours i have two set up for ammo i dont have one for handguns if its comfortable i might get one so glad mobile reserve could help you try out some new toys he smiled at me i smiled back he gives you a lousy holster and you flirt with him i loan you my whole second rig and nothing killian said that wasnt flirting killian when i flirt youll know it ooh derry said hudson came up in full gear you going to keep distracting my men marshal or are you ready to execute that warrant of yours im through distracting if youre through planning im through he said then me too lets go kill some vampires not hunt just kill he asked hunting vampires isnt a catchandrelease sport sergeant he laughed a short surprised sound either youre getting funnier or its fucking late its fucking late i said there are dozens of people wholl say that im not funny at all i made him laugh again and when youre about to risk your life together there are worse ways to begin it was one of those buildings downtown that had been rehabbed until outside it was an architectural wonder that had been saved from demolition but inside it was ultramodern ultrasleek with carpet and almost empty halls as if once they agreed on the twotone paint job they couldnt agree on anything else the building still had vacancies but was mostly full good news for the investors but bad news for us if the building had been mostly empty the chances of having collateral damage would have been less collateral damage isnt that a nice phrase it was why theyd had to evacuate so many people there was no way the vamps didnt know something was up we were outside the condo it still belonged to jill conroy it felt like wed learned that hours ago but actually only about an hour had passed from the first recon to us being here in the hallway wed finally gotten a number for one of her fellow lawyers jill had been awol from her job for five days three of those days shed called in sick but the fourth day she hadnt answered the phone hmm three days home sick then no answer i was betting that jill conroy had become the undead the evil wicked undead not a member of the church of eternal life and i knew not jeanclaudes people the fact that we had a third player in town and neither of the other sides had figured it out was bad it showed either the master of these guys was very powerful or wed become careless i would have liked to have pushed my power through their walls and checked out how many were in there i was capable of doing that now but if they were as good as i feared theyd sense it i feared theyd try more vampire tricks if they knew i or someone with my skills was with the cops if they thought it was just cops they might rely on speed and strength if they did my money was on us so i had to go in blind again shit id done a lot of vampire lairs in my day but never with mobile reserve or any police tactical unit in some ways it was very different and in some ways it was very the same difference one i wasnt in front hudson was the guy in charge once we hit the building hed been in charge before as far as i was concerned but hed had to answer to his chain of command incident commander negotiation commander tactical commander but none of them was going in with us and it was all about who was willing to pick up a gun and put their shoulder next to yours hudson went third in the line order though it wasnt going to be a true single line you will move when i move blake you are my fucking shadow until i tell you different you will follow my direct orders once were inside or i will cuff you and leave you with a guard is that clear crystal i said i think he liked me as a person but we were about to do his job the job wasnt personal and professionally he didnt know me at all no amount of charm could offset that he didnt really trust me at his back i hadnt earned it yet they brought up a huge metal body shield with a little window in it officer baldwin carried the shield he wasnt the bulkiest of the men that was derry but baldwin had height and since everyone was going to be crouching behind the shield height counted like tall people trying to crouch under a short persons umbrella i expected them to use one of those big metal rams but they didnt ms conroy had paid extra for a solid metal door with a lock that made it true security all that looking at specs of the building and interviewing people had paid off they put a small explosive charge on the lock and blew it the flash bang grenade went first then in we went in the wake of the stunning noise and blinding light when the searing light faded the only light came from the sweeps of the mens flashlights mounted to their guns then it was chaos not the chaos of a fight because no one was in the first room but the chaos of trying to shuffle behind the shield and not trip or trip someone else they shuffled as a unit but it was so quick like running inside a shell of bodies while youre doing what amounts to dancing or gymnastics as a unit youre also searching the dark keeping track of the gun in your hand and looking for something to shoot at thanks to the briefing i knew the layout of this condo almost better than my own house the big empty living room the small enclosed kitchen the hallway beyond with the guest bathroom left and the guest room right it was a straightforward layout thank god hudson spoke in the mike in my ear a whisper even with me standing right behind him with my hand touching his back mendez derry kitchen they peeled off wordlessly the back of our little conga line lighter jung moved up and i felt his hand against my back nice to know i wasnt the only one who needed a steadying hand radio in my ear vic female not morgan i think it was derry vamp bites yes blake check it out i stumbled made jung stumble we were like dominoes i remembered to press my button what check out the body i could have argued but there was no time i knew he was doing it to get rid of me maybe i really had slowed them down but he was definitely getting me out of the way before the main shit hit the fan i peeled off like they had shown me and went for the kitchen i followed his order even though i didnt agree i went to check out the body because the sergeant had told me to damn it i doubletimed it to the kitchen because if i hurried i might still get to trail in for the main fight light shown through the louvered door of the kitchen i smelled the blood before i touched the door light washed over me then dimmed as my eyes adjusted derry was heading for the door as i was coming in hudsons voice sounding strained but clear hit the radio stay with blake until shes checked the body radio silence derrys shoulders slumped saying he was disappointed but he didnt argue derry just moved up with me rifle still at the ready i went with him though i pointed my shotgun a little to one side the room wasnt that wide and i just wasnt sure there was enough room for all of us pointing guns in without risking crossing someones body one of my goals tonight was not to do that i knew some of what wed find because i could smell it not just the blood old blood but that meaty fluid smell and a stale whiff of sex male sex it helped me steel myself for what i was about to see she lay spreadeagle on the small fourseater table her legs had folded over the edge of the table and her groin was splayed in a line for the door so the view was painfully clear shed been raped and for that much damage probably not just with someones body or at least not just with a penis i was glad when i could look away she was wearing what looked like a silver sequined bikini but she had pantyhose on under it though i might not have realized that if the clothes on her lower body hadnt been ripped away the pantyhose told me she was a stripper from this side of the river the laws on the books in st louis for strippers are odd jeanclaudes club gets around it on a grandfather clause because as a vampire he was here before the laws went into effect but anyone else had to abide by the rules one of the rules was that the girls had to wear pantyhose not just hose under their outfits the rules were designed by people who wanted to make sure that st louis could not have those kinds of clubs theres no one so selfrighteous as someone policing someone elses morality her head was back so that her eyes were staring at the far wall of the small but expensivelooking kitchen her hair was brown and must have been at least to her waist id become pretty good at judging hair length when people were lying down the hair was real not a wig so it wasnt our missing stripper this was indeed someone else how many people had they kidnapped tonight either mendez or derry had used flex cuffs on her wrists it was standard op on intact bodies officers had been killed by dead bodies better safe than sorry mendez squatted down he was peering under the table what is that i squatted because i was closer to the ground derry kept an eye on the room gun sort of at the ready but careful to not point out toward us it was nice to work with professionals there was a long cylindrical object under the table it was black with dried blood on it it was so caked with blood that for a second i couldnt tell what it was then it was like one of those abstract pictures that suddenly snap into place and you know i swallowed hard against the burn of nausea i took a slow breath through my nose and let it out easy through my mouth my voice sounded odd even to me when i said bottle wine bottle mendez said god he must have hit his button by accident because hudson heard him what is it mendez hudson asked over the headsets sorry sir just jesus this was a bad way to die steady mendez that didnt kill her i said and stood up mendez moved with me his eyes flashed white through his mask and gear i pointed with one hand at her neck her breast her arms they bled her to death before he asked sort of hopefully never a good sign when the police are asking you to please make this not as horrible as it looks i shook my head but multiple bites means shes dead she cant be a vampire the body is checked out guys can i join you or am i on permanent babysit duty derry moved for the door of the kitchen oh goody i wasnt the only one who wanted out of here i followed derry and mendez brought up the rear id have moved to the back of the line but no one complained so i stayed where i was the sound of gunfire and yelling and screaming was ahead i wanted to run but derry moved at a jog if his body was tight with adrenaline and his pulse thundering it didnt show mendez followed derrys lead and so did i a womans scream came high and shrill from deeper into the apartment her screams were accompanied by sounds that were more animal than human thick wet sucking sounds the vampires were feeding and dawn morgan was still alive we did the only thing we could we rushed into the hallway we rushed off to save her we jogged into the trap because the bait was screaming the only light was the sweep of flashlights ahead and behind because i didnt have a light it ruined my night vision but didnt really help me derry jumped over something and i glanced down to find that there were bodies in the hallway the glance down made me stumble over the third body i only had time to register that one was our guy and the rest werent there was too much blood too much damage i couldnt tell who one of them was he was pinned to the wall by a sword he looked like a shelled turtle all that careful body armor ripped away showing the red ruin of his upper body the big metal shield was crushed just past the body was that baldwin back there there were legs sticking out of one of the doors derry went past it trusting that the officers ahead of him hadnt left anything dangerous or alive behind them it was a level of trust that i had trouble with but i kept going i stayed with derry and mendez like id been told there was a vamp near the end of the hallway with most of the top of his head missing his mouth was wide showing fangs in the flash of someones light derry hit the doorway and hugged the wall to the left i followed him mendez went right only when mendez didnt follow me did i realize that i should have peeled off to the other wall with him hell there were too many rules i stayed with derry because there wasnt time to correct the mistake if it was a mistake if we lived id ask someone the holy objects had blazed to life so bright white and blue like captive stars they were ruining everyones night vision made it hard to shoot my cross was safely tucked away for just that reason by the thin flashlight beams and the incandescent flare of holy fire i saw what there was to see if id been there from the beginning my mind would have been slow and taking it all in with that artificial sense that you have more time to do things decide things than you actually do but sometimes when you step into the middle of it you see things in strobe effect an image here there but never the large picture as if to see it all at once would overwhelm you hudson yelling mp to his shoulder bodies on the ground between him and the big bed a glimpse of pale naked flesh on the bedfemale two other vampires riding two of the men one rode him to the floor so he had to be lost to sight from hudson and killians position the other man was trapped against the wall still firing his gun into the chest of the vamp while the body bucked and wouldnt die the vamp was pressed tight to the white glow of something that looked like a luminous rosary mendez with his rifle trying to find a shot in the mess stepping around giving his back to the bed so he could pin the gunbarrel against the back of the vamps head the vamp never lifted from jungs neck the gunshot like all the others was loud but not nearly as loud as it could have been it was wrong all wrong no vamp except the most powerful could stand up to holy objects like this only revenants mindless newbies would feed while you pushed a gun to their head and blew their brains out you cant be ancient and a newbie which meant we were missing someone someone that was standing right fucking here i dropped my shields and i looked not toward the fighting but away from it either he was better than i was and he was invisible which meant he was farther into the room or he was hiding somewhere that the team hadnt gotten to yet or both i found the energy of him in the far corner in plain sight even knowing he was there i couldnt see him which meant either i was wrong or he was good enough that he could stand wrapped in shadows and darkness and be invisible the only other vamp id ever known that was that good had never been human i think i could have stripped him of it using my necromancy or jeanclaudes marks but i had the mossberg in my hands why waste magic when youve got technology i tightened my brace of the butt against my shoulder sighted down the barrel and pulled the trigger the shot didnt kill him but it brought him stumbling away from the wall suddenly everyone could see him his hands were holding his stomach where id shot him he looked surprised tall bastard id been aiming for his chest i hit him again and there was an echo two echoes his body slammed back against the wall i yelled into the mike i want to see the wall through his chest no one argued derry had moved over to help mendez i was betting that hudson had sent him while i was concentrating on vampire stuff hudson killian and i shot the master vampire until there was a pale smear of wall through his chest he slid down the wall like a broken puppet painting the wall dark with blood hudson and killian stopped firing but i didnt i put a shot into the head and had a second shot in before they joined me but they did join me with three of us it didnt take long to explode most of his head like a melon thrown against a wall when most of his head was gone from his shoulders i lowered my gun enough to look around and see how everyone else was doing now that the master was dead the newbie vamps were cringing away from the holy objects just like theyre supposed to well the one vamp that was still alive cringed she pressed her bloody face against the corner behind the bed her small hands held out as if to ward it off at first it looked like she was wearing red gloves then the lights shone in the blood and you knew it wasnt operalength gloves it was blood all the way to her elbows even knowing that even having melbourne motionless on the floor in front of her still mendez didnt shoot her jung was leaning against the wall like hed fall down if he didnt concentrate his neck was torn up but the blood wasnt gushing out shed missed the jugular lets hear it for inexperience i said shoot her the vampire made mewling sounds like a frightened child her voice came high and piteous please please dont hurt me dont hurt me he made me he made me shoot her mendez i said into the mike shes begging for her life he said and his voice didnt sound good shit i said and started across the room something grabbed my ankle reflex pointed the shotgun downward one of the dead vampires hissed up at me with a hole in its forehead but it still had my ankle and it was still going to bite me from less than two feet away the sawedoff would have been better but there was no time i emptied my gun into its head and back until it let go of me and blood and other things leaked out of the body hudson dead is at least half their brains spilled and daylight through their chests he didnt argue just stepped up close to the other vamp and started pegging away at it i guess making invisible vampires visible had earned me some credits with the sergeant i peeled shotgun shells out of the stock holder and fed them into the gun as i walked toward mendez and the vampire she was still crying still begging they made us do it they made us do it the woman on the bed was naked and her eyes had started to glaze shit but the room had to be secured before we could see to the victim secured in my line of work meant something different than for most officers of the law secured meant that everything in the room that wasnt on my side was dead killian was moving up by the bed to check on our victim i hoped he could help her because it seemed worse to lose people who were trying to save someone that didnt get saved jung was trying to hold pressure on his own neck wound melbournes body lay on its side one hand outstretched toward the cringing vampire melbourne wasnt moving but the vampire still was that seemed wrong to me but i knew just how to fix it i had the shotgun reloaded but i let it swing down at my side at this range the sawedoff was quicker no wasted ammo mendez had glanced away from the vamp to me then farther back to his sergeant i cant shoot someone whos begging for her life its okay mendez i can no he said and looked at me his eyes showed too much white no step back mendez hudson said sir step back and let marshal blake do her job sir its not right are you refusing a direct order mendez no sir but then step back and let the marshal do her job mendez still hesitated now mendez he moved back but i didnt trust him at my back he wasnt bespelled she hadnt tricked him with her eyes it was much simpler than that police are trained to save lives not take them if shed attacked him mendez would have fired if shed attacked someone else hed have fired if shed looked like a raving monster hed have fired but she didnt look like a monster as she cringed in the corner hands as small as my own held up trying to stop what was coming her body pressed into the corner like a childs last refuge before the beating begins when you run out of places to hide and you are literally cornered and theres nothing you can do no word no action no thing that will stop it go stand by your sergeant i said he stared at me and his breathing was way too fast mendez hudson said i want you here now mendez obeyed that voice as hed been trained to but he kept glancing back at me and the vampire in the corner she glanced past her arm and because i didnt have a holy item in sight she was able to give me her eyes they were pale in the uncertain light pale and frightened please she said please dont hurt me he made us do such terrible things i didnt want to but the blood i had to have it she raised her delicate oval face to me i had to have it the lower half of her face was a crimson mask i nodded and braced the shotgun in my arms using my hip and arm instead of my shoulder for the brace point i know i said dont she said and held out her hands i fired into her face from less than two feet away her face vanished in a spray of blood and thicker things her body sat up very straight for long enough that i pulled the trigger into the middle of her chest she was tiny not much meat on her i got daylight with just one shot mendezs voice came over the mike were supposed to be the good guys shut up mendez jung said in a voice that was choked and thicker than it should have been i knelt by jung check mel he whispered i didnt argue with him though i was pretty sure that it was useless i reached for the big pulse in his neck and found torn bloody meat the carpet around him was spongy with blood they hadnt even fed on him theyd just torn his throat out not to feed just to kill how is he jung asked hudson i said hudson was there and i got up and let him tell jung the bad news not my job to break the news to the wounded not my job i walked out into the middle of the room there was movement in the hallway and it took everything i had not to shoot the medics as they came through hudson had had to call on the headsets but i hadnt heard him hell of a night they descended on the wounded with their bags and boxes and i walked farther into the room because there was nothing i could do i had no power over human mortality vampires some shapeshifters but not straight humans i didnt know how to save them how could you look her in the eyes and do that i turned and found mendez by me hed taken off his mask and helmet though i was betting that was against the rules until we left the building i covered my mike with my hand because no one should learn about someones death by accident she tore melbournes throat out she said the other vampire made her do it is that true maybe i said then how could you just shoot her because she was guilty and who died and made you judge jury and ex he stopped in midsentence executioner i finished for him the federal and state government actually i thought we were the good guys he said and it had that note of a child who finally realizes that sometimes good and evil arent so much opposites as two sides of a coin you toss it one way and it looks good another way and its evil sometimes it just depends on which end of the gun youre on we are he shook his head you arent i have no excuse for what i said next other than he hurt my feelings and he said out loud something id began wonder about if you cant take the heat mendez get out of the fucking kitchen get a desk job but whatever you do right now get the fuck away from me he stared at me hudson said mendez go get some air thats an order mendez gave us both a glance then he went for the door hudson watched him go then looked back at me he didnt mean that yeah he did he doesnt understand what you do i sighed sure in the movies the vampires look peaceful nothing here looks peaceful i dont bring peace sergeant i bring death you save more lives than you take pretty to think so i said he clapped me on the back the closest hed ever get to hugging one of his people but i took it for the compliment it was you did good tonight blake dont let anyone take that away from you i nodded thanks you dont sound convinced he said lets just say that after awhile you get tired of having to shoot people who are begging for their lives theyre vampires theyre already dead he said i shook my head and smiled i wish i believed that sergeant hudson i do surely wish i believed that i watched them start taking out the wounded they left melbourne where he lay but took the girl from the bed they were triaging taking the ones they could save the dead arent going anywhere well none of the dead in this room i was having an argument with sergeant hudson we were doing it quietly at the back of the equipment van so the media that had descended on us wouldnt get us on camera but it was still an argument it isnt them sergeant i said so there was an extra vamp or two than the bite marks on the earlier victims they made more the master vamp of this group is strong enough to hide his power from both the church of eternal life and the master of the city nothing we killed up there had that kind of power we lost three men up there i think thats plenty powerful enough i shook my head most of these were babies almost brandnew what i saw at the earlier crime scenes wasnt a feeding frenzy it was methodical the vampires up in that condo were still more like animals than thinking beings they were too wild to be taken on an organized hunt i dont know what youre talking about an organized hunt you make it sound like killing humans is like hunting deer or rabbit to some of the vampires it is he shook his head hands on hips and started to pace in a tight circle but the open door of the van stopped his pacing its the right number of vamps they had one dead stripper and one that they nearly killed thats good enough they took her and left a state trooper as a witness so wed know they wanted us to come here tonight why they ambushed us in the hallway blake i think we were just better at killing them than they planned for us to be maybe but what if it wasnt a trap to kill us what if it was a trap to kill the vampires thats just that makes no sense youre ready to close the case youre ready to declare them dead defeated we kill a few vampires find a few dead humans in the condo and youre ready to believe its our serial killers and who else would it be are you saying weve got copycats no im saying that if we close this case then they can just move on to the next town they can start over youre saying they left us some of their baby vampires so wed kill them and think it was them they sacrificed their own people for this yeah thats what im saying you know what i think blake no what i think you just cant let it go i think you want it not to be over it was my turn to try to pace but i was smaller and standing a little farther out from the doors so i got almost a full circle out of my pacing it didnt help i want this over with hudson more than you do because if these vampires were left up there as sacrificial lambs then they used me to kill them they used all of us as a sort of a weapon their weapon go home blake go home to your husband or boyfriend or fucking dog but go home your job is done here do you understand that i looked up at him and tried to think how to explain it i finally tried something i didnt like admitting to the police at large i saw inside the memories of one of the vampires at the church earlier tonight i saw some faces i got some names those faces arent up there those names arent going to belong to any of the dead this case is closed blake which means your warrant has been fulfilled youre done go home actually sergeant i have sole discretion on whether a warrant is finished or not mark me on this if we dont get these guys in st louis theyll move shop we got some of them tonight but not all of them and we sure as hell missed the big guy and if you dont kill the main master he just moves somewhere else and starts making new vampires its like going in for cancer surgery if you dont get it all then it keeps spreading i thought you were dating a vampire he said i am i said for someone whos dating one of them you have a damned dark view of them ask me how i feel about human beings sometimes ive gotten called in on too many serial killer cases where they want it to be a monster because they dont want to believe that one human being could do shit like that to another human being how long you been doing this hunting vamps doing the bad crimes six years why most violent crime units rotate their people about every two to five years maybe you need to see something a little less bloody for awhile i didnt know what to say to that so i sort of sidestepped it up there the master vampire that was hiding in the corner none of you could see him right until you shot him i could feel him i knew exactly where he was he was controlling the others in the bedroom if he hadnt died then the others would have kept attacking even with the holy objects visible wed have lost more people maybe but whats your point my abilities with the dead are genetic its like a psychic gift no amount of training or practice will teach you how to see the invisible there are less than twenty people in the entire country that have abilities even close to mine there are a hell of a lot more than twenty people in the new federal marshals program he said i nodded yeah and some of them are good some of them would have sensed his power but i dont know if any of the rest would have known exactly where to shoot youre saying that youre the only one who can do your job i shrugged look blake take some advice from someone whos been doing this longer than you have youre not god you cant save everybody and the police work in this town has been running just fine without you to babysit you arent the only cop in this city and you arent the only one who can do this job youve got to let go of that idea or youll go crazy youll start blaming yourself for not being there twentyfourseven youll start thinking if only id been there this bad thing or that bad thing wouldnt have happened its a lie youre just a person with some good abilities and good judgment but dont try and carry the weight of the whole fucking world itll crush you i looked up into his brown eyes and there was something in his face that said he was giving advice that had been hardwon if id been a girlgirl id have said something like you sound like youre talking from experience but id hung around with the boys club too long not to know my manners hudson was opening up and he didnt have to he was trying to help me asking him personal shit would have made me an ungrateful wretch ive been the only one for so long did you go up in that condo by yourself he asked i shook my head then stop acting like you did do you have anyone waiting for you at home his voice was gentler than it had been when hed first told me to go home to my husband or boyfriend yeah i got someone waiting then go home call him from the car let him know that the officer down calls werent you they never released names of the downed officers to the media until all the families had been contacted better for the bereaved but hell on all the other families with police officers out and about tonight they were all waiting for the phone to ring or worse the doorbell no one with a police officer in the family wanted to see another cop on their doorstep tonight i thought about how id left micah and nathaniel standing in the parking lot how id told them to take ronnie home how i hadnt kissed either of them goodbye my eyes were hot and my throat hurt i nodded maybe a little too rapidly my voice was only a little shaky ill go home ill call home get some sleep if you can youll feel better tomorrow i nodded but didnt look at him id taken a couple of steps when i turned back and said ill bet you almost anything hudson that the crime lab is going to agree with me the dna in the bites from the first vics arent going to match most of the vamps upstairs you just wont let this go will you i shrugged i dont know how to let go sergeant take it from someone who knows blake you better start learning or youre going to burn out i looked at him and he looked back and i wondered what hed seen in me tonight for him to feel that i needed the burnout lecture was he right or were we all just tired him me all of us i drove home thinking about vampires not the fun ones the ones wed just killed it was nearly three in the morning mine was almost the only car when i pulled out onto the highway eight dead vamps plus one human cohort my bet was a human servant because he was the one that had killed officer baldwin with a sword that spoke of long ago skills not many modern humans are good enough with a blade to take out a tactical officer armed with an mp eight was enough to account for all of them but i knew wed missed vittorio he just hadnt been there the night was clear and bright and as i left the city proper behind stars studded the sky like someone had spilled a bag of diamonds across the velvet of it i felt surprisingly good i wasnt sure why and didnt look at it too closely just in case it was fragile and too much poking would have broken the mood i felt good and i was going home and id saved everyone i could and killed everyone i could i was out of it for the night thered been enough dead females to account for nadine and nellie the pair that had seduced avery seabrook thered even been an extra that could have been gwenyth vittorios sweetheart but i thought it long odds that all three of them would just let us shoot them without much of a fight by the standards i was used to it hadnt been much of a fight not for what this group had been capable of at least one of them or more should have tried to fly out a window to escape the sniper had had nothing to do tonight it wasnt until i was turning off onto south that i realized the circus of the damned would have been much closer and gotten me to bed sooner now it was too late as long or longer to backtrack as go forward but i wanted my own bed tonight i wanted a certain stuffed toy penguin i wanted micah and nathaniel and right at that moment i didnt really want to see another vampire it wasnt the vampire vics that made me not want to face another vampire tonight it was my victims it was the flash pictures in my head of the girl whod begged for her life and jonah cooper and the silent crowd watching me at the church i tried to hide behind the shield of the horrible things theyd done to the woman in the kitchen it had been horrible once id justified it for myself by thinking that i was the good guy that there were things i wouldnt do lines i wouldnt cross lately the lines seemed blurry or gone i agreed with mendez you didnt shoot someone begging for their life not if you were a good guy but a lot of them begged a lot of them were sorry once they were looking down the wrong end of a gun but they werent sorry while they were killing people torturing people no they were having a good time until they got caught what got me tonight was her saying he made us do it had he had vittorio so controlled them that they could not disobey him i knew from the fallout with the london vamps that wed adopted that you were legally bound to follow your master almost morally bound because he was like your liege lord but was it more than that could vampires make other vampires do things they did not want to do id ask jeanclaude but not tonight tonight i was tired the highway stretched black and empty my only company was a semi truck pulling some allnight load across the country off in the distance the truck and i had the road to ourselves i was betting that wherever vittorio was thats where wed find the women the crime lab would check the dead vamps dna against the bite marks in the first few victims and wed know how many wed missed as far the st louis police were concerned it was over wed executed most of them and chased the survivors out of town trouble was serial killers dont stop killing they just move on and start again somewhere else sergeant hudson and his men were done with it and theyd paid a high price to be done but my badge said federal which meant that i might not be done with vittorio and his people i pushed the thought away for now wed driven him and his surviving members out of town that had to be enough at least for tonight i was off the highway now on the smooth more narrow road that led farther into jefferson county and my house trees blocked the view so the stars seemed farther away i pulled into my driveway and saw the faint shine of lights against the living room drapes micah or nathaniel had waited up it was after three am and someone had waited up i felt guilty happy and apprehensive nothing good had ever come of my father and judith waiting up for me i still wasnt completely used to living with anyone so sometimes old reactions crept up like i was seventeen again and there was a light on i told myself i was being silly but this would be the first callout like this one since nathaniel had the right to make more demands on me i wasnt sure yet what all of those demands might be so i was a little nervous as i put my key in the door was i being silly only one way to find out they were sitting on the couch i thought nathaniel was asleep with his head in micahs lap but he turned as i came through the door and i caught the flash of his eyes in the light from the television a look of such naked relief crossed micahs face before he managed to hide it behind a smile he was back to his usual smiling neutrality back to making as few demands on me as possible but id seen that first look that look that said more than any words that hed wondered if hed ever see me again i hadnt kissed him goodbye i had forgotten to call from the car tell them the officer downcalls werent me the thought cut deep like some guilty knife nathaniel got to me first then slowed before he actually touched me the look on my face maybe or the fact that i just stood there halfway between the couch and the door the look on his face was so disappointed i got a flash of emotion from him so sad he thought i was drawing back away too scared to really be with him with them that wasnt what i was scared of you cant shoot someone from less than three feet away with a sawedoff and not get blowback i had blood in my hair on my arms id gotten some of it with the wet wipes i kept in the car but not all of it i wasnt clean if id been just a cop and the dead woman just a human then id have worried about bloodborne disease she could have aids or hepatitis but she was a vampire so she couldnt carry anything unless you counted vampirism yeah i guess that counted but nathaniel and micah couldnt get that either but maybe i could if i killed humans then i was in more danger from disease but vamps were cleaner it was too weird for me tonight too much thinking anita are you alright micah asked and got off the couch to move up beside nathaniel i jerked out of reach ive got blood on me other peoples blood i was shaking my head over and over god knows what i brought home with me we cant catch anything nathaniel said not even a cold he didnt look lost anymore he looked worried blood cant hurt us micah said they were right i was being silly about contagion but do you really want to touch me while ive still got the blood of my victims on me yes nathaniel said and moved to hug me i moved back just enough that he stopped i was afraid if i let them hug me that i would lose it i would just sink into their arms and sob victims micah said anita this doesnt sound like you but he came with nathaniel he tried to hug me i moved back until the door hit me and i was shaking my head if i let you hold me im going to cry damn it i hate to cry micah gave me a look thats not it i closed my eyes and let the equipment bag fall to the floor he was right that wasnt it not completely i tried to be honest i tried to say what i felt if i get any sympathy im going to fall apart maybe thats what you need to do micah said and he moved just a little closer maybe just for a little while let us take care of you i kept shaking my head im afraid of what he asked voice soft of letting go micah touched my shoulder gently i didnt pull away he moved slowly gently easing me away from the door and into his arms i stayed stiff and unyielding for a moment then my breath came out in a long wavering line and i let myself fold around him my hands grabbed at his shirt handfuls of cloth as if i couldnt get close enough or hold on hard enough i wanted him naked not for sex though that would probably come but because i just wanted as much of him pressed against as much of me as possible ill go run the bath nathaniel said i reached out for him caught his shirt and drew him into us im sorry i said what about he asked and he and micah exchanged a look the first tear squeezed out traitorous bastard my voice was almost steady when i said i didnt kiss you goodbye either of you i just drove off im sorry they both kissed me soft chaste a mere touch of lips micah brushed the tear off my cheek we understood he looked at nathaniel run the bath id rather have a shower and get to bed they exchanged another look but with a nod from micah nathaniel went for the bathroom i looked at micahs face the only man in my life i didnt have to look up to to meet his eyes whats happened what have i missed he smiled but it wasnt a happy smile it was the smile hed had when i first met him a smile that held sadness selfdeprecation mocking and something else something that sadness was too light a word for id almost broken him from that smile i grabbed his arms almost shook him what happened nothing i swear everythings fine but jeanclaude warned us not to let you get in the shower he said and i quote not between glass walls i frowned at him what are you talking about why should jeanclaude care about how i clean up the phone rang i jumped like id been stabbed i said what i was thinking if its another murder scene tonight i cant do it even saying it i knew id do it if they needed me id go but what id said was true id go but i wasnt sure i could handle it tonight admitting that even to myself scared me it was my job i had to be able to do it micah went for the phone while i stood in the darkened living room and prayed for it not to be the police he called its jeanclaude why is he calling on the phone come and find out micah said i walked to the lights of the kitchen it was only the lights over the sink not that much light but i blinked like a deer in headlights i took the receiver from micah while he tried not to give me worried eyes whats up i asked ma petite how do you feel his voice was the joy for me it usually was but tonight even that voice left me flat and empty like shit why how long has it been since you fed i leaned my forehead against the wall and closed my eyes i ate some peanuts and chips in the last day why nathaniel had put some munchies in my glove compartment i am not referring to food ma petite suddenly the emptiness spilled away replaced by panic jesus damian he is well i have seen to it how can he be well he started to die if i went just a few hours over six ive gone almost twentyfour hours god i cannot believe this so stupid and when in the last twentyfour hours could you have fed theardeur and who on the question stopped the selfrecriminations and helped me think i guess there were worse things than forgetting about theardeur during a police investigation like maybe not forgetting theardeur during a police investigation several horrible scenarios went through my head like theardeur rising in the van with mobile reserve or zerbrowski in his car i was suddenly cold and it had nothing to do with my earlier pangs of conscience ma petite i can hear your sweet breath but i need to hear your sweet voice jesus mary and joseph how did you keep it from getting me by shielding in every way between us and richard and helping the others do so as well thats why youre calling me on the phone not mindtomind oui how did you keep me from draining damian and nathaniel i fed theardeur at the club as we discussed and i shared with damian it is only when he is drained that your triumvirate would begin to pull upon our bad kitty one feeding through you took care of it for this long he sighed and he sounded tired because he was still shielding too hard for me to feel it non non ma petite we have done your sixhour feedings for you whos we richard and damian and myself nathaniel had fed you last and i was not a hundredpercent certain that i could control the feeding so i did not use him richard got a taste of theardeur from the other side he did whatd he think of it he has new respect for our ability to not go mad i wanted to ask who richard had fed on but it was none of my business i wasnt monogamous and neither was he i was still leaning against the wall but my eyes were open damian fed theardeur not as the eatee but as the eater it was not hard to raise it in him is this permanent i mean do richard and damian need to feed now too non ma petite desperate measures but not permanent ones how can you be sure i asked because i can feel it growing in me again not just my need but yours i parceled it out shared it among those i could but it is time again ma petite i turned around and stared blindly out into the kitchen are you saying you borrowed myardeur for the last few hours he seemed to think about that that will do for an explanation oui so i could hunt bad guys and not lose control in the middle of it all yes i didnt know what to say so i said what i could thank you you are most welcome ma petite but dawn is near and when i sleep theardeur will return home i would prefer to give it back to you before then so i might feel how tempestuous that return will be youre worried oui you asked me how i felt why theardeur comes with a price as all the hungers do but they have their rewards as well i do not speak of the pleasure but of the strengths that they give us in effect by stealing away yourardeur i weakened you tonight if i hadnt feared contacting you mindtomind i would have asked your permission first or warned you i didnt feel weak then i thought about it im really bugged by the vampires i killed tonight i mean more than normal im sort of shaky and wondering if im the good guy after all such selfdoubt is not like you i do have some selfdoubt i said but not too much you could not be who you are if you doubted too much are you saying that i draw some of my bravery or my coldness from theardeur i am saying that theardeur may feed that part of you that keeps you safe in your own mind your own heart i shook my head this is too complicated for me jeanclaude just let me have it back and well see if i feel any better i would rather you be alone with micah when that happens we have very carefully left him untouched while we sought to feed so that you might feed on him yourself i didnt feel the least bit sexy i just wanted a quick shower and to sleep im too tired for sex jeanclaude too tired for much of anything as i feared i took too much or theardeur has become attached to your own natural drives what are you talking about long before theardeur found you ma petite i found that you were seldom too tired for sex i thought about blushing but found that even that seemed like too much effort what do you want me to do what little excitement had crept back into my voice had vanished nothing seemed quite real as if i was already asleep asleep on my feet if you intend to clean up ive got other peoples blood in my hair so yeah fine go to the bathroom then but take micah with you hang up the phone go to the bathroom take micah with you and sometime before you have filled the bathtub with water i will give back to you that which is yours nathaniel is filling the tub now micah said you warned us not to use the shower something about glass the return may be more violent than i would like ma petite i would feel better if you and micah were not surrounded by glass walls do you know this is going to be bad or are you just worried let us say that i have not lived so long or courted you successfully without thinking worstcase scenarios courting is that what you call it nowadays i am hanging up now ma petite i suggest you do as i have bid he hung up i put the receiver back in its cradle and started walking out of the kitchen micah was standing by the table watching with careful kittycat eyes i understood now how much he held back behind that careful face but tonight i didnt pry i had enough horrors of my own without borrowing you know about what jeanclaudes been doing with theardeur i asked yes jeanclaude had me keep an eye on nathaniel so that if he started to get weak i could call for help i shook my head i endangered him all of you i felt numb again even the selfrecrimination felt like just words later when there was more of me id feel bad but right now id felt about as bad as i was able there just wasnt enough of me left to worry about it anita micah was in front of me and i hadnt seen him move anita are you alright i shook my head the answer was no but out loud i said i want to be cleaned up before theardeur comes back i want to get this shit off of me i started for the bathroom micah trailed after me nathaniel was bending over the bath tub his pony tail trailing around his naked upper body hed stripped down to silk boxers the sight of him like that should have moved me but it didnt cold i felt so cold inside he gave me worried eyes as he moved toward me what can i do to help i flung myself on him hard enough he staggered he held me against the warmth of his body he held me tight and hard responding to my desperation i wanted to bury myself in his flesh wrap him up around me but i couldnt id endangered him risked his life by simply not paying attention to theardeur if jeanclaude had not helped out i tried to push the thought away but jonah coopers body flashed in my head his body on the ground my foot on his shoulder and grass showing through his chest you feel the draw of them i know you do hed said i was on my knees and only nathaniels hands had kept me from hurting myself on the edge of the tub anita i pulled away from nathaniel and reached for micah he took my hand and said go nathaniel go before theardeur comes i dont think he started to say i screamed go please go god go i didnt see nathaniel go or stay because jeanclaude dropped his shielding i dont know what id expected hed made it sound like he borrowed my favorite coat or book and now hed give it back but a coat doesnt want to come back to you a book doesnt care who reads it he didnt hand it back to me his shields dropped and it roared home like a train that he had fought to hold back to keep still but it had strained against his hold it had hungered to come home it was like being caught on the tracks at night and the first hint you have that disaster is here is a bright light and the tracks vibrating under your feet then the world becomes noise light as if thunder and lightning could be forged into metal and its all coming straight through you and you cant get off the tracks you cant run you cant hide because your body is the tracks and the train is a piece of yourself that wants to come home theardeur fell on us and we fell into the water it took us almost a minute to remember we couldnt breathe under water we came up gasping for air laughing almost as soon as we could breathe enough for it clothes had vanished in the first rush we were naked in the water how had we managed to get out of the jeans that fast a piece of jean cloth floated by me oh thats how no missionary position well both drown i said his curls were plastered to his head and his hair looked black in the candlelight the laughter died from his face his eyes and left something darker more basic behind a look that made me shiver all he said was okay he moved us to the edge of the tub pressing my back against the smooth side of it he pressed himself up against me pinning me between the tub and his body the feel of him hard and firm against the front of my naked body made me close my eyes for a moment i had some vague memory of clothes being ripped away but i wasnt sure when or even which of us had done it i was getting better at thinking when theardeur rose but there were moments when thinking was not what i did he moved back from my body so he could caress the front of himself just watching his hand play over that thick firm flesh made me shiver he angled himself downward so he could push between my thighs he felt incredibly large sliding between my legs he didnt try to angle upward or enter me he simply pushed himself between my thighs so that the thickness of him brushed against all of me he rubbed himself back and forth using his body like another hand to caress and play between my legs but it was a thick hard rubbing with none of the delicacy of fingers youd think water would help everything be slippery but water makes some parts less wet less slick so that though it felt good it also was rougher than it would have been if id been wet with something other than water not wet enough he said and his voice was thick and strangely hoarse strangled with desire i would have liked to argue because theardeur wanted to argue wanted to say take me take me now if id been with almost any other man in my life we could have done just that without hurting me or him but micah was the exception to a lot of rules in my life it wasnt the length that was the problem it was the width wed found this out the hard way and had had the rubby spots to prove it i managed to say no not wet enough he leaned his forehead against mine and said a heartfelt shit i nodded my head against his wordless assent because i didnt trust my voice micah wasnt the only one strangling on need he drew his body from between my legs and even that drew a small sound from me his hands went to my waist and he just suddenly lifted me up up so that i was perched on the edge of the tub if his hand hadnt been on my leg i would have overbalanced and fallen back into the water but he steadied me one hand stayed on my leg but the other hand moved up the line of my thigh i thought he was going to do me by hand but his finger slid inside me it was unexpected and even one finger felt tight and good so good that i lay back along the raised tile around the tub i felt the heat before i actually lay down on the candles but the heat of it pressed against my skin i sat up so abruptly that he had to move his hands and spill me back into the water did you get burned he asked i shook my head no not this time id caught my hair on fire once i laughed sort of shakily stupid micah looked at me and there was something in that look what i asked theardeur is gone i thought about it felt around for it and found no no not gone but receded not receded like when i fought it but more like me getting almost burned had helped me think again or maybe even theardeur bows to physical survival but i could feel it like a storm that had moved offshore but was still coming i thought id caught myself on fire again he said i frowned at him yes again is it my fault that youre so amazing that you make me forget everything even physical safety he shook his head not me theardeur theardeur makes everything better anita there was something about the way he said it something serious and a little sad that made me say whats wrong he kissed me on the tip of the nose later i might have argued with him but theardeur decided that it had given us enough time it hit me like a train and threw me into his arms made my hands move over his body as if i was hungry to touch him as if no touch no caress nothing would be enough we kissed the same way as if we were hungry for each other it was as if we could have we would have climbed into each others skins wrapped ourselves through each other closer than skin or flesh could survive one minute my mouth was trying to climb inside micahs the next my beast rose swimming up up through my body coming out of that metaphysical place and climbing up my body micah drew back from my mouth enough to say anita i used hands and body to press his mouth back to mine his beast began to spill up through his body in a line of breathstealing heat it rose fast and faster as if it had to catch up with mine they raced up our bodies raced through that dark water raced and raced faster and faster until they hit the surface it wasnt about changing shape it was about changing bodies it was about that need to wrap as much of him around as much of me as tight and close as i could it was as if the very essence of our bodies had responded to that desire our beasts spilled out of our mouths and brushed metaphysical furred sides down each other as we spilled inside each others bodies it was closer than sex closer than anything id ever felt it was as if for a blinding shattering moment we were in each others bodies not in our minds not merely our thoughts or feelings not even memories but for a breath or two a part of me slipped inside him and a part of him slipped inside me they werent parts that could think and feel like a human being there was none of that wow so this is how it feels to be micah there was only a sense of burrowing down down deep inside him of finding that metaphysical hiding place where the beast lay and having my beast curl up for a moment inside his most secret space while his beast did the same in me in that moment theardeur fed fed on that warm living power fed on the sensation of being deeper inside micahs body than id ever been inside any mans before theardeur fed and left us quieter calmer happier the beasts didnt turn and go back up the way theyd come one moment that piece of me was curled warm and safe inside him and the sensation of him inside me was like when we made love as if even his beast were bigger and took up more room than mine that warm living energy didnt come back up our throats it was as if the two energies spilled out the fronts of our bodies out our skin so that for a heartbeat it felt as if wed burst our skins and two great furred shapes were passing through us then it was as if the two beasts dropped back into place i swear i felt as if something physical with true weight was dropped down the center of my body and hit the end of me as if instead of falling from the height i was the height and could feel the body falling through me and hitting my floor we broke from the kiss laughing breathless i found my voice first wow he looked happier than id ever seen him relaxed more more at home somehow as if some great weight had gone from him you know he said still breathing hard youre not supposed to be able to do that if one of you is human i didnt know you were supposed to be able to do that at all i said if you are both powerful and a true mated pair then its possible you say it like it has a name shiva and pavarti or simply maithuna its sanskrit for union or coupling shiva who would destroy the world with his energy if pavarti didnt constantly have sex with him and spill off the energy he nodded world religion class from college again i shook my head a few years back we found a naga a real live one that had been a crime victim it made me go look up hindu religion i mean if you get one type of supernatural being you might get others from the same place did you nope i thought about it well not yet i put my arms behind his head and drew him down for a kiss he didnt fight but he kept himself just above my face you fed theardeur i still want a kiss he kissed me and it was gentle at first then grew until we were feeding at each others mouths again he drew back laughing and breathless i thought wed done this already i wasnt sure how to explain it wed had metaphysical sex and like sometimes happens after regular sex i was pumped energized i could feel him still hard and thick pressed between our bodies i wanted him inside me i wanted him as close physically as id had him metaphysically i kept one hand behind his neck but let the other trace down his body until i could cup him in my hand he closed his eyes and swallowed hard i moved my hand up and wrapped my fingers around him he was so hard so thick so solid in my hand that it made me close my eyes made my breath shudder from my body i opened my eyes and knew that my focus was already soft i want this inside me he tried for amusement but his face was raw with the beginnings of that need his voice was hoarse again when he said even without theardeur i squeezed him tight enough to flutter his eyes back into his head when he could see again i said its not theardeur that makes me want you micah his voice was a harsh whisper as if he were having trouble talking well never top what weve already done tonight i stroked my hand up the long hard shaft of him its not about being better just being as good he shook his head it wont be as good without theardeur or our beasts and this close to full moon i dont think we want to keep trying the beasts it could get out of hand it was my turn to shake my head just us micah just us from the moment we touched its never been just us theres always someone or something else never just us he looked so serious i cupped one hand under the soft wetness of his testicles and gently played with them while i played my other hand over the head and shaft of him then were past due dont you think he swallowed hard laughed then gave a small nod youre wetter after you feed theardeur but we ended up back in the water so you wont be wet enough or open enough for this he wrapped his hand around mine where i still held him he squeezed our hands together until his head went back eyes closed and he shuddered hard enough to make the water slosh against the sides of the tub he looked down at me and slipped his hand between my legs searching until he could slip a finger inside me he managed two fingers inside me before my head went back and my eyes fluttered shut to go in there he whispered when i could talk i said oh darn then youll have to make me wet and open he shoved the two fingers fast and hard inside me stopped my voice along with my breath i can do that he said and he had that look that look that said he knew i wanted him and that i wouldnt say no i didnt say no i said yes over and over again i said yes until he worked me open with his fingers and finally with his mouth so he could push himself inside me so we could finally put that in there and it was wet and tight and hard and everything i wanted it to be when i screamed his name and raked my nails down his back when his body thrust one last time inside mine thrust so far and so deep that it made me cry out again and arched his body above mine on the bathroom tile painted his body in flame and shadow above me sent our hands into the candles and spilled the candles into the water to smoke and die when all that was done he looked down at me eyes not quite focused face still slack with orgasm i said in a voice breathy and panting metaphysics we dont need no stinking metaphysics it took him a blink to get the joke but once he did he started to laugh and since he was still inside me that made me writhe which made him thrust inside me again which made me writhe again which made him writhe which he finally slid off to one side onto a small candlefree slice of tile still laughing we laughed until tiredness pulled at us like some giant hand dragging us under it was as if the entire twentyfour hours caught up with me at once and i was just done done for the day done for the night done for the year done we dried our hair as best we could i insisted on at least running an oiled cloth over the knives that id dunked in the bathtub micah helped me gather up the big knife and the two handguns i got the big equipment bag from the living room but micah begged me to just put it in the bedroom with us instead of putting everything into their various gun safes just one night itll be okay i promise he said i had to agree that i didnt want to go upstairs to the long rifle safe then downstairs to the ammo safe then well you get the idea we dragged ourselves to bed carrying more weapons than clothes i let the equipment bag drop beside the bed softly nathaniel lay on his side curled into a little ball like he always lay when no one was in the bed but him i laid the knives on the bedside table on his side of the bed again trying to be quiet he opened his eyes just enough to see me then they closed and his breathing deepened he didnt wake completely but his body responded to me climbing in beside him he was so warm almost hot feverish or maybe that was just how cool our skin was from the bath and the sex in the open air i put the browning in its homemade holster in the head of the bed micah put the firestar on the bedside table by him nathaniel relaxed into the curve of my body pressing as much of him against as much of me as he could it was only then that i realized we were all nude nathaniel hadnt worn anything to bed and neither had we i let micah come to bed nude if he wanted to but never nathaniel and never me it hadnt even occurred to me to get clothes on first id just wanted to go to bed to sleep to cuddle between them both micah settled in against my back and i let myself sink into the sensation of being held between them id slept with micah pressed naked to my back but never nathaniel id had his ass pressed into the curve of my stomach and groin for months but never without clothes never just skintoskin i pressed my breasts against the warmth of his back one arm up and over his head so i could touch his hair my other hand went around his waist in his sleep he pulled my hand closer to his body lower so that my fingers brushed areas id made very sure stayed covered whats wrong micah whispered as if hed felt some tension in me i touched the silky warmth of the skin just inside nathaniels hip that soft pocket of flesh that frames the groin nathaniels hand on mine holding me close to him as his breathing evened back into deep sleep i snuggled in against him until my breath danced along his neck and he snuggled harder against me nothing i whispered nothing at all micah spooned himself in at my back his arm going underneath my pillow and a little under nathaniels micahs other arm went over my waist and because nathaniel was so close to me his hand ended up resting on nathaniels hip ah he whispered no clothes no clothes i said he whispered against the back of my neck and it halftickled that a problem no i said and moved my head a fraction down my pillow so i could breathe in the scent of nathaniels neck you sure yeah and i was because it felt too right to be wrong the raid on the vampire condo got national attention a mixed blessing headlines ranged from condo of death to police raid ends vampire serial killers rampage or the most popular vampires turned serial killers next on channel the reports were so similar it didnt much matter what local channel it was on i just stopped answering my phone for a few days the interview requests were national and a few international i wondered if anyone on mobile reserve was getting this much attention if they were i hoped they were enjoying it more than i was dna came back and my worst fears were confirmed three of the vamps killed matched the earlier victims bites but that left us with five unaccounted for five serial killers still at large serial killers dont stop killing not unless theyre locked up or permanently dead theyd fled st louis the way they fled new orleans and pittsburgh before that theyd killed policemen in all three towns their kill count was more than twenty and they were still out there thered been a gap of of nearly three months between the killings in pittsburgh and the killings in new orleans barely a month between new orleans and st louis they were escalating less time between killing sprees more victims of choice though st louis had managed to get away with the fewest dead among our police how did we get so lucky jeanclaude got a letter the writing was beautiful calligraphy on heavy vellum paper with a watermark the note was from vittorios gwennie jeanclaude master of the city of st louis i have left vittorio his madness has grown beyond anything that i can excuse or take part in i cannot live as he lives anymore if he finds me he will kill me i have fled with another younger vampire of our kiss myron and vittorio will not forgive the betrayal vittorio is seeking another city now you have driven him out but he will find another hunting ground his madness does not let him rest for long now his only release seems to come when he kills the people that he sees as taunting him i saw your asher at belles court after the church was done with him let me say only that vittorio was not so lucky he is a ruin of a man now no he is a monster he has let the holy water that ate his body eat his mind as well everything i loved in him is gone lost to this mind sickness i hope you found the little that myron and i could do to assist the police helpful we moved the bodies so that they would be found sooner it was all we could do with vittorio so close myron was the one who left the policeman alive so you would know that the girl was taken myron was also in the church as one of our spies he knew that you had the address from cooper before he died he did not tell anyone but me for the rest are trapped in vittorios evil dream we did all we could to help you and your human servant please believe that if we survive i will try to contact you again i truly expect that vittorio will find us before the year is out but sometimes it is better to live a short good life than an evil long one most sincerely yours gwen the letter solved some of the mystery but it left the biggest part unanswered where was vittorio how long until he found another city to stalk i was a federal officer that meant when he resurfaced id get to see it if i wanted to or if the local vampire hunter called me in on it denisluc st john is still in the hospital in new orleans i talked to him on the phone let him know what happened to the vampires that nearly killed him he wants a piece of them when they resurface good for him im kind of hoping to be left out of it is that cowardly maybe if i thought i was the only one who could track them down and save the world id do it but im not the only cop in the country im not even the only vampire executioner with a badge in the country let someone else have the fun for a change id had about as much fun in the last few years as i could take ill go if im asked but im not volunteering there are always more bad guys always theres no way to win the war you can win a battle here and there but the war is always ongoing you kill one villainous bastard and another one just as bad or worse crops up it never seems to end we have a meeting set up to talk to malcolm about the bloodoath situation unfortunately the nobloodoath policy is countrywide not just in st louis a fucking disaster waiting to happen several of the vamps that were at the church the night i killed cooper have approached jeanclaude to change masters from malcolm to him avery seabrook and wicked and truth are among those jumping ship marianne did another tarot reading that duplicated the last one it being identical means were still working through it i still dont know whos supposed to help me someone from my past everyone that is helping seems very much my present and future the dragon has given primo permission to stay in st louis and would like to talk to us at a later date about council business a mixed blessing that ive contacted the police working on the browns case theyve agreed to have an officer fly down with some of the boys personal effects which means they are stumped evans has agreed to look at the stuff barbara brown sent me a card saying how sorry she was she hurt me i cant fix the world but im making progress on my life some nights its enough to come home alive and crawl into bed beside someone you love who loves you back i found orchids that were the same greenishgold as micahs eyes a bouquet of them is sitting on the coffee table in our living room micah says hes never gotten flowers before nathaniel got a frilly white apron like no ones mother ever really wore and a string of pearls i found him lying on the bed running the pearls over and over through his fingers for jeanclaude pure white orchids in a simple but elegant black vase he put them on the coffee table in his living room yellow roses for asher though they paled beside the gold of his hair richard and i arent back to the flowergiving stage yet and truthfully he never did see much point in he himself getting flowers from anyone damian nearly started a riot at danse macabre the first night he went to work after we became a true triumvirate he seems to have gained powers that are more belle mortes line of vampire than morovens line hes enjoying his newfound sex appeal im not sure damian is exactly in the boyfriend category but he is my vampire servant and he deserves better than hes been getting from me i gave him an envelope with a gift certificate in it a certificate to a furniture store he can decorate the basement as his room until we can have an apartment built over the garage for him we had a basementcleaning party one night nathaniels idea basically invite a lot of friends over and make them do grunt work then feed them pizza afterward well okay the wereleopards werewolves wererats and humans got pizza the vampires got something a little less solid no jeanclaude did not come help clean up the basement but surprisingly asher did so did richard he behaved himself all the way up to refreshments then he couldnt stand me opening a vein for asher he didnt argue he just left hes trying were all trying im trying to remember what i thought i was doing when i started hunting vampires and helping the police i used to think i was doing something noble that there was a reason and a purpose to it i used to know that i was the good guy but lately it feels like im just shoveling one pile of shit so another one can takes its place like the bad guys are an avalanche and im trying to stay ahead of it by shoveling maybe im just tired or maybe im wondering if mendez was right maybe you cant be one of the good guys if you spend most of your time shooting people to death i dont know what bothers me more that i can shoot someone in the face whos begging for their life or that legally theres no other option i dont mind killing to defend my life and the lives of others i dont mind killing if the person has truly earned it id cap vittorio in a heartbeat but what if the girl in the condo had told the truth what if because her master told her to do something she had no choice what if away from the bad guy shes not a bad guy oh hell i dont know the only thing i know for certain is that it isnt my job to worry about how the poor bastard turned into a killer its my job to make sure they never kill anyone else again thats what i do i am the executioner murder someone in my town and im the one that you get to see once
