jim butcher small favor the dresden files a novel of the dresden files acknowledgments many folks deserve thanks as usual particularly my family who has to put up with my insanity during deadline crunches my agent jenn who has to make excuses to my editor when im late and my editor anne who in turn has to make excuses for me to her bosses plus the beta asylum who have the ongoing task of pointing out warts on my babies the lunatics this time i have to add new folks to the listthe local and visiting players at nero central who were good enough to step around me during various roleplay and combat actions while i finished off the last few chapters of small favor in the corner of the tavern chapter one w inter came early that year it should have been a tipoff a snowball soared through the evening air and smacked into my apprentices mouth since she was muttering a mantrastyle chant when it hit her she wound up with a mouthful of frozen cheerwhich may or may not have been more startling for her than for most people given how many metallic piercings were suddenly in direct contact with the snow molly carpenter sputtered spitting snow and a round of hooting laughter went up from the children gathered around her tall blond and athletic dressed in jeans and a heavy winter coat she looked natural in the snowy setting her cheeks and nose turning red with the cold concentration molly i called i carefully kept any laughter i might have wanted to indulge in from my voice youve got to concentrate again the children her younger brothers and sisters immediately began packing fresh ammunition to hurl at her the backyard of the carpenter house was already thoroughly chewed up from an evening of winter warfare and two low fortress walls faced each other across ten yards of open lawn molly stood between them shivering and gave me an impatient look this cant possibly be real training she said her voice quavering with cold youre just doing this for your own sick amusement harry i beamed at her and accepted a freshly made snowball from little hope who had apparently appointed herself my squire i thanked the small girl gravely and bounced the snowball on my palm a few times nonsense i said this is wonderful practice did you think you were going to start off bouncing bullets molly gave me an exasperated look then she took a deep breath bowed her head again and lifted her left hand her fingers spread wide she began muttering again and i felt the subtle shift of energies moving as she began drawing magic up around her in an almost solid barrier a shield that rose between her and the incipient missile storm ready i called out aim every single person there including myself threw before i got to the end of aim and snowballs sped through the air flung by children ranging from the eldest daniel who was seventeen down to the youngest little harry who wasnt yet big enough to have much of a throwing arm but who didnt let that stop him from making the largest snowball he could lift snowballs pelted my apprentices shield and it stopped the first two the frozen missiles exploding into puffs of fresh powder the rest of them though went right on through mollys defenses and she was splattered with several pounds of snow little harry ran up to her and threw last with both hands and shrieked merry triumph as his breadloafsized snowball splattered all over mollys stomach fire i barked belatedly molly fell onto her butt in the snow sputtered some more and burst out in a long belly laugh harry and hope the youngest of the children promptly jumped on top of her and from there the lesson in defensive magic devolved into the carpenter childrens longstanding tradition of attempting to shovel as much snow as possible down the necks of one anothers coats i grinned and stood there watching them and a moment later found the childrens mother standing beside me molly took after charity carpenter who had passed her coloring and build on to her daughter charity and i havent always seen eyetoeyewell in point of fact weve hardly ever seen eyetoeyebut tonight she was smiling at the childrens antics good evening mister dresden she murmured charity i replied amiably this happen a lot almost always during the first real snowfall of the year she said generally though its closer to christmas than halloween i watched the children romping though molly was growing quickly in a number of senses she reverted to childhood easily enough here and it did me good to see it i sensed charitys unusually intense regard and glanced at her lifting an eyebrow in question you never had a snowball fight with family she said quietly did you i shook my head and turned my attention back to the kids no family to have the fight with i said sometimes the kids would try at school but the teachers wouldnt let it happen and a lot of times the other kids did it to be mean instead of to have fun that changes things charity nodded and also looked back at the kids my daughter how is her training progressing well i think i said her talents dont lie anywhere close to the same areas mine do and shes never going to be much of a combat wizard charity frowned why do you say that do you think she isnt strong enough strength has nothing to do with it but her greatest talents make her unsuited for it in some ways i dont understand well shes good with subtle things delicate things her ability at handling fine sensitive magic is outstanding and increasing all the time but that same sensitivity means that she has problems handling the psychic stresses of real combat it also makes the gross physical stuff a real challenge for her like stopping snowballs charity asked snowballs are good practice i said nothing gets hurt but her pride charity nodded frowning but you didnt learn with snowballs did you the memory of my first shielding lesson under justin dumorne wasnt a particularly sentimental one baseballs merciful god charity said shaking her head how old were you thirteen i shrugged a shoulder pains a good motivator i learned fast but you arent trying to teach my daughter the same way charity said theres no rush i said the noise from the children stopped dropping to furtive whispers and i winked at charity she glanced from the children to me amusement evident in her face not five seconds later molly shouted now and multiple snowballs came zipping toward me i lifted my left hand focusing my will my magic and drew it into the shape of a broad flat disk in front of me it wasnt a good enough shield to stop bullets or even wellthrown baseballs but for snowballs it was just fine they shattered to powder on my shield revealing it in little flashes of pale blue light as a circular plane of force centered on the outspread fingers of my extended left hand the children laughed as they cried out their disapproval i shouted hah and lifted a triumphant fist then charity standing behind me dumped a double handful of snow down the neck of my coat i yelped as the cold ate my spinal cord jumped up out of my tracks and danced around trying to shake the snow out from under my clothes the children cheered their mother on and began flinging snowballs at more or less random targets and in all the excitement and frivolity i didnt realize that we were under attack until the lights went out the entire block plunged into darknessthe floodlights illuminating the carpenters backyard house lights in every nearby home and the streetlights were all abruptly extinguished eerie ambient werelight reflected from the snow shadows suddenly yawned where there had been none before and the scent of something midway between a skunk and a barrel of rotting eggs assaulted my nostrils i yanked my blasting rod out of its holder on the inside of my coat and said to charity get them inside emergency charity said in a far calmer voice than i had managed everyone into the safe room just like in practice the children had just begun to move when three creatures i had never seen before came bounding through the snow time slowed as the adrenaline hit my system and it felt like i had half an hour to study them they werent terribly tall maybe fivefootsix but they were layered with white fur and muscle each had a head that was almost goatlike but the horns atop them curled around to the front like a bulls rather than arching back their legs were reversejointed and ended in hooves and they moved in a series of singlelegged leaps more than running they got better air than a chicago bull too which meant i was dealing with something with supernatural strength though thinking about it i couldnt actually remember the last time id dealt with something that didnt have supernatural strength which is one of the drawbacks of the wizard business i mean some things are stronger than others sure but it wouldnt much matter to my skull if a paranormal bruiser could benchpress a locomotive or if he was merely buff enough to juggle refrigerators i trained the tip of my blasting rod on the lead whatsit and then a bunch of snow fell from above in my peripheral vision landing on the ground beside me with a soft thump i threw myself into a forward dive rolled over one shoulder and came to my feet already moving laterally i was just in time to avoid the rush of a fourth whatsit which had knocked the snow loose just before it dropped down onto me from the tree house michael had built for his kids it let out a hissing bubbling snarl i didnt have time to waste with this backstabbing twit so i raised the rod as its tip burst into scarlet flame unleashed my will and snarled fuego a wristthick lance of pure flame leapt from the blasting rod and seared the creatures upper body to blackened meat the excess heat melted snow all around it and sent up a billow of scalding steam judging by the tackle hanging between the things legs as the steam burst up from the snow it probably inflicted as much pain as the actual fire the whatsit went down and i had to hope that it wasnt bright enough to play possum the carpenter children were screaming i whirled around readying the rod again and didnt have a clear shot one of the whitefurred creatures was running hard after daniel mollys oldest brother hed begun to fill out and he ran with his fingers locked on the back of the coats of little harry and hope the youngest children carrying them like luggage he gained the door with the creature not ten feet behind him its wickedlooking horns lowered as it charged daniel went through the door and kicked it shut with his foot never slowing down and the creature slammed into it headon i hadnt realized that michael had installed allsteel woodpaneled security doors on his home just as i had on mine the creature probably would have pulverized a wooden door instead it slammed its head into the steel door horns leading the way and drove a footdeep dent into it and then it lurched away letting out a burbling shriek of pain smoke rose from its horns and it staggered back swatting at them with its threefingered clawed hands there werent many things that reacted to the touch of steel like that the other two whatsits had divided their attention one was pursuing charity who was carrying little amanda and running like hell for the workshop michael had converted from a freestanding garage the other was charging molly who had pushed alicia and matthew behind her there wasnt time enough to help both groups and even less to waste over the moral dilemma of a difficult choice i turned the rod on the beastie chasing charity and let it have it the blast hit it in the small of its back and knocked it from its hooves it flew sideways slamming into the wall of the workshop and charity dashed through the door with her daughter i turned my blasting rod back to the other creature but i already knew that i wouldnt be in time the creature lowered its horns and closed on molly and her siblings before i could line up for another shot molly i screamed my apprentice seized alicias and matthews hands gasped out a word and all three of them abruptly vanished the creatures charge carried it past the space theyd been in though something i couldnt see struck its hoof and sent it staggering it wheeled around at full speed kicking up snow as it did and i felt a sudden fierce surge of exaltation and pride the grasshopper might not be able to put up a decent shield but she could do veils like they were going out of style and shed kept her focus and her wits about her the creature slowed head sweeping and then it saw the snow being disturbed by invisible feet moving toward the house it bawled out another unworldly cry and went after them and i didnt dare risk another blast of flamenot with the carpenters house in the line of fire so instead i lifted my right hand triggered one of the triplelayered rings on it with my will and sent a burst of raw force at the whatsit the unseen energy struck it in the knees throwing its legs out from under it with such strength that its head slammed into the snow the disturbance in the snow rushed around toward the front door of the house molly must have realized that the deformation of the security door would make it difficult if not impossible to open and once again i felt fierce approval but it faded rather rapidly when the whatsit that had been playing possum behind me slammed into the small of my back like a sulfurandrotteneggdriven locomotive the horns hit hard and it hurt like hell but the defensive magic on my long black leather duster kept them from impaling me the impact knocked the wind out of me snapped my head back sharply and flung me to the snow everything got confusing for a second and then i realized that it was standing over me ripping at the back of my neck with its claws i hunched my shoulders and rolled only to be kicked in the nose by a cloven hoof and an utterly gratuitous amount of pain came with a side order of whirling stars i kept trying to get away but my motions were sluggish and the whatsit was faster than me charity stepped out of the workshop with a steelhafted ballpeen hammer in her left hand and a heavyduty contractors nail gun in her right she lifted the nail gun from ten feet away and started pulling the trigger as she walked forward it made phutphutphut sounds and the already seared whatsit started screaming in pain it leapt up wildly twisting in agonized gyrations in midair and fell to the snow thrashing i saw heavy nails sticking up out of its back and the smoking wounds were bleeding greenwhite fire it tried to run but i managed to kick its hooves out from under it before it could regain its footing charity whirled the hammer in a vertical stroke letting out a sharp cry as she did and the steel head of the tool smashed open the whatsits skull the wound erupted with greyish matter and more greenwhite fire and the creature twitched once before it went still its body being consumed by the eerie flame i stood up blasting rod still in hand and found the remaining beasties wounded but mobile their yellow rectangularpupiled eyes glaring in hate and hunger i ditched the blasting rod and picked up a steelheaded snow shovel that had been left lying next to one of the childrens snow forts charity raised her nail gun and we began walking toward them whatever these things were they didnt have the stomach for a fight against mortals armed with cold steel they shuddered as if they had been a single being then turned and bounded away into the night i stood there panting and peering around me i had to spit blood out of my mouth every few breaths my nose felt like someone had superglued a couple of live coals to it little silver wires of pain ran all through my neck from the whiplash of getting hit from behind and the small of my back felt like one enormous bruise are you all right charity asked faeries i muttered why did it have to be faeries chapter two w ell charity said its broken you think i asked the light touch of her fingers on my nose was less than pleasant but i didnt twitch or make any sounds of discomfort while she examined me its a guy thing at least it isnt out of place michael said knocking snow off of his boots getting it set back is the sort of thing you dont mind forgetting find anything i asked him the big man nodded his head and set a sheathed broadsword in a corner against the wall michael was only a couple of inches shorter than me and a lot more muscular he had dark hair and a short beard both of them peppered with silver and wore blue jeans work boots and a blueandwhite flannel shirt that corpse is still there its mostly a burned mess but it didnt dissolve yeah i said faeries arent wholly beings of the spirit world they leave corpses behind michael grunted other than that there were footprints but thats about it no sign that these goatthings were still around he glanced into the dining room where the carpenter children were gathered at the table talking excitedly and munching the pizza their father had been out picking up when the attack occurred the neighbors think the light show must have come from a blown transformer thats as good an excuse as any i said i thank god no one was hurt he said for him it wasnt just an expression he meant it literally it came of being a devout catholic and maybe from toting around a holy sword with one of the nails from the crucifixion wrought into the blade he shook himself and gave me a short smile and you of course harry thank daniel molly and charity i said i just kept our visitors busy your familys who got the little ones to safety and charity did all the actual smiting michaels eyebrows went up and he turned his gaze on his wife did she now charitys cheeks turned pink she briskly swept up the various tissues and cloths id bloodied and carried them out of the room to be burned in the lit fireplace in the living room in my business you dont ever want samples of your blood your hair or your fingernail clippings lying around for someone else to find i gave michael the rundown of the fight while she was gone my nail gun he asked grinning as charity came back into the kitchen how did you know it was a faerie i didnt she said i just grabbed what was at hand we got lucky i said michael arched an eyebrow at me i scowled at him not every good thing that happens is divine intervention michael true michael said but i prefer to give him the credit unless i have a good reason to believe otherwise it seems more polite than the other way around charity came to stand at her husbands side though they were both smiling and speaking lightly about the attack i noticed that they were holding hands very tightly and charitys eyes kept drifting over toward the children as if to reassure herself that they were still there and safe i suddenly felt like an intruder well i said rising looks like ive got a new project michael nodded do you know the motive for the attack thats the project i said i pulled my duster on wincing as the motion made me move my stiffening neck i think they were after me the attack on the kids was a diversion to give the one in the tree a shot at my back are you sure about that charity asked quietly no i admitted its possible that theyre holding a grudge about that business at arctis tor charitys eyes narrowed and went steely arctis tor was the heart of the winter court the fortress and sanctum sanctorum of queen mab herself some nasty customers from winter had stolen molly and charity and i with a little help had stormed the tower and taken molly back by main force the whole mess had been noisy as hell and wed pissed off an entire nation of wicked fae in the process of making it keep your eyes open just in case i told her and let molly know that id like her to stay here for the time being michael quirked an eyebrow at me you think she needs our protection no i said i think you might need hers michael blinked charity frowned quietly but did not dispute me i nodded to both of them and left molly wasnt rebelling against everything i told her to do purely upon reflex these days but fait accompli remained the best way of avoiding arguments with her i shut the door to the carpenter household behind me cutting off the scent of hot pizza and the sound of loudly animated childrens voices raucous after the excitement the november night was silent and very cold i fought off an urge to shiver and hurried to my car a beatup old volkswagen beetle that had originally been powder blue but was now a mix of red blue green white yellow and now primer grey on the new hood my mechanic had scrounged up some anonymous joker who had seen too many disney movies had spraypainted the number inside a circle on the hood but the cars name was the blue beetle and it was going to stay that way i sat looking at the warm golden light coming from the house for a moment then i coaxed the beetle to life and headed for home chapter three a nd youre sure they were faeries bob the skull asked i scowled how many other things get their blood set on fire when it touches iron and steel bob yes i think i know a faerie when i get my nose broken by one i was down in my lab which was accessed by means of a trapdoor in my basement apartments living room and a folding wooden stepladder its a concrete box of a room deep enough under the rest of the boardinghouse i live in to be perpetually cool in the summer thats nice come winter not so much the lab consisted of a wooden table running down the center of the room and was surrounded on three sides by tables and workbenches against the outer wall of the room leaving a narrow walkway around the table the workbenches were littered with the tools of the trade and id installed those white wire shelving units you can get pretty cheap at walmart on the walls above the benches creating more storage space the shelves were covered with an enormous variety of containers from a leadlined box to burlap bags from tupperware to a leather pouch made from the genital sac of i kid you not an actual african lion it was a gift dont ask candles burned around the room giving it light and twinkling off the pewter miniature buildings on the center table a scale model of the city of chicago id brought down a single writing desk for mollyall the room i had to spareand her own notebooks and slowly accumulating collection of gear managed to stay neatly organized despite the tiny space well it looks like someone is holding arctis tor against you bob said the skull its eye sockets glowing with orange flickers of light like candles you couldnt quite see sat on its own shelf on the uncluttered wall half a dozen paperback romance novels littered the shelf around it and a seventh had fallen from the shelf and now lay on the floor obscuring a portion of the silver summoning circle id installed there faeries dont ever forget a grudge boss i shook my head at the skull scooped up the fallen book and put it back on the shelf you ever heard of anything like these guys my knowledge of the faerie realms is mostly limited to the winter end of things bob said these guys dont sound like anything ive run into then why would they be holding the fight at arctis tor against me bob i asked hell we werent even the ones who really assaulted winters capital we just walked in on the aftermath and picked a fight with some of winters errand boys who had swiped molly maybe some of the winter sidhe hired out the vengeance gig as contract labor these could have been wyldfae you know theres a lot more wyld than anything else they could have been satyrs his eyelights brightened did you see any nymphs if there are satyrs theres bound to be a nymph or two somewhere close no bob are you sure naked girl dropdead gorgeous old enough to know better and young enough not to care id have remembered that if id seen it i said feh bob said his eyelights dwindling in disappointment you cant do anything right harry i rubbed my hand against the back of my neck it didnt make it hurt any less but it gave me something to do ive seen these goat guys or read about them before i said or at least something close to them where did i put those texts on the near reaches of the nevernever north wall green plastic box under the workbench bob provided immediately thanks i said i dragged out the heavy plastic storage box it was filled with books most of them leatherbound handwritten treatises on various supernatural topics except for one book that was a compilation of calvin and hobbes comic strips how had that gotten in there i picked up several of the books carried them to the part of the table that was modeled as lake michigan and set them down then i pulled up my stool and started flipping through them how was the trip to dallas bob asked hmmm oh fine fine someone was being stalked by a black dog i glanced up at the map of the united states hanging on the wall beneath bobs shelf on a thick piece of poster board i absently plucked a green thumbtack from the board and poked it into dallas texas where it joined more than a dozen other green pins and a very few red ones where the false alarms had been they contacted me through the paranet and i showed them how to give fido the bums rush out of town this support network thing you and elaine have going is really smart bob said teach the minnows how to gang up when a big fish shows up to eat them i prefer to think of it as teaching sparrows to band together and chase off hawks i said returning to my seat either way it means less exposure to danger and less work for you in the long run constructive cowardice very crafty i approve his voice turned wistful i hear that they have some of the best strip clubs in the world in dallas harry i gave bob a hard look if youre not going to help me at least dont distract me oh bob said check the romance id put back on the shelf quivered for a second and then flipped over and opened to the first page the skull turned toward the book the orange light from its eyes falling over the pages i went through one old text then two then three hells bells i knew id seen or read something in one of these rip her dress off bob shouted bob the skull takes paperback romances very seriously the next page turned so quickly that he tore the paper a little bob is even harder on books than i am thats what im talking about bob hollered as more pages turned they couldnt have been satyrs i mumbled out loud trying to draw my thoughts into order my nose hurt like hell and my neck hurt like someplace in the same zip code that kind of pain wears you down fast even when youre a wizard who learned his basics while being violently bombarded with baseballs satyrs have human faces these things didnt weregoats bob suggested he flipped another page and kept reading bob is a spirit of intellect and he multitasks better than well pretty much anybody or maybe goatweres i stopped for a moment and gave the skull an exasperated look i cant believe i just heard that word what bob asked brightly weregoats weregoats im fairly sure i could have led a perfectly rich and satisfying life even if i hadnt heard that word or enjoyed the mental images it conjures bob chortled stars and stones youre easy harry weregoats i muttered and went back to reading after finishing the fifth book i went back for another armload bob shouted at his book cheering during what were apparently the love scenes and heckling most of the rest as if the characters had all been live performers on a stage which would probably tell me something important about bob if i were an astute sort of person after all bob himself was essentially a spiritual creature created from the energy of thought the characters within a book were from a certain point of view identical on some fundamental levelthere werent any images of them no physical tangibility whatsoever they were pictures in the readers head constructs of imagination and ideas given shape by the writers work and skill and the readers imagination parents of a sort did bob as he read his books and imagined their events regard those constructed beings assiblings of some sort peers children could a being like bob develop some kind of acquired taste for a family it was entirely possible it might explain his constant fascination with fictional subject matter dealing with the origins of a mortal family then again he might regard the characters in the same way some men do those inflatable sex dolls i was pretty sure i didnt want to know good thing im not astute i found our attackers on the eighth book about halfway through complete with notes and sketches holy crap i muttered sitting up straight find em bob asked yeah i said and held up the book so he could see the sketch it was a better match for our goatish attackers than most police sketches of perpetrators if the book is right i just got jumped by gruffs bobs romance novel dropped to the surface of the shelf he made a choking sound um did you say gruffs i scowled at him and he began to giggle the skull rattled against the shelf gruffs he tittered what i said offended as in the three billy goats gruff the skull howled with laughter you just got your ass handed to you by a nursery tale i wouldnt say they handed me my ass i said bob was nearly strangling on his laughter and given that he had no lungs it seemed gratuitous somehow thats because you cant see yourself he choked out your nose is all swollen up and youve got two black eyes you look like a raccoon holding a dislocated ass you didnt see these things in action i said they were strong and pretty smart and there were four of them just like the four horsemen he said only with petting zoos i scowled some more fine fine i said im glad i can amuse you oh absolutely bob said his voice bubbling with mirth help me help me its the billy goats gruff i glared youre missing the point bob it cant be as funny as what has come through he said ill bet every sidhe in winter is giggling about it bet theyre not i said thats the point the gruffs work for summer theyre some of queen titanias enforcers bobs laughter died abruptly oh i nodded after that business at arctis tor i could understand if someone from winter had come after me i never figured to do this kind of business with summer well bob pointed out you did kind of give queen titanias daughter the death of a thousand cuts i grunted yeah but why send hitters now she could have done it years ago thats faeries for you bob said logic isnt exactly their strong suit i grunted life should be so simple i thumped my finger on the book thinking theres more to this im sure of it how high are they in the summer hierarchy bob asked theyre up there i said as a group anyway theyve got a reputation for killing trolls probably where the nursery tale comes from troll killers bob said trolls like mabs personal guard whose pieces you found scattered all over arctis tor exactly i said but what i did there ticked off winter not summer ive always admired your ability to be unilaterally irritating i shook my head no i must have done something there that hurt summer somehow i frowned or helped winter bob do you know the phone started ringing i had run a long extension cord from the outlet in my bedroom down to the lab after molly had nearly broken her neck rushing up the stepladder to answer a call the old windup clock on one shelf told me that it was after midnight nobody calls me that late unless its something bad hold that thought i told bob its me murphy said when i answered i need you why sergeant im touched i said youve admitted the truth at last cue sweeping romantic theme music im serious she said something in her voice sounded tired strained where i asked her she gave me the address and we hung up i barely ever got work from chicago pd anymore and between that and my frequent trips to other cities as part of my duties as a warden i hadnt been making diddly as an investigator my stipend as a warden of the white council kept me from bankruptcy but my bank account had bled slowly down to the point where i had to be really careful to avoid bouncing checks i needed the work that was murphy i said making a duty call this late at night what else could it be bob agreed watch your back extra careful boss why do you say that i said shrugging into my coat i dont know if youre up on your nursery tales bob said but if youll remember the billy goats gruff had a whole succession of brothers yeah i said each of them bigger and meaner than the last i headed out to meet murphy weregoats jesus chapter four i was standing there watching the fire with everyone else when the beat cop brought murphy over to me its about time she said her voice tense she lifted the police tape and beckoned me i had already clipped my little laminated consultants id to my dusters lapel what took you so long theres a foot of snow on the ground and it doesnt show signs of stopping i replied she glanced up at me karrin murphy is a wee little thing and the heavy winter coat she wore only made her look smaller the large fluffy snowflakes still falling clung to her golden hair and glittered on her eyelashes turning her eyes glacial blue your toy car got stuck in a drift huh what happened to your face i glanced around at all the normals i was in a snowball fight murphy grunted i guess you lost you should have seen the other guy we were standing in front of a small fivestory apartment building and something had blown it to hell the front facing of the building was just gone as if some unimaginably huge ax had sliced straight down it you could see the floors and interiors of empty apartments when you could get a glimpse of them through the pall of dust and smoke and thick falling snow fires burned in the building insubstantial behind the haze of flame and winter rubble had washed out into the street damaging the buildings on the other side and the police had everyone cordoned off at least a block away broken glass and steel and brick lay everywhere the air was acrid thick with the stench of burning materials never meant to feed a fire despite the weather a couple of hundred people had gathered at the police cordons some enterprising soul was selling hot coffee from a big thermos and i hadnt been too proud to cough up a dollar for a foam cup of java powdered creamer and a packet of sugar lots of fire trucks i noted but only one ambulance and the crew is drinking coffee while everyone else shivers in the cold i sipped at my cup the bastards building wasnt occupied murphy said being renovated actually no one got hurt i said thats a plus murphy gave me a cryptic look you willing to work off the books per diem i sipped coffee to cover up a wince i far prefer a twoday minimum i guess the city isnt coughing up much money for consultants huh sis been pooling the coffee money in case we needed your take on something this time i didnt bother to hide the wince taking money from the city government was one thing taking money from the cops in si was another special investigations was the cpds version of a pool filter things that slipped through the areas of interest of the other departments got dumped on si lots of times those things included the cruddy work no one else wanted to do so si wound up investigating everything from apparent rains of toads to dogfighting rackets to reports of el chupacabra molesting neighborhood pets from its lair in a local sewer it was a crappy job no pun intended and as a result si was regarded by the city as a kind of asylum for incompetents they werent but the inmates of si generally did share a couple of traitsintelligence enough to ask questions when something didnt make sense and an inexcusable lack of ability when it came to navigating the murky waters of office politics when sergeant murphy had been lieutenant murphy shed been in charge of si shed been busted for vanishing during twentyfour particularly critical hours of an investigation it wasnt like she could tell her superiors that she was off storming a frozen fortress in the near reaches of the nevernever now could she now her old partner lieutenant john stallings was in charge of si and he was running the place on a strained frayed often knotted shoestring of a budget hence the lack of gainful employment for chicagos only professional wizard i couldnt take their money it wasnt like they were rolling in it but at the same time they had their pride i couldnt take that either per diem i told her hell my bank account is thinner than a tobacco lobbyists moral justification ill go hourly murphy glowered up at me for a moment then gave me a grudging nod of thanks proud doesnt always outweigh practical so whats the scoop i asked arson she shrugged explosion of some kind maybe an accident maybe not i snorted yeah because you call me in on maybeaccidents all the time come on murphy pulled a dust mask from her coat pocket and put it on i took out a bandanna and tied it around my nose and mouth all i needed was a tengallon hat and some spurs to complete the image stick em up pahdner she glanced back at me her face hard to read under the dust mask and led me to the building adjacent to the ruined apartment murphys partner was waiting for us rawlins was a blocky man in his fifties comfortably overweight and looked about as soft as a brinks truck hed grown in a beard frosted with grey a sharp contrast against his dark skin and he wore a weatherbeaten old winter coat over his offtherack suit dresden he said easily good to see you i shook his hand hows the foot it aches when im about to get asked to leave he said soberly ow its better if youve got deniability murphy said folding her arms in what an astute observer might have characterized as a tone of stubborn argument youve got a family to feed rawlins sighed yeah yeah ill be out by the street he nodded to me and walked off hed recovered from being shot in the foot pretty well and wasnt limping good for him good for me too id been the one to get him into that mess deniability i asked murphy there hasnt been anything specific murphy said but people up the line from si have made it very clear that you are persona non grata that stung a bit and my voice turned a shade more brittle than i had intended oh obviously the way i keep helping cpd with things they couldnt handle themselves is just inexcusable i know murphy said im lucky they havent charged me with gross competence and contributing to social order and had me locked away she waved a tired dismissive hand its always something thats the way organizations are except that when the country club gets a bug up its nose and decides that someone is out nobody dies as a result i said and added mostly murphy glared at me what do you want me to do about it harry i called in every chip id ever collected just to keep my fucking job theres no chance at all of me making command again much less moving up to a position where i could effect real change within the department i clenched my jaw and felt a flush rising up my neck she hadnt said it but shed lost her command and any bright future for her career because shed been covering my back murph no she said her tone calmer and steadier than it might have been id really like to know dresden ive paid you out of my own pocket when the city wouldnt spend it the rest of si throws in all the money they can spare into the kitty to be able to pay you when we really need you you think maybe i should moonlight at a burger joint to pay your fees hells bells murph i said it isnt about the money its never been about the money she shrugged so what are you bitching about i thought about it for a second and said you shouldnt have to tapdance around the demands of all the ladder climbers to do your job no she said her tone frank not in a reasonable world but if you havent noticed that world must be in a different area code and it seems to me that youve had to endrun your superiors once or twice bah i said and touchй she smiled faintly it sucks but thats what weve got you done whining hell with it i said lets work murphy jerked her head at the rubblechoked alley between the damaged building and its neighbor and we started down it climbing over fallen brick and timber where necessary wed gone about three feet before the stench of sulfur and acrid brimstone seared my nostrils sharp even through the smell of the gutted apartment building theres only one thing that smells like that crap i muttered i thought it smelled familiar murphy said like back at the fortress she glanced at me andthe other times ive smelled it i pretended not to notice her glance yeah its hellfire i said theres more murphy said quietly come on we pressed on down the alley until we passed the edge of the wrecked portion of the gutted building one step there was nothing but wreckage the next the brick wall of the building reasserted itself the demarcation between structure and havoc was a rough jagged line stretching up into the dust and the snow and the smokeall except for a portion of wall perhaps five feet off the ground there instead of a broken line of shattered brick and twisted rebar a perfectly smooth semicircle bit into the wall i leaned closer frowning the scent of hellfire grew stronger and i realized that something had melted its way through the brick walla shaft of energy like a giant drill bit it had to have been almost unimaginably hot to vaporize brick and concrete and steel leaving the rim of the area it had touched melted to smooth glass though half of the basketballsized circle was missing carried away by the collapsing wall any natural source of heat like that would have sent out a thermal bloom that would have scoured the alley i was standing in leaving it blackened and sere but the alley was littered with the usual city detritus where it wasnt choked with rubble and several hours worth of snow had piled up there as well talk to me murphy said quietly no normal fire is this contained i said what do you mean i gestured vaguely with my hands fire generated with magic is still fire murph i mean sure you can call up tremendous heat and energy but once it gets to you it behaves like heat it still does business with the laws of thermodynamics so were talking mojo murphy said well technically mojo isnt she sighed are we dealing with magic or not as if the scent of hellfire werent enough to give it away yeah murphy nodded you call up fire all the time she said ive seen it do a lot of things that didnt look like normal fire oh sure i said holding my hand over the surface of the flamebored bricks they were still warm but if you want to control it once you call it up it takes additional energy to focus the fire into a desired course controlling the energy is usually as much effort as the fire itself if not more could you do something like this she asked gesturing at the building once upon a time she would have inflected that question a whole lot differently and id have gotten nervous about whether the hands in her pockets were holding a gun and handcuffs but that had been a long time ago of course back then i probably wouldnt have given her a straight answer either like i would now not a chance in hell i said quietly and not entirely metaphorically im pretty sure i couldnt call up this much energy in the first place and even if i could i wouldnt have anything left to control it with i closed my eyes for a moment trying to feel any lingering traces of power around the area but the destruction and subsequent drift of dust and snow and smoke had obscured any coherent patterns that might have given me hints about how the working had been accomplished i did however notice something else the surface of the cut was not perpendicular to the wall of the building it went in at an angle i frowned and squinted back behind me trying to line it up with the wall of the building on the other side of the alley murphy knew me well enough to see id noticed something and i knew her well enough to see her sudden interest make furrows between her eyebrows as she forced herself to be quiet and let me work i got up and went to the far side of the alley a light coating of snow and dust had coated the wall watch your eyes i murmured squinting my own to slits then i raised my right hand called up my will and murmured ventas reductas the wind i called up wasnt the usual burst i commonly used it was far more toneddown than that and it poured steadily from my outstretched hand all the work i was doing with molly had allowed me to rethink a lot of my basic evocations the fast and dirty magic that wizards used in desperate and violent situations id been trying to teach the spell to molly but she didnt have the raw strength i had and it would have practically knocked her unconscious to call up a heavy blast of air id modified my teaching just to get her comfortable with using a bit of air magic and wed accidentally developed a passable impersonation of an electric blowdryer i used the dryer spell to gently brush away dust and snow from the wall it took me about a minute and a half and when i was finished i caught another scent under the brimstone stench and said double crap murphy stepped forward with her flashlight and shone it on the wall the sigil had been painted on the wall in something thick and brown that smelled like blood at first i thought it was a pentacle but i saw the differences immediately harry murphy said quietly is it human most likely i said mortal blood is the strongest ink you can use for symbols like this in highenergy spells i dont think anything else could have contained the amounts of energy it would have taken to blow up this building its a pentacle right murphy asked like the one you wear i shook my head different how so her mouth twitched at one corner other than the blood i mean a pentacle is a symbol of order i said quietly five points five sides it represents the forces of air earth water fire and spirit its contained within a circle the points touching the outer ring it represents the forces of magic bound within human control power balanced with restraint i gestured at the symbol see here the points of the star fall far outside the ring she frowned what does it mean i have no idea i said gosh she said youre worth the money haha look even if id seen this symbol before it could mean different things to different people the hindus and the nazis have very different ideas about the swastika for example can you make a guess i shrugged off the top of my head this looks uncomfortably like a combination of the pentacle and the anarchy symbol magic unrestrained anarchist wizards murphy asked its just a guess i said my gut told me it was a good one though and i got the impression that murphy had the same feeling whats the symbol for murphy asked what is it meant to do reflect power i said my guess is that the energy that drove through the building was reflected from this sigil which means i kayaked down a logic cascade as i spoke which means that the energy had to come in from somewhere else first i turned around slowly trying to judge the angles the incoming beam must have gone right through the collapsed part of the building and beam i pointed at the semicircular hole in the ruined wall yeah heat energy a whole lot of it she studied the hole it doesnt look like it would be big enough to take down the building it isnt i said not in an explosion anyway this just drilled a hole might have started a fire as it went but it couldnt have sheared off the front of the building like that murphy frowned tilting her head then what did working on it i mumbled i judged the angles as best i could and took off down the alley the firemen were still hard at work on the building and we had to walk over several hoses as we emerged into the street at the back of the apartment building i crossed the street and walked down the length of the building there my hand raised senses questing for any residual magic i didnt find any but i did smell hellfire again and a couple of feet later i found another notpentacle identical to the first also hidden under a light dusting of snow i kept going clockwise around the ruined building i found two more symbols on the undamaged building on its next side and one more across the street from the front of the ruined apartments and then i completed the circle arriving back at our original reflective symbol five reflection points which had guided a truly freaking frightening amount of energy through the building forming one single enormous shape as they did its a pentagram i said quietly murphy frowned what i touched the round smooth bore mark on the destroyed buildings wall the beam of energy that ripped through the building right here was one of five sides of a pentagram a fivepointed star murphy regarded me blankly i reached into my pocket and pulled out a piece of chalk okay look everyone learns to draw this in grade school right i quickly sketched out a star on a clear bit of brick wallfive strokes of the chalk forming five points right right murphy said you get them from the teacher when you get an a another example of symbols having disparate meanings i said but look here in the middle i filled in the closed shape in the center of the star thats a pentagon shape see the center of the pentagram thats where you contain whatever it is youre trying to contain what do you mean contain a pentagram like this one is a symbol of power i said its got a lot of uses depending on how you employ it but most often you use it to isolate or contain an entity you mean like summoning a demon murphy said sure i said but you can use it to trap other things too if you do it right remember the circle of power at harley macfinns place five candles formed the pentagram on that one murphy shuddered i remember but it wasnt this big no i admitted and the bigger you make it the more juice it takes to keep it going ive never ever heard of one that would take this much energy to activate i drew little x shapes at the points of the star and drew the chalk from one to the next thickening the lines of the example pentagram get it the beam streamed from one reflector to the next melting holes through the building as it went the reflectors formed the beam into one huge pentagram at ground level more or less murphy frowned and squinted at the simple diagram the center of that shape couldnt have covered the whole building no i said id need a good map to be sure but i think the center of the pentagram must have been about twenty feet back from the front door which is why only the front half of the building collapsed the explosion came from inside this pentagon thing magical tnt i shrugged the explosion came from inside the pentagrams center but not necessarily from the pentagram i mean it could have been a normal device of some kind square in the middle of the giant scary pentagram murphy asked maybe i said nodding it depends on what the pentagram was being employed for and to know that id have to know which way was its north i circled the topmost point of the chalk pentacle the direction of the first line i mean does it make a difference yeah i said most everybody draws those stars just like i did bottom left to the topmost point as the first stroke thats how you draw it when you want to defend something ward something away from a location or banish a spiritual entity so this could have been a banishing spell murphy asked its possible but you can do a lot of other things with it if you draw it differently like build a cage for things murphy said yeah i frowned troubled or open a doorway for something which judging by your face would be bad i i shook my head i didnt even want to know what kind of terror would need a pentagram that huge in order to squeeze into our world i think if something sized to fit this pentagram had come through it there would probably be more than one building on fire oh murphy said quietly look until i know what the pentagrams purpose was all i can do is speculate and theres something else weird here too whats that theres not a trace of residual magic and there should be hell with this much power being tossed around the whole area should practically be glowing it isnt murphy nodded slowly youre saying they wiped their prints i grimaced exactly and i have no idea how to do it hells bells i didnt know it was possible i sipped at my coffee in the silence and pretended the shiver that went down my spine was from the cold i passed the cup to murphy who took a sip from the opposite side and passed it back to me so she said were left with questions what is a majorleague supernatural hitter doing placing a huge pentagram under an empty apartment building what was his goal in creating it and why blow up the building afterward i frowned and thought of an even better question why this building i turned to murphy who owns it lake michigan ventures murphy replied a subsidiary of mitigation unlimited whose ceo is triple crap i spat gentleman johnnie marcone chapter five i tried to collect some of the blood in the reflective symbols and use it in a tracking spell to follow it back to its original owner but it was a bust either the blood was already too dry to use or else the person who had donated it was dead i had a bad feeling it wasnt the winter air that made the spell fail typical nothing was ever simple when marcone was involved gentleman johnnie marcone was the robber baron of the streets of chicago and the undisputed lord of its criminal underworld though hed long been under legal siege the bastions of paperwork defended by legions of lawyers had never been conquered and his power base had grown steadily and quietly they probably could have tried harder to take him down but the heartless fact of the matter was that marcones management style was a better alternative than most hed put the civil back in civil offender harshly cutting down on violence against civilians and law enforcement alike it didnt make his business any less ugly just tidier but it could have been worse as far as the citys authorities were concerned of course the authorities didnt know that it was worse marcone had begun expanding his power base into the supernatural world as well signing on to the unseelie accords as a freeholding lord it made him in the eyes of the authorities of the supernatural world a kind of small neutral state a recognizable power and i had no doubt that hed begun using that new power to do what he always didcreate more of the same all of which had been made possible by harry dresden and the truly galling thing about the entire situation was that it had been the least evil of the options that had been available to me at the time i looked up from the circle id chalked on the concrete beneath a sheltered overhang in the alley and shook my head sorry cant get anything maybe the blood is too dry maybe the donor is dead murphy nodded ill keep an eye on the morgues then i broke the circle with a swipe of my hand and rose from my knees can i ask you something murphy said sure why dont you ever use pentagrams all i ever see you draw is circles i shrugged pr mostly run around making lots of fivepointed stars in this country and people start screaming about satan including the satanists ive got enough problems if i need a pentagram i usually just imagine it you can do that magics in your head mostly building an image in your mind and holding it there theoretically you could do everything without any chalk or symbols or anything else then why dont you because its a pointlessly difficult effort for identical results i squinted up at the stillfalling snow youre a cop i need a doughnut she snorted as we left the alley stereotype much dresden cops do a lot of running around in their cars and they dont always get to control their hours murph lots of times they cant leave a crime scene to hit a drivethrough so they need food that can sit in a car for hours and hours without tasting foul or giving them food poisoning doughnuts are good for that so are granola bars is rawlins a masochist too murphy casually bumped her shoulder against my arm when i was between steps making me wobble and i grinned we emerged onto the mostly empty street the firemen had been wrapping up their job when i arrived and every truck but one had departed once the flames were out the show was over and there were no rubberneckers anymore only a few cops were in sight most of them in their cars so what happened to your face murphy asked i told her she concealed a smile the three billy goats gruff hey theyre tough all right they kill trolls i saw you do that once how hard could it be i found myself grinning i had a little help murphy matched my smile one more short joke and im taking a kneecap murphy i chided petty violence is beneath you which is saying something keep it up wise guy im always going to be taller than you once youre lying unconscious on the ground youre right that was a low blow ill try to rise above it she showed me a clenched fist pow dresden right to the moon we reached murphys car rawlins was in the passenger seat pretending to snore he wasnt the sort to just fall asleep so summer made a run at you murphy said you think the attack on marcones building is connected with that i lost my faith in coincidence i said get in she said ill give you a ride home i shook my head there might be something i can do here but i need to be alone and i need a doughnut murphy arched a delicate darkgold eyebrow oooooookay get your mind out of the gutter and give me the damned doughnut murphy shook her head and got in her car she tossed me a sack from dunkin donuts that was sitting on rawlinss side of the dashboard hey rawlins protested without opening his eyes for a good cause i told him nodding my thanks to murphy call you when i know something she frowned at my nose you sure you want to be alone i winked one of my blackened eyes at her some things a wizard has to do for himself i said rawlins swallowed a titter i get no respect they drove off and left me in the silently falling snow in the still hours before dawn there were still a couple of fire crews and uniform cops there the latter blocking off the street though the former werent actively firefighting the building was out and coated in a layer of icebut i guess there always could have been something hidden in the walls and ready to pop out again i overheard one of them telling another that the road crew that was supposed to clean the rubble out of the street was helping a city plow truck stuck in the snow and would be there when they could i trudged to about a block away found an alley not choked and went in with my doughnut i debated for a moment what approach i would take my relationship with this particular source had changed over the years after all reason indicated that sticking with longstanding procedure was my best bet instinct told me that reason had disappointed me more than once and that it wasnt thinking in the long term anyway over the years my instincts and i have gotten cozy so instead of bothering with a simple baitandsnare i braced my feet held out my right hand palm up placed the doughnut upon it like an offering and murmured a name names capital n have power if you know somethings name you automatically have a conduit with which you can reach out and touch it a way to home in on it with magic sometimes that can be a really bad idea speak the name of a big bad spiritual entity and you might be able to touch it surebut it can touch you right back and the big boys tend to do it a lot harder than any mortal its worth as much as your soul to speak the name of beings like that but the nevernever is a big place and not to mix metaphors but there are plenty of fish in that sea there are literally countless beings of far less metaphysical significance and it really isnt terribly difficult to get one of them to do your bidding by invoking its name people have names too sort of mortals have this nasty habit of constantly reassessing their personal identity their values their beliefs and it makes it a far more slippery business to use a mortals name against them i know a few names i invoked this one as lightly and gently as i could in an effort to be polite it didnt take me long maybe a dozen repetitions of the name before the entity it summoned appeared a basketballsized globe of blue light dived out of the snow overhead and hurtled down the alley toward my face i stood steady as it came on even with relatively minor summonings you never let them see you flinch the globe snapped to an instant halt about a foot away from the doughnut and i could just make out the luminous shape of the tiny humanoid figure within tiny but not nearly so tiny as the last time i had seen him hells bells he must have been twice as tall as the last time wed spoken toottoot i said nodding to the pixie toot snapped to attention piping my lord the pixie looked like an athletically slender youth dressed in armor made of discarded trash his helmet had been made from the cap to a threeliter bottle of cocacola and tufts of his fine lavender hair drifted all around its rim he wore a breastplate made from what looked like a carefully reshaped bottle of peptobismol and carried a box knife sheathed in orange plastic on a rubberband strap over one shoulder rough lettering on the box knifes case written in what looked like black nail polish proclaimed pizza or death a long nail its base carefully wrapped in layers of athletic adhesive tape was sheathed in the hexagonal plastic casing of a ballpoint pen at his side he must have lifted the boots from a ken doll or maybe a vintage gi joe youve grown i said bemused yes my lord toottoot barked i arched an eyebrow is that the box knife i gave you yes my lord he shrilled this is my box knife there are many who like it but this one is mine toots words were crisply precise and i realized that he was imitating the drill sergeant from full metal jacket i throttled the sudden smile trying to fight its way onto my face it looked like he was taking it seriously and i didnt want to crush his tiny feelings what the hell i could play along at ease soldier my lord he said he saluted by slapping the heel of his hand against his forehead and then buzzed a quick circle around the doughnut staring at it intently that he declared in a voice much more like his usual one is a doughnut is it my doughnut harry it could be i said im offering it as payment toot shrugged disinterestedly but the pixies dragonfly wings buzzed in excitement for what information i said i jerked my head at the fallen building there was a seriously large sigilworking done in and around that building several hours ago i need to know anything the little folk know about what happened a little flattery never hurt and when i need information from the little folk youre the best there is toot his peptoarmored chest swelled up a bit with pride many of my people are beholden to you for freeing them from the pale hunters harry some of them have joined the zalords guard pizza lord was the title some of the little folk had bestowed upon melargely because i provided them with a weekly bribe of pizza most dont know it even in my circles but the little folk are everywhere and they see a lot more than anyone expects my policy of mozzarelladriven goodwill had secured the affections of a lot of the locals when id demanded that a sometime ally of mine set free several score of the folk who had been captured id risen even higher in their collective estimation even so zalords guard was a new one on me i have a guard i asked toot threw out his chest of course who do you think keeps the dread beast mister from killing the brownies when they come to clean up your apartment we do who lays low the mice and rats and ugly big spiders who might crawl into your bed and nibble on your toes we do fear not zalord neither the foulest of rats nor the cleverest of insects shall disturb your home while we draw breath i hadnt realized that in addition to the cleaning service id acquired an exterminator too handy as hell though now that i thought about it there were things in my lab that wouldnt react well to becoming rodent nest material outstanding i told him but do you want the doughnut or not toottoot didnt even answer he just shot off down the alleyway like a runaway paper lantern but so quickly that he left falling snow drifting in contrail spirals in his wake typically speaking faeries get things done in a hurrywhen they want to at any rate even so id barely had time to hum through when you wish upon a star before toottoot returned the edges of the sphere of light around him had changed color flushing into an agitated scarlet run toottoot piped as he streaked down the alley run my lord i blinked of all the things id imagined hearing from the little fae on his return that had not been on my list run he shrilled whirling in panicked circles around my head my brain was still processing what about the doughnut i asked like an idiot toottoot zipped over to me set his shoulders against my forehead and pushed for all he was worth he was stronger than he looked i had to take a step back or be overbalanced forget the doughnut he shouted run my lord forget the doughnut that more than anything jarred me into motion toottoot was not the sort to give in to panic for that matter the little fae had always seemed to benot ignorant so much as innocent of the realization of danger hed always been oblivious to danger in the past when there was mortal food on the line in the silence of the snowy evening i heard a sound coming from the far end of the alley footsteps quiet and slow a quivering fearful little voice in my head told me to listen to toot and i felt my heart speed up as i turned and ran in the direction hed indicated i cleared the alley and turned left slogging through the deepening snow there was a police station only two or three blocks from here there would be lights and people there and it would probably serve as a deterrent to whatever was after me toot flew beside me just over my shoulder and hed produced a little plastic sports whistle he blew on it in a sharp rhythm and through the falling snow i dimly saw half a dozen spheres of light of various colors all smaller than toots appear out of the night and begin to parallel our course i ran for another block then two and as i did i became increasingly certain that something was following in my wake it was a disturbing sensation a kind of crawly tingle on the back of my neck and i was sure that i had attracted the attention of something truly terrible mounting levels of fear followed that realization and i ran for all i was worth i turned right and spotted the police station house its exterior lighting a promise of safety its lamps girded with haloes in the falling snow then the wind came up and the whole world turned frozen and white i couldnt see anything not my own feet as i struggled through the snow and not the hand i tried holding up in front of my face i slipped and went down and then bounced back to my feet in a panic certain that if my pursuer caught me on the ground i would never stand again i slammed a shoulder into a light pole and staggered back from it i couldnt tell which way i was facing in the whiteout had i accidentally stumbled into the street there would probably be no cars moving in this mess but if one was even slowly id never see it in time to get out of the way i wouldnt be able to hear a car horn either the snow was coming so thick now that i had trouble breathing i picked a direction that seemed as if it would take me to the police station and hurried on within a few steps i found a building with one outstretched hand i used it to guide me leaning one hand against the solid wall that worked fine for twenty feet or so and then the wall vanished and i stumbled sideways into an alley the howling wind went silent and the sudden stillness around me was a shock to my senses i pushed myself to my hands and knees and looked behind me on the street the blinding curtain of snow still swirled thick and white and impenetrable beginning as suddenly as a wall in the alley the snow was barely an inch deep and except for a distant moan of wind it was silent at that instant i realized that the silence was not an empty one i wasnt alone the glittering snow on the alley floor blended seamlessly into a sparkling white gown tinted here and there with streaks of frozen blue or glacial green i lifted my eyes she wore the gown with inhuman elegance its rippling fabric draping with feminine perfection her body a perfect balance of curves and planes beauty and strength the gown was cut low and left her shoulders and arms bare her skin made the snow seem a bit sallow by comparison glittering colors flickered at her wrists her throat and upon her fingers always changing cycling through deep blue and green and violet iridescence her fingernails glittered with the same impossibly shifting hues upon her head was a circlet of ice elegant and intricate as if it had been formed from a single crystalline snowflake her hair was long past her hips long and silken and white blending into the gown and the snow her lipsher gorgeous sensual lipswere the color of frozen raspberries she was a vision of beauty the kind that has inspired artists for centuries immortal beauty that is rarely imagined much less actually seen beauty like hers should have struck me senseless with joy it should have made me weep and give thanks to the almighty that i had been allowed to look upon it it should have stopped my breath and made my heart lurch with delight it didnt it terrified me it terrified me because i could also see her eyes they were wide feline eyes vertically slitted like a cats they shifted color in time with her gemsor more likely the gems changed color in time with her eyes and though they too were beautiful beyond the bounds of mortality they were cold eyes inhuman eyes filled with intelligence and desire but empty of compassion or pity i knew those eyes i knew her if fear hadnt taken the strength from my limbs i would have run a second form appeared from the darkness behind her and hovered in the shadows at her side like an attendant it resembled the outline of a catif any domestic cat ever grew so large i couldnt see the color of its fur but its greengold eyes reflected the cold blue light luminous and eerie and well should you bow mortal mewled the feline shape its voice was damned eerie throbbing in strange cadences while producing human sound from an inhuman throat bow before mab the queen of air and darkness bow before the monarch of the unseelie fae the winter court of the sidhe chapter six i gritted my teeth and tried to summon up a salvo of snark it wouldnt come i was just too scaredand with good reason think of every fairytale villainess youve ever heard of think of the wicked witches the evil queens the mad enchantresses think of the alluring sirens the hungry ogresses the savage shebeasts think of them and remember that somewhere sometime theyve all been real mab gave them lessons hell i wouldnt be surprised if shed set up some sort of certification process just to make sure they were all up to snuff mab was the ruler of fully half of the realm of faerie those areas of the nevernever the spirit world closest to our own and she was universally respected and feared id seen her seen her in the merciless clarity of my wizards sight and i knewnot just suspected but knewexactly what kind of creature she was fucking terrifying thats what so terrifying that i couldnt summon up a single wiseass comment and that just doesnt happen to me i couldnt talk but i could move i pushed myself to my feet i shook with the cold and the fear but faced the faerie queen and lifted my chin once id done that proved that i knew where my backbone was i was able to use it as a reference point to find my larynx my voice came out coarse rough with apprehension what do you want with me mabs mouth quivered at the corners turning up into the tiniest of smiles the feline voice spoke again as mab tilted her head i want you to do me a favor i frowned at her and then at the dimly seen feline shape behind her is that grimalkin back there the feline shapes eyes gleamed indeed grimalkin said the servitor behind me bears that name i blinked for a second confusion stealing some of the thunder from my terror the servitor behind you theres no one behind you grimalkin mabs expression flickered with annoyance her lips compressing into a thin line when grimalkin spoke his voice bore the same expression the servitor is my voice for the time being wizard and nothing more ah i said i glanced between the two of them and my curiosity took the opportunity to sucker punch terror while confusion had it distracted i felt my hands stop shaking why would the queen of air and darkness need an interpreter mab lifted her chin slightly a gesture of pride and another small smile quirked her mouth you are already in my debt the eerie surrogate voice said for her an you wish an answer to that question you would incur more obligation yet i do not believe in charity theres a shock i muttered under my breath whew my banter gland had not gone necrotic but you missed the point of the question i think why would mab need such a thing shes an immortal a demigod mab opened her mouth as grimalkin said ah i perceive you doubt my identity she let her head drift back a bit mouth open and an eerie little laugh drifted up from her servitor just as you did in our first meeting i frowned that was correct when mab first walked into my office in mortal guise years ago i noticed that something was off and subsequently discovered who she really was as far as i knew no one else had been privy to that meeting perhaps youd care to reminisce over old times mewled the eerie voice mab winked at me crap shed done that the last time id bumped into her and once again no one else knew anything about it id been indulging in wishful thinking hoping she was fake she was the real mab mab showed me her teeth three favors you owed me mab saidsort of two yet remain i am here to create an opportunity for you to remove one of them from our accounting uhhuh i said how are you going to do that her smile widened showing me her delicately pointed canines i am going to help you yeah this couldnt be good i tried to keep my voice steady and calm what do you mean behold mab gestured with her right hand and the layer of snow on the ground stirred and moved until it had risen into a sculpture of a building about eighteen inches high it was like watching a sand castle melt in reverse i thought i recognized the building is that the building the lady knight asked you to examine confirmed mabs surrogate voice its amazing what you can get used to if your daily allowance of bizarre is high enough as it was before the working that rent it asunder other shapes began to form from the snow rather disconcertingly detailed shapes of cars rolled smoothly by beside the building typical chicago trafficuntil one of them an expensive town car turned down the alley beside the building the one id walked down not an hour before i had to take a couple of steps to follow it as it came to a halt and stopped the snow cars doors opened and human shapes the size of the old star wars action figures came hurrying out of the vehicle i recognized them the first was a flattop noneck bruiser named hendricks marcones personal bodyguard and enforcer his mother was a kodiak bear his father was an abrams tank and after he got out of the car he reached back into it and came out with a light machine gun that he carried in one hand while hendricks was doing that a woman got out of the other side of the car gard was tall six feet or so though hendricks made her look petite she wore a smart business suit with a long trench coat and as i watched she opened the cars trunk and removed a broadsword and an allmetal shield maybe two feet across she passed her hand over the surface of the shield and then quickly covered it with a section of cloth that had apparently been cut to fit it both of them moved in a tense precise professionally concerned cadence the third man out of the car was marcone himself a man of medium height and build wearing a suit that cost more than my car and he looked as relaxed and calm as he always did marcone was criminal scum but ill give the rat his duehes got balls that drag the ground when he walks marcones head whipped around abruptly back down the alley the way theyd just come though neither hendricks nor gard reacted with a similar motion he produced a gun with such speed that it almost seemed magical and little puffs of frost blazed out from the muzzle of the snowsculpted weapon hendricks reacted immediately turning to bring that monster weapon to bear and tiny motes of blue light flashed down the alley representing tracer fire gard put her shield and her body between marcone and whatever was at the end of the alley they hurried into a side door of the building one that had been destroyed in the collapse hendricks followed still spraying bursts of fire down the alley he too vanished into the building hells bells i breathed marcone was inside mab flicked her hand in a slashing gesture and the top twothirds of the little snow building disintegrated under a miniature arctic gale i was left with a cutaway image of the buildings interior marcone and his bodyguards moved through the place like rats through a maze they sprinted down a flight of stairs at the bottom marcone stabbed at some kind of keypad with short sharp precise motions and then looked up heavy sheets of what looked like steel fell into place at the top and bottom of the stairs simultaneously and i could all but hear the ominous boom as they settled into place gard reached up and touched the center of the near door and there was a flash of light bright enough to leave little spots in my vision then they hurried down a short hallway to another keypad and repeated the process more doors more flashes of light locking himself in i muttered frowning then i got it wards blast doors its a panic room he built a panic room grimalkin made a low lazy yowling sound that i took for a murmur of agreement my own apartment was set up with a similar set of protections which i could invoke if absolutely necessarythough granted my setup was a little more merlin and a little less bond but i had to wonder what the hell had rattled marcone enough to send him scurrying for a deep hole then gards head snapped up looking directly at where mab currently stood as if the little snow sculpture could somehow see the titanic form of the winter queen looking down upon her gard reached into her suit pocket drew out what looked like a slender wooden box the kind that really highend pen sets come in sometimes and took a small rectangular plaque of some kind from the box she lifted it facing mab again and snapped the little plaque in her fingers the entire snow sculpture collapsed on itself and was gone they saw the hidden camera i muttered within her limits the chooser is resourceful and clever mab replied the baron was wise to acquire her services i glanced up at mab what happened all sight was clouded for several moments then this at another gesture the building reformedbut this time little clouds of frost simulated thick smoke roiling all around it obscuring many details the whole image in fact looked hazier grainier as if mab had chosen to form it out of snowflakes a few sizes too large to illustrate details even so i recognized marcone when he came stumbling out the front door of the building several forms hurried out behind him they surrounded him a plain van appeared out of the night and the unknown figures cast him through its open doors then they entered and were gone as the van pulled away the building shuddered and collapsed in on itself sliding down into the wreckage and ruin id seen i have chosen you to be my emissary mab said to me you will repay me a favor owed you will find the baron the hell i will i said before my brain had time to weigh in on the sentiment mab let out a low throaty laugh you will wizard child an you wish to survive you have no choice anger flared in my chest and shoved my brain aside on its way to my mouth that wasnt our deal i snapped our bargain stipulated that i would choose which favors to repay and that you would not coerce me mabs frozenberry lips lifted in a silent snarl and the world turned into a curtain of white agony that centered on my eyes nothing had ever hurt so much i fell down but i wasnt lucky enough to hit my head and knock myself unconscious i couldnt move i couldnt breathe i couldnt scream then there was something cold beside me and something very soft and very cold touched my ear i recognized the sensation from the far side of the pain lips mabs lips the queen of air and darkness placed a gentle row of kisses down the outside ridge of my ear then sucked the lobe into her mouth and bit down quite gently in the other ear i heard grimalkins voice speaking in a low tense hungry whisper mortal brute whatever your past whatever your future know this i am mab and i keep my bargains question my given word again ape and i will finish freezing the water in your eyes the pain receded to something merely torturous and i clenched my teeth down hard over a scream i could move again i flinched away from her scrambling until my back hit a wall i covered my eyes with my hands and felt some of my frozen eyelashes snap i sat there for a minute struggling to control the pain and my vision gradually faded from white to a deep red and then to black i opened my eyes i could barely focus them i felt a wetness on my face touched it with a finger there was blood in my tears i have not coerced you nor dispatched any agent of mine to do so mab continued as if the break in the conversation had never happened nonetheless if you wish to survive you will serve me i assure you that summers agents will not rest until you are dead i stared at her for a second still halfdazed from the pain and once again deeply sincerely and wisely frightened this is another point of contention between you and titania when one court moves the other perforce moves with it mab said i croaked titania wants marcone dead put simply she replied and her emissary will continue to seek your death only by finding and saving the barons life will you preserve your own she paused unless unless unless you should agree to take up the mantle of the winter knight mab said smiling i should be forced to choose another emissary if you did and your involvement in this matter could end her eyelids lowered sleepily sensual and her surrogate voice turned liquid heady an audible caress as my knight you would know power and pleasure that few mortals have tasted the winter knight the mortal champion of the winter court the previous guy who had that job was when last i knew still crucified upon a frozen tree within bonds of ice tortured to the point of death and then made whole only to begin the process again hed lost his sanity somewhere in one of the cycles he wasnt a real nice guy when i knew him but no human being should have to suffer like that no i said i dont want to end up like lloyd slate he suffers for your decision she said he remains alive until you take up the mantle accept my offer wizard child give him release preserve your life taste of power like none you have known her eyes seemed to grow larger becoming almost luminous and her notvoice was a narcotic a promise there is much i can teach you a decent person would have rejected her offer out of hand im not always one of those i could offer you some excuses if you like i could tell you that i was an orphan by the time i was six i could tell you that the foster father who eventually raised me subjected me to more forms of psychological and physical abuse than you could shake a stick at i could tell you that id been held in unjust suspicion for my entire adult life by the white council whose principles and ideals id done my best to uphold or maybe i could say that id seen too many good people get hurt or that id looked upon a lot of nasty things with my indelible wizards sight i could tell you that id been caught and abused by the creatures of the night myself and that i hadnt ever really gotten over it i could tell you that i hadnt gotten laid in a really long time and all of those things would be true but the fact of the matter is that theres simply a part of me that isnt so nice theres a part of me that gets off on laying waste to my enemies with my power that gets tired of taking undeserved abuse theres this little voice inside my head that sometimes wants to throw the rules away stop trying to be responsible and just take what i want and for a minute i wondered what it might be like to accept mabs offer life among the sidhe would beintense in every sense a mortal could imagine what would it be like to live in a house hell probably a big house if not a freaking castle money hot showers every day every meal a feast id be able to afford whatever clothes i wanted whatever cars i wanted maybe i could do some traveling see places id always wanted to see hawaii italy australia i could learn to sail like i always wanted women oh yeah hot and cold running girls inhumanly beautiful sensuous creatures like the one before me the winter knight had status and power and those are even more of an aphrodisiac to the fae than they are to us mortals i could havealmost anything all it would cost me was my soul and no im not talking about anything magical or metaphysical im talking about the core of my identity about what makes harry dresden who and what he is if i lost those things the things that define me then what would be left just a heap of bodily processesand regret i knew that but all the same the touch of mabs chilled lips on my ear lingered on sending slow pleasant ripples of sensation through me when i breathed it was enough to make me hesitate no mab i said finally i dont want the job she studied my face with calm heavy eyes liar she said quietly you want it i can see it in you i gritted my teeth the part of me that wants it doesnt get a vote i said im not going to take the job period she tilted her head to one side and stared at me one day wizard you will kneel at my feet and ask me to bestow the mantle upon you but not today no mab said today you repay me a favor just as i said you would i didnt want to think too hard about that and i didnt want to openly agree with her either so instead i nodded at the patch of ground where the sculptures had been who took marcone i do not know that is one reason i chose you emissary you have a gift for finding what is lost if you want me to do this for you im going to need to ask you some questions i said mab glanced up as if consulting the stars through the stillfalling snow time time time will there never be an end to it she shook her head wizard child the hour has nearly passed i have duties upon which to attendas do you you should rise and leave this place immediately why i asked warily i got to my feet because when your little retainer warned you of danger wizard child he was not referring to me on the street outside the alley the galeforce wind and the white wall of blowing snow both died away on the other side of the street two men in long coats and big stetson hats stood facing the alley i felt the sudden weight of their attention and got the impression that they had been surprised to see me i whirled to speak to mabonly to find her gone grimalkin too both of them vanished without a trace or a whisper of power to betray it i turned back to the street in time to see the two figures step off the sidewalk and begin moving toward me with long strides they were both tall nearly my own height and thickly built the snowfall hadnt lightened and the street was a smooth pane of unbroken snow they were leaving cloven footprints on it crap i spat and fled back down the narrow featureless alley chapter seven a t this sign of retreat the two men threw back their heads and let out shrill bleating cries their hats fell off when they did revealing the goatlike features and curling horns of gruffs but they were bigger than the first attack teambigger stronger and faster and as they closed the distance on me i noticed something else both of them had produced submachine guns from beneath their coats oh come on i complained as i ran thats just not fair they started shooting at me which was bad news wizard or not a bullet through the head will splatter my brains just as randomly as the next guys the really bad news was that they werent just spraying bullets everywhere even with an automatic weapon it isnt easy to hit a moving target and the old spray and pray method of fire relied upon blind luck disguised as the law of averages shoot enough bullets and eventually you have to hit something do your shooting like that and sometimes youll hit the target and sometimes you wont but the gruffs shot like professionals they fired in short burping little bursts aimed fire even if it suffered from the fact that they were moving while they did it i felt something hit my back just to the left of my spine an impact that felt somewhat like getting slugged in the back by someone with a single knuckle extended it was a sharp unpleasant sensation and the way my balance wavered was more due to the fact that it surprised and frightened me than to the actual force it imparted i kept running ducking my head down as far as i could hunching up my shoulders the defensive magics woven into my coat could evidently stop whatever rounds the gruffs were using but that didnt mean an unlucky ricochet couldnt bounce some lead into me from the front or sides around the coatand getting shot in the lower legs ankles or feet would probably kill me as certainly as one through the head it would just take a little more effort on the gruffs part to make it stick its hard to think when someones trying to kill you we human beings arent wired to be rational and creative when we know our lives are in danger of a swift and violent end the body has definite ideas of which survival strategies it prefers to embrace and those are generally limited to rip threat to pieces or run like hell no thinking need be involved as far as our instincts are concerned our instincts were a long time in the making though and the threats that can come after us now have outpaced them you cant outrun a bullet and you dont go handtohand with a gunman unless youre certain you are about to die anyway speed and mindless aggression werent going to keep me alive i needed to figure a way out i felt another bullet hit the lower part of my coat it caught spellstrengthened leather and tugged it forward just the way a thrown rock might have done admittedly though the rock wouldnt have made that angryhornet buzzing noise as it struck i dumped a garbage can over behind me hoping it might trip up the gruffs for a second and buy me a little time hey you try coming up with a cogent rational course of action when youre running down a frozen alley with genuine fairytale creatures chasing you spitting bullets at your back its way harder than it looks i didnt dare turn to face them i could have raised a shield to stop the gunfire but once i had stopped moving i figured odds were fantastic that one of them would just hop over me like a kung fu theater extra and theyd come at me from two directions at once in fact if i were them and had tracked me to that alley the chattering gunfire from behind me ceased and i realized what was happening i raised my staff as i neared the far end of the alley pointed it ahead of me and screamed forzare my timing wasnt perfect the unseen force i released from the end of the staff rushed out ahead of me an invisible battering ram it struck the third gruff just as the faethug stepped around the corner a massive oak cudgel readied in his hands the blast didnt hit him squarely it would have thrown him a goodly ways if it had instead it caught the right side of his body ripping the cudgel away from him and sending the gruff into a drunken spinning stagger i dont know much about goats but i do know a little about horses having taken care of my second mentor ebenezar mccoys riding horses on his little farm in missouri their feet are awfully vulnerable especially considering how much weight theyre putting on such a relatively small area any one of a hundred little things can go wrong one of them is the possibility that some of the surprisingly frail little bones just above the back of the hoof could be fractured or broken a pastern or fetlock injury like that can lame a horse for weeks even permanently so as i passed the staggered gruff i swung my heavy staff like a baseball bat aiming at the back of one of his hooves i felt the impact in my hands and heard a sharp crack the gruff let out a highpitched and utterly bestial scream of surprise and pain and tumbled to the snow i all but flew on by lengthening my stride crossing the street and heading for the nearest corner before his buddies could get a clear shot at me when you drive game youd damn well better be sure that the one youre driving the prey toward is ready and able to handle it i ducked around the next corner maybe half a second before the guns behind me coughed and burped again chewing chips of brick from the wall there was a steel door on the side of the building an exitonly door with no handle on the outside i couldnt stay ahead of the gruffs for long i took a chance stopped and pressed my hand against the door hoping like hell it had a pushbar opening mechanism and not a dead bolt something went right i felt the bar on the other side reached out with my will and another murmur forzare and directed the force against the other side of the door it popped open i went through and pulled it shut behind me the building was dark silent and almost uncomfortably warm in contrast with the night outside i leaned my head against the metal door for a second panting good door i wheezed nice door nice locked hostiletofaeries door my ear was in contact with the door and it was the only reason i heard the movement immediately on its other side snow crunched quietly i froze in place i heard a scraping sound and a snorted breath that sounded like something youd hear from a horse then nothing it took me maybe three seconds to realize that the gruff on the other side of the door was doing the same thing i was listening to see if he could hear who was on the other side it couldnt have been more than six inches away and i was standing there in complete darkness if something went wrong and the gruff came in after me i could forget running i couldnt see the floor the walls or any obstacles that might trip me up like stairs or a mound of rusty razor blades i froze not daring to move metal door or not if the gruff had the right submachine gun and the right kind of ammunition he could riddle me with holes right through the steel there was no telling what other weapons he might be packing either id once seen a sobering demonstration of how to skewer someone on a sword from the other side of a metal door and it hadnt been pretty so i stood very still and tried to think quietly it was about then that i remembered one of those movies with the maniac in the ghost mask where one of the kids in the opening segment leans against a bathroom stall listening exactly the same way i was the killer in the neighboring stall rams a knife into the victims ear it was a panicinducing thought and suddenly i had to fight the urge to bolt my ear began to itch furiously if i hadnt known that the gruffs were trying to flush me out like a rabbit from his briar patch i might not have managed to keep my cool it was a near thing but i did it a week and a half went by before i heard another exhalation from a largerthanhuman chest and a pair of quick light crunches of cloven hooves on snow i pushed away from the door as silently as i could trembling with adrenaline fatigue and cold i had to think ahead of these assholes if i wanted to get out in one piece inky binky and pinky knew id come in here and they werent about to give up the chase right now one of them was watching the door id come in to make sure i didnt backtrack the other two were circling the building looking for a way in i was pretty sure i didnt want to be hanging around when they found it i drew off the pentacle amulet i wore around my neck murmured and made a tiny effort of will the amulet began to glow with gentle blue light i stood in a utility corridor of some kind bare concrete floor met unpainted drywall there were a couple of doors on the right side of the hall and another one at the far end i checked them out the first door opened into a room containing several commercialgrade heating and airconditioning units all hooked up to a ductwork octopus no help there the next room was padlocked shut i felt a little bad for doing it but i lifted my staff took a moment to close my eyes and concentrate and then sent another pulse of energy down the runecarved length of wood this time focused into a blade of pure force it sliced through the hasp and bit into the heavy wood of the door behind it the lock fell to the floor its cleanly severed steel glowing dull orange at the edges the room beyond was probably the workshop of the buildings handyman it wasnt large but it was neatly organized it held a woodworking bench tools and various supplieslightbulbs air filters for the units next door replacement parts for doors sinks and toilets i availed myself of a few things and dropped my last two twenties onto the workbench by way of apology then i stalked back out into the hallway and continued into the building the next door was locked too i jimmied it open with the crowbar id taken from the tool room it made some noise a deepthroated bawl of animal sound came from the far side of the metal door something slammed against it but not hard enough to bring it down and the sound was followed by an immediate yowl of pain i bared my teeth in a grin the far side of the door opened onto the lobby of an office building very sparse a light was blinking on a panel with a keypad on it next to the door id just forced open apparently i had triggered the buildings security system that was fine by me the nearest police station was only a little more than a block from here and the lights and the appearance of mortal police officers would probably make the gruffs fade and wait for a better moment to settle my hash but wait if the building had a security system i had to have tripped it when i came in the side door and that had been a couple of minutes ago why hadnt the cops shown up already the weather most likely travel would be slow lines would be down causing all kinds of power and communication problems there would be traffic accidents everywhere there was traffic and in the wake of all the manpower diverted to marcones wrecked building the station would be overloaded with work even this late at night it might take several minutes longer than usual for the police to respond a shadow moved outside the buildings front door and one of the gruffs appeared there i didnt have minutes i was moving before i had consciously recognized the fact running for the elevators the steel security gate inside the door would prevent the gruff from crashing through the glass to come at me but that didnt stop the gruff from lifting its submachine gun and opening up on me the gun sounded like heavy canvas ripping only a thousand times louder the window shattered and glass flew everywhere some of the bullets struck the security gate throwing off sparks most of them shattering a couple bouncing wildly around the lobby the rest came at me i had my left hand stretched out toward the gruff as i ran and my will was focused on the bracelet on my wrist made of a braid of many metals the chain of the bracelet was hung with multiple charms in the shape of medieval shields the power of my will rushed into the bracelet focused by the enchantments id laid upon it when i had prepared it my will coalesced into a concave dome of barely visible blue energy between me and the gruff and bullets slammed against it shattering in bursts of light that rippled over the surface of the energy shield like tiny waves in a still pond all three of the elevator doors stood open and i rushed into the nearest and rapidly hit the buttons for every floor up to the top of the building then i leapt out repeated the process in the second elevator and then jumped into the third and headed straight for the top no sense in making it easy for the gruffs to follow me up and even a moments delay might buy me the time i needed the elevator doors closedthen buzzed and sprang open again oh come on i shouted and hit the closedoor button hard enough to hurt my thumb i growled and watched as the elevator twitched closed again and then once more sprang open a sad little ding emerging from a halffunctioning bell i was jabbing the button like a lunatic when the gruffs demonstrated their opinion of mortal security systems sure the touch of metal was anathema to the beings of faerie sure they couldnt hammer their way through a metal door or bash through a heavy metal gate brick walls on the other hand presented fewer problems there was a thunder crack of sound and the wall beside the front door exploded inward i dont mean it fell in it literally exploded as the momentum of a superhumanly powerful being struck the wall from the far side and shattered it bits of brick flew like bullets a ceramic pot holding a plastic plant shattered several pieces zipped into the elevator and bounced around inside of it a cloud of brick dust billowed through the lobby the gruff who had just oneupped the big bad wolf bulled its way through the cloud curling rams horns first it staggered a step or two shaking its head then focused on me and let out another bleating howl augh i screamed at the elevator jabbing the button close close close it did the car began rising just as the stunned gruff brought his weapon to bear and opened up bullets ripped through the relatively flimsy metal of the elevators door but my shield bracelet was ready and none of them found their targetwho let out a howling adrenalinedrunken laugh of defiance as the elevator rose what they say is true theres nothing as exhilarating as being shot at and missed when the shooter happens to be a fairytale hit man it just adds to the zest fourteen floors later i emerged into a darkened hallway and guided by the light of my upraised amulet i found the door to the roof it was an exterior door with a heavy dead bolt and there was no way that the crowbar was going to get it open i took a step back lifted my staff and focused my will on the door once upon a time i would have just let fly with my will and blasted it right out of its frame a fairly exhausting bit of spellcraft instead i pointed the end of the staff at the bottommost hinge on this side and barked forzare a blade of unseen energy like that i had used on the padlock severed the hinge with a miniature crack of thunder i did it for the middle and lower hinges too then used the crowbar to pry the heavy door out of its setting and hurried out onto the roof there was a lot of wind up this high even though the night was fairly calm the towers of the city could funnel even a mild breeze into a virtual gale and tonight this rooftop was on the receiving end the wind ripped my coat out to one side and i had to lean against it at least there wasnt much snowexcept where a portion of architecture created a lee against the wind there it was piled deep it took me a second to orient when youre fourteen floors up it gives you an alien perspective of streets and buildings that might otherwise be familiar i figured out which side of the building id come in on and hurried to it searching for the escape route id spotted on the way in it wasnt the fire escapes which decorated two sides of the building in a weathered steel framework those things are noisy as hell and the gruffs would be watching them instead i leaned out over the edge and looked at the niche in the brick wall it ran the entire vertical length of the building a groove about three feet wide and two feet deep there was one on either side of each corner of the building probably there for the aesthetic value rising like a threewalled chimney from the ground to the roof my breath went a little short fourteen floors is a much longer way down than it is up especially when you arent using things like elevators and fire escapes especially when i noted the frost and ice forming on the buildings exterior i took a moment to debate the sanity of this plan id cut the odds in my favor assuming there were only three gruffs after me this time one would have to watch the elevators another would have to watch the fire escape that left only one to actively pursue me i didnt know how fast the gruff would get to the roof but i had no doubt that hed manage it in short order the idea of simply pushing the gruff off the roof with a blast of power had a certain appeal but i decided against it a fourteenstory drop might just piss the gruff offand it would absolutely confirm my location better to slip away and leave them wondering if i was still hiding in the building so i climbed out onto the ledge amidst gusting winds my nose and fingers went numb almost immediately i tried to ignore them as i lowered my legs into the groove in the wall and braced my feet against the bricks on either side then my heart pounding madly i shifted my hips and wriggled a bit until the outward pressure of my legs against the bricks was the only thing that kept me from kissing sidewalk once my arms were low enough i was able to spread them and plant my forearms against the bricks as well assisting my legs i cannot possibly explain to you how frightened i was staring down the swirling snow kept me from seeing the ground at times once i started there would be no going back one slip one miscalculation one inconveniently placed patch of ice and i would be able to add pancake to my impersonation repertoire i pushed hard with my arms and let my legs loosen i slid them down a few inches and tightened them again until they supported my weight once more then i loosened my arms and slid down a few inches before stopping tightening my arms again and repeating the process i started climbing down shifting my legs and arms in turn five or six inches at a time moving down the brick groove inchworm style i made it about ten feet before an image invaded my mind a gruff aiming his gun down at me from a couple of feet away and casually popping several rounds through the top of my head i started climbing faster my stomach turning with reaction to the height and the fear i heard myself making desperate little grunting sounds the wind howled blowing snow into my eyes frost formed on my eyelashes my coat did little to protect me from the wind swirling the length of my body and i started shaking uncontrollably i lost the staff when i was about fifty feet up it tumbled from my numbing fingers and i held my breath the rattle of its impact could attract the gruffs attention and ruin the whole purpose of taking the madman route off the building but the solid length of oak fell into a drift of snow and vanished silently into the white powder i labored to emulate it only less quickly i didnt slip until i was ten feet up i managed to take the fall well mostly because i landed in the same snowdrift that had received my staff i struggled up out of the freezing white and almost went back down when my staff tangled in my legs i took it up in mostly nerveless hands and staggered out of the drift a sphere of light whipped past the other end of the alley then reappeared and shot toward me toottoots face was unusually sober even grim he zipped up to me and held a finger to his lips i nodded at him and mouthed i need to know how to get out toots sphere of light bobbed once in acknowledgment and then sped away i looked up other balls of glowing light darted about the skies flickers that you would barely even notice if you didnt know what to look for i took a precaution while i waited as before i didnt wait long toot returned a moment later and beckoned me he took the lead and i followed him i was getting colder the fall into the drift had covered me in a light layer of snow which had then melted wet clothes are exactly the worst thing to be wearing in that kind of weather i had to keep moving hypothermia isnt as dramatic a death as being ripped apart by bullets but itll get the job done when i got to the far end of the alley i heard another bleating cry from a gruff drifting on the moaning wind softened by the falling snow i glanced back and just barely saw motion as a gruff descended the side of the building the same way i hadthough much more swiftly a second later there was an agonized inhuman scream as the gruff got to the bottom and discovered that the snow had hidden the box of nails that i had stolen from the tool room and spread liberally over the ground the screams went on for several seconds one of the nails must have pierced the gruff s hoof and as tired and cold as i was i still had energy enough to grin that one wasnt going to be dancing in elf circles anytime soon id lamed two of them and figured it would be enough to make them back off the chase at least for the moment but you never can tell i wasted no time in following toot through back alleys and away from the chosen emissaries of summer around me the little glowing christmas balls of light the zalords guard darted back and forth a wary ring of sentinels spread in a perimeter that moved as i did several blocks away i found an allnight grocery store and staggered in out of the cold the clerk glared at me until i hobbled over clumsily dug change out of my pockets and left it next to the cash register before shuffling to the coffee counter at that point the clerk evidently decided that he wouldnt have to get out the shotgun or whatever he had behind the counter and went back to staring out the window there were a few other shoppers there and i saw a police car crunch through the snow on the street outside probably responding to the alarm at the building nice and public probably safe i was so cold i could barely fill up the cup the coffee which burned my tongue a little was absolutely delicious even served black i guzzled the hot drink and felt sensation begin returning to my body i stood there for a moment with my eyes closed and finished the coffee then i crushed the paper cup and tossed it into the trash someone had snatched john marcone and i had to find him and protect him i had a feeling that murphy wasnt going to be thrilled with the circumstances around this one hells bells i wasnt happy with it but that really wasnt what was bothering me what really worried me was that mab had been involved what was the deal with having grimalkin along to do her talking for her aside from making her seem even more extremely disturbing than usual i mean oh sure mab may have seemed fairly straightforward but there was a lot more going on than she was saying for example mab had said that summers hit men were after me because mab had chosen me to be her emissary but for that to be true she had to have done it hours ago at least a little while before the first crew of gruffs had attacked me at the carpenter place and that had happened several hours before the bad guys grabbed marcone someone was running a game all right someone was keeping secrets i had a bad feeling that if i didnt find out who why and how mab would toss me into the trash like a used paper cup right after she crushed me of course chapter eight a wideaxled fullofitself militarywannabe truck crunched through the snowy streets and came to a halt outside the little grocery store the lights glared in through the doors i squinted at it after a minute the hummers horn blared in two short beeps oh youve got to be kidding me i muttered i hobbled to the door and out to the truck which blended seamlessly with the background and the foreground and with most of the air the driverside window rolled down and revealed a young man whom fathers of teenage daughters would shoot on sight he had pale skin and deep grey eyes his dark slightly curly hair was long enough to declare casual rebellion and tousled to careless perfection he wore a black leather jacket and a white shirt both of them more expensive than any two pieces of furniture at my apartment in marked contrast there was a scarf inexpertly crocheted from thick white yarn around his neck under the collar of the jacket he faced straight ahead so that i saw only his profile but i felt confident that he was smirking on the other side of his face too thomas i said a lesser man than me would hate you he grinned theres someone lesser than you he rolled his eyes to me on the last word to deadpan the delivery and his face froze in an expression of absolute neutrality he stayed that way for a few seconds empty night harry you look like ten miles of bad road he forced a smile onto his mouth but that was as far as it went i was going to go with a raccoon gee thanks get in he took the monorail to the other side of the hummers cab to unlock the passengerside door i showed up eventually and noticed every little ache in my body on the wayespecially the throbbing burn centered on my broken nose i tossed my staff into the back of das truck half expecting an echoing clatter when it landed i got in shut the door and put on my seat belt while thomas got the truck moving he peered carefully into the heavy snow presumably looking for some runty little sedans he could drive over for fun thats gotta hurt he said after a moment only when i exhale i said testily what took you so long well you know how much i love getting called in the middle of the night to drive through snow and ice to play chauffeur for grumpy lowlife investigators the anticipation slowed me down i grunted in what might have been construed as an apologetic manner by someone who knew me thomas did whats up i told him everything thomas is my half brother my only family im allowed he listened and then i concluded i went for a ride in a monster truck thomass mouth twitched up in a quick smile it is kinda butch isnt it i squinted around the truck do tv shows start an hour later in the backseat than they do up here who cares thomas said its got tivo good i said it might be a little while before i return you to your regularly scheduled programming thomas let out a theatrical sigh why me because if i want to find marcone the best place to start is with his people if word gets out that hes gone missing theres no telling how some of them might react when i come snooping around so youve got my back what if i dont want your back cope i said heartlessly youre family youve got me there he admitted but i wonder if youve thought this through very thoroughly i try to make thinking an ongoing process thomas shook his head look you know i dont try to tell you your business except tonight apparently i said marcone is a grownup thomas said he signed on to the accords willingly he knew what he was going to be letting himself in for and i said and its a jungle out there thomas said he squinted through the thick snow metaphorically speaking i grunted he made his bed and i should let him lie in it something like that thomas said and dont forget that murphy and the police arent going to be thrilled with a save the kingpin campaign i know i said and id love to stand back and see what happens but this isnt about marcone anymore then what is it about mab skinning me alive if i dont give her what she wants come on harry thomas said you cant really think that mabs motives and plans are that direct that cutanddried he adjusted the setting of the hummers wipers she wants marcone for a reason you might not be doing him any favors by saving him on mabs behalf i scowled out at the night he held up a hand ticking off fingers and thats assuming that one hes alive at all right now two that you can find him three that you can get him out alive and four that the opposition doesnt cripple or kill you whats your point i asked that youre playing against a stacked deck and that you have no idea if mab is going to be there to cover your bets when the bad guys call he shook his head it would be smarter for you to skip town go someplace warm for a few weeks mab might take that kinda personal i said mabs a businesswoman thomas said creepy and weird but shes cold too calculating as long as you still represent a potential recruit to her i doubt shed elect to depreciate your value prematurely depreciate i like that you might be rightunless to return to the original metaphor mab isnt playing with a full deck which the evidence of recent years seems to imply with increasing frequency i nodded out the window and ive got a feeling that id have had even more trouble with the gruffs ive seen so far if we werent in the middle of a freaking blizzard if i waltz off to miami or somewhere warm ill be putting myself that much nearer to the agents of summerwho are also planning my murder thomas frowned and said nothing i could run but i couldnt hide i said better to face it here on my home ground while im still relatively restedi let out a huge and genuine yawninstead of waiting for faerie goons from one court or the other to ah depreciate me by surprise after ive been on the run for a few weeks what about the council thomas demanded youve been wearing the grey cloak for how long now and youve fought for them how many times i shook my head right now the council is still stretched to the limit we might not be in open battle with the red court at the moment but the council and the wardens have got years of catchup work to do i felt my jaw tighten lot of warlocks have come up in the past few years the wardens are working overtime to get them under control you mean kill them thomas said i mean kill them most of them teenagers man i shook my head luccio knows my feelings on the matter she refuses to assign any of it to me which means that other wardens are forced to pick up the slack im not going to add to their workload by dragging them into this mess you dont seem to mind adding to mine thomas noted i snorted thats because i respect them so long as we have that clear he said we drove past a city snowplow it had foundered in a deep drift like some kind of metallic ice age beast trapped in a tar pit i watched it with bemusement as thomass truck crunched slowly steadily on by by the way he asked where do you want to go first things first i said i need food you need sleep ticktock food will do for now i pointed there an ihop he hauled the big truck into a slow steady turn then what i ask people impertinent questions i said hopefully turning up pertinent answers assuming someone doesnt kill you while you do thats why im bringing my very own vampire bodyguard thomas parked across three spaces in the tiny otherwise unoccupied lot of an international house of pancakes i like the scarf i said i leaned over and inhaled through my nose as best i could it stung but i detected a faint whiff of vanilla and strawberries she make it for you thomas nodded without saying anything the leathergloved fingers of one hand traced over the soft simple yarn he looked quietly sad i felt bad for mentioning justine my brothers lost lover then i understood why he wore the gloves if shed made it for him a token of her love he didnt dare touch it with his skin it would sear him like a hot skillet so he kept it close enough for him to smell her touch upon it but he didnt dare let it brush against him every time i think my romantic life is a wasteland i look at my brother and see how much worse it could be thomas shook his head and killed the engine and we sat for a moment in silence so i clearly heard a deep male voice outside the truck say dont either of you move there was the distinct clickclack of a shotguns pump working or i will kill you chapter nine w hen theres a gun pointed at you youve got two options either you move fast and unexpectedly and hope that you get lucky or you freeze and try to talk your way clear given that i had really limited room in which to attempt to dodge or run i went with option b i held still i dont suppose i asked hopefully that this is the full military model it has individually heated seats and a sixdisk cd changer thomas said i scowled uhhuh those are way cooler than silly features like armor and bulletproof glass hey thomas said its not my fault you have special needs harry said the man with the shotgun hold up your right hand please i arched an eyebrow at that typically the vocabulary of thugs holding guns to your head ran a little light on courtesy phrases like please you want me to kill him thomas murmured barely audible i twitched my head in a tiny negative motion then i lifted up my right hand fingers spread turn it around said the man outside let me see the inside of your wrist i did oh thank god breathed the voice id finally placed it i turned my head to one side and said through the glass hey there fix is that a shotgun youre holding to my head or are you just glad to see me fix was a young slender man of medium height his hair was silverwhite and very fine and though no one would ever accuse him of beauty there was a confidence and surety in his plain features that gave them a certain appeal he was a far cry from the nervous scrawny kid id first met several years ago he wore jeans and a green silk shirtnothing more he obviously should have been freezing and he just as obviously wasnt the thickly falling snowflakes werent striking him every single one seemed to find its way to the ground around him somehow he held a pumpaction shotgun with a long barrel against his shoulder and wore a sword on a belt at his hip harry he said his voice steady his tone wasnt hostile can we have a polite talk we probably could have i said if you hadnt started off by pointing a gun at my head a necessary precaution he said i needed to be sure you hadnt taken mabs offer and become the new winter knight i asked you could have asked me fix if youd become mabs creature fix said you would have lied it would have changed you made you an extension of her will i couldnt trust you youre the summer knight i replied so i cant help but wonder if that wouldnt make you just as controlled and untrustworthy summers not all that happy with me right now apparently maybe youre just an extension of summers will fix stared at me down the barrel of the shotgun then he lowered it abruptly and said touchй thomas produced from nowhere a semiautomatic pistol scaled to fit his truck and had it trained on fixs head before the other man had finished speaking the second syllable of the word fixs eyes widened holy crap i sighed and took the gun gently from thomass grip now now lets not give him the wrong idea about the nature of this conversation fix let out a slow breath thank you harry i i pointed the gun at fixs head and he froze with his mouth partly open lose the shotgun i told him i made no effort to sound friendly his mouth closed and his lips pressed into a thin line but he obeyed step back i said he did it i got out of the car carefully keeping the gun trained on his head i recovered the shotgun and passed it back to thomas then i faced the silverhaired summer knight in dead silence while the snow fell fix i said quietly after a moment had passed i know youve been spending a lot of time in the supernatural circles lately i know that plain old things like guns dont seem like a significant threat in some ways i know that you probably meant it as a message that you werent coming after me with everything you could bring to bear and that i was supposed to consider it a token of moderation i squinted down the sight of thomass gun but you crossed a line you pointed a gun at my head friends dont do that more silence and snowfall point another weapon at me i said quietly and youd damned well better pull the trigger do you understand me fixs eyes narrowed he nodded once i let him look down the guns barrel for a few more seconds and then lowered it its cold i said what do you want i came here to warn you harry fix said i know mab has chosen you to act as her emissary you dont know what youre getting into i came to tell you to stand clear of it or what or youre going to get hurt fix said quietly he sounded tired maybe killed and theres going to be collateral damage along the way he held up a hand and continued hurriedly please understand im not threatening you harry im just telling you about consequences id have an easier time believing that if you hadnt opened the conversation by threatening to kill me i said the last summer knight was murdered by his winter counterpart fix replied in fact thats how most of them die if youd taken service with mab i wouldnt stand a chance in a fair fight against you and we both know it i did what i had to in order to warn you and still protect myself oh i said it was a precautionary shotgun aimed at my skull that makes it different dammit dresden fix said what do i have to do to get you to listen to me behave in a vaguely trustworthy fashion i said for instance next time you know that summers hitters are about to make a run at me maybe you could call me on a telephone and give me a little headsup fix grimaced his face twisted into an expression of effort when he spoke his jaws stayed locked together but i could with difficulty understand the words wanted to oh i said a big chunk of my anger evaporated it was probably just as well fix wasnt the one who deserved to be on the receiving end of it i cant back off he drew in a breath and nodded as if in comprehension mabs got a handle on you for now he gave me a rather bleak smile she isnt the sort to let go of anyone she wants to keep and im not the sort who gets kept i replied maybe not fix said but he sounded dubious are you sure you wont reconsider were going to have to agree to disagree jesus fix said looking away i dont want to square off against you dresden then dont he stared quietly at me his expression serious i cant back off either i like you harry but i cant make you any promises were playing for opposite teams i said nothing personal but well do what we have to do fix nodded we didnt speak for almost a minute then i laid the shotgun down in the snow nodded and got back into thomass truck i gave the huge automatic back to my brother fix made no move toward the shotgun harry he said as the truck started to pull out his mouth twitched a few times before he blurted remember the leaf lily gave you i frowned at him but nodded thomas got the truck moving again and started driving windshield wipers squeaked snow crunched beneath tires a steady white noise okay thomas said what was that all about guys supposed to be a friend and he screwed you over i thought you were going to pistolwhip him for a minute then you start getting all tearyeyed metaphorically speaking i said tiredly you know what i mean hes under a geas thomas thomas frowned lilys got him in a brainlock i doubt shed do that to fix they go back who then my money is on titania the summer queen if she told him to keep his mouth shut and not to help me he wouldnt get a choice in the matter probably why he showed up armed and tried to intimidate me he wouldnt be able to speak to me outright but if hes delivering a threat in order to further titanias plans it might let him get around the geas seems pretty thin to me you believe him titanias done it to him before and she doesnt really like me you kill someones daughter that happens he said i shrugged wearily tired to my bones the combination of pain cold and multiple bursts of adrenaline had worn me down a lot more than i had realized i couldnt stop another yawn what was he talking about as we pulled out oh i mumbled after that mess at arctis tor lily gave me a silver pin in the shape of an oak leaf it makes me an esquire of summer supposedly i can use it to whistle up help from titanias court its their way of balancing the scales for what we did never a bad thing to be owed a favor thomas agreed you got it on you yeah i said it was in fact in a little ring box within the inner coat of my duster i got it out and showed it to thomas he whistled gorgeous work the sidhe know pretty i agreed maybe you can use it and get them to back off i snorted its never that simple titania could decide that the best way to help me would be to break my back paralyze me from the waist down and dump me into a hospital bed so her gruffs wont have to kill me thomas grunted then why would fix mention it maybe he was compelled to i said maybe titanias hoping ill call for help and shell have a chance to squash me personally or maybe i let my voice trail off for a moment while i kicked my punchdrunk brain in the stomach until it threw up an idea or maybe i said because he wanted to warn me about it the gruffs have found me twice now and they havent been physically tailing or tracking me neither location was one of my regular hangouts and how did fix find me just now in the middle of a blizzard he sure as hell didnt coincidentally pick a random ihop thomass eyes widened in realization its a tracking device i scowled at the beautiful little silver leaf and said not without a certain amount of grudging admiration titania that conniving bitch damn thomas said i feel a little bad for pointing a gun at the shrimp now i probably would too i said if i wasnt so weirded out by the fact that fix is starting to be as crabwise and squirrelly as the rest of the sidhe thomas grunted better get rid of that thing before more of them show up he hit the control that lowered the passenger window it coughed and rattled a little before it jerked into motion instead of smoothly gliding down wizards and technology dont get along so well to hightech equipment i am the living avatar of murphys law the longer i stayed in thomass shiny new oil tanker the more all the things that could go wrong would go wrong i lifted the leaf to chuck it out but something made me hesitate no i murmured thomas blinked no no i said with more certainty closing my hand around the treacherous silver leaf ive got a better idea chapter ten i finished the spell that i thought would keep the gruffs busy and climbed wearily out of my lab to find thomas sitting by the fireplace my big grey dog mouse lay beside him his fur reflecting highlights of reddened silver in the firelight watching thomass work with interest my brother sat crosslegged on the floor with my gun lying disassembled on a soft leather cloth upon the hearth he frowned in concentration as he cleaned the pieces of the weapon with a brush a soft cloth and a small bottle of oil mister my hyperthyroid tomcat bounded over the minute i opened the trapdoor to the lab and hurried down the folding staircase into the subbasement go get em tiger i muttered after him by way of encouragement make them run their little hooves off i left the door open heaved myself to the couch and collapsed mouses tail thumped the floor gently you all right thomas asked tired i said big spell uhhuh he said working industriously on the weapons barrel what building did you burn down your apartment if you dont lay off the wiseass commentary i said give me a minute and well get moving thomas gave me a sidelong calculating look i needed another minute or two anyway whens the last time you cleaned this thing uh whos the president now thomas clucked his teeth in disapproval and returned to the gun let me know when youre ready just give me a minute to catch my breath i said when i woke up there was dim light coming from my mostly buried basement windows and my neck felt like the bones had been welded together by a badly trained contractor the various beatings id received the night before had formed a corporation and were attempting a hostile takeover of my nervous system i groaned and looked around thomas was sitting with his back against the wall beside the fireplace as relaxed and patient as any tiger his gun mine and the bentbladed kukri knife hed favored lately lay close at hand down in my lab something clattered to the floor from one of the shelves or tables i heard misters paws scampering over the metal surface of the center table what are you grinning at my brother asked mister i said hes been knocking around down there all morning thomas said i was going to go round him up before he broke something but the skull told me to leave him alone yeah i said i creaked to my feet and shuffled to my little alcove with delusions of kitchenhood i got out the bottle of aspirin and downed them with a glass of water for your own safety mister gets upset when someone gets between him and his packet of catnip i shuffled over to the lab and peered down sure enough the little cloth bag containing catnip and the silver oak leaf pin still hung from the extralarge rubber band id snipped and fixed to the ceiling directly over little chicago as i watched mister hopped up onto a worktable then bounded into the air to bat at the cloth bag he dragged it down to the table with him claws hooked in the fabric and landed on the model of lincoln park my cat rubbed his face ecstatically against the bag for a moment then released it and batted playfully at it as the rubber band sent it rebounding back and forth near him then he seemed to realize he was being watched he turned his face up to me meowed smugly flicked the stub of his tail jauntily and hopped to the floor bob i called is the spell still working aye capn bob said arrrrr whats with that thomas murmured from right beside me i twitched hard enough to take me up off the floor and glared at him would you stop doing that he nodded his expression serious but i could see the corners of his mouth quivering with the effort not to smile right forgot i growled and called him something unkind yet accurate he wouldnt stop begging me to take him to see that pirate movie so i took him with me the last time i went to the drivein down in aurora and he got into it its been dying down but if he calls me matey one more time ill snap thats interesting thomas said but thats not what i was asking about oh right i said i pointed at the catnip bag the leaf s in there isnt that just going to draw summers goons here i let out a nasty laugh no they cant see it through the wards around the lab then why the big rubber band i linked summers beacon spell to the matrix around little chicago every time the leaf gets within a foot of the model my spell transfers the beacons signal to the corresponding location in the city thomas narrowed his eyes in thought and then suddenly grinned in understanding as mister pounced on the catnip again this time landing near the field museum if theyre following that beacon theyll be running all over town in two and a half feet of snow i confirmed grinning youre sadistic thank you i said solemnly wont they figure it out sooner or later i admitted but it should buy us a little time to work with scuse me i shambled to the door and put on my coat where to first thomas asked nowhere just yet sit tight i grabbed my squareheaded snow shovel from the popcorn tin by the door where it usually resided with my staff sword cane and the epically static magic sword fidelacchius mouse followed me out it was a job of work to get the door open and more than a little snow spilled over the threshold i started with shoveling the stairs and worked my way up a grave digger in reverse once that was done i shoveled the little sidewalk the front porch of the boardinghouse and the exterior stairs running up to the willoughbys apartment on the second floor then i dug a path to the nest of mailboxes by the curb it took me less time than i thought it would there was a lot of snow but it hadnt formed any layers of ice and it was basically a question of tossing powder out of the way mouse kept watch and i tried not to throw snow into his face we returned to my apartment and i slung the shovels handle back down into the popcorn tin thomas frowned at me you had to shovel the walk harrysomehow im under the impression that you arent feeling the urgency here in the first place i said im not terribly well motivated to bend over backward to save john marcones armaniclad ass i wouldnt lose much sleep over him in the second place my neighbors are elderly and if someone doesnt clean up the walks theyll be stuck here in the third place ive got to do whatever i can to make sure im on my landladys good side mrs spunkelcrief is almost deaf but its sort of hard to hide it when assassin demons or gangs of zombies kick down the door shes willing to forgive me the occasional wild party because i do things like shovel the walk its easier to replace an apartment than your ass thomas said i shrugged i was so stiff and sore from yesterday that i had to do something to get my muscles loosened up and moving the time was going to be gone either way might as well take care of my neighbors i grimaced besides you feel bad that your landladys building sometimes gets busted up because you live in it thomas said he shook his head and snorted typical well yeah but thats not it he frowned at me listening i struggled to find the right words there are a lot of things i cant control i dont know whats going to happen in the next few days i dont know what im going to face what kind of choices im going to have to make i cant predict it i cant control it its too big i nodded at my shovel but that i can predict i know that if i pick up that shovel and clear the snow from the walkways its going to make my neighbors safer and happier i glanced at him and shrugged its worthwhile to me give me a minute to shower he regarded me for a second and then nodded oh he said with the tiniest of smiles he mimed a sniff and a faint grimace ill wait gladly i cleaned up we were on the way out the door when the phone rang harry murphy said what the hell is going on out there why i asked what the hell is going on out there weve had at least two dozenwell i suppose the correct term is sightings everything from bigfoot to mysterious balls of light naturally its all getting shunted to si i started to answer her then paused marcone and the outfit were involved while they didnt have anywhere near the influence in civic affairs that they might have wanted marcone had always had sources of information inside the police departmentsources his subordinates could presumably access as well it would be best to exercise some caution you calling from the station i asked her yeah we should talk i said murphy might not want to admit that anyone she worked with could be providing information to the outfit but she wasnt the sort to stop believing the truth just because she didnt like it i see she said where mcanallys i said i checked a clock three hours see you there i hung up and started for the door again mouse followed close at my heels but i turned and nudged him gently back with my leg not this time boy i told him the bad guys have a lot of manpower access to skilled magic and i need a safe place to come home to if youre here theres no way anyone is going to sneak in and leave me a present that goes boom mouse huffed out a breath in a sigh but sat down keep an eye on mister all right if he starts getting sick take the catnip away my dog gave the door to the lab a dubious glance oh give me a break i said youre seven times as big as he is mouse looked none too confident thomas blinked at me and then at the dog can he understand you when it suits him i grumped hes smarter than a lot of people i know thomas took a moment to absorb that and then faced mouse a little uncertainly uh okay look what i said about harry earlier i wasnt serious okay it was totally a joke mouse flicked his ears and turned his nose away from thomas with great nobility what i asked looking between them what did you say ill warm up the car thomas said and retreated to the frozen grey outdoors this is my home i complained to no one in particular why do people keep making jokes at my expense in my own freaking home mouse declined to comment i locked up behind me magically and materially and scaled mount hummer to sit in the passenger seat the morning was cold and getting colder especially since i was fresh from the shower but the seat was rather pleasantly warm there was no way id admit to thomas that the luxury feature was superior to armored glass but gosh it was cozy right thomas said where are we headed to where they treat me like royalty i said were going to burger king i rubbed the heel of my hand against my forehead and spelled fratricide in a subvocal mutter but i had to spell out temporary insanity and justifiable homicide too before i calmed down enough to speak politely just take a left and drive please well thomas said grinning since you said please chapter eleven e xecutive priority health was arguably the most exclusive gym in town located in downtown chicago the business took up the entire second floor of what used to be one of the grand old hotel buildings now it had office buildings on the upper levels and a miniature shopping center on the first floor not just anyone could take the private elevator to the second floor one had to be a member of the health club and membership was tightly controlled and extremely expensive only the wealthiest and most influential men had a membership card oh and me the magnetic stripe on the back of the card didnt work when i swiped it through the card reader no surprise there id had it in my wallet for several months and i doubt the magnetic signature stored on the card had lasted more than a couple of days i hit the intercom button on the console executive priority said a cheerful young womans voice this is billie and how may i serve you thomas glanced at me and arched an eyebrow mouthing the words serve you youll see i muttered to him i addressed the intercom my card seems to have stopped working harry dresden and guest please one moment sir billie said she was back within a few seconds i apologize for the problem with your membership card sir im opening the elevator for you now true to her word the elevator opened and thomas and i got in it opened onto the main area of executive priority youre kidding me thomas said since when do you go to the gym it looked pretty typically gymlike from here lots and lots of exercise machines and weight benches and dumbbells and mirrors static bikes and treadmills stood in neatly dressed ranks theyd paid some madman who thought he was a decorator a lot of money to make the place look hip and unique maybe its my lack of fashion sense talking but i thought they should have held out for one of those gorillas who has learned to paint the results would have been of similar quality and they could have paid in fresh produce here and there men mostly white mostly over forty suffered through a variety of physical activities beside each and every one of them was a personal trainer coaching supporting helping the trainers were all women none of them older than their late twenties they all wore ridiculously brief jogging shorts so tight that it had to be some kind of minor miracle that allowed the blood to keep flowing through the girls legs they all wore tshirts with the gyms logo printed on them also tightand every single woman there had the kind of body that made her outfit look fantastic no gym in the world had that many gorgeous girls in its employ ah thomas said after a moment of looking around this isnt a typical health club is it welcome to the most healthconscious brothel in the history of mankind i told him thomas whistled quietly through his teeth surveying the place id heard that the velvet room had been retooled this is it yeah i said a brownhaired girl jiggled over to us her mouth spread in a beautycontest smile and for a second i thought her shirt was about to explode under the tension bright gold lettering over her left breast read billie hello mister dresden she chirped she bobbed her head to thomas sir welcome to executive priority can i get you a drink before your workout may i take your coats i held up a hand thanks billie but no im not here for the exercise her smile stayed locked in place pretty and meaningless and she tilted her head to one side im here to speak to ms demeter i said im sorry sir billie said she isnt in the girl was a confection for the eyes and i felt sure that the other four senses would feel just as well fed after a bit of indulgence but she wasnt a good liar yeah she is i said tell her harry dresden is here im sorry sir she said again like a machine stuck on repeat ms demeter is not in the building i gave her my toothiest smile youre kind of new here eh billie the smile flickered then stabilized again thomas i sighed give her a visual my brother looked around then went over to a nearby rack of steel dumbbells and picked up the largest set there one in each hand with about as much effort as id use to bundle twigs he twisted the steel bars around each other forming an asymmetric x shape he held it up to make sure billie saw it and then dropped it at her feet the weights landed with a forceful thump and billie flinched when they did you should see the kinds of things he can bend and break i said expensive exercise machines expensive furniture expensive clients i dont know how hard he could throw some of this stuff around but id be lying if i told you that i wasnt kinda curious i leaned down a little closer and said billie maybe you should kick this one up the line id hate them to dock your pay to replace all the broken things ill be right back sir billie said in a squeaky whisper and scurried away subtle thomas noted i shrugged it saves time howd you get a membership to a place like this its marcones place he thinks im less likely to trash it if im dazzled by friendly boobs cant say i blame him thomas admitted his eyes locked on one particular girl who was currently at a table filling out paperwork she froze in place and then looked up very slowly her lips parted as she stared at thomas and her dark eyes widened she started breathing faster and then shook herself and hurriedly looked down again pretending to read her paperwork my brother closed his eyes slowly and then turned his head away from the girl with the kind of steady deliberate motion one uses to shut a heavy door when he blinked his eyes open again their color had shifted from deep grey to a pale greywhite almost silver you okay i asked him quietly mmmm he murmured sorry got distracted theresa kind of energy here which i probably should have thought of dammit this building was home to constant regular acts of lust and desire those kinds of activities left a sort of psychic imprint around them a vibe thomas must have picked up on vampires like my brother take not blood but lifeenergy from their victims showing off his supernatural strength might have simplified things for us but it also cost thomas some of that energy the same way an afternoon of hiking might leave you and me particularly hungry usually vampires of the white court fed during the act of sex they could induce desire in others overwhelm their victims with undiluted primal lust if he wanted to thomas could have paralyzed the girl where she stood stalked over to her and done whatever he pleased to her there wouldnt have been anything she could do to stop him hell she would have begged him to do more and to hurry up about it he wouldnt do it not anymore anyway hed fought that part of himself for years and hed finally found a way to keep it under controlby feeding in the equivalent of tiny harmless nibbles from the customers in the uppertier beauty salon he owned and operated i gathered that while it did enable him to remain active and in control of himself it was nowhere near as satisfying as acquiring energy the oldfashioned wayin a stalking seduction culminating in a burst of lust and ecstasy i knew that his hunger that inhuman portion of his soul that was driven by naked need was screaming at him to do exactly that if he did though it could do the girl serious harm even kill her my brother wasnt like thatbut denying his hunger wasnt something that came naturally it was a fight and i knew what drove him to it that girl looks a little like justine i commented he froze at the name his expression hardening by gradual degrees his eyes darkened to their usual color again thomas shook his head and gave me a wry smile does she enough i said you okay as i ever am he said he didnt actually thank me but it was in his voice i pretended that i hadnt heard it there which was what he expected me to do its a guy thing billie came fibrillating back over to us this way please sir she said her smile once again firmly in place she led us rather nervously through the gym passing the hallway that led to the showers and private therapy rooms in back the door she led us through went to a very plain practical businesslike hallway one youd find in any office building she nodded to the last door in the hall the corner office and then retreated quietly i ambled up to the door knocked once and then opened it to find ms demeter sitting in her large but practical office behind her large but practical desk she was a fitlooking woman in early middle age lean well dressed and reserved her real name wasnt demeter but she preferred the professional sobriquet and now wasnt the time to needle her ms demeter i said keeping my tone neutral good day she finished turning off her laptop folded it shut and put it away in a drawer before she looked up and gave me a quiet nod mister dresden what happened to your face its always like this i said i forgot to put on my makeup today ah she said will you have a seat thanks i said i sat down across the desk from her i apologize if ive inconvenienced you her shoulder twitched in a nanoshrug its nice to know the limitations of those ive appointed my receptionist she replied what can i do for you then she lifted her hand wait allow me to rephrase what can i do to most quickly get rid of you a sensitive guy might have felt a little hurt by that remark good thing im me im looking for marcone i told her have you called his office i blinked slowly at her once then i repeated im looking for marcone im sure you are demeter said her expression never flickering what does that have to do with me i felt a tight smile strain my lips ms d i cant help but wonder why you instructed your receptionist to tell anyone who asked after you that you werent in the office perhaps i had some paperwork i needed to get done or perhaps you know that marcone is missing and youre using it as a tactic to stall any of his lieutenants who come nosing around looking to fill the void she stared at me for a moment her expression giving away nothing i really cant say that i know what youre talking about mister dresden you sure you dont want to get rid of me i asked you want me to stay here and lean on you i can make it really hard for you to do business if im feeling motivated im sure demeter replied why would you want to find him i grimaced i have to help him she arched a single wellplucked eyebrow have to its complicated i said and not terribly credible she replied i am well aware of your opinions regarding john marcone and even assuming that i had any information as to his whereabouts im not sure that id wish to make a bad situation worse how could you do that i asked by involving you she replied you clearly do not have mr marcones best interests in mind and your involvement could push his captors into precipitous action i doubt youd lose a moments sleep were he to be killed i would have shot back a witty reply if i hadnt slipped on a banana peel of selfrecrimination having said more or less those exact words not long before but sir came billies voice in protest from the hall outside the doorway darkened behind me and i turned to find several large men standing there the foremost of their number was a big guy late forties with an ongoing romance with beer or maybe pasta he wore his heart on his potbelly his welltailored suit mostly hid the gut and it would have concealed the shoulder rig and sidearm he wore beneath it if hed made the least effort to avoid exposing it as he moved demeter the big man said i need to speak to you privately you couldnt afford me torelli demeter replied smoothly and im in the middle of a business meeting get one of your whores to get him off torelli said you and i have to talk she arched an eyebrow at him regarding i need a list of your bank accounts security passwords and a copy of your records for the last six months he scowled looming over her torelli was the kind of guy who was used to getting his way if he loomed and scowled enough i knew the type i tried to glance past the goons to see whether thomas was in the hallway but could detect no sign of him one wonders if you have been partaking of your product demeter said why on earth should i provide you with my records accounts and funds things are going to change around here whore starting with your attitude torelli glanced at two of the four men behind him and angled his head toward demeter the two goons both of them mediumcaliber chicago bruisers stepped around torelli and walked toward her i grimaced i didnt care for demeter much personally but i needed her and i wouldnt be able to talk her into helping me if she were laid up in intensive care besides she was a girl and you dont hit girls you dont let twobit hired bullies do it either i stood up and turned to face torellis men staff in hand i gave them my hardest look which didnt even slow them down the one on the right threw something at my face and i had no time to work out what it might be i ducked recognized it as a snowspeckled winter glove and realized that it had been a distraction the guy on the left came in on me when i was ducking and kicked a steeltoed work boot at my left knee i turned my leg and took it on the shin it hurt like hell but at least i could still move i rolled to one side placing the goon on my left between myself and the goon on the right he threw a looping right hand at me and i met his knuckles with my staff knuckles crunched the goon howled the other one bulled past his painstunned partner and came at me obviously planning on tackling me to the floor so that all of his buddies could circle up and kick me for a while couldnt have that so i raised my right hand clenched in a fist baring four triplewire bands one on each finger with a thought and a word i released the kinetic energy stored in one of the rings it hit the goon like a locomotive slamming him back and to the floor with a very satisfying thud i turned and kicked the stunned first goon in both shins hah then placed one of my heels against his hip and shoved him to the floor he crumpled i turned to find myself staring down the barrel of torellis gun not bad kid the wouldbe kingpin said that judo or something something like that i could use a man of your skills once my health club finisheshe gave demeter a sour glancereprioritizing you couldnt afford me i said im going to be able to afford a lot he said name your price one hundred and fiftysix gajillion dollars i said promptly he squinted at me as if trying to decide if i was joking or maybe he was just trying to figure out how many zeros i was talking about think youre cute huh im freaking adorable i said especially with the raccoon face ive got going here torellis features darkened kid you just made the last mistake of your life god i said i wish thomas put the barrel of his desert eagle against the back of torellis head and said in a pleasant voice lose the iron nice and slow torelli stiffened in surprise and wasted no time in complying he turned his head slightly looking for his other two goons i could see a pair of feet lying toesup in the hallway but there was no other sign of them i stepped up to him and said calmly take your men and get out dont come back he regarded me with dull eyes then pressed his lips together nodded once and began gathering up his men thomas picked up torellis gun and stuck it down the front of his pants just like youre not supposed to do he walked quietly over to stand beside me his eyes tracking every movement the thugs made they departed half carrying the poor bastard with the broken hand while the two in the hallway staggered along barely recovered from being choked unconscious once they were gone i turned to face demeter where were we i was questioning your motives she said i shook my head helen you know who i am you know what i do yeah i think marcone is a twisted son of a bitch who probably deserves to die but that doesnt mean im planning on carrying out the deed she stared at me in silence for ten or fifteen seconds then she turned to her desk drew out a notepad and wrote something on a piece of paper she folded it and offered it to me i reached out for it but when i tugged she didnt let go promise me she said give me your word that youll do everything you can to help him i sighed of course the words tasted like a rancid pickle coated in salt and vinegar but i managed to say them i will you have my word demeter let go of the paper i looked at it an address nothing more it might help you she said it might not thats more than i had a minute ago i said i nodded to thomas lets go dresden demeter said as i walked to the door i paused thank you for handling torelli he would have hurt some of my girls tonight i glanced back at her and nodded once then thomas and i headed for the suburbs chapter twelve m arcones business interests were wide and varied they had to be when youre laundering as much money as he was he had restaurants holding companies importexport businesses investment firms financial businesses of every descriptionand construction companies sunset point was one of those boils festering on the face of the planet a subdivision located half an hour north of chicago it had once been a pleasant little wood of rolling hills around a single tiny river the trees and hills had all been bulldozed flat exposing naked earth to the sky the little river had been choked into a sludgy trough underneath the blanket of snow the place looked as smooth and white and sterile as the inside of a new refrigerator look at this i said to thomas i gestured at the houses each of them on a lot that exceeded the buildings foundation by the width of a postage stamp people pay to live in places like this you live in the basement of a boardinghouse thomas said i live in a big city and i rent i said houses like these go for several hundred thousand dollars if not more itll take thirty years to pay them off theyre nice houses thomas said theyre nice cages i responded no space around them nothing alive places like this turn a man into a gerbil he comes home and scurries inside then he stays there until hes forced to go back out to the job he has to work so that he can make the mortgage payments on this gerbil habitat and theyre way nicer than your apartment thomas said totally he brought the hummer to a crunching halt in the snow glaring through the windshield damn snow im only guessing where the streets are at this point just dont drive into whats going to be somebodys basement i said we passed twentythird a minute ago we must be close twentythird court place street terrace or avenue thomas asked circle damned culdesacs he started forward again driving slowly there he said nodding to the next sign that emerged from the haze that one yeah next to the customized street sign was a standard road sign declaring twentyfourth terrace a dead end damned foreshadowing i muttered whats that nothing we drove through the murky grey and white of a heavy snowfall the light luminous without source reflected from billions of crystals of ice the hummers engine was a barely audible purr by comparison the crunch of its tires on snow was a dreadful racket we rolled past half a dozen model houses all of them lovely and empty the snow piling up around windows that gaped like eye sockets in a halfburied skull something wasnt right i couldnt have told you what exactly but i could feel it as plainly as i could feel the carved wood of the staff i gripped in my hands we werent alone thomas felt it too moving smoothly he reached an arm behind the drivers seat and drew forth his sword belt it bore an old us cavalry saber hed carried on a number of dicey occasions paired up with a more recent toy hed become fond of a bentbladed knife called a kukri like the one carried by the ghurkas what is that he asked quietly i closed my eyes for a moment reaching out with my arcane senses attempting to detect any energies that might be moving in around us the falling snow muffled my magical perceptions every bit as much as it did my physical senses not sure i said quietly but whatever it is its a safe bet it knows were here how do you want to play it if the music starts ive got nothing to prove i said i say we run like little girls suits me but dont let murphy hear you talking like that yeah she gets oversensitive about little my shoulders tightened with the tension as thomas drove forward slowly and carefully he stopped the car beside the last house on the street it had a finished look to it the bushes of its landscaping poking up forlornly through the snow there were curtains in the windows and the faint marks of tire tracks not quite full of new snowfall led up the drive and to the closed garage someones behind that third window thomas said quietly i saw them move i hadnt seen anything but then i wasnt a supernatural predator complete with a bucketful of preternaturally sharp senses i nodded to let him know that id heard him and scanned the ground around the house the snow was untouched were the first visitors i said were probably making someone nervous gunman probably i said thats what most of marcones people are used to come on you dont want me to wait out here i shook my head theres something else out here it might be nothing but youre a sitting duck in the car maybe if youd gotten the armored version nag nag nag thomas said lets be calm and friendly i said i opened the door of the hummer and stepped out into snow that came up over my knees i made sure not to move too quickly and kept my hands out in plain sight on the other side of the hummer thomas mirrored me hello the house i called anyone home my voice had that flat heavy timbre you can only get when theres a lot of snow almost like we were standing inside my name is dresden im here to talk silence the snow started soaking through my shoes and my jeans thomas whipped his head around toward the end of the little street where the subdivision ended and the woods that were next in line for the bulldozers began he stared intently for a moment its in the trees he reported quietly the hair on the back of my neck stood up and i hoped fervently that whatever was out there it didnt have a gun im not here for trouble i called toward the house i held up two fingers and said scouts honor this time i saw the curtain twitch and caught a faint stir of motion behind it the inner door to the house opened and a mans voice said come in hands where i can see them i nodded at thomas he lifted his hand holding his car key and pointed it at the hummer it clunked and chirped its doors locking he came around the car sword belt hanging over his shoulder while i broke trail to the front porch struggling through the snow i knocked as much of the powder as i could off my lower body using it as an excuse to give me time to ready my shield bracelet i didnt particularly want to step through a dark doorway presenting a shootinggallery profile to any gunman inside without taking precautions when i came in i held my shield before me silent and invisible stop there growled a mans voice staff down show your hands i leaned my staff against the wall and did so id know those monosyllables anywhere hi hendricks a massive man appeared from the dimness in the next room holding a policeissue riot gun in hands that made it look like a childs toy he was built like a bull and you could apply thick and rocklike to just about everything in his anatomy especially if you started with his skull he came close enough to let me see his closecropped red hair dresden step aside i did and the shotgun was trained on my brother you vampire sword down fingers laced behind your head thomas rolled his eyes and complied how come he doesnt have to put his hands behind his head wouldnt make any difference with him hendricks replied narrow beady eyes swiveled like gun turrets back to me what do you want i wasnt sure id ever heard hendricks speak a complete sentence much less string phrases together it was sort of disconcerting the way it would be if mister suddenly developed the capacity to open his own cans of cat food it took me a second to get over the mental speed bump uh i said i want to i realized how lame this was going to sound i gritted my teeth and said it quickly i want to help your boss there was a clicking sound from the wall the sound of an audio speaker popping to life a womans voice said send the wizard up hendricks growled you sure do it the vampire stays downstairs hendricks grunted and tilted his head to the right through there and up the stairs dresden move it harry thomas said quietly hendricks brought his shotgun back up and covered thomas not you prettyboy you stay put or both of you get out its okay i said quietly to my brother i feel better if someone i trust is watching the door anyway just in case someone else shows up i cast my eyes meaningfully in the direction of the woods where thomas had said something lurked he shook his head whatever then he leaned back against the wall casual and relaxed his hands behind his head as if they were there only to pillow his skull i brushed past hendricks without slowing down or looking behind me i said careful with that gun he gets hurt and its going to be bad for you hendricks hendricks ignored me i had a feeling it was his strongest conversational ploy i went up the stairs noting a couple of details as i went first that the carpet was even cheaper than mine which made me feel more confident for some obscure reason second that there were bloodstains on it a lot of them at the top of the stairs i found more bloodstains including a long smear along one wall i followed them down to one of three bedrooms on the upper level of the house i paused and knocked on the door come in dresden said a womans voice i came in miss gard lay in bed it had been hauled over to the window so that she could see out of it she had a heavy assault rifle of a design i didnt recognize next to her the wooden handle of a doubleheaded battleax leaned against the bed within reach of her hand gard was blond tall athletic and while she wasnt precisely beautiful she was a striking woman with cleancut features icy blue eyes and an athletes build she was also a mess of blood she was soaked in it so was the bed beneath her her shirt was open revealing a black athletic bra and a long wound that ran the width of her stomach just below her belly button slick greyred ropy loops protruded slightly from the wound my stomach twisted and i looked away goodness miss gard said her voice quiet and rough her face pale youd think you never saw anyone disemboweled before just relieved i said i forced myself to face her first time today ive run into someone who looks worse than me she showed me a weary smile for a moment you need a doctor i said she shook her head no yes i said you do im surprised you havent bled to death already think of what it would cost monoc securities to replace you they wont need to ill be fine the company has a great health care package she picked up a small tube of what looked like heavyduty modeling glue from the bed at her side this isnt the first time ive had my guts ripped out it isnt fun but ill make it damn i said genuinely impressed are they hiring the question won another faint smile you dont really fit the employee profile i am tired of being kept down by the man i said gard shook her head wearily how did you find us demeter i said she lifted a golden eyebrow i suppose that shouldnt surprise me though ive warned him hes too trusting marcone is too trusting i widened my eyes at her lady that pretty much puts you in a paranoiac league of your own it isnt paranoiajust practical experience a safe house isnt safe if it isnt secret she reached down and pressed bloodied fingers against a loop of gore gently kneading it back into the wound she let out a hiss of pain as she did but she didnt let a little thing like an exposed internal organ get in the way of conversation you threatened her uh mostly i told her id help marcone she lifted the tube of airplane glue and smeared some of it onto either side of the wound where shed pushed her guts back in she bled a little more i noted that several inches of the wound had already been closed and sealed together you gave her your word gard asked uh yeah but i couldnt take it anymore look could you maybe not do that while we talk it makes it sort of hard for me to focus on the conversation she pressed the edges of the wound together letting out a breathy curse in a language i didnt know did you know she said that this kind of glue was originally developed as an emergency battlefield suture did you know that youre about to find out what i had for breakfast this morning i countered i dont know if its true she continued i saw it in a movie withdammitwith werewolves she exhaled and drew her hands slowly from the wound another two or three inches of puckered flesh were now closed together gard looked awful her face grey and lined with pain why dresden why are you looking for marcone the short version its my ass if i dont she squinted at me its personal pretty much ill give you my word on it if you like she shook her head its notyour word that i doubt thatsalways been good she closed her eyes against the pain and panted for several seconds but i need something from you what the white council she rasped i want you to call upon the white council to recover marcone i blinked at her uh what she grimaced and began packing another couple inches of intestine back into her abdomen the accords have been breached a challenge must be lodged an emissary summoned as a wardenshe gasped for a moment and then fumbled the glue into placeyou have the authority to call a challenge her fingers slipped and the wound sprang open again she went white with pain dammit sigrun i said more appalled at her pain than her condition and moved to help her get your hands out of the way when she did i managed to close the wound a little more giving the sharpsmelling glue a chance to bond the flesh closed she made an effort to smile at me wewe worked well together at the beer festival youre a professional i respect that ill bet you say that to all the guys who glue your stomach back together call the council gard said lodge the challenge ive got a better idea i said tell me where marcone is ill go get him and bring him home and this will all be over she started pushing the next bit back in while i waited with the glue it isnt that simple i dont know where he is i caught on but you do know who took him yes another signatory of the accords just as marcone is now i have no authority to challenge their actions but you do you may be able to force them into the light bring the pressure of all the members of the accords against them oh sure i said laying out more glue the council just loves it when one of their youngest members drags the entire organization into a fight that isnt their own you would know wouldnt you gard rasped its not as though it would be the first time i held the wound together waiting on the glue i cant i said quietly she was breathing too quickly too hard i could barely keep the wound closed whatever youngghsay after allits your ass on the line i grimaced and withdrew my fingers slowly making sure the wound stayed closed wed gotten the last few inches and the opening no longer gaped cant deny that i said then i squinted at her who is it i asked which signatory of the accords swiped marcone youve met them once already gard said from downstairs thomas suddenly shouted harry i whirled toward the door in time for the window behind me to explode in a shower of glass it jounced off my spelllayered leather duster but i felt a pair of hot stings as bits of glass cut my neck and my ear i tried to turn and had the impression of something coming at my face i slapped it aside with my left hand even as i ducked then hopped awkwardly back from the intruder it landed in a crouch upon the bed digging one foot into the helpless gards wounded belly a creature barely more than the size of a child it was red and black vaguely humanoid in shape but covered in an insects chitin its eyes were too large for its head multifaceted and its arms ended in the serrated clamps of a preying mantis membranous wings fluttered at its back a low and maddening buzzing and that wasnt the scary part its eyes gleamed with an inner fire an orangered glowand immediately above the first set of eyes another set this one blazing with sickly green luminescence blinked and focused independently of the first pair a sigil of angelic script burned against the chitin of the insectthings forehead i suddenly wished very much that my staff werent twenty feet away and down a flight of stairs it might as well have been on the moon for all the good it was going to do me no sooner had that thought come out than the knight of the blackened denarius opened its insectoid maw let out a brassy wail of rage and bounded at my face chapter thirteen a t one time in my life a shapeshifted demonically possessed maniac crashing through a window and trying to rip my face off would have come as an enormous and nasty surprise but that time was pretty much in the past id spent the last several years on the fringes of a supernatural war between the white council of the wizards and the vampire courts in the most recent years id gotten more directly involved wizards who go to a fight without getting their act together tend not to come home worse the people depending on them for protection wind up getting hurt the second most important rule of combat wizardry is a simple one dont let them touch you whether youre talking about vampires or ogres or some other kind of monstrous nasty most of them can do hideous things to you if they get close enough to touchas even a lesser member of the gruff clan had demonstrated on my nose the night before the prime rule of combat wizardry is simple too be prepared wizards can potentially wield tremendous power against just about anything that might come alongif were ready to handle it the problem is that the things that come after us know that too so the favored tactic is the sudden ambush wizards might live a long time but we arent rendproof youve got to think ahead in order to have enough time to act when the heat is on id made myself ready and taught young wizards with even less experience than me how to be ready toofor an occasion just such as this the coil of steel chain in my coat pocket came out smoothly as i drew it because id practiced the draw thousands of times and i whipped one end at the mantisthings face it was faster than me of course they usually are those two clamps seized the end of the chain the mantiss jaws clamped down on it and the creature ripped the chain from my hands with a wrench of its head and upper body quicker than thought that was a positive thing really the mantis hadnt had time to notice two important details about the chain first that the whole thing was coated in copper second that a standard electrical plug was attached to the other end i flipped my fingers at the nearest wall outlet and barked galvineus the plug shot toward the outlet like a striking snake and slammed home the lights flickered and went dim the denarian hopped abruptly into the air and then came down thrashing and twitching madly the electricity had forced the muscles in its jaws and clamps to contract and it couldnt release the chain acrid smoke began to drift up from various points on its carapace wizard gard gasped she gripped the wooden handle of her ax and tossed it weakly toward me i heard shouting and the bellow of a shotgun coming from downstairs it stayed in the background unimportant information everything that mattered to me was nearly within an arms length the ax bounced and struck against my leg but my duster prevented it from cutting into me i picked up the axchrist was it heavyhauled off and brought it straight down on the denarian as if id been splitting cordwood the ax crunched home sinking to the eye somewhere in the denarians thorax the things convulsions ripped the weapon out of my handsand the plug from the wall outlet the mantiss head whipped toward me and it screamed again it ripped out the ax and came to its feet in the same instant get clear gard rasped i did diving to the side and going prone the wounded woman emptied her assault rifle into the mantis in two or three seconds of howling thunder shooting from the hip from about three feet away words cannot convey how messy that was suffice to say that it would probably cost more to remove the ichor stains than it would to strip and refinish the walls the floor and the ceiling gard gasped and the empty rifle slid from her fingers she shuddered and pressed her hands to her belly i moved to her side and picked her up trying not to strain her stomach she was heavy not like a sumo wrestler or anything but she was six feet tall in her bare feet and had more than the usual amount of muscle she felt at least as heavy as thomas i grunted with effort got her settled and started for the door gard let out a croaking little whimper and more blood welled from her injury faint pangs of sympathetic pain flickered through my own belly her eyes had rolled back in her head it had taken a lot to beat gards apparent pain threshold but it looked like the visit from the denarianand the activity it had forced on herhad done it the day just couldnt have gotten any more disturbing until the splattered mass that had been the denarian started quivering and moving oh you have got to be kidding me i shouted where there had been one big bug thing now there were thousands of little mantislike creatures they all began bounding toward the center of the room piling up into two mounds that gradually began to take on the shape of insectoid legs the shotgun downstairs roared again and running footsteps approached harry thomas shouted he appeared at the bottom of the stairs sword in hand just as i hurried out the door still toting gard we had company up here i called i started down the stairs as quickly and carefully as i could i think there are three more of them down here thomas said making way for me he took note of gard holy crap a corpse lay on the floor of the entry hall it was black and furry and big and i couldnt tell much more about it than that the top fourfifths of its head were gone and presumably accounted for the mess all over the opposite wall its guts were spilled out on either side of its body steaming in the cold air drifting through the shattered front door hendricks crouched in the shadowed living room covering the entryway with his shotgun something scraped over the floorboards of the ceiling above us whats that thomas asked a giant preying mantis demon dragging itself over the floor thomas blinked at me thats just a guess i said hendricks growled how is she not good i said this is a bad spot to be in no defenses here not even a threshold to work with we need to bail shouldnt move her hendricks said it could kill her not moving her will kill her i countered us too hendricks stared at me but he didnt argue thomas was already reaching into his pocket he was tense his eyes flicking restlessly maybe in an attempt to track things that he could hear moving around outside he dug out his key ring and held it with his teeth then he took his saber in one hand that monster desert eagle in the other and started humming froggy went acourting under his breath gard had slowly grown limp and her head lolled bonelessly i was having trouble keeping her steady hendricks i said nodding at gard without a word he set the shotgun aside and took the woman from me i saw his eyes as he did touched with worry and fearand not for himself he took her very gently something i would never have imagined him doing and growled how do i know you wont leave us behind let them rip us apart while you run you dont i said curtly picking up my staff stay if you want these things will kill you both i guarantee it or you take a chance with us your call hendricks glared at me for a moment but when he glanced down at the unconscious woman in his arms the rocky scowl faded he nodded once harry thomas asked how do you want to do this we head straight for your oil tanker i said shortest route between two points and all theyll have the door covered thomas said i hope so okay he said rolling his eyes as long as theres a plan footsteps crossed the floor above us and paused at the top of the stairs thomass gun swiveled toward the stairs i didnt turn i covered the doorway a voice like outoftune violin strings stroked by a rotting cobra hide drifted down the stairs wizard i hear you i said this situation might be resolved without further conflict are you willing to parley why not i answered i didnt turn away from the door have i your word of safe passage you do then you have mine the voice answered whatever i said i lowered my voice to an almost subvocal whisper i was sure only thomas could hear watch them theyll try something the second they get a chance why give them the opportunity thomas murmured because we might find out something important by talking its harder to question corpses switch with me we traded places and i kept my staff pointed at the stairs as the mantisthing came down them it crouched on the topmost step it could occupy while still maintaining visual contact with the entry hall it looked none the worse for wear for being blown to hamburger by gards rifle it crouched the motion eerie and alien and tilted its head almost entirely to the horizontal first one way then the other as it looked at us then its stomach heaved for a second i thought it was throwing up as a yellowandpink mucus began to emerge from its mouth after a second though it lifted its clamplike claws and gripped its head then peeled it back and away from the mucus the motion disturbingly akin to someone donning a toosmall turtleneck sweater a human face emerged from the mucus and gunk while the split carapace of the head flopped about on its chest and upper back the denarian looked like she was about fifteen years old except for her hair which was silvery grey short and plastered to her skull she had huge and gorgeous green eyes a heartshaped face and a delicate pointy chin her skin was pale and clear her cheekbones high her features lovely and symmetrical the second set of green eyes and the sigil of angelic script still glowed faintly on her forehead she smiled slowly i wasnt expecting the chain i thought fire and force were your weapons of choice you were standing on top of someone i knew i said i didnt feel like burning her or blasting her through the wall foolish the girl murmured im still here but so am i you have five seconds to get to the fucking point i said im not going to let you stall while your buddies get into position mantis girl narrowed her eyes the eyes on her forehead narrowed as well trиs creepy she nodded at hendricks and gard my business is with them not you o warden of the white council give them to me you may leave in peace once they are dead i will gather my compatriots and we will depart the city without harm to any innocents i grunted what if i need them alive if you wish i can wait until you have interrogated them yeah thats what i want you standing around behind my back she lifted a talon i give you my solemn word no harm will come to you or your companion tempting i said shall i add in material reward as well mantis girl asked ill pay you two hundred thousand in cash why on earth would you do that she shrugged a shoulder my quarrel is with the upstart baron and his subjectsnot the white council i would prefer to demonstrate my respect to your people instead of causing an untoward altercation with them over the matter of your death uhhuh her smile turned sharper if it pleases you i might offer to entertain you once business is done i let out a harsh burst of laughter oh i said still chortling oh oh oh thats funny she blinked and stared at me uncomprehending the expression made me laugh even harder youyou want me toi mean hells bells do you think i dont know what happens to a mantiss mate once the deed is done she bared her teeth in sudden anger they were shiny and black you want me to trust you i went on still laughing and you think waving some bling and some booty at me is going to get it done god thats so cute i could just put you in my pocket do not deny me what is mine wizard she snarled i will have them make a pact with me i will honor it yeah i said ive seen the way you people honor your pacts let me make you a counteroffer give me marcone safe and whole and get out of town now and ill let you live suppose your offer appeals why should i believe you would allow us to leave in peace i gave her a faint smile and quietly paraphrased a dead friend because i know what your word is worth denarian and you know the worth of mine she stared at me for a moment then she said i will consult my companions and return in five minutes i bowed my head slightly to her she returned the gesture and started up the stairs again she vanished from sight glass broke somewhere upstairs then a redandblack blur flashed down the stairs toward us simultaneously with a chorus of hellish cries from outside treachery doesnt work so well when the other guy expects it and id had the spell ready to go since the second shed turned her back mantis girl didnt get to the bottom of the stairs before i pointed my staff at her and snarled forzare a hammer of pure kinetic energy slammed against her she went flying back the way shed come and when she reached the top of the stairs she kept going crashing through the wall of the house with a tremendous crunch no time to lose something came charging through the doorway to be met by thomass sword and pistol i didnt get a good look at it but got an impression of spiraling antlers and green scales i drew in my will pointed my staff at the front wall of the house and murmured forzare sending out a slow pulse of motion i let it press up against the front wall of the house and then fed more energy into it hardening it into a single striking surface then i drew back and really let loose roaring forzare at the top of my lungs i unleashed everything i had into a blast of energy which struck against the plate of force id just created there was an enormous sound of screaming wood and steel and the entire front wall of the house blasted free from its frame demonic voices howled i turned to find thomas taking advantage of the distraction to whip his saber through scything arcs rondellostyle cutting his opponent to ribbons the denarian bounded away screaming in brassy pain dammit thomas screamed at me thats a brandnew car quit whining and go i shouted back suiting words to action the front wall of the house had come down like a tidal wave shattering into a small ocean of rubble covering the hood of the hummer somewhere beneath the rubble i could hear the other denarians trying to get free we rushed for the hummer and piled in thomas got it started just as mantis girl sailed down from overhead and landed on the hood of the hummer denting it in sharply god dammit thomas snarled he slapped the hummer into reverse and started driving backwardwhile emptying his gun into mantis girl bursts of fluttering insect forms flew up from the gunshots instead of sprays of blood but judging by the screaming it hurt her plenty she tumbled back off the hood and vanished thomas manhandled the hummer into a turn and we left heading back out into the heavy snowfall we all rode in silence for several moments while our heart rates slowed and the terrorfueled adrenaline rush faded then thomas said i dont think we learned much the hell we didnt i said like what we know that there are more than five denarians in town and we know that theyre signatories of the accordswho apparently object to marcones recent elevation thomas grunted acknowledgment what now i shook my head wearily that last spell had been a doozy now i think i turned my head and studied the unconscious gard i think id better call the council chapter fourteen n ow that i had not one but two supernatural hit squads with a good reason to come after me my options had grown sort of limited in the end there was really only one place i could take gard and hendricks without endangering innocent lives st mary of the angels church which was why i told thomas to drive us to the carpenter house i still think this is a bad idea thomas said quietly the plow trucks were working hard but so far theyd barely been keeping even with the snow ensuring that the routes to the hospitals were clear the streets in some places looked like world war i trenches snow piled up headhigh on either side the denarians know that we use the church as a safehouse i said theyll be watching it thomas grunted and checked the rearview mirror gard was still unconscious but breathing hendrickss eyes were shut his mouth slightly open i didnt blame him i hadnt been standing watch over a wounded comrade all night and i felt like i could have taken a nap too what were those things thomas asked the knights of the blackened denarius i replied you remember michaels sword the nail worked into the hilt sure thomas said there are two others like it i said three swords three nails thomass eyes widened for a moment wait those nails from the crucifixion i nodded pretty sure and those things were what michaels opposite number yeah each of those denarian bozos has a silver coin three silver coins thomas said im drawing a blank thirty i corrected him thomas made a choking sound thirty potentially but michael and the others have several of them hidden away at the moment thirty pieces of silver thomas said understanding i nodded each coin has the spirit of one of the fallen trapped inside whoever possesses one of the coins can draw upon the fallen angels power they use it to shapeshift into those forms you saw heal wounds all kinds of fun stuff they tough certifiable nightmares i said a lot of them have been alive long enough to develop some serious talent for magic too huh thomas said the one who came through the door didnt seem like such a badass ugly sure but he wasnt superman maybe you got lucky i said as long as they have the coins hard to kill doesnt begin to describe it ah thomas said that explains it then what i asked thomas reached into his pants pocket and drew out a silver coin a little larger than a nickel blackened with age except for the shape of a single sigil shining cleanly through the tarnish when i gutted captain ugly this went flying out hells bells i spat and flinched away from the coin thomas twitched in surprise and the hummer went into a slow slide on the snow he turned into it and regained control of the vehicle without ever taking his eyes off me whoa harry what i pressed my side up against the door of the hummer getting as far as i physically could from the thing look justjust dont move all right he arched an eyebrow ooookay why not because if that thing touches your skin youre screwed i said shut up a second and let me think the gloves thomas had been wearing gloves earlier when fingering justines scarf he hadnt touched the coin with his skin or hed already know how much trouble he was in good but the coin was a menace and i strongly suspected that the entity trapped inside it might be able to influence the physical world around it in subtle waysenough to go rolling away from its former owner for example or to somehow manipulate thomas into dropping or misplacing it containment it had to be contained i fumbled at my pockets the only container i was carrying was an old crown royal whiskey bag the one that held my little set of gaming dice i dumped them out into my pocket and opened the bag i already had a glove on my left hand my paw had recovered significantly from the horrible burns it had gotten several years before but it still wasnt what youd call pretty i kept it covered out of courtesy to everyone who might glance at it i held the little bag open with two fingers of my left hand and said put it in here and for gods sake dont drop it or touch me with it thomass eyes widened further he bit his lower lip and moved his hand very carefully until he could drop the inoffensive little disk into the crown royal bag i jerked the drawstrings tight the second the coin was in and tied the bag shut then i slapped open the hummers ashtray stuffed the bag inside and slammed it closed again only then did i draw a slow breath and sag back down into my seat jesus thomas said quietly he hesitated for a moment and then said harryis it really that bad its worse i said but i cant think of any other precautions to take yet what would have happened if id touched it the fallen inside the coin would have invaded your consciousness i said it would offer you power temptation once you gave in enough it would own you ive resisted temptation before harry not like this i turned a frank gaze to him its a fallen angel man thousands and thousands of years old it knows how people think it knows how to exploit them his voice sharpened a little i come from a family where everyones an incubus or a succubus i think i know a little something about temptation then you should know how theyd get you i lowered my voice and said gently it could give justine back to you thomas let you touch her again he stared at me for a second a flicker of wild longing somewhere far back in his eyes then he turned his head slowly back to the road his expression slipping into a neutral mask oh he said quietly after a moment he said we should probably get rid of the thing we will i said the church has been up against the denarians for a couple of thousand years there are measures they can take thomas glanced down at the ashtray for a second then dragged his eyes away and glowered at the dented hood of his hummer they couldnt have shown up six months ago when i was driving a buick i snorted as long as youve got your priorities in order i just met them but already i hate these guys thomas said but why are they here why now offhand id say that they were out to wax marcone and prove to the other members of the accords that vanilla mortals have no place among us weirdosi mean superhumans theyre members of the accords id have to look it up i said i doubt theyre signed on as the order of demonpossessed psychotics but from the way mantis girl was talking yeah thomas shook his head so what do they get out of it what does taking marcone prove i shrugged i had already asked myself the same questions and hadnt been able to come up with any answers no clue i said but theyve got what it takes to have torn that building apart and to get around or go through the kind of muscle marcone keeps around him and what the hell are the faerie queens doing getting involved thomas asked i shrugged again id already asked myself that too i hate it when i have to answer my own questions like that we went the rest of the way to michaels place in greyandwhite silence his street was on one of the routes being kept plowed and we had no trouble rolling right up into his driveway michael himself was there with his two tallest sons each of them wielding a snow shovel as they labored to clear the driveway and the sidewalk and the porch of the ongoing snow michael regarded the hummer with pursed lips as thomas pulled in he said something to his sons that made them trade a look with each other then hurry inside michael walked down the driveway to my side of the truck and looked at my brother then at the passengers in the backseat i rolled down the window hey i said harry he said calmly what are you doing here i just had a conversation with preying mantis girl i said i held up a notebook where id scribbled down the angelic sigil while it was still fresh in my memory michael took a deep breath and grimaced then he nodded i had a feeling they might be in town oh i asked the front door of the house opened and a large darkskinned man appeared dressed in blue jeans and a dark leather jacket he wore a gym bag over one broad shoulder and had one hand resting casually inside it he paced out into the cold and the snow as if hed been wearing full winterweather gear rather than casual traveling clothes and stalked over toward us once he got close enough to make out the details his face split into a broad brief grin and he hurried to stand beside michael harry he said his voice deep rich and thick with a russian accent we meet again i answered his grin sanya i replied offering my hand he shook it with enough force to crack bones what are you doing here passing through sanya said and hooked a thumb up at the snow i was on the last flight in before they closed the airport looks like i am staying for a few days his eyes went from my face to the notebook and the pleasant expression on his dark face turned to a brief snarl somebody you know i asked tessa he said and imariel youve met huh his jaw clenched again tessas secondrecruited me tessa is here with friends i sketched the sigil id seen on the blackened denarius a few moments before and held it up to them sanya shook his head and glanced at michael akariel michael said at once i nodded hes in a crown royal bag in the ashtray michael blinked sanya too i hope you have one of those holy hankies id have taken it to padre forthill but i figured theyd have him under observation i need someplace quiet to hole up sanya and michael traded a long silent look sanya frowned examining my brother who is the vampire i felt thomas stiffen in surprise as a rule even members of the supernatural world cant detect what a vampire of the white court truly is unless hes actually in the middle of doing something vampity its a natural camouflage for his kind and they rely upon it every bit as much as a leopard does its spots but it can be tough to hide things from a knight of the cross maybe its a part of the power theyre given or maybe its just a part of the personality of the men chosen for the jobdont ask me which im fuzzy on the whole issue of faith and the almighty and i swim those waters with extreme caution and as much brevity as possible i just know that the bad guys rarely get to sneak up on a knight of the cross and that the knights have a propensity for bringing the truth to light i met sanyas gaze for a moment and said hes with me hes also the reason akariel has a date with the inside of a vault sanya seemed to consider that for a moment he glanced at michael who gave a grudging nod the younger knight pursed his lips thoughtfully at that his gaze moving to the backseat hendricks had woken up but he hadnt moved he watched sanya with steady beady eyes the woman sanya said frowning what is she hurt i said something like chagrin flickered over his features da of course you would not bring her here if you thought her a danger not to you or me i said tessa might have a different opinion sanyas eyebrows went up is that how she was wounded that was after she was wounded really sanya peered a little more closely at gard back off hendricks rumbled comrade sanya flashed that swift smile again and displayed open palms to hendricks michael nodded to thomas pull the truck around to the back of the house with all this snow piled up it should be hidden from the street thank you michael i said he shook his head theres a heater in the workshop and a couple of folding cots im not exposing the children to this i understand do you michael asked gently he thumped the trucks dented hood once lightly and waved thomas toward the back of the house twenty minutes later we were all warm if a bit crowded in michaels workshop gard lay on a couch sleeping her color improving almost visibly hendricks sat down with his back to the wall beside gards cot presumably to stand watch but hed started snoring within a few minutes sanya with the help of molly and her siblings was off rounding up food i watched as michael wrapped akariel up in a clean white hankie embroidered with a silver cross muttering a prayer under his breath the whole while then he slipped the hankie into a plain wooden box also adorned with a silver cross excuse me he said i need to secure this where do they keep those things thomas asked after michael had departed i shrugged some big warehouse with a gazillion identical boxes probably thomas snorted dont even think it i said it isnt worth it thomas ran his gloved fingers over the white scarf isnt it you saw how these things operate theyll manipulate your emotions and selfcontrol and something bad would happen to justine or theyd wait until they had you hook line and sinker and you were their meat puppet and something bad would happen to justine thomas shrugged ive got one demon in my head already whats one more i studied his profile youve got one monster in your head already i countered she barely survived it he was still for a moment then he slammed his elbow back against the workshop wall a gesture of pure frustration wood splintered and a little cold air whooshed in maybe youre right he said in a dull voice holy crap i said an idea crystallized in my head and a chill went down my spine thomas rubbed his elbow lightly what i just had a really unpleasant thought i gestured at marcones exhausted retainers i dont think the denarians took marcone so that they could erase him and make an example of him my brother shrugged why else would they do it i bit my lip my stomach turning in uncomfortable flips because i said maybe they want to recruit him chapter fifteen t homas stood watch over our sleeping beauties while i went inside to talk with michael and sanya at the carpenter kitchen table i laid all the cards down see above regarding the general futility of lying to knights of the crossand besides theyd both more than earned my trust it didnt take me very long so i said i think weve got to move fast and get marcone away from them before hes forced to join up michael frowned and folded his broad workscarred hands on the table before him what makes you think hes going to tell them no marcones scum i said but hes his own scum he doesnt work for anyone you are sure sanya asked frowning thoughtfully yeah i said i think thats why they wanted to grab hendricks and gard instead of killing them so they could force him to take the coin or theyd kill his people michael grunted its a frequently used tactic not for tessa sanya said his voice absolutely certain she prefers to find those already well motivated to accept a coin she regards their potential talents as a secondary factor to raw desire michael acceded the point with a nod which would mean that tessa isnt giving the orders sanya showed his teeth in a sudden fierce grin nicodemus is here fu i started to swear but i glanced at michael and changed it to fudgesicles nicodemus nearly killed us all last time he was in town and he did kill shiro both of the knights nodded michael bowed his head and murmured a brief prayer guys i said i know that your first instincts tend to be to stand watch against the night turning the other cheek and so on but hes here with maybe twice the demonpower he had on his last visit if we wait for him to come to us hell tear us apart agreed sanya said firmly take the initiative find him and hit the snake before he can coil to strike michael shook his head brother you forget our purpose we are not given our power so that we can strike down our enemies no matter how much they might deserve it our purpose is to rescue the poor souls trapped by the fallen nicodemus doesnt want to be rescued i said hes in full collaboration with his demon which changes nothing about our duty he said anyone even nicodemus can seek redemption no matter what theyve done as long as they have breath enough to ask forgiveness i dont suppose a pair of sucking chest wounds could get us around that i asked him because if they would id be tickled to provide them sanya let out a bark of laughter michael smiled but it was brief and strained my point is that we can undertake such an aggressive move in only the direst of circumstances faerie stands poised on the brink of an internal war i said which would probably reignite the war between the council and the vampire courtsand in the bad guys favor i might add one of the most dangerous men ive ever known is about to have involuntary access to the knowledge and power of a fallen angel which would give the denarians access to major influence within the united states not to mention the serious personal consequences for me if they succeed in making it happen i looked back and forth between the two knights and held up one hand straight over my head i vote dire all in favor michael caught sanyas hand on the way up and pushed it gently back down to the table this isnt a democracy harry we serve a king sanya frowned for a moment glancing at me but then he settled back in his chair a silent statement of support for michael you want to talk to them i asked michael youve got to be kidding me i didnt say that michael replied but i will not set out to simply murder them and have done its a solution harry but it isnt good enough i settled back in my chair and rubbed at my head with one hand an ache was forming there okay i said quietly trying to make up a plan as i went along what ifi set up a talk could you be lurking nearby for backup michael sighed theres a measure of sophistry in that you know theyll try to betray you if it seems to be to their advantage yeah and itll be their choice to do it thats what youre looking for isnt it some way to deal with the problem while still giving them a choice about what to do preferably in some manner that will get as few good guys killed as possible he looked pained but michael nodded fine i said ill try to set it up how sanya asked let me worry about that i said i checked the clock on the wall crap im late for a meeting can i borrow your phone of course michael said i glanced around the quiet house on my way to the phone and frowned where is everyone charity took them elsewhere for a few days michael said there wont be school in this mess anyway i grunted wheres molly michael paused and then shook his head im not sure i dont think she went with them i thought about it for a moment and thought i knew where shed be i nodded around the kitchen how do you keep things running around here with molly under the roof i figured things would be breaking down left and right lots and lots of preventive maintenance michael replied steadily and about twice as much repair work as i usually do sorry he smiled small price shes worth it the reasons i like michael have nothing to do with swords and the smiting of evil i got on the phone and dialed mcanallys pub mac answered mac the everlaconic owner its harry dresden i said is sergeant murphy there mac grunted in the affirmative put a beer on my tab and tell her im on the way mac grunted yes again thanks man he hung up without saying goodbye i made another call and spoke to a humorlesssounding man with a slavic accent i muttered my password so that no one in the kitchen would overhear it but the connection was so bad that i wound up all but screaming it into the receiver that kind of thing is to be expected when youve got a wizard on both ends it only took the jolly northman about ten minutes to get my call through to my party luccio said a young womans voice whats gone wrong harry hey i protested thats a hell of a thing to say to a man captain just because im calling in doesnt mean that theres some kind of crisis technically true i suppose why are you calling well theres a crisis she made an mmmmmm sound a group known as the knights of the blackened denarius has kidnapped baron marcone the crime lord you took it upon yourself to assist in joining the accords luccio asked amusement in her voice in what way is that relevant to the white council these denarian creeps are also signatories of the accords i said marcones retainers are crying foul theyve asked me to formally protest the abduction and summon an emissary to resolve the dispute seconds of silence ticked by in what way luccio repeated her voice much harder this time is that relevant to the white council the accords dont mean anything if they arent enforced and supported i said in the long run its in our own best interests to make sure theyre supported now before a precedent is set and dont bullshit me the captain of the wardens snarled a hint of an italian accent creeping into her speech if we take formal action it could provoke a wara war we simply cannot afford we all know the red court is only catching its breath we can ill afford the losses weve already taken much less those we might assume in a new conflict i made sure to keep my voice steady grim mab has contacted me personally she has indicated that it is strongly in our own best interests to intervene it wasnt exactly a lie i hadnt ever specified who we meant and with any luck the mention of mab would keep luccios attention completely the only reason the red court hadnt wiped us out in the yearslong war was that mab had given the council rightofway through the portions of the nevernever under her control allowing us wizards to stay as mobile as our opponents who had considerably less difficulty employing mortal vehicles to maneuver its soldiery jesu christi luccio spat she means to withdraw our rightofway through winter if we dont accede to her demands well i said she never actually came out and said that of course she didnt she never speaks plainly at all she does keep her deals though i pointed out she doesnt make deals she cant slide out of shes forbidden the ways to her people but also to the wyldfae as a gesture of courtesy all she needs to do is relax her ban against the wyldfae and wed be forced to travel in strength every time we went through the ways shes a sneaky bitch i agreed i crossed my fingers luccio exhaled forcefully through her nose very well i will forward the appropriate notifications pending approval by the senior council which emissary would you prefer the archive we have a working relationship luccio mmmmm ed again i heard a pencil scratching dresden she said i cannot stress to you enough how vital it is that we avoid general hostilities even with a relatively small power translation dont start another war harry but she continued we can afford to lose the paths through winter even less translation unless you really have to i hear you i said ill do my best do better luccio said her tone blunt there are those on the senior council who hold the opinion that were already fighting one war because of your incompetence i felt heat flush up my neck if they bring that up remind them that my incompetence is the only reason they werent all blasted to molecules by a newborn god i shot back and after that remind them that because of my incompetence were enjoying a ceasefire that we desperately needed to replace our losses and after that that is enough warden the captain snapped i fought down my frustration and clamped my mouth shut hey we were coming up on the holidays theyre a time of miracles ill notify you when i learn something luccio said and hung up the phone i hung up too harder than i really needed to i turned to find michael and sanya staring at me harry michael said quietly that was captain luccio was it not yeah i said you never told us that mab threatened to go back on her bargain well no michael watched me with troubled eyes because she didnt you just lied to luccio yeah i said shortly because i need the councils sayso to set up the meeting because ive got to set up the meeting so that the gang of murdering bastards who tortured shiro to death will have a chance to prove to you that theyve still got it coming harry if the council learns that youve misled them theyll probably charge me with treason i said michael rose from his seat but i stabbed a finger at him the longer we delay the longer those creeps stay in town the longer summers hit men keep coming after me and the more likely it is that innocent people are going to get hurt in the cross fire ive got to move fast and the best way to get the council to move is to let it think its own ass is about to fall into the fire harry michael began dont i said dont give me the speech about redemption and mercy and how everyone deserves a second chance im all for doing the right thing michael you know that but this isnt the time then what is right changes because were in a hurry he asked gently even your book says that theres a time for all things i said a time to healand a time to kill michael looked from me to the corner by the back door where the broadsword amoracchius rested in its humble leather scabbard its plain crusaderstyle hilt bound in wire it isnt that harry ive seen more of what theyve done than you have i have no qualms with fighting them if it comes to that theyve already blown up a building tried to murder me and set off a situation that nearly got your own children burned down in the cross fire in what way has it not come to that instead of answering michael shook his head took up amoracchius and walked further into the house i scowled after him for a minute and muttered darkly under my breath you confused him sanya rumbled i glanced at the darkskinned knight what you confused him sanya repeated because of what you did what lying to the council i dont see that i had much choice but you did sanya said placidly he reached into the gym bag on the floor next to him and drew out a long saber an old cavalry weaponesperacchius a nail worked into the hilt declared it a brother of michaels sword he started inspecting the blade you could have simply moved to attack them by myself im bad but im not that bad hes your friend he would have come with you you know that i shook my head hes my friend period you dont do that to your friends precisely sanya said so instead you have placed your own life in jeopardy in order to protect his beliefs you risk your body to preserve his heart he brought out a smooth sharpening stone and began stropping the sabers blade i suppose he considers it a particularly messianic act thats not why i did it i said of course it isnt he knows that it isnt easy for him usually hes the one protecting another willing to pay the price if he must i exhaled and glanced after michael i dont know what else i could have done da sanya agreed but he is still afraid for you he fell quiet for a moment while his stone slid along the swords blade mind if i ask you something i said the big man kept sharpening the sword with a steady hand not at all you looked a little tense when tessas name came up i said sanya glanced up at me for a second his eyes shadowed and unreadable he shrugged a shoulder and went back to his work she do you wrong barely ever noticed me or spoke to me sanya said to her i was just an employee one more face she did not care who i was this second of hers though the one who recruited you the muscles along his jawline twitched her name is rosanna and she done you wrong i said why do you say that cause when you talk about her your face says that you been done wrong he gave me a brief smile do you know how many black men live in russia dresden no i mean i figure theyre kind of a minority sanya stopped in midstrop and glanced at me for a pregnant moment one eyebrow arched yes he said his tone dry kind of more so than in the states i guess he grunted for moscow i was very very odd if i went out to any smaller towns when i was growing up i had to be careful about walking down busy streets i could cause car accidents when drivers took their eyes off the road to stare at me literally many people in that part of the world had never seen a black person with their own eyes that is changing slowly but growing up i was a minority the way bigfoot is a minority a freak i started putting things together thats the kind of thing that is bound to make a young man a little resentful he went back to sharpening the sword oh yes so when you say that tessa prefers to take recruits she knows will be eager to accept a coin i speak from experience sanya said nodding rosanna was everything that angry poor desperate young man could dream of pretty strong sensual and she truly did not care about the color of my skin sanya shook his head i was sixteen i winced yeah good age for making really bad decisions i speak from experience too she offered me the coin sanya said i took it and for five years the creature known as magog and i traveled the world with rosanna indulged in every vice a young man could possibly imagine andobeyed tessas commands he shook his head and glanced up at me by the end of that time dresden i wasnt much more than a beast who walked upright oh i had thoughts and feelings but they were all slaves to my baser desires i did many things of which i am not he broke off and turned his face away from me i did many things she was your handler i said quietly rosanna she was the one getting you to try the drugs to do the deeds one little step at a time corrupting you and letting the fallen take control he nodded and the whole time i never even suspected it i thought that she cared about me as much as i cared about her he smiled faintly mind you i never claimed to be of any particular intelligence who got you out i asked him shiro in a way sanya said shiro had just driven tessa from one of her projects inantwerp i believe she came storming into rosannas apartment in venice furious she and rosanna had an argument i never completely understoodbut instead of leaving when i was told to do so i stayed to listen i heard what rosanna truly felt about me heard her report about me to tessa and i finally understood what an idiot id been i dropped the coin into a canal and never looked back i blinked at him that must have been difficult my entire life has been one of a snowball in hell sanya said cheerfully though the metaphor is perhaps inverted at the time i judged the action to be tantamount to suicide since tessa was certain to track me down and kill mebut shiro had followed her to venice and he found me instead michaelnot the chicago michael the other onemet us at malta and brought esperacchius here with him offering me the chance to work against some of the evil id helped to create from there i have been knighting is good work plenty of travel interesting people always a new challenge i shook my head and laughed thats putting a positive spin on it i am making a difference sanya said with simple and rocksolid conviction and you dresden have you considered taking up fidelacchius joining us no i said quietly why not sanya asked his tone reasonable you know for what we fight you know the good we do for others your cause runs a close parallel to ours to protect those who cannot protect themselves to pit yourself against the forces of violence and death when they arise im not really into the whole god thing i said and i am an agnostic sanya responded i snorted hells bells tell me you arent still clinging to that you carry a holy blade and hang out with angels the blade has power true the beings allied with that power aresomewhat angelic but i have met many strange and mighty things since i took up the sword if one called them aliens instead of angels it would only mean that i was working in concert with powerful beingsnot necessarily the literal forces of heaven or a literal creator sanya grinned a philosophical fine point true but i am not prepared to abandon it what we do is worthy without ever bringing questions of faith religion or god into the discussion cant argue with that i admitted so tell me sanya said why have you not considered taking up the sword i thought about it for a second and said because it isnt for me and shiro said i would know who to give it to sanya shrugged and nodded his head in acquiescence reason enough he sighed we could use fidelacchiuss power in this conflict i wish shiro were with us now good man i agreed quietly he was a king you know i thought he just liked the kings music no no i said shiro himself he was a direct descendent of the last king of okinawa several generations back but his family was royalty sanya shrugged his broad shoulders there have been many kings over the centuries my friend and many years for their bloodlines to spread through the populace my own family can trace its roots back to salahuddin i felt my eyebrows rise salahuddin you mean saladin king of syria and egypt during the crusades sanya nodded the same he paused in midstrop and looked up at me his eyes widening i know youre agnostic i said but do you believe in coincidence not nearly so much as i once did sanya replied that cant be a coincidence both of you descended from royalty i chewed on my lip could that have something to do with who can take up one of the swords i am a soldier and an amateur philosopher sanya said you are the wizard could such a thing be significant i waggled a hand in midair yes and no i mean there are a lot of factors that tie magic to matters of inheritancegenetic or otherwise a lot of the old rites were intimately bound up with political rulers the king and his land are one sanya intoned solemnly well yeah sanya nodded michael showed me that movie merlin was the only good thing about that movie that and captain picard kicking ass in plate mail with a big ax i waved my hand the point is that in many cultures the king or sultan or whatever held a position of duty and authority that was as much spiritual as physical certain energies could have been connected to that giving the old kings a form of metaphysical significance perhaps something similar to the power of the swords sanya asked i shrugged maybe by the time i was born the planet was running a little low on monarchs it isnt something ive looked at before sanya smiled well now you need only find a prince or princess willing to lay down his or her life over matters of principle do you know any not so much i said but ive got a feeling that were onto something i glanced at the clock on the wall its getting late ill be back here in about two hours or ill call da sanya said we will watch over your criminals for you thanks i said and went back out to the workshop hendricks had slumped to the floor and was sleeping gard was actually snoring thomas had been pacing restlessly when i entered well he asked gotta get to macs and meet murphy i said lets roll thomas nodded and headed for the door i reached into the trash can by the door took out an empty motor oil can and tossed it into the least cluttered corner of the workshop it bounced off something in midair and molly let out a soft yelp appearing there a moment later rubbing a hand to her hip whered she come from thomas demanded crossly what did i miss molly demanded her tone faintly offended i had all the senses covered even thomas didnt know i was there you didnt miss anything i said i just know how you think grasshopper if i cant make you stay where its safe i might as well keep you where i can see you maybe youll even be useful youre with us mollys eyes gleamed excellent she said and hurried over to join me chapter sixteen i was more than an hour late and murphy was not amused your nose looks worse than it did yesterday she said when i sat down at the table i think the black eyes have grown too gosh youre cute when youre angry i responded her eyes narrowed dangerously it makes your little button nose all pink and your eyes get bloodshot and even bluer did you have any last words dresden or should i just choke you now mac i called raising a hand two pale she fixed me with a steady look and said dont think you can buy your way out of this with good beer i dont i said rising im buying my way out of it with really really good beer i walked over to the bar as mac set two bottles of his microbrewed liquid nirvana down and took off the caps with a deft twist of his hand disdaining a bottle opener i winked at him and picked up both bottles then sauntered back over to murphy i gave her my bottle took mine and we drank she paused after the first taste and blinked at the bottle before drinking again more deeply this beer she pronounced after that just saved your life macs a master beeromancer i replied id never tell him but at the time i wished hed serve his brew cold id have loved to hold a frosty bottle against my aching head for a moment youd think the pain from the damned broken nose would fade eventually but it just kept on stubbornly burning we had settled down at a table along one wall of the pub there are thirteen tables in the room and thirteen wooden pillars each extensively carved with scenes mostly out of old world fairy tales the bar is crooked and has thirteen stools and thirteen ceiling fans whir lazily overhead the setup of the entire place is designed to diffuse and refract random magical energies the kind that often gather around practitioners of magic when theyre grumpy or out of sorts it offers a measure of protection from accumulated negative energies enough to make sure that annoying or depressing vibes for lack of a more precise term dont adversely affect the moods and attitudes of the pubs clientele it doesnt keep out any of the supernatural riffraffthats what the sign by the door is for mac had the place legally recognized as neutral ground among the members of the unseelie accords and members of any of the accorded nations had a responsibility to avoid conflict in such a place or at least to take it outside still neutral ground is safe only until someone thinks they can get away with violating the accords its best to be cautious there on the other hand murphy said more quietly maybe youre too pathetic to beat to death right now my nose you mean compared to the way my hand felt its nothing i said still cant be much fun well no she watched me through her next sip and then said youre about to play the wizard card and tell me to butt out not exactly i said she gave me her cop eyes all professionally detached neutrality and nodded once so talk remember the guys from the airport a few years back yeah killed the old okinawan guy in the chapel he died real bad i smiled faintly i think hed probably argue the point if he could she shrugged and said tone quietly flat it was a mess the guys behind it are back theyve abducted marcone murphy frowned her eyes distant for a moment calculating theyre grabbing his business or forcing him onto their team i said im not sure yet were working on it we you remember michael i asked charitys husband yeah i remember that at the airport we found a couple of men with no tongues and fake identification theyd been killed with long blades swords if you can believe that in this day and age it was messy harry she put her hands flat on the table and leaned toward me i dont like messy im all kinds of sorry about that murph i said its possible that a grain or two of sarcasm was showing in my reply ill be sure to ask them to put on the kid gloves if i survive asking the question ill let you know what they say murphy regarded me calmly theyre back then i nodded only this time they brought more friends to the party she nodded where are they no murph where are they harry murph asked her voice hard if theyre that dangerous im not waiting for them to choose their ground so that we have to rush into a hostile situation in response to them well go after them right now before they have a chance to hurt anyone else itd be a slaughter murphy maybe she said maybe not youd be surprised what kinds of resources the department has gotten its hands on what with the whole war on terror right and youre going to tell your bosses what that the same terrorists who attacked the airport and murdered a woman in the marina are in the city planning another operation that the only way to ensure the safety of its citizens is to preemptively assault them then show up with swat si every cop in town anyone we can get from the bureau and all the military backup available on short notice i sat back in my chair at that startled at murphys toneand at the possibilities hell the kind of firepower she was talking about might give even the denarians pause and given the current climate terrorist plot was all but synonymous with respond with overwhelming force oh sure most modern weaponry was far less effective on supernatural targets than anyone without knowledge of them would expectbut even reduced to the effectiveness of bee stings enough bee stings can be just as deadly as a knife in the heart humanity at large enjoys a dichotomous role in supernatural politics on the one hand they are sneered at and held in contempt for being patently unable to come to grips with reality to the point where the supernatural world hardly needed to bother to hide from them given half a chance the average human being would rationalize the most bizarre of encounters down to unusual but explainable events they are referred to as herd animals by a lot of the things that prey on them and often toyed with and tormented on the other hand no one wants to get them stirred up either humanity when frightened and angry is a force even the supernatural world does not wish to reckon with the torches and pitchforks are just as deadly in their numbers and their simple rage as they ever wereand it was my opinion that most of the supernatural crowd had very little appreciation for just how destructive and dangerous mankind had grown in the past century which is why i found myself sorely tempted to let the denarians get a big old faceful of angry cop five or six rifles like gards might not kill mantis girlbut if you followed them up with thirty or forty pairs of stompy combat boots for all the little bugs little miss clamphands could go down for the count of course all that was predicated on the idea that the humans involved a knew what they were up against and b took it seriously and worked together tightly enough to get the job done murphy and the guys in si might have a pretty good grasp of the situation but the others wouldnt theyd be expecting a soldier movie but theyd be getting something out of a horror flick instead i didnt for one second believe that murphy or stallings or anyone else in chicago could make everyone involved listen to them once they started talking about demons and monsters i rubbed at my head again thinking of sanya maybe we could try to explain it in more palatable terms instead of shapeshifting demons we could tell them that the terrorists were in possession haha get it of experimental genetically engineered biomimetic armored suits maybe that would give them the framework they needed to get the job done and maybe it wouldnt maybe theyd run into something out of a nightmare and start screaming in fear coordination and control would go right out the window especially if the denarians had anyone with enough magical juice to start blowing out technology then would come the panic and slaughter and terror its an idea i said to murphy maybe even a workable idea but i dont think its time has come at least not yet her eyes flashed very blue and youre the one who decides i took another sip of beer and set the bottle down again deliberately apparently says who murphy demanded i leaned back in my chair in the first place i said quietly even if you brought in all that firepower the best you could hope for is a hideously bloody costly victory in the second place theres a chance that i can resolve this whole thing through council channelsor at least make sure that when the fur starts flying were not in the middle of the bloody town but you and in the third place i continued i dont know where they are murphy narrowed her eyes and then some of the tension abruptly left her features youre telling me the truth usually do i said i could probably track them down given a day or so but it might not come to that she studied my face for a moment but you dont think that talk will stop them from whatever theyre doing here not a chance in hell but hopefully ill talk them out of the woodwork to someplace a little more out of the way what if someone gets hurt while youre scheming she asked those encounters people were having last night are getting attention no ones been hurt so far but that could change im not prepared to tolerate that those were something else i said tiredly something i dont think will be a threat to the public i told her about summers hitters she drank the rest of her beer in a single tip then sighed nothings ever simple with you i shrugged modestly heres the problem harry she said quietly last time these maniacs were around there were bodies and there were reports several witnesses gave a fairly good description of you and nothing came of it i said nothing came of it because i was in charge of the investigation murphy corrected me her tone slightly sharpening the case was never closed and if similar events bring it up again theres no way i can protect you stallings wouldnt john would probably try murphy said but rudolphs been ladder climbing over in internal affairs and if he gets an opening hell start screaming about it and the case will get kicked up the line and out of sis control i frowned at that turning my bottle around slowly in my fingers well i said that could complicate things murphy rolled her eyes you think dammit harry a long time ago i agreed with you that there were some things that it was better the department didnt get involved in i promised not to go blowing whistles and raising alarms every time things got spooky she leaned forward slightly her eyes intent but im a cop harry before everything else my job is to defend and protect the people of this city and what do you think im doing the best you know how she said without heat i know your heart is in the right place but you can be as sincere as hell and still be wrong she paused to let that sink in and if youre wrong it could cost lives lives im sworn to protect i said nothing you asked me to respect your limits and i have she said quietly i expect you to return the favor if for one second i think that letting you handle this is going to cost innocent lives im not going to stand quietly in the wings im going in and bringing everything i can get my hands on with me and if i do that i expect your complete support and youre the one who gets to decide when that is i demanded she faced me without flinching not a millimeter apparently i leaned back in my seat and sipped beer with my eyes closed murphy didnt know everything that was at stake here more than anyone else on the force sure but she was operating under only partial knowledge if she made the wrong call she could really screw things up beyond all ability to conceive shed probably had that same exact thought about me and on more than one occasion id asked murphy for a lot when id asked her to trust me how could i not return the favor and still call myself her friend simple i couldnt hell if she decided to go in shed do it with or without me in that circumstance my presence could mean the difference between a bloody victory and a disaster and and i suddenly felt a lot more empathy for michaels confusion i opened my eyes again and said quietly you decide to bring cpd in youll have my cooperation but youve got to believe me this isnt the time for that kind of solution she ran her thumb over a scar in the wooden table what if that building had been full of people harry families these denarians could have killed hundreds give me time i said she put her hands on the tables edge and rose facing me with those same neutral eyes again as she started to speak i got a twisty feeling in the pit of my stomach i wish i could she said but the door to the pub slammed open hard enough to strain its hinges and leave marks against the old wooden wall athingcame through the door it was hard for me to tell what it was at first imagine a big man trying to squeeze into a doghouse he has to crouch down and go in sideways one shoulder at a time moving very carefully to avoid harming himself on the door frame thats what this huge greyfurred thing looked like but with horns and cloven hooves the enormous gruffseveral feet taller than any ogre or troll id ever seensqueezed all the way through the door and then rose to a crouch his head shoulders and the top part of his back pressed against the ceiling hunched awkwardly he slowly scanned the room his golden eyes gleaming around their rectangular pupils each knuckle of his closed fists was the size of a freaking cantaloupe and a heavy pungent animal scent filled the air thanks to the snow the pub wasnt crowdedjust a few regulars plus murphy and me but even so this wasnt something you saw every day and the room went totally still the gruff s gaze settled on me then he duckwalked toward my table mac raced for the switch that turned off the fans but the first couple of spinning blades the gruff passed struck sharply against his curling hornsand shattered he did not so much as blink he stopped beside my table and surveyed murphy then turned his huge heavy gaze to me wizard he rumbled in a voice so deep that i could feel it better than i could hear it i have come hence to speak to thee about mine younger brothers the gruff s huge eyes narrowed and its knuckles creaked like shipping hawsers as its fists tightened and the harms thou hast wrought upon them chapter seventeen i picked up my staff and rose to face the enormous gruff murphy watched me with very very wide eyes this is neutral ground i said quietly aye the gruff agreed the accords alone keep thy neck unbroken thy skull uncracked or your enormous ass uncooked i replied staring up and setting my jaw dont start thinking it would be easy tiny mayhap and mayhap not the gruff rumbled tis a question answered only by the field i breathed as shallowly as i could the huge gruff didnt smell bad preciselybut he sure as hell smelled a lot speak we find ourselves at odds friend of winter the gruff rumbled friend of summer too i said they gave me jewelry and everything aye the huge gruff said you have done good service to my court if not to my queen i am surprised then at your use of the bane pon two of my younger kin the bane murphy said quietly iron i clarified i turned back to the gruff they were trying to kill me i wanted to survive no friend of either court would so employ the bane wizard the gruff growled did you not know this it is more than a mere weapon and the pain it causes more than simple discomfort it is a poison body and spirit that you have used pon us i glared at the big idiot they were trying to kill me i repeated only more slowly you know so it would be all insulting i wanted to survive the gruff narrowed its eyes then you intend to continue as you have begun i intend to survive i replied i didnt ask for this fight i didnt begin it thourt fated to die in any case mortal soon or late why not face it with honor and make thy passing more peaceful thereby peaceful i asked barely containing a laugh if i go down fighting tiny i plan for it to be about as unpeaceful as things get i jabbed a finger at him ive got nothing against you and your brothers tiny except that you keep trying to freaking kill me back off and it wont have to get any uglier than it already has the gruff growled it sounded like a dump truck grinding its gears that i will not do i will serve my queen then dont expect anything but more of the same from me i replied you would behave this way in the service of winter the gruff demanded incredulous you who struck the heart of arctis tor what hold has the dark queen pon you mortal sorry tiny but you arent nearly as special as you think you are this is pretty much the way i behave every time someone tries to whack me i gestured at him with my staff so if you came here to try to talk me into lying down and dying you can leave the way you came in and if youre the one coming after me next youd better have more brains than your brothers did or im going to leave you as a great big pile of cold cuts and spare ribs the gruff growled again and gave me a stiff nod then come out and let us settle this uh uhoh showing bravado to the bad guysor the notsobad guys as the case may beis a given a part of the territory but id never taken on anything with the sheer mass of tiny the gruff and i really didnt think id care to try my hand against him without one hell of a lot of preparation first i also had to remember that big didnt necessarily equal stupid not given the circles he apparently moved in in fact most of the higher reaches of the summer court knew a formidable amount of countermagic if tiny here had half the ability id seen demonstrated in the past i would be in real trouble in a straight fight all he had to do was stand outside and wait macs place had only the one door worse thomas and molly were waiting outside in thomass barge and they would be sure to join in i wasnt sure what could happen at that point leaving totally aside the fact that wed be brawling in the middle of chicago in broad daylight i had to think that the gruff might have backup waiting nearby to intervene if anyone outside the business of the courts of winter and summer tried to interfere molly was of limited capability in a fight and thomas tended to believe that the best way to approach any given combat was with a maximum of power speed and aggressive ferocity things could get really messy really fast i was trying to think of a way of getting out of this without getting anyone killed when murphy put her gun on the table and said in a very clear loud challenging tone i dont think so the gruff turned to stare at her in surprise so did mac so did everyone else there heck so did i murphy stood straight up and turned to face the enormous gruff with her feet spread i will not let this challenge to my authority pass the gruff tilted its head to one side its horns dug furrows in the wooden ceiling mac winced lady it rumbled do you know who i am murphy asked a lady knight a shield bearer of this mortal demesne the gruff replied anofficer of the law or so i believe it is called thats right she said calmly i make no challenge to your authority dame murphy she said dame murphy rumbled the gruff but you do murphy said you have threatened one i am sworn to protect the gruff blinkeda considerable gesture on his scaleand glanced at me this wizard yes murphy said he is a citizen of chicago and i am sworn to protect and defend him against those who would harm him dame murphy the gruff said stiffly this matter is not one of mortal concern the hell it isnt murphy said this man lives in chicago he pays taxes to the city he is beholden to its laws she glanced aside at me and her mouth quirked wryly if he is to suffer the headaches of citizenry as he must then it is fair and lawful that he should enjoy the protections offered to every citizen he is therefore under my protection and any quarrel you have with him you also have with me the gruff stared at her for a moment eyes narrowed in thought art thou quite certain of thy position dame murphy quite certain she replied even knowing that the duty solemnly charged unto me and my kin might require us to kill thee master gruff murphy replied laying a hand on her gun for the first time consider for a moment what a steeljacketed round would feel like as it entered your flesh the gruff flicked its ears in surprise a number of napkins were blown from the surface of a nearby table thou wouldst aim such weapons of the bane at a lawful champion of the seelie court in your case master gruff murphy said i would hardly need to aim then she picked up the gun and aimed it at the gruff s eyes i started to panic then i saw where i thought murph was going with this one and i had to work to keep myself from letting out a cheer the gruff s knuckles popped again this it growled is neutral ground chicago she replied has never signed any accords i will fulfill my duty attack me here the gruff said and i will crush you crush me here murphy said and you will have broken the accords while acting on behalf of your queen was that your intention in coming here the gruff ground its teeth a sound like creaking millstones my quarrel is not with you if you attempt to take the life of a citizen of chicago whom i am sworn to protect you have made it my quarrel master gruff does your queen wish to declare war upon the mortal authorities of chicago would she wish you to decide such a thing the gruff stared at her evidently pondering lady has a point tiny i drawled theres nothing to be gained here but trouble and nothing to be lost but a little time walk away youll find me again soon enough the gruff stared at murphy and then at me if id been less intrepid and fearless i would have held my breath hoping id avoided a fight as it was i held my breath mostly to cut down on the smell finally the gruff bowed its head toward murphy with more scraping of ceilings and wincing of bartenders courage he rumbled should be honored though thou art less a man than i thought wizard hiding behind a mortal however valiant she may be i let out a long breath as silently as i could and said gosh somehow ill try to live with myself it will not oerburden you long this i promise the gruff nodded once to murphy then turned and scuttled out the way hed squeezed in he even shut the door behind him murphy let out her breath and put her gun away in its shoulder holster it took her two or three tries i sank into my chair on weak legs you i said to murphy are so hot right now she gave me a weak smile oh now you notice she glanced at the door is he really gone yeah i said i figure he is the summer court arent exactly sweetness and light but they do have a concept of honor and if any faerie gives his word hes good for it mac did something id rarely seen him do he got three black bottles out from beneath the bar and brought them over to the table he twisted the tops off and put one down in front of me and another in front of murphy then kept the third for himself i took up the bottle and sniffed at it i wasnt familiar with the brew but it had a rich earthy aroma that made my mouth water without a word mac held up his bottle in a salute to murphy i joined him murphy shook her head tiredly and returned the salute we drank together and my tongue decided that any other brew it ever had would probably be a bitter disappointment from this day forward too many flavors to count blended together into something i couldnt describe if id had a week to talk about it id never had anything like it it was gods beer mac drained the bottle in a single pull with his eyes closed when he lowered it he looked at murphy and said bravely done murphys face was flushed with relief and with a reaction to her beer that was at least as favorable as mine i doubt mac could have seen it but id known murph long enough to see that she started blushing too mac went back to the bar leaving murphy and me to finish our bottled ambrosia okay murphy said in a weak voice where were we you were about to tell me how you thought i was wrong and that the chicago pd needed to intervene oh murph said right she stared after the departed gruff for a moment you said that that thing was from the nicer of the two groups causing us grief yep i said weve gone up against the supernatural three times she said quietly its ended badly twice we meaning the cops of course i nodded one of those occasions had killed her partner ron carmichael he hadnt been an angel or anything but he had been a good man and a solid cop all right she said quietly im willing to hold off for now on one condition name it im in from here on out you obviously need someone to protect you from the big bad billy goats i snorted yeah obviously she held up the last of her beer i held up mine we clinked them finished them and went back out into the winter cold together chapter eighteen a ll right i said i hearby call this war council to order we were all sitting around my tiny living room eating burger king thomas and molly had voted for mcdonalds but since i was paying i sternly informed them that this was not a democracy and burger king it was hail to the king baby murphy rolled her eyes over the whole thing war council molly asked wideeyed are we going to start another war i sort of meant it as a metaphor i said as i made sure the ketchupmustard ratio on my burger was within acceptable parameters i need to decide on my next step and ive been hit in the head a few times lately figured my brain could use a little help just now worked that out did you thomas murmured quiet you i growled the idea is to generate useful thoughts here not funny ones molly said suppressing a laugh i eyed her she ate a french fry murphy sipped at her diet coke well she said i dont know how much advice i can give you until i know what youre up against i told you in the car i said the knights of the blackened denarius fallen angels old tarnished coins psychotic killers got it murphy said but that doesnt tell me what their capabilities are shes got a point thomas said quietly you havent said much about these guys i blew out a breath and took a big bite of hamburger to give me a moment to think while i chewed theres a lot that these things can do i said afterward mostly the coins seem to allow their users to alter their physical form into something better suited for a fight than a regular human body battle shapeshifting molly said cool it isnt cool i told her then i paused and admitted okay maybe a little it makes them harder to hurt it makes them faster it arms them with various forms of weaponry claws fangs that kind of thing cassius looked like he might have had a poisonous bite for example ursiels wielder could shift into this huge bear thing with claws and fangs and horns another one turned her hair into about a million strips of living titanium blade and they were whipping all over the place and shooting through walls stretched out like twenty or thirty feet i have some customers like that thomas quipped murphy blinked and glanced at him i cleared my throat and gave thomas another glare another one of them nicodemus didnt seem to do any shapeshifting but his freaking shadow could leap off the wall and strangle you creepy as hell they dont all have like a uniform or something molly asked not even close i replied each of the fallen seems to have its own particular preferences and i suspect that those preferences adapt themselves differently to different holders of the coins quintus cassiuss fallen had this whole serpent motif going and cassiuss magic was pretty snakeintensive too but he was totally different from ursiel who was totally different from mantis girl from this morning who was different from the other denarians ive seen murphy nodded anything else goons i said more like a cult really nicodemus had a number of followers whose tongues had been removed they were fanatics heavily armed and crazy enough to commit suicide rather than be captured by his enemies she winced the airport yeah that it no i said nicodemus also had thesecall them guard dogs i guess except that they werent dogs i dont know what they were but they were ugly and ran fast and had big teeth but all of that isnt what makes them dangerous no thomas said then what is the fallen i replied the room fell silent theyre beings older than time who have spent two thousand years learning the ins and outs of the mortal world and the mortal mind i said quietly they understand things we literally could not begin to grasp theyve seen every trick learned every move and theyre riding shotgun for each coin holderif they arent in the drivers seat already every one of them has a perfect memory a library of information at his immediate disposal and a schemer that makes cardinal richelieu look like mother teresa hanging around in his brain as an adviser thomas stared at me very hard for a moment frowning i tried to ignore him murphy shook her head lets sum up an unknown number of enemies with unknown capabilities supported by a gang of madmen packs of attack animals and superhumanly intelligent pocket change she gave me a look its sort of tough to plan for that given how much we dont know well then thats what we do next isnt it molly asked tentatively find out more about them thomas flicked a glance at molly and nodded once to do that wed have to find them i said a tracking spell molly suggested i dont have any samples to work with i replied and even if i did somebody on their team was able to obscure mabs divining spells im nowhere close to mabs league my spells wouldnt have a prayer if theyve got that much of an entourage theyre going to stick out anywhere even vaguely public murphy mused a gang of toughs with no tongues if the denarians are in town that should make them relatively easy to locate last time they were holed up in undertown i said believe me theres plenty of room for badness down there what about the spirit world thomas asked quietly surely theres an entity or two who could tell us something possibly i said im on speaking terms with one or two of the loa but that kind of information is either expensive or unreliable sometimes both and remember who were talking about the fallen are heavyweights in the spirit world no one wants to cross them molly made a frustrated sound if we cant track them with magic and we cant find them physically then how are we supposed to learn more about them exactly kid i said hence the whole war council concept we ate in silence for a few minutes then murphy said were coming at this from the wrong angle eh i said wittily were thinking like the good guys we should be thinking like the bad guys figuring out what they had to face and get around i leaned forward a little and nodded at her to go on i dont know as much about the supernatural aspects of this situation she said i dont know much of anything about these denarians but i do know some things about marcone for example i know that even if he has some underlings who want to take over the franchise hes got more who are personally loyal or who will figure that bailing him out will reap them some major profits yeah i said tilting my head at her so so wherever they took him it has to be somewhere marcones network cant reach we can be virtually certain that they arent hiding in plain sight i grunted hells bells yeah not only that but marcone plans ahead he had that panic room ready to go in fact my eyes widened the location of your secret hideyhole ought to be awfully secret dont you think sure molly said what good is a hiding place if everyone knows where it is the denarians knew exactly where he was going i said the spell they set up to tear down that buildings defenses was no spurofthemoment magicit was too complex it had been planned out ahead of time son of a bitch thomas swore someone inside marcones organization ratted him out so if we find the rat murphy said catching on we might find a trail that leads back to the nickelheads i finished with a fierce grin was this war council concept a brilliant idea or what molly tittered nickelheads i have a gift i said modestly then i added in a low voice and stop giggling wizards dont giggle bad for the image molly buried her giggle in another mouthful of fries i slurped on my coke and turned to murphy so what we need to do is figure out whos going to backstab marcone someone highly placed enough to know the location of the safehouse and who will profit by marcones absence youre assuming the informant was complicit murphy said that wouldnt necessarily be true someone could have inadvertently given information away or been compelled to cooperate i paused to think about that true so well have to start by looking at who could have given away the safe house murphy raked her fingers through her darkgolden hair frowning in thought to be honest si doesnt cross trails with the outfit all that often id have to make some calls to find out thomas drummed his fingers on the arm of his chair the fbi would have more wouldnt they and you know that guy rick right molly said the one who was helping that jerk interrogate me murphys eyes narrowed she made a noise that wasnt quite an agreement but wasnt quite a denial either murphy has issues with her exhusband it took molly about half a second to figure out the expression on murphys face she looked around the room somewhat desperately for a moment uh so harry whats with mister hes been sleeping like a log the whole time weve been here which brings us to the second part of the problem i said the hitters from the summer court i think odds are good that theyve got my place under surveillance thomas arched an eyebrow i didnt sense anything coming in you didnt sense anything walking through the front door of the pub either murphy said archly i was circling the block thomas said crossly middle of a damned blizzard and you still cant find a parking spot i hate this town ive got warning spells spread out all around this place i said anything gets within a block and ill probably know about it and youve got to get up early in the morning to sneak past mouse mouse who was sitting in front of molly making soulful eyes at her chicken sandwich glanced at me and wagged his tail if they were very close id know it theyre probably spread out in a loose ring watching who comes and goes i said the gruffs dont really want to kick my apartment door downnot yet at any rate theyd rather fight where there wont be collateral damage but ive got a feeling that they arent at their best in all this snow molly frowned you think mab is influencing the weather for you maybe the ongoing record snowfall is a coincidence i said but if so its awfully convenient nothings ever convenient with you dresden murphy said exactly my point i rubbed at my jaw i needed to shave but my throbbing nose was bad enough without adding a couple of razor nicks to the mess i didnt trust my hands to be steady there were too many scary things moving around and if i stopped long enough to think about how far in over my head i was getting i might just crawl into a hole and pull it in after me dont think harry you know too much about what youre up against analyze decide and act okay we can assume that the summer crew saw us come in as long as we dont leave theyll assume that were still here molly said aha i wondered why you asked me along i winked at her know thyself grasshopper yeah when we leave i want you to make sure that the gruffs and their crew dont notice hopefully that will buy us some more time while they play patient hunter and wait for me to expose myself again heh thomas sniggered expose yourself murphy tossed an onion ring at him which he caught and popped in his mouth meanwhile ive got a new toy for you to play with thomas my brother arched his eyebrows and focused his attention on me i went into my tiny bedroom and came back out with a small figurine a rough figure of clay that resembled gumby more than anything i lifted it to my mouth and breathed on it then murmured a word and said catch i tossed it to thomas my brother caught it and suddenly a tall man too lanky to look altogether healthy and with too many rough edges to be handsome sat in thomass chair dressed in his clothes his hair had short waves in it and looked perpetually rumpled his eyes were a bit sunken in a permanent state of too little sleep but the line of his chin strong and clean made him look harder and sharper than he might otherwise have appeared hells bells did i really look like that maybe i needed a makeover or something murphy sucked in a breath and looked back and forth between thomas in his new look and me molly didnt bother trying to hide her reaction and just said cool what thomas asked though the figure speaking looked like me the sound of my brothers voice was unchanged and a spot of ketchup from his burger still speckled one side of his mouth he looked around for a moment then scowled rose and ducked into my bedroom to look at himself in the little shaving mirror in the drawer in my bathroom youve invented a doll that turns people into their ugly half brothers eh get over yourself prettyboy i called if you think im letting you break my nose to complete the look youre insane i grunted yeah thats a problem i had to set it up to look like i looked the day i finished it it isnt a problem molly said at once ill get my makeup kit and fix up his eyes for him at least i dont know what we can do for his nose but from a distance he should look right if he looks like you harry murphy said doesnt that mean hes going to be attracting some sort of hostile attention thomas snorted and appeared in the doorway to my bedroom his face ketchupfree harry walks around looking like this all the time now that would be awful i can handle it for a few hours dont get cute on me i said give us two or three hours lead time and then head out stay on the roads and keep moving dont give them a chance to surround you youve got your cell phone i suppose he said but given how much ive been hanging around you two and the bad weather id say the odds were against its working i grunted and tossed him my leather duster and my staff he caught them and frowned you sure you dont want these just dont lose them i said if the gruffs saw a double of me who wasnt wearing the coat theyd know something was up in a heartbeat the idea is to keep them from getting suspicious in the first place the charm should be good for another six maybe seven hours once it drops get back here yeah yeah thomas said sliding into my duster the illusion magic didnt make the thing fit him and he had to fiddle with the sleeves but it looked like it always did on me karrin dont let him do anything stupid murphy nodded ill try but you know how he is she picked up her coat and shrugged into it where are we going back to gard i said the carpenter place im betting marcone left her a sample of his hair to use to track him down for just such an occasion as this but you said you couldnt get through the uhthe obscuring magic that the nickelheads have probably not but if i know marcone he also collected samples of hair or blood from his people to find them if they ever needed help or murphy grimaced if they rated early retirement im hoping gard can give us an inside track on finding the leak too i said meanwhile molly hurried over to thomas with her makeup kit and began modifying his face thomass face was about level with the chin of the illusionme if not a little lower but id taught molly the basics behind my illusion magicsuch as it was my skill with illusions was pretty basic and it wouldnt stand up to any serious examination molly was able to scrunch up her eyes and see past it of course you didnt have to make the illusion utterly convincing if you could manage to keep people from having a good reason to take a hard look at it in the first place the illusion doesnt have to be fancyits the misdirection behind it that really matters molly had been caught in a goth undertow of the youth culture and it showed in her makeup she had plenty of blues and purples and reds to darken thomass eyes with and the illusion of my face assumed an appearance fairly close to my own sans the swollen nose itll do i said murph youre driving molly if you dont mind my apprentice grinned as she hurriedly pulled on her coat then she stuck her tongue between her teeth frowned fiercely and waved her hand at me with a murmur i felt the kids veil congeal about me like a thin layer of jello a wobbly and slippery sensation the world went a little bit blurry as if i were suddenly looking at everything through hazy green water but murphys face turned up into a grin thats very good she said i cant see him at all mollys face was set with concentration as she maintained the spell but she glanced at murphy and nodded her head in acknowledgment right i said come on mouse my dog hopped to his feet and trotted over eagerly waving his tail murphy looked in my general direction and arched an eyebrow if the gruffs dont buy it i want all the early warning i can get i told her she lowered her voice and murmured and maybe youre a little nervous about going out without the coat and the staff maybe i said it was only a half lie insulting nickname or not coat and staff or not the more i thought about what we were up against the more worried i became i wasnt nervous i was pretty much terrified chapter nineteen i t was dark by the time we got to chez carpenter and we were beginning to slow down to turn into the driveway when murphy said someones tailing us keep driving i snapped at once from where i was crouched down in the back of murphys saturn i felt like a groundhog trying to hide in a golf divot go past the house murphy picked up speed again accelerating very slowly and carefully on the snowbound streets i poked my head up just enough to peer into the night behind us mouse sat up with me and looked solemnly and carefully out the back window when i did the car with one headlight pointing a little to the left i asked thats the one spotted him about ten minutes ago can you see his plates i squinted not through this snow and with his lights in my eyes molly turned and knelt in the passenger seat peering through the back window who do you think it is molly sit down murphy snapped we dont want them to know that weve seen the headlights of the car behind us grew brighter and began to sweep closer murph they saw her here they come im sorry molly said im sorry get your seat belts on murphy barked murphy began accelerating but our pursuer closed the distance within a few seconds the headlights grew brighter and i could hear the roar of a big old throaty engine i scrambled up to the backseat and clawed at the seat belt but mouse was sitting on the other side of the buckle and before i could get it out from under him murphy screamed hang on collisions are always louder than i expect and this one was no exception the pursuing car smashed into the rear of the saturn at maybe forty miles an hour metal screamed fiberglass shattered i got slammed back against my seat and then whiplashed into the back of the drivers seat mouse bounced around too molly screamed murph swore and wrenched at the steering wheel it could have been worse murphy had gained enough speed to mitigate the impact but the saturn went into a spin on the snowy streets and revolved in a graceful slowmotion ballet slamming my nose into the back of murphys seat didnt feel very good in fact it felt so notgood that i lost track of what was going on for a few seconds i was vaguely aware of the car spinning and then crunching broadside into an enormous mound of snow the saturns engine coughed and died my pounding heart sent thunder to my ears and agony to my nose i barely heard the sound of a car door opening and closing somewhere nearby i heard murphy twist around in her chair and gasp gun she drew her weapon unfastened her seat belt and tried her door it was pressed into a solid wall of white she snarled and crawled across a stunned mollys lap fumbling at the door i lurched to the other side of the car and clawed at the door until it opened when it did i saw a slightly smashedup car in the middle of the street idling with both doors open two men stalked toward us through the snow one was holding what looked like a shotgun and his partner had an automatic in either hand murphy threw herself out of the car and darted to one side it wasnt hard to figure out whyif shed started shooting immediately molly would have been in the line of any return fire murphy moved swiftly crouched as close to the ground as she could get but to do so cost her a precious second the shotgun roared and spat fire the blast smashed murphy to the ground like a blow from a sledgehammer at the sight my scrambled brain congealed i drew up my will flung out a hand and screamed ventas servitas wind roared forth from my outstretched fingers i directed it at the snowcovered ground in front of our attackers and a sudden storm of flying bits of ice and snow engulfed the gunmen i kept the pressure on them maintaining the spell as i shouted molly get to murphy veil and first aid molly shook her head and gave me a glassyeyed stare but she climbed out of the car and staggered over to murphy a second later both of them vanished from sight i let up on the wind spell moving enough air to keep a galeforce wind going is a lot more work than anyone thinks the air went still again except for swirling eddies of wind frost devils that danced about in half a dozen whirling helices of snow the two gunmen were revealed crouching low their arms still upraised to shield their eyes from the wind and stinging flakes of ice i missed my staff i missed my duster but i wasnt missing the revolver i drew from my coats pocket and aimed at the bad guys while i raised my left hand shaking the shield bracelet there out from under the sleeve of my coat i recognized one of the two gunmen the one with the brace of pistols his name was bart something or other and he was muscle for hirecheap muscle at that but at least you got what you paid for bart was the kind of guy you called when you needed someones ribs broken on a budget the other guy was familiar too but i couldnt put a name to him come on it wasnt like i hung around in outfit bars getting to know everyone besides all i really needed to know was that hed shot murphy i started walking forward straight at them and stopped when i was maybe fifteen feet away by the time i got there they were finally getting the ice and snow out of their eyes i didnt wait for them to get their vision back i aimed carefully and put a bullet through shotgun boys right knee he went down screaming and kept screaming bart turned toward me and raised both guns but my shield bracelet was ready i made an effort of will and a hemisphere of shimmering translucent silver force flickered to life between bart and me he emptied both automatics at me but he might as well have been shooting water pistols my shield caught every shot and i angled it to deflect the rounds up into the air rather than into one of the houses in the neighborhood around us barts guns clicked empty i lowered the shield and lifted my revolver as he fumbled at his pockets for fresh magazines bart i chided him think this one through he froze in place and then slowly moved his hands away from his pockets thank you guess what i want you to do next he dropped his guns bart was in his late thirties and goodlooking tall with the frame of a man who spent a lot of his time at the gym he had little weasel eyes though dark and gleaming they darted left and right as if seeking possible avenues of escape dont make me shoot you in the back bart i said bullet could hit your spine paralyze you without killing you that would be awful i moseyed over to him keeping the gun trained on him and making sure i always had a clear view of the other gunman he was still screaming though it had a hoarse thready sound to it now do you know who i am dresden jesus bart said nothing personal man you tried to kill me bart thats just about as personal as it gets it was a job he said just a job and i suddenly remembered where id seen the other guy before unconscious in the hallway outside demeters office at executive priority he was one of torellis flunkies and he did not appear to have much more savvy than his boss jobs gonna get you killed one day bart i said maybe even right now i called out molly how is she murphys voice came back to me instead of mollys im fine she said the words were clipped as if she were in pain vest stopped all but one of the balls and that one isnt bad her arm is bleeding harry molly said her voice shaking its stopping but i dont think theres anything else i can do murph get back to the car stay warm like hell harry i will i completed the sentence for her go into shock dont be stupid murph i cant lug your unconscious body around and keep these guys under control murphy growled something vaguely threatening under her breath but i heard molly say here let me help you barts beady eyes were all but bugging out of his head as he searched for the source of the sound of mollys voice what what the hell by now i was sure people in the houses around us had called the police i was sure that the cops would be a few moments longer than usual arriving too i wanted to be gone by then which meant that i didnt have much time but bart didnt have to know that just like bart didnt have a clue what hed gotten himself involved in i most likely didnt have time to grill even one of the gunmen torellis goon was hurt and probably mad as hell at me he was probably more loyal to torelli too if he was a personal retainer that really left me only one smart option for gathering information i stepped forward shifting my gun to my left hand and held out my right i spoke a quiet word and a sphere of fire bright as a tiny sun kindled to life in the air above my right hand i turned a slow stare on bart and stepped close to him the thug flinched and fell onto his ass in the snowy street i released the sphere of fire and it drifted closer to bart look big guy i said in an amiable tone ive had a tense couple of days and ive got to tell you burning someones face off sounds like a great way to relax i was just a hire bart stammered scooting back on his buttocks from the little sphere of fire just a driver hired to do what i asked him i was just supposed to put you off the road and cover the shooter bart half screamed he pointed a finger at the wounded man him i spread my fingers a little wider and the flaming sphere jumped a few inches closer to the goons face bart bart lets not change the focus here this is about you and me im just a contractor bart all but screamed writhing to get his face farther away from the fire they dont tell guys like me shit guys like you always know more than youre told i said so youve got something you can give the cops to keep yourself out of jail i dont bart said i swear i smiled at him and pushed the fire sphere a little closer inhale blue i said exhale pink hey this is relaxing torelli bart screamed throwing up his arms jesus it was torelli torelli wanted the job done hes been getting ready to move on marcone since when i demanded i dont know couple of weeks maybe thats when they brought me in oh jesus i closed my hand and snuffed out the sphere of fire before it could do more than scorch the sleeves of barts coat he lay there on the ground breathing roughly and refused to lower his arms the sound of sirens ghosted through the streets it was time to go he been talking to anyone lately i demanded anyone new setting up an alliance bart shook his head shuddering i aint one of his fulltimers i aint seen nothing like that harry molly screamed id gotten too intent on the conversation with bart and id been too worried about murphy to remember to take everybodys guns away the gunman on the ground had recovered his shotgun and worked the action ejecting a spent shell and loading a new round i spun toward him raising my shield bracelet the problem was that my spiffy redesigned bracelet while better in a lot of ways than the old one took a lot more power to use and as a result i could bring it up only so fast i threw myself to the ground and tried to put bart between me and torellis hitter bart scrambled frantically to clear the line of fire and i knew that i wasnt going to get the shield up in time mouse must have darted off to the side at the beginning of the confrontation because he appeared out of the shadows and came bounding through nearly three feet of snow as if hed been running on racetrack turf he was moving so fast that a bow wave of flying snow literally preceded him like when a speedboat cuts through the water he hit torellis hitter just as the man pulled the trigger shotguns are loud bart screamed an impolite word mouse seized torellis man by his wounded leg the one id shot a minute ago and began wrenching him around by it shaking him as easily as a terrier shakes a rat the goon had another earpiercing scream left in him a highpitched thing that sounded like it had come from a slaughterhouse hog the shotgun flew from his fingers and he began flopping like a rag doll unconscious from the pain the sirens grew louder and i pushed myself back to my feet bart lay on the ground rocking back and forth and screaming the wild shotgun blast had hit him right in the ass there was a lot of blood on his jeans but he didnt seem to be gushing anything from a major artery granted depending on how much of the shot hed caught the wound could potentially maim cripple or maybe even kill him if there was any internal bleeding but there are worse places to get hit and with all the adrenaline surging through me it seemed pretty hilarious cackling i called to mouse and ran for the car molly already had murph buckled into the passenger seat i had to crawl across her to get to the drivers side she let out a blistering curse as i accidentally bumped her arm the drivers chair was practically touching the steering wheel and for a second i thought i was going to have to push down the pedals with one hand and drive with the other but i managed to find the lever that made the seat slide back and the car started on the first try dammit dresden murphy wheezed there were weapons involved we have to go back mouse sailed into the backseat through the open door and molly closed both doors on that side of the car i rocked the steering wheel and wiggled the saturn loose from the snow then started off down the street i still had an irrational smile plastered on my face my cheeks hurt not a chance murphy we cant just let them go i suppressed another round of adrenaline giggles they arent going anywhere and im persona non grata remember you want to get caught at the scene of a shooting with me mixed up in it but dammit murphy i said exasperated do you want me to go to jail if we go back now torellis goon tells them i shot him they take my gun and if they can find the bullet or if its still in his leg its assault with a deadly weapon not if you were defending yourself murphy grated in a fair world maybe i said as it is if theres no one but outfit goons there two guys with records and a known association both of them wounded the cops are going to assume that they quarreled and shot each other two bad guys go away you keep your job and i dont get pulled off of this casewhich is the same thing as getting killed i glanced aside at her who loses murphy didnt say anything for a moment then she said everyone loses harry the law is there to protect everyone its supposed to apply equally to everyone i sighed and paid attention to the road id drive for a few minutes to be sure we were in the clear and then circle back to michaels place thats wishful thinking murph and you know it pretty sure marcones lawyers love that attitude the law isnt perfect she replied quietly but that doesnt mean that we shouldnt try to make it work do me a favor i said what hold your nose shut put on a philadelphia accent and say i am the law murphy snorted and shook her head i glanced aside at her her face was pale with pain her eyes a little glassy her left arm was wrapped up in what looked like strips torn from mollys tshirt i checked the rearview my apprentice was indeed wearing nothing but a green lace bra under her winter coat she was crouched down with both arms around mouse her face buried in his snowfrosted fur hey back there i said anyone hurt mouse yawned but molly checked him over anyway no were both fine cool i said i looked over my shoulder for a second to give molly a smile nice veil back there fast as hell you did good grasshopper molly beamed at me did my face look like that when you did that little balloffire thing to me i prefer to think of it as a little ball of sunshine i said and you were stoic compared to that guy grasshopper you did a good job too furface i told mouse i owe you one mouse opened his mouth in a doggy grin and wagged his tail it thumped against molly scattering a little snow against bare skin she yelped and burst into a laugh murphy and i traded a look if the gunman had squeezed the trigger a hundredth of a second sooner or later murphy would be dead the blast could have taken her in the head or neck or torn into an artery without mouse id probably be dead too and if theyd gotten me and murphy i doubted theyd have left molly behind to testify against them that one had been closeno supernatural opposition necessary molly might not realize that yet but murphy and i did hows the arm murph i asked quietly just hit muscle she said closing her eyes it hurts like hell but it isnt going to kill me you want me to drive you to the emergency room murphy didnt answer right away there was a lot more to the question than the words in it doctors are required by law to report any gunshot wound to the authorities if murph went in for proper medical treatment theyd report it to the cops and since she was a cop it would mean that she had to answer all kinds of questions and it would probably mean that the truth of what happened behind us would come out it was the responsible lawabiding thing to do no harry she said finally and closed her eyes i exhaled slowly relieved that answer had cost her something my hands had started shaking on the wheel generally speaking im fine when theres a crisis in progress its afterward that it starts getting to my nerves sit tight i said well get you patched up just drive she said wearily so i drove chapter twenty t his is getting awfully murky harry michael said worry in his voice i dont like it snow crunched under our feet as we walked from the house to the workshop the daylight was fading as a second front hit the city darkening the skies with the promise of more snow i dont like it much either i replied but nobody came rushing up to present me with options i stopped in the snow hows murphy michael paused beside me charity is the one whos had actual medical training but it seemed a simple enough injury to me a bandage stopped the bleeding and we cleaned the wound thoroughly she should be careful to monitor her condition for the next few days but i think shell be all right how much pain is she in i asked charity keeps some codeine on hand it isnt as strong as the painkillers at a hospital but it should let her sleep at least i grimaced and nodded im going to hunt up the denarians michael he took a deep breath youre going to attack them i should i said a little more sharply than id meant to because there are people who dont deserve a second chance michael and if these losers dont qualify for the permanent shit list i dont know who does michael gave me a small smile everyone does harry a little shiver went through me but i didnt let it show on my face i just rolled my eyes right right original sin gods grace ive heard this part before i sighed but im not planning to assault them i just want to learn whatever i can about them before we square off michael nodded which is why were standing out in the snow talking i take it i need whatever information you can give me and i dont need another philosophical debate michael grunted i already got in touch with father forthill he sent over a report on who we think might be in town with tessa i spent a couple of seconds feeling like an argumentative jerk oh i said thank you thatthat could help a lot michael shrugged weve learned to be wary of even our own intelligence the fallen are masters of deception harry sometimes it takes us centuries to catch one of them lying i know i said but you must have something solid a little he said we are fairly certain that tessa and imariel are the secondeldest of the denarians only nicodemus and anduriel have been operating longer i grunted are tessa and nicodemus rivals generally michael replied though i suppose it bears mentioning that theyre also husband and wife match made in hell eh not that it seems to mean much to either of them they very rarely work together and when they do its never good the last time they did so according to the churchs records was just before the black plague came to europe plagues the nickelheads did that last time they were in town i shook my head youd expect a different tune or two in a husbandandwife act that had been running that long variety is the key to a happy marriage michael agreed solemnly his mouth quivered nickelheads i decided their name gave them too much dignity given what they are im correcting that those who underestimate them generally dont survive it michael said be careful you know me yes he said where were we plagues ah yes the nickelheads have used plagues to instigate the most havoc and confusion in the past i fought off a smile that threatened my hardass exterior as michael continued its proven a successful tactic on more than one occasion once a plague has gained momentum theres almost no limit to the lives they can claim and the suffering they can inflict i frowned and folded my arms sanya said that tessa preferred choosing eagersubjects i suppose over talented ones michael nodded the fallen who follow imariel go through bearers very quickly none of them are kind to those they bond with but imariels crew are the monsters among the monsters tessa chooses their hosts from among the downtrodden the desperate those who believe that they have nothing to lose those who will succumb to temptation the most rapidly i grunted lot of those around in the wake of a big nasty plague or any kind of similar chaos yes we believe that it is one reason she collaborates with nicodemus from time to time shes focused on shortterm i said getting it hes all about the long view exactly michael said when he threw lasciels coin at my son it was a calculated gesture calculated to rope me in i said you michael said or my son a chill that had nothing to do with the air went through me give the coin to a child a child who couldnt defend himself who could be raised with the voice of a fallen angel whispering in his ear shaping him preparing him to be used as a weapon against his own family imagine it i stared around the yard that had been the scene of so much merriment only a few hours before id rather not i said michael continued quietly in general the families of the bearers of the swords are sheltered against such evils but things like that have happened before and nicodemus has borne a coin for a score of centuries he has no difficulty with the notion of waiting ten or fifteen or twenty years to attain his goals thats why you think hes here i said because going after someone like marcone isnt tessas style it isnt michael said but i believe that if by helping it happen she could create the kind of environment she loves best full of chaos and despair it would be reason enough for her to join forces with her husband how many tessa keeps a group of five other fallen around her he gave me a quick smile sorry four now thank thomas i said not me i intend to michael said nicodemus michael shook his head i believe youve been told before that nicodemus makes it a point to destroy any records the church manages to build concerning him thats not going to be as easy to arrange in the future hail the information age i interjected but our accounts regarding him are sketchy we thought he had only three regular companionsbut then he produced lasciels coin which had supposedly been in secure storage in a chilean monastery i think it would be dangerous to assume anything at this point worstcase scenario i said how many other coins might he have with him michael shrugged six perhaps but its just a guess i stared at him youre saying that they could have a dozen walking nightmares with them this time he nodded last time they came to party all three swords were here there were four denarians and we barely came out of it alive i know but youre used to this right i asked him the knights take on odds like this all the time he gave me an apologetic glance we like to outnumber them two to one if possible three to one when we can arrange it but shiro said he had fought several duels against them i said oneonone shiro had a gift michael said it was as simple as that shiro knew swordplay like mozart knew music im not like him im not afraid of facing a single denarian alone but i would generally consider us evenly matched my fate would be in gods hands super i sighed faith harry michael said he will not abandon us there will be a way for good to overcome good overcame last time i said quietly more or less but that didnt stop them from killing shiro our lives belong to the almighty michael said evenly we serve and live for the sake of others not for our own yeah i said im sure that will comfort your kids when they have to grow up without a father michael abruptly turned to face me squarely and his right hand closed into a fist stop talking he said in a low hard tone right now so help me god i almost took a swing at him out of sheer frustration but sanity grabbed the scruff of my neck and turned me around i stalked several paces away through the snow and stood with my back to him sanity invited shame over for tea and biscuits dammit i was supposed to be a wizard connected with my inner light master of the disciplined mind all of that kind of crap but instead i was shooting my mouth off at a man who didnt deserve it because because i was scared really really scared i always started shooting my mouth off when something scared me it had been an asset before but it sure as hell wasnt right now when something scared me i almost always embraced my anger as a weapon against it that too was usually an asset but this time id let that fear and anger shape my thinking and as a result id torn into my friend in the most tender spot he had at a time when he could probably have used my support then i realized why i was angry at michael i had wanted him to come flying in like superman and solve my problems and hed let me down were always disappointed when we find out someone else has human limits the same as we do its stupid for us to feel that way and we really ought to know better but that doesnt seem to slow us down i wondered if michael had ever felt the same way about me my last remark i muttered was out of line yes michael said it was you want to duke it out or arm wrestle or something there are better ways for us to spend our time nicodemus and tessa should be our focus i turned back to him agreed this isnt over he said a harsh edge in his voice well discuss it after i grunted and nodded some of the tension left the air between us back to business that was easier you know what i dont get i said how do you step from nicodemuss end of recruiting marcone all the way to tessas end of a society steeped in chaos and despair i dont know michael said he moved his hand to the hilt of the sword he now wore belted to his side an unconscious gesture but nicodemus thinks he does and whatever hes doing ive got a bad feeling that wed better figure it out before he gets it done chapter twentyone i f i knew of any trusted lieutenants preparing to betray my employer miss gard said with exaggerated patience they wouldnt be trusted now would they if you ask politely im sure you can get someone to read the definition of treachery to you dresden michael smiled quietly he sat at the workbench with one of his heavy daggers and a metal file evidently taking some burrs out of the blade hendricks sat on a stool at the other end of the workbench the huge enforcer had disassembled a handgun and was cleaning the pieces fastidiously okay then i said to gard why dont we start with everyone who knew the location of marcones panic room gard narrowed her eyes studying me she looked better granted its difficult to look much worse than disemboweled but even so shed been reduced from ten miles of bad road to maybe two or three she was sitting up in her cot her back resting against the wall of the workshop and though she looked pale and incredibly tired her blue eyes were clear and sharp i dont think so she said quietly theres not going to be much need to keep marcones secrets once hes dead or under the control of one of the fallen i cant she said oh come on i said throwing up my hands hells bells im not asking you for the launch codes to nuclear missiles she took a deep breath and enunciated each word i cant from the workbench hendricks rumbled sokay tell him gard frowned at his broad back but nodded once and turned to me comparatively few people in the organization were directly aware of the panic room but im not sure thats our biggest concern the change in gears from stonewall to narration made me blink a little even michael glanced up frowning at gard no i asked if thats not our biggest concern what is the number of people who could have pieced it together from disparate facts gard replied contractors had to be paid materials had to be purchased architects had to be hired any of a dozen different things could have indicated that marcone was building something and piqued someones curiosity enough to dig deeper i grunted at which point he could probably find out a lot by talking to the architects or builders exactly in this instance he was unusually lax in his standard caution when it came to matters of security i urged him to take conventional measures but he refused conventional measures i said youre talking about killing everyone who worked on it secret passages and secret sanctums are quite useless if they arent secret gard replied maybe he didnt feel like killing a bunch of his employees to cover his own ass gard shrugged im not here to make moral judgments dresden im an adviser that was my advice i grunted so who would know the builders people handling books and paychecks and anyone they talked to gard said that makes the suspect pool a little larger than is useful i said indeed it does stop i said occam time gard gave me a blank stare maybe shed never heard of mc hammer occam she asked occams razor i said the simplest explanation is most often correct her lips quivered how charming if we define a circle of suspects that includes everyone who might possibly have heard anything we get nowhere if we limit the pool to the most likely choices we have something we can work with and were much more likely to find the traitor we gard asked whatever i said who would have had a lot of access lets leave the contractors out of it they generally arent out for blood and marcone owns half the developers in town anyway gard nodded her head in acceptance very well one of three or four accountants any of the inner circle and one of two or three troubleshooters troubleshooters michael asked when theres trouble i told him they shoot it gard let out a quick snort of laughterthen winced clutching at her stomach with both hands easy there i said you all right eventually gard murmured please continue what about torelli i asked what about him could he be our guy gard rolled her eyes please the man has the intellect of a lobotomized turtle marcones been aware of his ambition for some time now if hes been aware of it i asked how come torelli is still paying taxes because we were using him to draw any other wouldbe usurpers into the open where they could be dealt with hungh i said frowning could he have put pressure on any of the people in the know the bookkeepers perhaps but i think it highly unlikely marcone has made it clear that they enjoy his most enthusiastic protection yeah but yurtle the lobotomized isnt all that bright gard blinked excuse me my god woman i protested youve never read dr seuss she frowned who is dr i held up a hand never mind forget it torelli isnt all that bright maybe he figured he could strongarm a bookkeeper and knock off marcone before marcone got a chance to demonstrate his enthusiasm gard pursed her lips torelli has stupidity enough and to spare but hes also a sniveling cowardly little splatter of rat dung she narrowed her eyes why are you so focused on him oh i said i cant put my finger on any one thing but my finely tuned instincts tell me that hes hostile gard smiled tried to kill you did he he started trying to put the muscle on demeter while i was there this morning i objected ah she said i had wondered how you found us torellis goons tried shooting me up right before i came here i see gard said narrowing her eyes in thought the timing of his uprising is rather too precise to be mere coincidence im glad im not the only one who thought of that she tapped a finger against her chin torelli is no genius but he is competent at his job he wouldnt be operating that high in the organization if he werent i suppose its possible that torelli might have secured the information if he applied enough mean cunning to the task she glanced up at me you think the denarians recruited him to be their man on the inside i think they had to get their information about marcones panic room somewhere i said worked that out did you gard said with a wan smile yeah turned your own hideyhole into a fox trap thats gotta sting the old ego miss security consultant you wouldnt believe how much gard said a flinty light in her eyes but ill deal with that when its time you arent dealing with anything but more sleep for a little while i noted her face twisted into a scowl yes so let me do the heavy lifting i said how so i glanced around the workshop could we speak privately for a moment hendricks who had been reassembling his gun turned his overdeveloped brow ridges toward me scowling in suspicion michael glanced up his face a mask gard looked at me for a while then she said its all right with me hendricks finished putting the pistol back together loaded it and then loaded a round into the chamber he made it a point to stare straight at me the entire while then he stood up tugged on his coat and walked straight toward me hendricks wasnt as tall as me which cut down on the intimidation factor on the other hand he had muscle enough to break me in half and we both knew it he stopped a foot away put the gun in his pocket and said be right outside michael i said please he rose sheathing the dagger and followed hendricks out into the snow the two kept a careful even distance between them as they went like dogs who arent yet sure whether theyre going to fight or not i closed the door behind them and turned to gard give me what i need to find and question torelli she shook her head i can get you his address and the locations of the properties he owns places he frequents known associates but he wont be at any of those places hes been in the business too long to make a mistake like that oh please i said rolling my eyes youve got blood or hair samples for all of your people somewhere get me torellis gard stared at me with her poker face for that matter i added get me marcones if i can get close enough it might help me find him my employer keeps them under intense security hes the only one who can access them i snorted so get me samples from the second collection second collection you know the one youre keeping the one marcone doesnt know about gard brushed a stray lock of gold from her cheek what makes you think i have any such samples i showed her my teeth youre a mercenary gard mercenaries have to be more cautious with their own employers than they do with the enemy theyve been hired to fight they take out insurance policies even if marcone didnt have samples collected im betting you did her eyes drifted over to the door for a moment and then back to me lets pretend for a moment that i have such a collection she said why on earth would i hand it over to you youre antagonistic to my employers business and could inflict catastrophic damage on it with such a thing in your possession gosh youre squeamish considering the catastrophic damage his business inflicts on thousands of people every day of the year im merely protecting my employers interests she showed me her teeth almost as though im a mercenary i sighed and folded my arms what if i only took torellis and marcones samples then you would still be capable of using that against marcone in the future if i want to hurt marcone i said all i need to do is sit down with a sixpack of beer and a bag of pretzels and let him twist in the wind perhaps gard admitted swear to me that you will use none of the samples but torellis and marcones that you will use neither of them for harm of any kind and that you will return both to me immediately upon my request swear it by your power oaths in general carry a lot of currency among the preternatural crowd theyre binding in more senses than the theoretical every time you break a promise theres a kind of backlash of spiritual energies a broken promise can inflict horrible pain on supernatural entities such as the sidhe when a wizard breaks a promise particularly when sworn by his own power the backlash is different a diminishing of that magical talent it isnt a crippling effect by any meansbut break enough promises and sooner or later youd have nothing left as dangerous as the world had been for wizards over the past few years any of us would have been insane to take the chance that our talents and thus our ability to defend ourselves might be hampered even if that reduction was relatively slight i squared my shoulders and nodded i swear by my own power that i will abide by those restrictions gard narrowed her eyes as i spoke and when i finished she gave me a single nod she reached into her pocket moving very gingerly and withdrew a single silver key she held it out to me union station locker two fourteen everything is labeled i reached out to take the key but gards fingers tightened on it for a second dont let anything you care about stand directly in front of it when you open it i arched an eyebrow at her as she released the key all right thank you she gave me a quick tight smile stop wasting time here go i frowned youre that worried about your boss not at all gard said closing her eyes and sagging wearily down on the cot i just dont want to be in the vicinity the next time someone comes to kill you chapter twentytwo m urphys car looked like it might have been through a war zone and there were oddcolored stains in the snow underneath it as a result wed taken michaels truck i rode in the cab with michael while mouse rode in the back yeah i know not safe but the reality of the situation is that you dont fit two people our size and a dog mouses size into the cab of a pickup there wouldnt be any room left for oxygen mouse didnt seem to be the least bit distressed by the cold as we sallied forth to union station he actually walked to the side of the truck and stuck his head out into the wind tongue lolling happily not that there was a lot of wind to be hadmichael drove patiently and carefully in the bad weather after the third or fourth time we passed a car that had slid up onto a sidewalk or into a ditch i stopped tapping my foot and mentally urging him to hurry it would take a hell of a lot longer to walk to union station than it would to drive with what was obviously appropriate caution we didnt talk on the way dont get me wrong it isnt like michael is a chatterbox or anything its just that he usually has something to say he invites me to go to church with him which i dont unless something is chasing us or has some kind of proudpapa talk regarding something one of his kids has done well talk about mollys progress or weather or sports or something not this time maybe he wanted to focus his whole attention on the road i told myself yeah that was probably it it couldnt have anything to do with me opening my big fat mouth too much obviously a mound of plowed snow had collapsed at the entrance of the parking garage but michael just built up a little speed and rumbled over and through it though it was mostly the momentum that got him inside the parking garages lights were out and with all that piled snow around the first level very little of the ambient snowlight got inside parking garages are kind of intimidating places even when you can see them theyre even more intimidating when theyre entirely black except for the nonetooexpansive areas lit by the glare of headlights well i said at least theres plenty of available spaces michael grunted who wants to travel in weather like this he wheeled into the nearest open parking space and the truck jerked to a stop he got out fetched the heavy sports bag he used to carry amoracchius in public and slung the bag from his shoulder i got out and mouse hopped out of the back to the ground the truck creaked and rocked on its springs relieved of the big dogs weight i clipped mouses lead on him and then tied on the little apron thing that declared him a service dog its an outandout lie but it makes moving around in public with him a lot easier mouse gave the apron an approving glance and waited patiently until his disguise was in place service dog michael asked his expression uncomfortable he had a flashlight in his right hand and he shone it at us for a moment before sweeping it around us searching the shadows i have a rare condition i said scratching the big dog under the chin cantgetadateitis hes supposed to be some kind of catalyst or conversation starter or failing that a consolation prize anyway hes necessary mouse made a chuffing sound and his tail thumped against my leg michael sighed youre awfully persnickety about the law all of a sudden i said especially considering that youre toting a concealed weapon please harry im uncomfortable enough i wont tell anyone about your sword if you wont tell anyone about my gun michael sighed and started walking mouse and i followed the parking garage proved to be very cold very dark very creepy and empty of any threat we crossed the halfburied street mouse leading the way through the snow snows coming down thicker again now that the suns down michael noted mabs doing maybe i said if it is titania would be less able to oppose her power after the sun went down which is also when titanias agents would be able to move most freely through town but you arent certain its mabs doing michael asked nope could just be chicago which can be just as scary as mab some days michael chuckled and we went into union station it doesnt look like that scene in the untouchables if you were wondering that was shot in this big room they rent out for welltodo gatherings the rest of the place doesnt look like something that fits into the roaring twenties its all modernized and looks more or less like an airport sorta depressing really i mean of all the possible aesthetic choices out there airports must generally rank in the top five or ten most bland but i guess theyre costeffective that counts for more and more when it comes to beauty sure all the marble and corinthian columns and soaring spaces were beautiful but where do they fall on a costassessment worksheet the ghost of style still haunts the bits of the original union station that have been permitted to stand but looking around the place i couldnt help but get the same feeling i had when i looked at the coliseum in rome or the parthenon in athensthat once it had been a place of splendor once but a long long time ago which way are the lockers michael asked quietly i nodded toward the northeast end of the building and started walking the ticketing counters were closed except for one whose clerk was probably in a back room somewhere there werent a lot of people walking around late at night train stations in general dont seem to explode with activity particularly not in weather like ours one harried customerservice representative from amtrak was dealing with a small knot of angrylooking travelers who had probably just been stranded in town by the storm she was trying to get them a hotel good luck the airport had been closed since yesterday and the hotels would be doing a brisk business already you know your way around the station michael commented trains are faster than buses and safer than planes i said i took a plane to portland once and the pilot lost his radio and computer and so on had to land without instruments or communications we were lucky it was a clear day statistically its still the safest he began not for wizards it isnt i told him seriously ive had flights that went smoothly a couple of them just had little problems but after that trip to portland i shook my head there were kids on that plane im going to live a long time i can take a little longer to get there hey joe i said to a silverhaired janitor walking by with a wheeled cart of cleaning supplies harry joe said nodding with a small smile as he passed by ive been here a lot lately i said to michael traveling to support the paranet mostly plus warden stuff i rolled my eyes i didnt want the job but ill be damned if ill do it halfassed michael looked back at the janitor thoughtfully for a moment and then at me whats that like wardening i asked i shrugged ive got four other wardens who are i guess under my command i made air quotes around the word in atlanta dallas new york and boston but i mostly just stay out of their way and let them do their jobs give them help when they need it theyre kids grew up hard in the war though that didnt give them brains enough to keep from looking up to me mouse suddenly stopped in his tracks me too i didnt rubberneck around instead i focused on the dog mouses ears twitched like individual radar dishes his nose quivered one paw came up off the ground but the dog only looked around him uncertainly lassie would have smelled something i told him she would have given a clear concise warning one bark for gruffs two barks for nickelheads mouse gave me a reproachful glance put his paw back down and sneezed hes right michael said quietly something is watching us when isnt it i muttered glancing around i didnt see anything my highly tuned investigative instincts didnt see anything either i hate feeling like han solo in a world of jedi im supposed to be the jedi i muttered aloud whats that michael asked the stations lights went out all of them at exactly the same time the emergency lights which are supposed to come on instantly didnt beside me michaels coat rustled and something clicked several times presumably he was trying his flashlight and presumably it didnt work that wasnt good magic could interfere with the function of technology but that was more of a murphy effect things that naturally could go wrong tended to go wrong a lot more often it didnt behave in a predictable or uniform fashion it didnt shut down lights emergency lights and batterypowered flashlights all at the same time i didnt know what could do that harry michael asked mouse pressed up against my leg and i felt his warning growl vibrating through his chest you said it chewie i told my dog ive got a bad feeling about this chapter twentythree p eople started screaming i reached for the amulet around my neck and drew it forth as i directed an effort of will at it to call forth light in the darkness and nothing happened id have stared at my amulet if i could have seen it i couldnt believe that it wasnt working i shook the necklace cursed at it and raised it again forcing more of my will into the amulet it flickered with bluewhite sparks for a moment and that was it mouse let out a louder snarl the one i hear only when hes identified a real threat something close my heart jumped up hard enough to bounce off the roof of my mouth i cant call a light i said my voice high and thin a zipper let out a highpitched whine in the dark next to me and steel rasped against steel then rang like a gently struck bell father michaels voice murmured gently we need your help white light exploded from the sword about a dozen things crouching within three or four yards of us started screaming id never seen anything like them before they were maybe five feet tall but squat and thick with rubberylooking muscle they were built more or less along the lines of baboons somewhere between pure quadruped and biped with wickedlooking claws long ropy tails and massive shoulders some of them carried crudelooking weapons cudgels stoneheaded axes and stonebladed knives their heads were apelike and nearly skeletal black skin stretched tight over muscle and bone they had ugly almost sharklike teeth so oversized that you could see where they were cutting their own lips and and they didnt have any eyes where their eyes should have been there was nothing but blank sunken skin they screamed in agony as the light from michaels sword fell on them reeling back as if burned by a sudden flameand if the sudden smoldering reek that filled the air was any indicator they had been harry michael cried i knew that tone of voice i crouched as quickly as i could as low as i could and barely got out of the way before amoracchius swept through the space where my head had been and slammed into the leaping form of one of the creatures that had been about to land on my back the thing fell back away from me and landed on the floor thrashing its blood erupted into bluewhite fire as it spurted from the wound i snapped my head around to stare at amoracchius more blood sizzled on the blade of the sword like grease on a hot skillet iron these things were faeries id never seen them facetoface before but id read descriptions of themincluding when i had been boning up on my book learning to figure out the identity of the gruffs given that this beastie was a faerie there was only one thing it could be hobs i screamed at michael as i drew the gun from my coat pocket theyre hobs after that i didnt have time to talk a couple of the hobs around us had recovered enough from the shock of sudden exposure to light to fling themselves forward mouse let out his deepchested battle roar and collided with one of them in midair they went down in a tangle of thrashing limbs and flashing teeth the next hob leapt over them at me stone knife in its knobby hand i slipped aside from the line of his jump and pistolwhipped him with the barrel of the heavy revolver the steel smashed into the hobs eyeless face scorching flesh and shattering teeth the hob screamed in pain as it flew by crashing into one of its fellows in nomine dei michael bellowed i felt his shoulder blades hit mine and the light from the great sword bobbed and flashed followed by another scream from a hobs throat the hob wrestling with mouse slammed the huge dog to the floor and rose up above him baring its fangs i took a step toward it jammed the revolver into its face screamed get off my dog and started pulling the trigger i wasnt sure what hurt the hob morethe bullets or the muted flashes of light from the discharge either way it recoiled so hard that it flung itself completely off of mouse who came to his feet still full of fight i grabbed him by the collar and hauled him back with me until i felt michael at my back again the hobs withdrew to the shadows but i could still hear them all around us as bright as michaels sword was i should have been able to see the ceiling far overhead but it spread out for only twenty feet or sofar enough to keep the hobs from leaping onto us in a single bound but not much more than that i could hear screams still drifting through the interior of the station i heard a gun go off something smaller than my the rapid shots of panic fire whoever was packing was presumably shooting blindly into the dark hells bells this was going to turn into a real mess if i didnt do something and fast weve got to get out of the open i said thinking out loud michael head for the ticketing counter cant you clear the way michael asked i can cover you i cant see in this crap i said and there are other people in here if i start tossing power around i could kill somebody then stay close michael said he moved out at a stalk sword held high over his head ready to sweep down on top of anything stupid enough to come leaping at him we went over two dead hobs both of them covered in blue flames that gave off barely any light but consumed the bodies with voracious rapidity i heard a scuffle of claws on the floor and shouted a wordless cry michael pivoted smoothly as a hob armed with a pair of stone axes rushed into the light of the holy sword the dark faerie flung one of the axes at michael on the way my friend slapped it aside with a contemptuous flick of his sword and met the hob with a horizontal slash that shattered its second ax and split open its torso all the way back to its crooked spine the hob dropped spewing flame and michael kicked its falling body back into its companions scattering them for a moment and gaining us another twenty feet nice i said keeping close trying to watch the bobbing shadows all around us you been working out you look good michaels teeth flashed in a quick smile wouldnt speaking give these creatures a fine means of tar he broke off as amoracchius flicked in front of my face deflecting a tumbling stone knife targeting us he continued me and my big mouth i shut up the rest of the way to the ticketing counter i led michael around behind it and all but tripped over the form of a wounded man in a business suit he let out a choked scream of pain and clutched at the bloodied cloth over his lower leg there was the broken shard of a stone blade still protruding from the mans leg harry michael said keep moving theyre gathering for a rush okay i said i knelt down by the wounded businessman and said come on buddy this is no place to be sitting around i grabbed him underneath the arms and started backpedaling down the counter theres a doorway back here somewhere goes to the rear area perfect michael said i can hold that for as long as you need the wounded man struggled to help me but mostly all he did was make it harder to move him he was making continuous sounds of terror and pain i was glad that we had the barrier of the counter between us and the encroaching hobs i didnt particularly care to find out what getting hit with a sharp stone ax felt like we reached the door behind the ticketing counter which was closed i jiggled the handle but it was apparently locked i didnt have time for this crap i lifted my right hand and focused on one of the energy rings i wore there was one of them on each finger a band made of three rings woven into a braid the rings stored energy saving back a little every time i moved my arm and allowing me to unleash that stored energy all in one spot i brought my will to bear on the door as i lifted my hand in a closed fist focusing the energy of the rings into as small an area as i could i hadnt designed them for this kind of work theyd been made to shove things roughly away from me before they could rip my face off but i didnt have a lot of time to waste putting together something neater so i aimed as best i could triggered the ring and watched it rip the doorknob the lock and the plate they were all mounted in right out of the door to send them tumbling into the room beyond unimpeded by any of those pesky metal security fittings the door swung inward come on i said to michael seizing the wounded man again mouse lead the way my dog padded through the doorway crouched low and with his teeth bared i practically walked on his tail as i came in behind him and michael was all but treading on the wounded mans bloodied leg as the light from amoracchius illuminated the room we entered it revealed the harried customerservice rep wed seen a few minutes before she knelt on the floor crucifix in hand her head bowed as she frantically recited a prayer as the light fell over her she blinked and looked up the white fire of the holy sword painted the tear streaks on her face silver as her mouth dropped open in an expression of shock and stunned joy she looked down at her crucifix and back up at him again michael took a quick glance around the room smiled at the woman and said of course hes there of course he listens he paused then admitted granted he doesnt always answer quite this quickly there were other people in the roomthe customers shed been trying to find a hotel room for when things had gone dark and scary she had somehow rounded them up and gotten them into the room that took a lot more moxie than most people had i also noted that she had been kneeling between the customers and the doorway i liked her already carol i said sharply enough to make her tug her gaze from michael who now stood in the doorway holy sword in hand carol i need you to give me a hand here she blinked and then nodded jerkily and rose she helped me drag the wounded man over to where the others were seated against the wall hhow did you know my name she stammered are yyou two angels i sighed and tapped a fingernail on the name tag she wore im sure as hell not i said i jerked my head at michael though hes about as close to one as youre ever likely to see dont be ridiculous harry michael said im just a he broke off and ducked something solid whizzed past him and slammed a hole the size of my head into the drywall above us bits of dust rained down and frightened people cried out michael slammed the door shut but without you know all those pesky metal security fittings it swung open again he slammed it closed and leaned one shoulder against it panting something struck the door with a heavy thump then there was silence i ripped open the wounded mans pant leg along the seam the knife had hit him in the calf and he was a bloody mess but it could have been worse leave it in i told carol and make sure he stays still thats close to some big veins and i dont want to open them trying to take it out stay close to him and keep him from trying to take it out okay iyes all right carol said she blinked her eyes at me several times i dont understand whats happening me either i responded i rose and went to stand beside michael those things are quite a bit stronger than i am he said in a low rumble that the people behind us couldnt hear if they rush this door i wont be able to hold it shut im not sure they will i said but youre here i dont think theyre after me i said if they were they wouldnt be going after everyone else too michael frowned at me but you said they were faeries they are i said but i dont think this was supposed to be a hit there are too many of them for that this is a fullblown assault michael grimaced then there are people in danger they need our help and theyre going to get it i said listen hobs cant stand light any kind of light it burns them and it can kill them thats why they called up this myrk before they came in myrk its matter from the nevernever think of it as a cellophane filter only instead of being around a light it is spread all through the air thats why we couldnt see the light from my amulet and why the muzzle flash of my gun was so muted and thats how were going to take them out we get rid of the myrk michael said nodding exactly i said i raked my fingers back through my hair and started fumbling through my pockets to see what i had on me not much i keep a small collection of handy wizarding gear in the voluminous pockets of my duster but the pockets of my winter coat contained nothing but a stick of chalk two ketchup packages from burger king and a furry lintcoated tic tac okay i said let me think a minute something slammed into the other side of the door and shoved michaels work boots a good eighteen inches across the floor a claw flashed through the opening at me i got out of the way but the sleeve of my coat didnt the hobs claws ripped three neat slits in the fabric michael lifted amoracchius in one hand and drove its blazing length through the sturdy door the hob screamed and pulled away michael slammed the door shut again and jerked the weapon clear dark blood sizzled on the holy blade i dont mean to rush you he said calmly but i dont think we have a minute chapter twentyfour d ammit i swore this is my only winter coat i closed my eyes for a second and tried to focus my mind to the task a myrk wasnt like other forms of faerie glamour those could create appearance and could simulate emotional states related to that appearance the myrk was a conjuration something physical tangible that actually did exist and would continue to do so as long as the hobs gave it enough juice metaphorically speaking wind might do it a big enough wind could push the myrk awaybut it would have to be an awful lot of wind the little gale id called up to handle torellis hitters would barely make a dent in it i could probably do something more violent and widespread but when it comes to moving matter around you dont get something for nothing there was no way id be able to maintain that kind of blast long enough to get the job done i might be able to cut the myrk off from the hobs if i could sever that connection it would prevent them from pouring constant energy into it and poof the myrk would resume its natural state as ectoplasm of course cutting them off wouldnt be a cakewalk i would need some means of creating a channel to each and every hob in order to be sure i got the job done i didnt have anything i could use as a focus and i had no idea how many of them were out there anyway an empowered circle could cut the power to the spell from the other side of the equation isolating the hobs from the flow of energy outside the circle but the circle would need to encompass the entire freaking building i doubted the hobs would be considerate enough to let me run outside and sprint around an entire chicago city block to fire up a circle besides i didnt have that much chalk running water can ground out a spell if theres enough of it but given that we were inside a building that wasnt in the cards so how the hell was i supposed to cut off this stupid spell given the pathetic resources i had it isnt like there are a whole lot of ways to rob a widespread working of its power my nose throbbed harder and i leaned my head back turning my face upward sometimes doing that seemed to reduce the pressure and ease the pain a little i stared up at the office ceiling which had been installed at a height of ten or eleven feet rather than leaving the place open to the cavernous reaches of the old station and beat my head against the proverbial wall the ceiling was one of those dropdown setups a metal framework supporting dreary yet costeffective rectangles of acoustic material interrupted every few yards by the ugly little cowboy spur of an automatic firefighting sprinkler my eyes widened ha i said and threw my arms up in the air haha ahhahahaha i am wizard hear me roar mouse gave me an oblique look and sidled a step farther away from me and well you should i bellowed pointing at the dog for i am a fearsome bringer of fire i held up my right hand and with a murmur called up the tiny sphere of flame the spell stuttered and coughed before it coalesced and even then the light was barely brighter than a candle harry michael asked in that tone of voice people use when they talk to crazy people what are you doing the drywall to one side of the door suddenly buckled as a hobs claws began ripping through it michael bobbed to one side temporarily leaving the door held his thumb up to the wall as if judging where the stud would be and then ran amoracchius at an angle through the drywall the sword came back hissing and spitting while another hob howled with pain without the myrk these things are in trouble i said carol be a dear and roll that chair over here carol her eyes very wide her face very pale did so she gave the chair a little push so that it came the last six feet on its own michaels shoulder hit the door as another hob tried to push in the creature wasnt stupid it didnt keep trying to force the door when amoracchius plunged through the wood as if it had been a ricepaper screen and michaels sword came back unstained whatever youre going to do sooner would be better than later two minutes i said i rolled the chair to the right spot and stood up on it i wobbled for a second then stabilized myself and quickly unscrewed the sprinkler from its housing foulsmelling water rushed out in its wake which i had expected and mostly avoided granted i hadnt expected it to smell quite so overwhelmingly stagnant though i should have many sprinkler systems have closed holding tanks and god only knew how many years that water had been in there waiting to be used i hopped down out of the chair and moved out from under the falling water i pulled one of the pieces of chalk out of my pocket knelt and began to draw a large circle all around me on the lownap carpet it didnt have to be a perfect circle as long as it was closed but ive drawn a lot of them and by now theyre usually pretty close eexcuse me carol said whwhat are you doing our charming visitors are known as hobs i told her drawing carefully infusing the chalk with some of my will as i did so light hurts them a hob burst through the already broken drywall this time getting its head and one shoulder through it howled and raked at michael who was still leaning on the door michaels hip got ripped by a claw but then amoracchius swept down and took the hobs head from its shoulders in reply dark blazing blood spattered the room and some of it nearly hit my circle hey i complained im working here sorry michael said without a trace of sarcasm a hob slammed into the door before he could return to it and drove him several paces back he recovered in time to duck under the swing of a heavy club then swept amoracchius across the creatures belly and followed it up with a heavy thrusting kick that shoved the wicked faerie out of the room and back into its fellows michael slammed the door shut again bbut its dark carol stammered staring at michael and me alternately theyve put something in the air called myrk think of it as a smoke screen the myrk is keeping the lights from hurting the hobs i said i finished the circle and felt it spring to life around me an intangible curtain of power that walled away outside magicincluding the myrk that had been caught inside the circle as it formed it congealed into a thin coating of slimy ectoplasm over everything in the circlewhich is to say me super i mumbled and swiped it out of my eyes as best i could sso carol said what are you doing exactly im going to take their smoke screen away i held the sprinkler head in my right hand and closed my eyes focusing on it on its texture its shape its composition i began pouring energy into the object imagining it as a glowing aura of bluewhite light with dozens of little tendrils sprouting from it once the energy was firmly wrapped around the sprinkler i transferred it to my left hand and extended my right again bbut we dont have any lights oh we have lights i said i held out my right hand and called forth my little ball of sunshine in the myrkfree interior of the circle it was as whitehot and as bright as usual but i could see that outside of the circle it didnt spread more than five or six feet through the myrk out there oh my god carol said actually all the regular lights are on tootheyre just being blocked the myrk isnt shutting down the electricity these computers are all on for examplebut the myrk is keeping you from seeing any of the indicator lights harry michael called you rush a miracle worker you get lousy miracles i called back in an annoyed tone the rest of the spell was going to be a little tricky hhow are you doing that carol breathed magic i growled hush i wore a leather glove over my left hand as usual which should offer my scarred skin a little protection all the same this wouldnt be much fun i murmured ignus infusiarus and thrust the end of the sprinkler into the flame floating over my right hand how does this help us carol demanded her voice shaking and frightened this place still has electricity i said maybe i was imagining the smell of burned leather as the heat from the flame poured into the metal sprinkler it still has computers it still has phones harry michael said swinging his head left and right staring up at the ceiling theyre climbing theyre going to come through the roof i began to feel the heat even in the nervedamaged fingers of my left hand it was going to have to be hot enough i drew up more of my will lifted the sprinkler and the flame and visualized what i wanted the tendrils of energy around it zipping out to every other sprinkler head in the whole building and it still has its sprinklers i broke the circle with my foot and energy lashed out from the sprinkler to every other object shaped like it in the surrounding area heat washed out of me in a wave headed in dozens of different directions and i poured all the energy i could into the little ball of sunshine which suddenly had several dozen sprinkler heads to absorb its energy instead of only one it took maybe ten seconds before the fire detector let out a howl and the sprinkler system chattered to life people let out surprised little shrieks and a steady emergency klaxon wound to life somewhere out in the station sparks flew up from several phones monitors and computers okay i said so the office doesnt have computers but the rest still applies michael looked up at me and showed me his teeth in a ferocious grin when i watched my little ball of sunshine intensely as the water came down for maybe half a minute nothing happened except that we got drenched it was actually kind of surprising how much water was coming downsurprising in a good way i mean i wanted lots of water somewhere around the sixtysecond mark i felt my spell begin to flicker its power eroded away by the constant downpour wait for it i said ready at two minutes my spell buckled the connection to the other sprinklers snapping the fire in my hand snuffing out michael i shouted now michael grunted and flung open the door before hed stepped through it there was a sudden flutter of faltering power in the air and the holy blade blazed with light brighter than the heart of the sun itself he plunged through the door and as the burning light of amoracchius emerged into the station at large dozens or hundreds of hob throats erupted into tortured cries the sound of the wicked faeries screams was so loud that i actually felt the pressure it put on my ears the way you can at a really loud concert but louder still was the voice of michael carpenter knight of the cross avenging angel incarnate bearer of the blade that had once belonged to a squire called wart lava quod est sordium michael bellowed his voice stentorian too enormous to come from a human throat in nomine dei sana quod est saucium after the sword had left the room i could see that all the office lights had come back as well as those outside mouse i screamed stay guard the wounded i hurried after michael and glanced back behind me mouse trotted forward and planted himself in the doorway between the hobs and the people in the office head high legs braced wide to fill the space outside the sprinklers were doing a credible impersonation of a really stinky monsoon i slipped in a puddle of water and burning hob blood a few feet outside the door the light from the sword was so bright so purely even painfully white that i had to shield my eyes with one arm i couldnt look directly at michael or even anywhere near him so i followed him by the pieces of hob he left in his wake several wicked faeries had been struck down by michaels sword they were the lucky ones many moredozens that i could seehad fallen too far away for michael to have reached them with the blade those were simply lumps of smoldering charcoal spewing columns of greasy smoke their meat flashcooked away from bone some of the soontobeformer hobs were still thrashing as they burned hells bells i dont call him the fist of god as a pet name folks i followed michael alert for any dimming of the swords light if any of the sprinklers in the building were a different model from the one id used to focus my spell it wouldnt have been able to heat them and trigger them if michael wound up plunging back into the myrk then the hobs afforded a measure of protection from the light would gang up on himand fast but as luck or maybe fate or maybe god but probably a cheap city contractor would have it it looked like theyd all been the same water came down everywhere washing away the myrk as if it had been a layer of mud replacing it with thousands upon thousands of fractured rainbows as the pure illumination of amoracchius shone through the artificial downpour for the hobs there was nowhere to hide i followed the trail of smitten fiends smiten fiends smited fiends smoted fiends dont look at me i never finished high school maybe learning the various conjugations of to smite had been in senioryear english it sure as hell hadnt been on my ged test i stopped and peered around as best i could through the blinding light and steady fall of water from the sprinklers trying to get an idea of where michael was headed i felt a sudden swift vibration that rose through the soles of my shoes and then a heavy thud accompanying a second such tremor i whirled to face the front of the building as glass and brick and stone exploded from the entry door behind it was a vague flicker of haze in the air but as whatever was behind the veil entered the glare of amoracchius and my impromptu thundershower the spell faltered and vanished twenty feet and four or five tons of big brother gruff erupted from the veil he wore armor made of some kind of translucent crystal and the sword in his hand was longer than my freaking car his mouth opened and i felt his battle roar rather than hearing it over the cacophony of combat a sound so deep and loud that it should have been made by a freaking whale oh yeah i muttered today just keeps getting better and better chapter twentyfive a nybody with an ounce of sense knows that fighting someone with a significant advantage in size weight and reach is difficult if your opponent has you by fifty pounds winning a fight against him is a dubious proposition at best if your opponent has you by eight thousand and fifty pounds youve left the realm of combat and enrolled yourself in roadkill or possibly in a tom and jerry cartoon my body was already in motion apparently having decided that waiting on my brain to work things through was counterproductive to survival it was thinking that the catandmouse analogy was a pretty good one while i was nimbler and could accelerate more swiftly than the huge gruff he could build up more speed on a straightaway physically speaking i had almost no chance of seriously harming him while even a love tap from him would probably collapse my rib cageanother similarity jerry wins on television but in real life tom would rarely end up with the short end of the stick i dont remember mister ever coming home nursing mouseinflicted wounds for that matter he hardly ever came home from one of his rambles hungry playing cat and mouse is generally only fun for the cat my body meanwhile had flung itself to one side forcing tiny to turn as he pursued me limiting his speed and buying me a precious second or threetime enough for me to sprint toward a section of floor marked off by a pair of yellow caution signs where joe the janitor had been waxing the floor i crossed the wet slick floor at a sprint and prayed that i wouldnt trip if i went down it would take only one stomp of one of those enormous hooves to slice me in half footgear like that isnt so hot for slippery terrain though as soon as i crossed to the other side of the waxed floor i juked left as sharply as i could changing direction tiny tried to compensate and his legs went out from under him that isnt a big deal by itself sometimes when you run something happens and you trip and you fall down you get a skinned knee or two maybe scuff up your hands and very rarely youll do something worse like sprain an ankle but thats at human mass increase the mass to tinys size and a fall becomes another animal entirely especially if theres a lot of velocity involved thats one reason why elephants dont ever actually runthey arent capable of it of lifting their weight from the ground in a full running stride if they fell at their size the damage could be extreme and evidently nature had selected out all those elephant wind sprinters that much weight moving at that much speed carries a tremendous amount of energyenough to easily snap bones to drive objects deep into flesh to scrape the ground hard enough to strip a body to the bone tiny must have weighed twice what an elephant does five tons of flesh and bone came down all along one side of his body and landed hardthen slid carrying so much momentum that tiny more resembled a freight train than any kind of living being he slid across the floor and slammed into the wall of a rental car kiosk shattering it to splintersand went right on through it hardly even slowing down tiny dug at the floor with the yellow nails of one huge hand but they didnt do anything but peel up curls of wax as he went sliding past me i slammed on the brakes and tried to judge where tiny looked like hed coast to a halt then i drew in my will it was difficult as hell in the falling water but i didnt need a lot of it when it comes to intentionally screwing up technology ive always had a gift i focused on the lights above the entire section of the station tiny slid into lifted my right hand and snarled hexus some of them actually exploded in showers of golden sparks some of them let out little puffs of smokebut every single one of them went out michael had advanced down the concourse far behind me and the light of amoracchius was now shielded by the stations interior walls when i took out the electric lights it created a genuine swath of heavy shadows the sudden island of darkness drew hobs like corpses draw flies burned terrified furious hobs whose tidbitfilled night on the town had suddenly turned into a nightmare they didnt have eyes but they found their way to the dark easily enough and i saw more than a dozen rush in one of them passing within a couple of feet of me without ever slowing down or taking note of my presence tiny started bellowing a second later his huge voice blending with the vengeful howls of angry hobs aint so big now i panted are you but as it turned out tiny was just as big a crushed hob flew out of the shadows and splattered the floor maybe twenty feet away i dont mean that he was just ragdoll limp he was crushed crushed like a beer can where tinys huge fist had simply seized the hob squeezed it hard enough to empty it of various internal liquids and then thrown it away light flashed in the shadows a long streak of sparks like flint drawn along a long long strip of steel and suddenly low blue flames surrounded the blade of tinys sword they were guttering barely able to stay alight beneath the falling water but they cast enough light to let me see what was happening the hobs had gone mad with hate it had been inevitable i suppose the minions of winter and those of summer do not play well with one another and the denizens of faerie do not behave like human beings their natures are far more primal more immutable they are what they are predators are swift to attack prey that has fallen and is vulnerable winter fae hate the champions of summer the hobs were both several of them threw themselves at tinys head while the others just started hacking with their crude weapons or biting with their sharklike teeth tinys armor served him well in that mess defending the most critical areas and as hobs went for his throat the gruff started throwing his head back and forth i thought it was panic for a second until he slammed one of his horns into a hob with such power that it broke the wicked faeries skull his sword slewed back and forth in two quick precise motions and half a dozen hobs fell dead and burning the others let out shrieks of terror and bounded away their hatred insufficient to the task of withstanding the fallen gruff tiny rolled to his knees and began to push himself up and though his expression was contorted with pain his inhuman eyes swept around until they spotted me oh crap i didnt wait for him to get up and kill me i ran of all the times to do without my jacket and staff for crying out loud what had i been thinking that i had summer so thoroughly outwitted that i wouldnt need them that life just hadnt been challenging enough until now stupid harry stupid stupid i swore that if i lived through this id make up dummy copies of my gear for when i needed thomas to play stalking horse the ground started shaking as tiny took up the chase behind me my options were limited to my right was the exterior wall of the building and i couldnt go outside into the deepening snow my imagination treated me to a dandy image of me floundering in hipdeep snow while tiny with his far greater height and mass cruised effortlessly up behind me and beercanned me ahead of me was an empty hallway leading to another wall and on my left were nothing but rows and rows ofstorage lockers i fumbled in my pocket again as i ran through the water sheeting the floor and started trying to get a look at the numbers on the lockers i spotted the one corresponding to gards key and i skidded to a halt on the watery floor i jammed the key in the lock frantically as tiny running with a limp but still running closed the last dozen yards between us i had to time it perfectly i raised my right hand aimed at the hoof on his wounded leg and waited for all of his weight to come forward onto it before triggering every energy ring on my right hand unleashing a rushing column of force that hit him with the power of a speeding car the gruff s hoof went out from under him again on the wet floor and he pitched forward with a roar of frustration he dropped his blade and reached for me with both hands as he fell i waited until the last second to jump back ripping open the door to gards locker as i went i could only describe what happened next as a bolt of lightning it wasnt lightningnot really real lightning did not have the raw savage intensity of thisthing and i realized with a startled flash of insight that this energy whatever it was was alive whitehot power tinged with flashes of scarlet streaked out of the locker like a hundred hyperkinetic serpents zigzagging with impossible speed that living lightning ripped into tiny cutting through his crystalline armor as if it had been made of soft wax it burned and slashed and pounded the flesh beneath in a long line from tinys shoulder to his lower leg letting out a screaming buzz of sound unlike anything i had ever heard before in the last fraction of a second before it vanished the energy snapped back and forth like the tip of a whip and tinys left leg came off at the knee the gruff screamed whatever that thing had been it had taken the fight out of tiny hells bells i stared at the maimed summer champion and then at the open innocentlooking locker then i walked slowly forward tiny had only one eye open and it didnt look like it would focus on anything his breathing was rough quick and ragged which translated into a seething oatscented breeze anywhere within ten or fifteen feet of his head tiny blinked his other eye open and though they still wouldnt focus he let out a weaksounding grunt mortal he rasped i am bested one of his ears flicked once and he exhaled in a sigh finish it i walked past the fallen gruff without stopping noting as i did that the stroke of energy that had severed his leg had cauterized it shut too he wasnt going to bleed to death i peered cautiously into the locker it was empty except for a single flat wooden box about the size of a big backgammon kit the back wall of the locker sported something elsethe blackened outline of some sort of rune it wasnt the first time id seen gard employing some kind of runebased magic but id be damned if i knew how it was done i reached out with my wizards senses cautiously but felt nothing whatever energy had been stored there was gone now what the hell i reached in and grabbed the box nothing ripped me into quivering shreds i scowled suspiciously and slowly withdrew the box but nothing else happened evidently gard had considered her security measures to be adequate for dealing with a thief or a dinosaur whichever once i had the case i turned back to the gruff mortal tiny wheezed finish it i try not to kill anything unless its absolutely necessary i replied and ive got no need to kill you today this wasnt a personal matter its done thats the end of it the gruff focused his eyes and just stared at me for a startled moment mercy from a winterbound im not bound i snapped this is purely temp work i squinted around i think the hobs have mostly cleared out can you leave on your own or do you need me to send for someone the gruff shuddered and shook his huge head not necessary i will go he spread the fingers of one hand on the ground and started sinking into it as if it were quicksand as portals to faerie went that was a new one for me this is a onetime offer i told him just before he was completely gone dont come back i shant he rumbled his eyes sagging closed in weariness but mark you this wizard i frowned at him what my elder brother he growled is going to kill thee then tiny sank into the floor and was gone another one i demanded of the floor youve got to be kidding me i leaned against the lockers banging my head gently against the steel for a moment then i pushed myself back onto my feet and started jogging back toward where i had parted with michael just because the hobs were gone from this part of the station didnt mean that there wasnt still a fight going on michael might need my help i picked up the trail of body parts again though by this time most of them were mounds of dark powder like charcoal dust pounded to a gooey paste by the buildings sprinklers the patches of gunk got thicker as i continued in the direction i thought michael had gone i followed the trail to the base of a ridiculously broad flight of stone stairsthe one that actually had been in the untouchables the parts were still recognizable as parts here these hobs hadnt been dead for long they lay in a carpet of motionless burning corpses on the stairs judging by the way theyd fallen they had been facing up the stairs when they died several fallen hobs bore wounds that indicated that michael had hewed his way through them from behind white knight he might be but once that sword comes out michael puts his game face on and he plays as hard as almost anyone ive ever seen not that i could blame him not all the remains id passed had been those of hobs three security guards were down one maybe ten feet from the stairs the other two on the stairway itself they had fallen separately in the darkness id passed several other bloodstains that had almost certainly been fatal to their donors unless the falling water had made them look more extensive than they actually were id never encountered hobs facetoface before but i knew enough about them to hope that whoever had spilled that blood was dead hobs had a habit of hauling victims back into their lightless tunnels i shuddered id give the troubleshooters from summer that much all the gruffs wanted to do was kill me clean and that would be the end of it id been carried into the darkness by monsters before it isnt something id wish on anyone ever you dont really live through it even if you survive it changes you i pushed away bad memories and tried to ignore them while i thought some of the hobs had obviously taken their victims and run according to the books it was their modus operandi though this entire attack seemed to indicate a higher level of organization than the average rampage obviously whoever was behind it wasnt in complete control faeries share one universal traittheir essential natures are actively contrary and they are notoriously difficult to command the hobs on the stairs were different from the ones id had to contend with at the front of the station these all bore more advanced cutlery probably made of bronze and wore armor made of some kind of hide to be clustered this thickly on the stairs they had to have been at least a little organized fighting in ranks too something had compelled these hobs to attack in unison hell if the numbers of fallen hobs in front of me were any indication the gang that came after michael and me were probably stragglers who had gone haring off on their own looking for a little carryout to take home so what had been the purpose of the attack what the hell had drawn them all to the stairway whatever was at the top obviously above me the light of the holy sword flickered and began to fade i chugged up the stairs as it did still holding my fingers up to shield my eyes until the light dwindled and caught up to michael he was breathing hard sword still raised over his head in a high guard and ready to come sweeping down i noted idly that the stench of stagnant water had vanished replaced by the quiet strong scent of roses i lifted my face again and felt cool clean rosescented water fall on my face falling through the light of the holy sword had improved it it would seem the last hob to fall a big brute the size of a freaking mountain gorilla lay motionless near michaels feet what was left of a bronze shield and sword lay in neatly sliced fragments around the body its blood spread sluggishly down the stairs coated with bluewhite flame as its body was slowly consumed by more of the same everybody can relax i panted as i caught up to michael im here michael greeted me with a nod and a quick smile are you all right not bad i said barely resisting the temptation to turn the second word into a barnyard sound sorry i wasnt much use to you once you waded in it couldnt have happened without your help michael said seriously thank you de nada i replied i went up the last few stairs and got a look at what the hobs had been after children there must have been thirty kids around ten years old up at the top of the stairs all of them in school uniforms all of them huddled together in a corner all of them frightened most of them crying there was one dazedlooking woman in a blazer that matched those of the children together with two women dressed in the casual uniforms of amtrak stewards a train had just arrived i murmured to michael as i realized what had happened it must have gotten in through the weather somehow thats why the hobs were here now michael flicked amoracchius to one side shaking off a small cloud of fine black powder from the blade as he did then he put the weapon away it should be safe now everyone he said his voice calm the authorities should be here any minute he added in a quieter tone we should probably go not yet i said quietly i walked into the great hall far enough to see the area behind the first of the row of corinthian pillars that lined the walls three people stood there the first was a man of a height with michael but built more leanly more dangerously he had hair of dark gold that fell to his shoulders and the shadow of a beard resulting from several days without shaving he wore a casual darkblue sports suit over a white tshirt and he held the bronze sword of a hob stained with their dark blood in either hand he regarded me with the calm remote eyes of a great cat and he showed me some of his teeth when he saw me his name was kincaid and he was a professional assassin next to him was a young woman with long curling brown hair and flashing dark eyes her jeans were tight enough to show off some nice curves but not too tight to move in and she held a slender rod maybe five feet long in one hand carved with runes and sigils not too unlike mine captain luccio had a long plastic tube hanging from a strap over one of her shoulders its top dangling loose odds were good her silver sword was still stowed inside it i knew that when she smiled she had killer dimplesbut from the expression on her face i wasnt going to be exposed to that hazard anytime soon her features were hard and guarded though they did not entirely hide a fierce rage i hoped it was reserved for the attacking hobs and not for me the captain was not someone i wanted angry at me standing between and slightly behind the two adults was a girl not much older than all the other children who had taken refuge in the hall shed grown more than a foot since the last time id seen her about five years ago she still looked like a neatly dressed perfectly groomed childexcept for her eyes her eyes were creepily out of place in that innocent face heavy with knowledge and all the burdens that come with it the archive put a hand on kincaids elbow and the hired killer lowered his swords the girl stepped forward and said hello mister dresden hello ivy i responded nodding politely if these creatures were under your command the little girl said in a level tone im going to execute you she didnt make it a threat there wasnt enough interest in her voice for it to be that the archive just stated it as a simple and undeniable fact the scary part was that if she decided to kill me thered be little i could do about it the child wasnt simply a child she was the archive the embodied memory of humanity a living repository of the knowledge of mankind when she was six or seven id seen her kill a dozen of the most dangerous warriors of the red court it took her about as much effort as it takes me to open the wrapper on a stack of crackers the archive was power with a capital p and operated on an entirely different level than i did of course they werent under his command luccio said she glanced at me and arched an eyebrow how could you even suspect such a thing i find it unlikely that an attack of this magnitude could be anything but a deliberate attempt to abduct or assassinate me mab and titania have involved themselves in this business the archive said in a matteroffact tone mister dresden is currently winters emissary in this affairand need i remind you that hobs are beholden to winterto mab she hadnt needed to remind me though id been putting that thought off for a while the fact that the hobs were mabs subjects meant that matters were even murkier than i thought and that now was probably a reasonably good time to start panicking but first things first prevent the scary little girl from killing me i have no idea who was ordering these things around i said quietly the archive stared at me for an endless second then that ancient implacable gaze moved to michael sir knight she said her tone polite will you vouch for this man maybe it was just my imagination that it took michael a second longer to answer than he might have done in the past of course she stared at him as well and then nodded her head mister dresden you remember my bodyguard kincaid yeah i said my voice didnt exactly bubble with enthusiasm hi tough guy what brings you to chicago kincaid showed me even more teeth the midget he said i hate the snow if it was up to me id much rather be somewhere warm say hawaii for example i am not a midget the archive said in a firmly disapproving tone i am in the seventyfourth percentile for height for my age and stop trying to provoke him the midgets no fun kincaid explained i tried to get her to join the girl scouts but she wasnt having any of it if i want to glue macaroni to a paper plate i can do that at home said the archive its hours past my bedtime and i have no desire to entangle ourselves with the local authorities we should leave she frowned at kincaid obviously our movements have been tracked our quarters here are probably compromised she turned her eyes back to me i formally request the hospitality of the white council until such time as i can establish secure lodgings uh i said luccio made a quick motion with one hand urging me to accept of course i said nodding at the archive excellent the archive said she turned to kincaid im soaked my coat and a change of clothes are in my bag on the train ill need them kincaid gave me a skeptical glance but tellingly he didnt argue with the archive instead he vanished quickly down the stairs the archive turned to me statistically speaking the emergency services of this city should begin to arrive in another three minutes given the weather and the condition of the roads it would be best for all of us if we were gone by then couldnt agree more i said i grimaced whoever did this is taking awful chances moving this publically the archives notquitehuman gaze bored into me for a moment then she said matters may be quite a bit worse than that im afraid our troubles are just beginning chapter twentysix m ichael stopped in his tracks when he saw the gaping hole tiny the gruff had left in the east wall of union station merciful god he breathed harry what happened little problem i said you didnt say anything to me you looked busy i told him and you already had a couple of hundred bad guys to handle i nodded at the hole i only had the one michael shook his head bemusedly and i saw luccio look at the hole with something like mild alarm did you get it michael asked luccio cocked her head at michael when he spoke and then looked sharply at me i gave michael a level look and said obviously then i turned on my heel and whistled sharply mouse my dog soggy but still enthusiastic came bounding toward us over the watercoated marble floors he slid to a stop throwing up a little wave that splashed over my feet as he did the archive peered intently at mouse as he arrived and took a step toward himbut was prevented from going farther by kincaids hand which came to rest on her slender shoulder michael frowned at the girl and then at the dog this he said brings up a problem there was only so much room in the cab of michaels truck all of us were soaking wet and there was no time to get dry before the authorities arrived i didnt think it completely fair that i got a number of less than friendly looks on the walk to the garage after i explained that it had been me who set off the sprinkler system but at least no one could claim that i hadnt been willing to suffer the consequences right along with them the archive might have been a creepy billy mumyinthe twilight zone kind of child but she was still a child by general acclamation she was in the cab michael had to drive im not letting her sit in there alone kincaid stated oh come on i said hes a knight of the freaking cross he isnt going to hurt her irrelevant kincaid said what about when someone starts shooting at her on the way there is he going to throw his body in front of her to keep her from harm i michael began youre damned right he will i growled harry michael said his tone placating id be glad to protect the child but it would be somewhat problematic to do that and drive at the same time mouse let out a low distressed sound which drew my attention to the fact that the archive had fallen uncharacteristically silent she was standing beside kincaid shuddering her eyes rolling back in her head dammit i said get her into the truck go kincaid michael kincaid scooped her up at once and he and michael got into the cab of the truck iis yyour hhouse far from here warden luccio asked me she didnt look good well she looked good given the circumstances but she also looked soaked and halffrozen already kneeling to hug mouse ostensibly rubbing his fur to help dry it and fluff it out id seen luccio in action as captain of the wardens of the white council and i had formed my opinion of her accordingly when i looked at the woman whod faced kemmlers disciples without batting an eye whom id once seen stand in the open under fire from automatic weapons to protect the apprentices under her care i tended to forget that she was about fivefootfour and might have checked in at a hundred and thirty or forty pounds soaking wet which she was in the middle of a blizzard it isnt far i said then i went up to the door beside kincaid and said put the kid on your lap she wears the seat belt kincaid said shes in danger enough from exposure already luccio doesnt weigh much more than ivy does i said in a flat tone shes in almost as much danger as the kid so youre holding ivy on your lap and letting my captain ride in the cab like a gentleman kincaid gave me a level look his pale eyes cold or what im armed i said youre not he looked at me levelly then at my hands one of them was in my coat pocket then he said you think i believe that youd kill me if you try to make me choose between you and luccio i said with a brittle smile im pretty sure whom im going to bid aloha his teeth flashed in a sudden wolfish smile and he moved over drawing the freezing child onto his lap by the time i got back to luccio she was upright only because mouse sat placidly in the cold supporting her she mumbled some kind of protest in a faint commanding tone but since she said it in italian i declared her brain frozen and assumed command of the local warden detachment which was handy since it consisted of only me anyway i bundled her into the trucks cab and got her buckled in beside kincaid he helped with itmy fingers were too cold and stiff to manage very quickly harry michael said he reached back drew a rolledup thermal blanket from behind the trucks front seat and tossed it to me i caught it and nodded my thanks with the cold already starting to chew at my belly that left me and mouse in the back of the truck both of us soaking wet in the middle of winter in the middle of a blizzard the cold moved from my belly to my chest and i curled up into a ball because i didnt have much choice in the matter magic wasnt an option my palmsized ball of flame wouldnt get along well with the back of a moving truck especially given how much i was already shaking i wanted to get warm not set myself on fire ssssometimes chchchchivalry ssssucks i growled to mouse teeth chattering my dog whose thick winter coat wasnt much good after it had gotten a good soaking leaned against me as hard as i leaned against him underneath the rough blanket while the cab of the truck heated up nicely its windows fogging i felt like a dickens character i thought about explaining that to mouse just to occupy my thoughts but he was suffering enough without being forced to endure dickens even by proxy so we made the trip in miserable companionable silence there might have been emergency lights going by us i was too busy enjoying the involuntary rhythmic contractions of every muscle cell in my freaking body to notice thirty seconds into the trip i was fairly certain that i was going to black out and wake up five hundred years in the future but as it turned out i had to endure only a miserable twenty minutes or so before michael pulled up outside my apartment both vehicle doors opened to the weary but authoritative ring of luccios voice get him to the door while he can still let us in through his wards im fine i said rising only it came out sounding more like mmmmnnngh and when i tried to stand up i all but fell out of the truck michael caught me and kincaid moved quickly to help him lift me to the ground i dimly felt one of kincaids hands enter my jacket pocket and turn it out empty son of a bitch he said grinning i knew it luccio emerged from the trucks cab carrying the entirely limp form of the archive draped over one hip the girls arms and legs flopped loosely her mouth hung open in sleep and her cheeks were bright pink get up dresden she stated her voice was firm but though warmed by the trip she was still nearly as damp as she had been at the station and i saw her buckle as the cold sank its teeth into her hurry i moved my feet in a vague shuffle and remembered somewhere that when you walked you moved them alternately this improved our progress considerably we reached a door and someone said something about dangerous wards no kidding i thought ive got some wards on my place thatll fry you to greasy spots on the concrete but you should see the ones gard can do luccio snapped something to me about the wards and i thought she looked cold i had a fire at my place which she could probably use i opened the door for her the way youre supposed to for a lady but the damned thing was stuck until michael shoved it open with his shoulder and muttered something disparaging about amateur work then everything got sort of muddled and my arms and legs hurt a lot i ended up thinking man my couch feels nice mouse snuffled at my face and then all but squashed me as he laid his head and most of his upper body across mine i thought about chewing him out for it but opted for sleep on my wonderful couch instead blackness ensued i woke up to a room illuminated only by the light from my fireplace i was toasty though my fingers and toes throbbed uncomfortably there was a gentle weight pressing down on me that proved to be virtually every blanket i owned the deep slow steady sound of my dogs breathing whispered from the rug in front of the couch and one of my hands was lying on the rough warm dry fur of mouses back water trickled nearby luccio sat on a footstool in front of the fire facing the flames my teapot hung on its latch over the fire a basin of steaming water sat upon the hearth as i watched she dipped a cloth in the hot water and slid it over her shoulder and down the length of one arm her face in profile to me her eyes were closed in an expression of simple pleasure the light of the fire made lovely exquisitely feminine shadows along the slender lines of her naked back down to the waist of her jeans as she moved muscles shifting beneath soft skin that shimmered golden like the firelight for a second after the warm cloth glided over it leaving little wisps of vapor in its wake something else had never really occurred to me before either luccio was beautiful oh she wasnt covergirl pretty though i suspected that with the right preparation shed be damned close her features were appealing particularly around her little cupids bow of a mouth framed by its dimples contrasted with a rather squaredoff chin that stopped half an eyelash shy of masculinity she had dark eyes that flashed when she was angry or amused and her mediumbrown hair was long curling and lustrous she obviously took really good care of itbut there was too much strength in that face for her to be conventionally pretty beauty runs deeper than that there was an inexpressible quality of femininity about her that appealed to me tremendouslysome critical mixture of gentle curves quiet grace and supple strength that i had only that second realized happened to reside in the same place as the head of the wardens maybe more important i knew the quality of the person under the skin id known luccio for years been in more than one tight spot with her and found her to be one of the only veteran wardens whom i both liked and respected she shook her hair to the other side of her back and washed the other shoulder and arm just as slowly and just as evidently taking pleasure in doing so it had been a while since id seen a womans naked back and shoulders it had been considerably rarer than my views of the various nightmares my job kept exposing me to i guess even among all the nightmares sooner or later youll get lucky enough to catch a glimpse of a beautiful dream and despite the trouble i was in for just that moment there under all those blankets i looked at something beautiful it made me wish i had the talent to capture the sight with charcoal or inks or oilsbut that had never been my gift all i could do was soak up that simple sight beautiful woman bathing in firelight i didnt actually notice when luccio paused and turned her head to face me i just noticed suddenly that she was returning my gaze her dark eyes steady i swallowed i wasnt sure what i had been expecting sudden outrage maybe or a biting remark or at least a blush luccio didnt do any of that she just returned my stare calm and poised and lovely as you please one arm folded across her breasts while the other dipped the cloth into the steaming basin again sorry i said finally lowering my eyes i was probably blushing dammit maybe i could pass it off as mild frostbite heroically suffered on her behalf she let out a quiet little murmur of sound that was too relaxed to be a chuckle did it displease you no i said at once god no nothing like that then why apologize she said i uh i coughed i just figured that a girl who came of age during the reign of queen victoria would be a little more conservative luccio let out a wicked little laugh that time victoria was british she said im italian bit of a difference then i asked just a little she replied when i was young i posed for a number of painters and sculptors you know she tilted her head back and washed her throat as she spoke mmm though that was in my original body of course right the one that had been stolen by an insane necromancer leaving luccios mind permanently trapped in a loaner a really young fit lovely loaner i dont see how the one youre in now could possibly come up short by comparison she opened her eyes and flashed me a smile that was entirely too pleased and girlish thank you but i would not have you misunderstanding me id avail myself of your shower after being soaked in that foul soup but the archive is on your bed and kincaid has closed the door hes resting too and id rather not have him go for my throat before he wakes and you were asleep so she gave a little shrug of her shoulders it did really interesting things to the shadows the fire cast upon her skin and i was suddenly glad of all the blankets piled on me are you feeling all right luccio asked me ill live i said it was gallant of you to face down kincaid like that no problem hes an ass a very dangerous one luccio said i wouldnt have traveled with him if i had not seen him pass through the security checkpoint in boston she rose dropped the washcloth in the basin and pulled her shirt on giving me a rather intriguing view of her back and waist silhouetted against the firelight i sighed moment over back to business what were you doing traveling with them i asked bringing them here for the parley she replied parley the archive contacted nicodemus archleone regarding our accusations he agreed to meet with us here in chicago to discuss the matter you are the initiating party in this instance and i am here to serve as your second i blinked at her you my second she turned to face me as she finished buttoning her shirt and smiled faintly duty before ego relatively few of the wardens with sufficient seasoning for the role were willing i thought it might be best if you worked with me instead of morgan thats why they pay you the big bucks cap that keen interpersonal insight that and because im quite good at killing things luccio said nodding she turned to the fireplace and took gards little wooden box off the mantel dresden hells bells i breathed sitting up captain that thing is dangerous put it down i snapped out that last in a tone of pure authority one id gotten used to when working with molly and various folks id met through the paranet she froze in her tracks and arched an eyebrow at me but only for a split second then she smoothly replaced the box and stepped away from it i see you were holding it when we dragged you in here you wouldnt let it go in fact well i said no which i take it explains what you were doing at the station well i said yes quite a coincidence she said i shook my head in my experience when theres a knight of the cross around theres no such thing as coincidence she frowned at that its been a very long time since ive been to confession nearly a century in fact im not aware that the almighty owes me any favors mysterious ways i said smugly she laughed i take it theyve used that line on you before constantly i said a good man she said youre lucky to have him as a friend i frowned and said quietly yeah i am i shook my head whens the parley noon tomorrow she nodded at the mantel can you tell me whats in there options i said if the parley fails out with it dresden she said i shook my head she put a fist on one hip why not gave my word she considered that for a moment then she nodded once and said as you wish get some more rest youll need it then she prowled over to my love seat sank wearily down into it and without another word curled up under a blanket she was apparently asleep seconds later i thought about getting up and checking out gards case maybe calling michael and murphy but the weariness that suddenly settled on my limbs made all of that sound impossibly difficult so i settled in a little more comfortably and found sleep coming swiftly to me as well the last thing i noticed before i dropped off was that under all the blankets i was entirely undressed and i was clean chapter twentyseven i still dont see why i cant go molly said folding her arms crossly you know how you told me how much you hate it when your parents quote scripture at you to answer your questions i asked her yeah im not gonna do that because i dont know this one well enough to get the quote right she rolled her eyes but its something about the best way to defeat temptation is to avoid it oh please molly said actually hes right thomas said passing over my duster seriously i know temptation molly gave my brother a sidelong look and blushed faintly stop that i told him thomas shrugged cant help it im hungry i wound up jumping rooftop to rooftop for half an hour dodging a bunch of threefoottall lunatics with bows and arrows elves i murmured someone on summers team was calling in backup too interesting i wonder which side tipped the scales first youre welcome thomas said hey molly snapped can we get back on topic i know how to handle myself harry this is supposed to be a talk not a fight i sighed turning to her we were talking to each other in the carpenters kitchen while everyone else geared up in the workshop thomas had sneaked in the front door of the house to pass my staff and coat back to me after his evening of decoy work grasshopper i said think who were going to be talking to nicodemus the head of the denarians she said the man who tried to kill my father and my teacher and did his best to put a demon inside my little brothers head i blinked how did you know about the usual eavesdropping on mom and dad she replied impatiently the point being that im not going to be tempted to pick up one of his coins harry im not talking about you being tempted kid i said im worried about nicodemus given everything thats going on id rather not wave a knight of the crosss brushedwithdarkness daughter under his nose were trying to avoid a huge fight not find new reasons to start one molly gave me a steady stare hey i said hows that homework i gave you coming she stared some more shed learned from charity so she was pretty good at it id gotten charitys stare plenty though so id been inoculated she turned in silence and stalked out of the kitchen thomas snorted quietly what i asked him you really think youre going to avoid a fight i think im not going to hand them any of michaels family as hostages i said nicodemus has got something up his sleeve as i spoke i made sure the little holdout knife in its leather sheath was still secured up mine the only question is who is going to start the music and where wheres the meeting i shrugged neither party knows kincaid and the archive are picking a neutral spot they left my place early this morning theyre going to call but i doubt theyll start it this soon my money says that nicodemus will want something in exchange for marcone thats when hell make his move at the exchange thomas asked i nodded try to grab the whole tamale uhhuh thomas said speaking of i came by your place after i was done playing tag with assassin midgets last night got a whiff of perfume on the doorway and checked through the window on the south side of the house he gave me a sly grin about fucking time man i frowned at him what the grin faded you mean you still didntoh empty night harry what did you see i saw you talking to a woman who had already taken half her clothes off for you man oh come on i said thomas it wasnt like that she was just getting clean i gave him the short version of the previous evening thomas gave me a look of his own then he thwapped me gently upside the head hey i said harry he said you were sleeping for hours she had plenty of time to get clean you think she sat around for all that time because she wasnt tired just yet you think she didnt plan on you seeing her i opened my mouth to answer and left it that way for that matter she could have settled down behind the couch where you couldnt have seen her if you did wake up thomas continued not right by the fire where she made what i thought was quite a nice little picture for you ii didnt think she he stared at me you didnt make a move shesluccio is my commanding officer man wewe work together thomas rolled his eyes thats a twentyfirstcentury attitude man shes a nineteenthcentury girl she doesnt draw the lines the same way you and i do but i never thought i cant believe this thomas said tell me you arent that stupid stupid i demanded yeah he said bluntly stupid if she offered and you turned her down because you had a reason you didnt want to thats one thing never realizing what she was talking about thoughthats just pathetic she never said my brother threw up his hands what does a woman need to do harry rip her clothes off throw herself on top of you and shimmy while screaming do me baby he shook his head sometimes youre a frigging idiot i i spread my hands she just went to sleep man because she was being thoughtful of you you knob she didnt want to come on too strong and make you uncomfortable especially given that shes older and more experienced than you are and your commanding officer to boot she didnt want to make you feel pressured so she left you plenty of room to turn her down gracefully he rolled his eyes read between the lines once in a while man i i sighed ive never been hit on by a woman a hundred and fifty years older than me i said lamely try to use your brain around women once in a while instead of just your juju stick thomas tossed me my staff i caught it everyones a critic my brother purloined an apple from the basket on the island in the kitchen on his way to the door glanced over his shoulder and said moron thank god nicodemus is a man he left and i stood there for a second being annoyed at him i mean sure he was probably rightbut that only made it more annoying not less something else he was right about anastasia had looked simply amazing in front of that fire huh i hadnt really thought of her in terms of her first name before just as luccio or the captain or captain luccio come to think of it shed been out of the dating game for even longer than i had could be that she hadnt exactly been brimming with selfconfidence last night either the situation bore thinking upon later for now there was intrigue and inevitable betrayal afoot and i had to focus i headed out to the workshop the day was brighter than the one before but the cloud cover still hadnt gone it had stopped snowing though the wind kicked up enough powder to make it hard to tell a check of the mirror had revealed that the tip of my nose the tops of my ears and the highest parts of my cheeks were rough and ruddy from exposure to cold and my brush with hypothermia they looked like theyd suffered from a heavy sunburn added to my raccoon eyes i thought them quite charming no wonder luccio had thrown herself at me with such wanton abandon dammit harry focus focus danger is afoot i opened the door to the workshop just as michael folded his arms and said i still dont see why i cant go because were trying to avoid a fight luccio said calmly and an atmosphere of nervous fear is not going to foster a good environment for a peaceful exchange im not afraid of them michael said no luccio said smiling faintly but theyre afraid of you in any case gard said neither the church nor the knights are signatories of the accords not to put it too bluntly sir michael but this is quite literally none of your business you dont know these people michael said quietly not the way i do i do i said quietly at least in some ways michael turned to give me a steady searching look maybe he said quietly do you think i should stay away i didnt answer him immediately gard watched me from where she sat on the edge of her cot now dressed and upright if not precisely healthylooking hendricks sat at the workbench again although he was sharpening a knife this time weapons nuts are always fiddling with their gear murphy seated down the bench from hendricks was cleaning her gun she wasnt moving her wounded arm much though she apparently had full use of that hand sanya loomed in a corner near the workbench patiently working some kind of leather polish into esperacchiuss scabbard i dont think this is where theyll try to stick in the knife i said quietly i turned my eyes to luccio i also dont think it would be stupid to have a couple of knights on standby in case im wrong luccios head rocked back a little no reason not to hedge our bets i told her quietly these people dont play nice like the unseelie fae or the red court ive seen them in action captain she pursed her lips and her eyes never wavered from my face all right warden she said finally its your city i did not agree to this gard said rising her expression dark oh deal with it blondie i told her beggars and choosers the white council is backing you up on this one but dont start thinking its because we work for you or your boss im going to be there too murphy said quietly without looking up from her gun not just somewhere nearby there in the room pretty much everyone there said no or some variant of it at that point except for hendricks who didnt talk a lot and me who knew better murphy put her gun back together during the protests and loaded it in the silence afterward if you people want to have your plots and your shadowy wars in private she said you should take them to antarctica or somewhere or you could do this in new york or boise and this isnt any of my business but you arent in any of those places youre in chicago and when things get out of hand its the people im sworn to protect who are endangered she rose and though she was the shortest person in the room she wasnt looking up at anyone im going to be there as a moderating influence with your cooperation or we can do it the other way your choice but i know a lot of cops who are sick and tired of this supernatural bullshit sneaking up on us she directed a level gaze around the room she hadnt put the gun away i smiled at her just a little gard looked at me and said dresden i shrugged and shook my head sadly what once we gave them the vote it went totally out of control youre a pig harry murphy growled but a pig smart enough to bow to the inevitable i said i looked at gard and said far as im concerned shes got a legitimate interest ill back it warden luccio said in a warning tone may i speak to you i walked over to her she cant possibly know luccio said quietly the kind of grief she could be letting herself in for she can i replied as quietly shes been through more than most wardens captain and shes sure as hell covered my back enough times to have earned the right to make up her own mind luccio frowned at me for a moment and then turned to face murphy sergeant she said quietly this could expose you to aconsiderable degree of risk are you sure if it were your town murphy said your job your duty could you stand around with your fingers in your ears luccio nodded slowly and then inclined her head besides murphy said half smiling as she put her gun in her shoulder holster its not as if im leaving you people much choice i like her sanya rumbled in his deep halfswallowed accent she is so tiny and fierce i dont suppose she knows how to sanya michael said his voice very firm we have talked about this the darkskinned russian sighed and shrugged it could not hurt to ask sanya he lifted both hands in a gesture of surrender grinning and fell silent the door to the house banged shut and running footsteps crunched through the snow molly opened the door to the workshop and said harry kincaids on the phone hes got the location for the meeting kincaid murphy said in a rather sharp voice yeah didnt i mention that i asked her my tone perfectly innocent as i headed for the door he showed up last night her eyes narrowed well talk tiny sanya rumbled to michael clenching a demonstrative fist but fierce chapter twentyeight p eople think that nothing can possibly happen in the middle of a big citysay chicagowithout lots of witnesses seeing everything that happened what most people dont really understand is that there are two reasons why that just aint sothe first being that humans in general make lousy witnesses take something fairly innocuous like a minor traffic accident at a busy pedestrian intersection beepbeep crunch followed by a lot of shouting and arm waving line up everyone at that intersection and ask them what happened every single one of them will give you a slightly different story some of them will have seen the whole thing start to finish some of them will have seen only the aftermath some of them will have seen only one of the cars some of them will tell you with perfect assurance that they saw both cars from start to finish including such details as the expressions on the drivers faces and changes in vehicle acceleration despite the fact that they would have to be performing simultaneous feats of bilocation levitation and telepathy to have done so most people will be honest and incorrect honest incorrectness isnt the same thing as lying but it amounts to the same thing when youre talking about witnesses to a specific event a relative minority will limit themselves to reporting what they actually saw not things that they have filled in by assumption or memories contaminated by too much exposure to other points of view of that relative minority even fewer will be the kind of person who by natural inclination or possibly training has the capacity for noticing and retaining a large amount of detail in a limited amount of time the point being that once events pass into memory they already have a tendency to begin to become muddled and cloudy it can be more of an art form than a science to gain an accurate picture of what transpired based upon eyewitness descriptionsand thats for a matter of relative unimportance purely a matter of fallible intellect with no deep personal or emotional issues involved throw emotions into the mix and mild confusion turns into utter havoc take that same fenderbender make it an accident between a carload of neoskinhead types and some gangbangers at a busy crosswalk in a south side neighborhood and youve got the kind of situation that kicks off riots no matter what happens you probably arent going to be able to get a straight story out of anyone afterward in fact you might be hardpressed to get any story out of anyone once human emotions get tossed into the mix everything is up for grabs the second reason things can go unnoticed in the middle of the big city is pretty simple walls walls block line of sight let me rephrase that walls block line of involvement the human animal is oriented around a sense of sight things arent real until we see them seeing is believing right which is also why there are illusioniststhey can make us see things that arent real and it seems amazing if a human being actually sees something bad happening theres a better chance that he or she will act and get involved than if the sense of sight isnt involved history illustrates it oh sure allied governments heard reports of nazi death camps in world war ii but that was a far cry from when the first troops actually saw the imprisoned jews as they liberated the camps hearst had known it before that you furnish the pictures and ill furnish the war and according to some he did conversely if you dont see something happening it isnt as real you can hear reports of tragedies but they dont hit you the way they would if you were standing there in the ruins nowhere has as many walls as big cities do and walls keep you from seeing things they help make things less real sure maybe you hear loud sharp noises outside some nights but its easy to tell yourself that those arent gunshots that theres no need to call the police no need to even worry its probably just a car backfiring sure or a kid with fireworks there might be loud wailing or screams coming from the apartment upstairs but you dont know that the drunken neighbor is beating his wife with a rolling pin again its not really any of your business and theyre always fighting and the man is scary besides yeah you know that there are cars coming and going at all hours from your neighbors place and that the crowd there isnt exactly the most uprightlooking bunch but you havent seen him dealing drugs not even to the kids you see going over there sometimes its easier and safer to shut the door be quiet and turn up the tv were ostriches and the whole world is sand newbies who are just learning about the world of wizards and the unpleasant side of the supernatural always think theres this huge conspiracy to hide it from everyone there isnt theres no need for one beyond preventing actual parades down main street hells bells from where im standing its a miracle anyone ever notices which is why i was fairly sure that our parley with the archive and the denarians in the shedd aquarium was going to go unremarked oh sure it was right in the middle of town within a stones throw of the field museum and within sight of soldier field but given the weather there wasnt going to be a lot of foot trafficand the aquarium was in its offseason there might be a handful of people there caring for the animals but i felt confident that kincaid would find a way to convince them to be somewhere else murphy had rented a car since hers was so bustedup the past few days of snow had seen a load of accidents and there werent any compact cars left so shed wound up with a silver caddy the size of a yacht and id called shotgun hendricks and gard rode in the backseat gard had gotten to the car under her own power though she had been moving carefully luccio sat beside gard with her slender staff and her silver rapier resting on the floorboards between her feet though my own staff was a lot longer and had to slant back between the front seats and past gards head up into the rear window well city work crews were still laboring to clear roads and access to critical facilities an offseason tourist attraction was not high on anyones priority list for that matter the field museum had been closed due to the weather which meant that there really werent any functioning public buildings for several hundred yards in any direction that could be a problem michaels white truck wasnt going to be able to get anywhere close without being spotted which meant that he and sanya were going to be two maybe three minutes away from helping provided they could be signaled at all that was practically the other side of the world where a violent confrontation is concerned on the other hand it also meant that the bad guys werent going to be able to bring in any help without being spotted either provided they were driving cars of course glass halffull harry glass halffull there was no profit to be had in a fightnot yet anyway whatever nicodemus was after hed have to make his demands before he had a chance to doublecross us out of whatever he wanted us to bring him besides given what id seen of the archive in action hed be freaking insane to try anything where she was officiating she didnt brook slights to her authority lightly the nearest street had been cleared by city trucks but none of the parking lots had been done and the excess snow from the streets formed small mountains on either side of the road looks like were going to have to walk in murphy said quietly keep circling they keep the animals here yearround i said quietly and theyve got to be fed every day the staff will have broken a trail in somewhere perhaps they let the exhibits go hungry during the storm gard suggested few would venture into this for the sake of their paychecks you dont do oceanography for the money i said and you sure as hell dont take up working with dolphins and whales for the vast paycheck and the company car i shook my head they love them someones gone in every day theyll at least have broken a foot trail there murphy said pointing sure enough someone had hacked a narrow opening into the mounded snow at the side of the road and dug out a footpath on the other side murph had to park at the side of the road with the doors of the rental car just an inch from the snow walls if someone came along going too fast given the condition the streets were in the caddy was going to get smashed but it wasnt like she had a lot of choice we all piled out of the drivers side of the car into the wan light of early afternoon luccio and i both paused to put on our grey wardens cloaks cloaks look cool and everything but they dont go well with cars luccio buckled on a finely tooled leather belt that held a sword on her left hip and a colt on her right my was back in my duster pocket and the weight of both the coat and the gun felt greatly comforting the wind caught my coat and the cloak both and almost knocked me over until i got them gathered in close to my body again and under control hendricks stolid and huge in his dark sensible london fog winter coat went by me with a small smile on his face hendricks took point and the rest of us followed him through what could only generously be called a trail instead of the snow being up to our chests on the trail we sank only to our knees it was a long cold slog up to the aquarium and then around the entire building where the snow had piled up to truly impressive depths in the lee of the wind on the south side of the structure wind hustling in over the frozen lake felt like it had come straight from outer space and everyone but gard hunched up miserably against it the trail led us to an employees door in the side of the building which proved to have had the lock housing on its frame covered in duct tape leaving it open hendricks opened the door and i stuck my head in and took a quick look around the building was dark beneath its smothering blanket of snow except for a few dim nightlights set low on the walls i didnt see anyone but i took an extra moment or two to extend my senses into the building searching for any lurking presences or hostile magicks nothing but a little paranoia never hurts in a situation like this captain i said quietly what do you think luccio moved up beside me and studied the hall beyond the doorway her dark eyes flickering alertly back and forth it seems clear i nodded said excuse me and went through the door in a burst of raging anticlimax i stomped the snow off my boots and jeans as best i could as the others came in behind me i moved farther down the hall straining to sense anyone approaching which meant that i heard the soft scuff of deliberately obtrusive footsteps two or three seconds before kincaid rounded the far corner he was dressed in his customary black clothing again fatigue pants and a hunting jacket over body armor and he had enough guns strapped to his body to outfit a terrorist cell or a texan nuclear family he gave his chin a sharp little lift toward me by way of greeting this way ple his eyes focused past me and his voice died in midcourtesy he stared over my shoulder for a second sighed and then told me she cant be here i felt my eyebrows rising the corners of my mouth went along for the ride i leaned in a little to kincaid and murmured you tell her his gaze went from murphy to me a less charitable man than i might have called his expression sour he drummed one thumb on the handle of a sidearm and asked she threaten to call in the constabulary shes got this funny thing where she takes her oath to protect the city and citizens of chicago seriously its as if her promises mean something to her kincaid grimaced ill have to clear it with the archive no murphy no meeting i said tell her i said that the assassin grunted you can tell her yourself he led me through the halls of the shedd to the oceanarium it was probably the most popular exhibit therea great big old semicircular building containing the largest indoor aquatic exhibits in the world its outer ring of exhibits sported a number of absolutely huge pools containing millions of gallons of water and a number of dolphins and those little white whales whose names i can never remember the same as the caviar beluga beluga whales there were rocks and trees built up around the outsides of the pools complete with moss and plants and everything to make it look like the pacific northwest although i was fairly sure that the bleacher seats where the audience could marvel at whales and dolphins who would show up and do their usual daily health inspections for their trainers to the sound of applause werent indigenous to the pacific northwest i think those were actually floridian in origin a pair of dolphins swept by us in the water flicking their heads out to get a look at us as they went one of them made a chittering sound that wasnt very melodic the other twitched its tail and splashed a little water our way all in good fun they werent the attractive flipper kind of dolphins they were regular dolphins that arent as pretty and dont get cast on television maybe they just refused to sell out and see a plastic surgeon i held up a fist to them represent kincaid scanned the bleachers frowning shes supposed to be sitting here dammit i sighed and circled back toward the stairs to the lower level she might be the archive but shes still a kid kincaid he frowned and looked at me so so kids like cute he blinked at me cute come on i led him downstairs on the lower level of the oceanarium theres an inner ring of exhibits too containing both penguins andwait for itsea otters i mean come on sea otters they open abalone with rocks while floating on their backs how much cuter does it get than small fuzzy floating playful tool users with big soft brown eyes we found ivy standing in front of one of the sea otter habitats dressed much more warmly and practically this time and carrying a small backpack she was watching two otters chase each other around the habitat and smiling kincaid stopped in his tracks when he saw that just to see what hed do i tried to step past him he shot me a look like hed murder me if i tried to interrupt her and my opinion of him went up a notch i eased back and waited no skin off my teeth to let the girl watch the otters for a minute it had been hard sometimes when i was a kid after my magic had started coming in id felt weird and differentalone it had gradually distanced me from the other kids but ivy had never had the luxury of belonging even temporarily from what i understood shed been the archive since she was born fully aware and stuffed full of knowledge from the time shed opened her eyes i couldnt even imagine how hideous that would be hell the more i learned as i got older the more i wished i were ignorant again well innocent anyway i remembered what it was like at least ivy had never been innocent i could let her smile at sea otters you bet a shadow moved behind me and i willed myself not to be creeped out i turned and saw the two dolphins from the tank above cruise by observing us again the huge tanks contained observation windows running the whole length of the secondlevel gallery so you could see the cute things on one side and ogle the homely dolphins and the caviar whales on the other from down here you could also see the far wall of the big tank which was a curved wall of glass that faced the open waters of lake michigan that always seemed a little sadistic to me i mean here were animals whom nature had equipped to roam the open vastness of the deep blue sea being kept in a mere three million gallons or so of water bad enough to do that to them without giving them a window seat onto all that open water too or maybe it wasnt i hear it kind of sucks to be a whale or a dolphin in the open ocean these days given the state of the fishing industry i guess theyre looking at a can one way or another i muttered hmmm kincaid said nothing ivy let out her breath in a satisfied sigh a moment later as the otters vanished into their den then she turned toward us and blinked oh she said her cheeks colored slightly and for a moment she looked very much like a young girl oh she smoothed wrinkles that didnt exist in her trousers nodded at kincaid and said yes kincaid nodded toward me local law enforcement wants a representative present to observe dresdens supporting it she took that in for a moment sergeant murphy yes i said i see she frowned when she spoke her tone was careful as if she was considering each word before she spoke it speaking as arbiter i have no objection provided both parties involved in the parley give their assent right kincaid said he turned and started walking i nodded to ivy who returned the gesture then i turned and hurried to catch up to kincaid so i asked him as we climbed the stairs so he said lets go talk to nicodemus kincaid led me down the way from the oceanarium and out to the main entry hall its another grandiose collection of shining stone floor and towering corinthian columns arranged around a huge tank the size of a roller rink its full of salt water and coral and seaweed and all kinds of tropical fish sometimes theres a diver with a microphone built into his or her mask feeding the little sharks and fish and talking to gawking tourists diffused light floods in through an enormous triangularpaneled cupola overhead the recent snow had blackened the panes of the cupola and drifted up over most of the glass front doors so the only light in the room came from the little colored lights in the huge tank fish glided through the tank like wraiths the odd light casting sinister shades over their scales and their shadows drifted disembodied over the walls of the room magnified by the distance and the glass walls of the aquarium it was eerie as hell one of the shadows drew my attention as some instinct picked out a strong subtle sense of menace about it it took me a couple of seconds to realize that this particular shadow disturbed me because it was human and moving in a perfect gliding pace around the wall behind the shadow of one of the tanks small but genuine sharkseven though the man who cast the shadow was standing perfectly still nicodemus turned from contemplating the fish swimming in the tank so that i could see the outline of his profile against the softly colored lights his teeth gleamed orangered in the light of the nearest underwater lamp i stopped myself from taking an involuntary step back but just barely it is a metaphor he said quietly he had a good voice mellow and surprisingly deep look at them swimming eating mating hunting killing fleeing hiding each to its nature all of them so different so alien to one another their world in constant motion always changing always threatening challenging he moved one arm sweeping it in a wider gesture they cannot know how fragile it is or that they are constantly surrounded by beings with the power to destroy their world and kill them all with the twitch of a finger it is no fault of theirs of course nicodemus shrugged they are simplylimited very very limited hello dresden youre playing the creepy vibe a little hard i said might as well go for broke put on a black top hat and pipe in some organ music he laughed quietly it didnt sound evil as much as it did rich and supremely confident theres some irregularity with the meeting i take it kincaid glanced at me and nodded local law enforcement wishes a representative to be present i said nicodemuss head tilted really who does it matter kincaid asked his tone bored the archive is willing to permit it if you have no objections nicodemus turned all the way around finally i couldnt see his expression just his outline against the tank his shadow meanwhile kept circling the room behind the shark two conditions he said go on kincaid said first that the representative be unarmed and that the archive guarantee his neutrality in the absence of factors that conflict with matters of lawenforcement duty kincaid glanced at me murphy wouldnt like the unarmed part but shed do it if nothing else she wouldnt want to back down in front of meor maybe kincaid but i had to wonder what was nicodemuss problem with an armed cop guns did not bother the man not even a little why that stipulation i nodded at kincaid excellent nicodemus said second he walked forward each footstep sounding clearly upon the marble floors until we could see him in the nearest floorlights he was a man of medium height and build his features handsome strong his eyes dark and intelligent hints of silver graced his immaculate hair though he was holding up pretty well for a man of two thousand he wore a black silk shirt dark pants and what could have been mistaken for a grey western tie at his throat it wasnt it was an old old rope from the same field as his coin second he said i want five minutes alone with dresden no offense nick i said but thats about five minutes longer than i want to spend with you exactly he replied smiling it was the kind of smile you see at country clubs and in boardrooms and on crocodiles theres really never a good opportunity for us to have a civilized conversation im seizing the chance for a chat he gestured at the building around us sans demolition if you think you can refrain i scowled at him mister archleone kincaid said are you offering a peace bond if so the archive will hold you to it i offer no such thing nicodemus said without looking away from me dresden would count it as worthless coin and his is the only opinion that really matters in this particular situation he spread his hands a talk dresden five minutes i assure you if i wished to do you harm even the hellhounds reputationhe paused deliberately to glance at kincaid with naked contempt in his gazewould not make me hesitate for an instant i would have killed you already kincaid gave nicodemus a chill little smile and the air boiled with potential violence i held up a hand and said quietly easy there wild bill ill talk with him then well have our sitdown all nice and civilized kincaid glanced at me and arched a shaggy darkgold eyebrow you sure i shrugged a shoulder all right he said ill be back in five minutes he paused then added if either of you initiates violence outside of the strictures of a formal duel youll be in violation of the accords in addition you will have offered an insult to the reputation and integrity of the archivewhich i will take personal action to amend the wintry chill in his blue eyes was mostly for nicodemus but i got some of it too kincaid meant it and id seen him in action before he was one of the scarier people i knew the more so because he went about matters with ruthless practicality unhindered by personal ego or the pride one often encountered in the supernatural set kincaid wouldnt care if he looked into my eyes as he killed me if that was what he set out to do hed be just as happy to put a bullet through my head from a thousand meters away or wire a bomb to my car and read about my death on the internet the next morning whatever got the job done that kind of attitude doesnt help you when it comes to finding flashy or dramatic ways to do away with your enemies but what it lacks in aesthetics it makes up in economy marcone whom this whole mess was about worked the same way and it had taken him far you crossed such men at extreme peril nicodemus let out another quiet charming laugh he didnt look impressed by kincaid maybe that was a good thing too much pride can kill a man on the other hand from what id seen of him maybe nicodemus really was that tough run along hellhound nicodemus said your mistresss honor is quite safe he drew an x on his chest cross my heart maybe it was an inside reference kincaids eyes flashed with something hot and furious before they went glacial again he nodded to me then precisely the same way to nicodemus and left im pretty sure the room didnt actually become darker and scarier and more threatening when i was left alone with the most dangerous man id ever crossed but it sure felt that way nicodemus turned that toothy predators smile to me as his shadow began to glide around the walls of the entry hall circling me like a shark so harry he said walking closer what shall we talk about chapter twentynine y oure the one who wanted a conversation i said and dont call me harry my friends call me harry he turned one hand palm up and who is to say i cannot be your friend that would be me nick i say here ill show you i enunciated you cant be my friend if i am to call you dresden it is only fair that you should call me archleone archleone i asked as in seeking whom he may devour kinda pretentious isnt it for half of a second the smile turned into something almost genuine for a godless heathen you are entirely too familiar with scripture you know that i can kill you do you not wed make a mess i said and who knows i might get lucky really really really lucky nicodemus moved a hand in acknowledgment but barring luck yeah i said and you offer such insouciance regardless habit i said it doesnt make you special or anything believe me oh i picked the right coin for you he started to walk in a slow circle around me the way you might a car at the dealership there are rumors that a certain warden has been flinging hellfire at his foes how do you like it id like it better if it came in pine fresh and new car instead of only rotting egg i said nicodemus completed his circuit of me and arched an eyebrow you havent taken up the coin i would but its in my piggybank i said and i cant break the piggy obviously hes too cute lasciels shadow must be slipping nicodemus said shaking his head it has had years to reason with you and still you refuse our gifts what with the curly little tail and the big sad brown eyes i said as if he hadnt said anything one of his heels hit the ground with unnecessary force and he stopped walking he inhaled through his nose and out again definitely the proper coin for you he folded his hands carefully behind his back dresden you have a skewed image of us we were operating at crosspurposes the first time we met and you probably learned everything you know about us from carpenter and his cohorts the church has always had excellent propaganda actually the murder torture and destruction you and your people perpetrated spoke pretty loudly all by themselves nicodemus rolled his eyes dresden please you have done all of those things at one time or another poor cassius told me all about what you did to him in the hotel room gosh i said grinning if someone had walked in on us in the middle of that sentence would my face be red or what he stared at me for a second and the emotion and expression drained out of his features like dewdrops vanishing under a desert sunrise what was left behind was little more than desolation harry dresden he said so softly that i could barely make it out i admire your defiance of greater powers than your own i always have but tempus fugit for all of us i blinked for all of us what the hell did he mean by that have you not seen the signs around you nicodemus asked beings acting against their natures creatures behaving in ways that they should not the old conventions and customs being cast aside i narrowed my eyes at him youre talking about the black council he tilted his head slightly to one side then his mouth twitched at a corner and he nodded his head very slightly they move in shadows manipulate puppets some of them may be on your council yes as good a name as any stop playing innocent i spat at him i saw the leftovers of the black council attack on arctis tor i know what hellfire smells like one of yours was in on it nicodemus blinked then he surged forwardfast so fast that by the time id registered that he was moving my back had already hit the wall that had been twenty feet behind me he hadnt been trying to hurt me if he had the back of my head would have splattered open he just pinned me there against the wall with one hand on my throat tighter and harder than a steel vise what he demanded his voice still a whisper his eyes though were very wide both sets of them a second set these glowing faintly green had opened just above his eyebrowsanduriels i presumed ack i said glarghk his arm quivered for a second and then he lowered his eyelids until they were almost closed a moment later he very very slowly relaxed his arm allowing me to breathe again my throat burned but air came in and i wheezed for a second or two while he stepped back from me i glared up at him and debated slamming him through one of those corinthian columns by way of objecting to being manhandled but i decided that i didnt want to piss him off nicodemuss lips moved but an entirely different voice issued from themsomething musical lyrical and androgynous at least it has some survival instinct nicodemus shook his head as if buzzed by a mosquito and said dresden speak im not your friend i said my voice rough im not your damned dog either conversation over i took a few steps to one side so that i could move around him without taking my eyes off him and started to leave dresden nicodemus said stop i kept walking i was almost out of the room before he spoke again resignation in his tone please i paused without turning around ireacted inappropriately especially for this venue i apologize huh i said and looked over my shoulder now i wish i had brought michael hed have fainted your friend and his brethren are tools of an organization with its own agenda and they always have been nicodemus said but thats not the issue here no i said the issue is marcone nicodemus waved a hand marcone is an immediate matter there are longterm issues in play i turned to face him and sighed i think youre probably full of crap but okay ill bite what longterm issues those surrounding the activities of your black council nicodemus said are you certain you saw evidence of hellfire in use at the site of the attack on arctis tor yes i didnt add the word dummy who says i aint diplomatic nicodemuss fingers flexed into the shape of claws and then relaxed again he pursed his lips interesting then the only question is if the contamination is among standing members of our order or he let the thought trail off and glanced at me lifting an eyebrow i followed the logic to the only other people in possession of any of the coins someone in the church i whispered with a sick feeling in my stomach historically speaking we get about half of the coins back that way nicodemus noted what would you say if i told you that you and i might have a great many common interests in the future i wouldnt say much of anything i said id be too busy laughing in your face nicodemus shook his head shortsighted you cant afford that come with me for a week and see if you feel the same way when were done even assuming i was stupid enough to go anywhere with you for an hour much less a week i saw how you treated cassius im not real eager to slide my nameplate onto his office door he didnt adjust to the times nicodemus replied with a shrug i wouldnt have been doing him any favors by coddling him we live in a dangerous world dresden one adapts and thrives or one dies living on the largesse of others is nothing but parasitism i respected cassius too much to let him devolve to that gosh youre chatty i said you were right this is so much fun its almost like a horrible thought hit me nicodemus was many things but he wasnt a fool he knew i wasnt going to sign on for his team not after the way he treated me the last time wed met he knew that nothing he said was going to sway me i might have surprised him with that little nugget of information about arctis tor but that could have been an act too all in all odds were high that this conversation was accomplishing absolutely nothing and nicodemus had to know that so why was he having it i asked myself because the goal of the conversation doesnt have anything to do with the subject or the context of the conversation i answered he wasnt here to talk to me about anything or convince me of anything he wanted to talk to me and keep me here which meant that something else was about to happen somewhere else wheels within wheels my god it was a metaphor this conversation was a metaphor for the parley as a whole nicodemus hadnt come to talk to us about violations of the accords hed engineered the parley and his motivation had nothing to do with subverting marcones talents to the service of a fallen angel he was after bigger game i whipped my staff toward nicodemus slamming my will through it in a surge of panicked realization screaming forzare as i did unseen force lifted him from his feet and slammed him into one of the huge corinthian columns like a cannonball stone shattered with a deafening crash like thunder and a lot of rock started to fall i didnt stick around to see how much it wouldnt kill him i only hoped it would slow him down enough for me to get to the others kincaid i shouted as i ran my voice boomed through the empty halls in the wake of the collapsing rubble kincaid i knew i had only seconds before all hell broke loose kincaid get the kid out of here i screamed theyre coming for ivy chapter thirty m y brain flew along a lot faster than my feet given the heavy snow outside the first line of retreat the archive would take would be into the nevernever the spirit world touches on the mortal world at all places and at all times it gets weird once you realize that totally alien regions of the nevernever might touch upon relatively close points in the real world crossing into the nevernever is dangerous unless you know exactly where youre goingi dont use it as a fallback very often at all but if youve really got your back to the wall and you have more experience than i do at crossing over you can get a feel for the crossing and almost always get to someplace relatively benign i figured it was safe to assume that the archive would be savvy enough to feel comfortable stepping overin fact she would have chosen this location for the parley for precisely that reason the denarians would know it too and they didnt want the archive to escape their ambush and come back loaded for bear they would have prepared countermeasures much as they had for marcone no scratch that exactly the way they had for marcone i realized the huge spell that had been used to tear apart the defenses of the crime lords panic room hadnt simply been a way for the denarians to secure the bait in this scheme it had been a field test for their means to cut off the magical energy from a large area and access to the nevernever with itand to imprison something big at the same time it was a bear trap customdesigned for ivy they were going to spring that monstrous pentagram again only this time i was going to be standing inside it when it happened fortunately the shedd was a lot squattier and more stable than marcones old apartment building had beenthough that didnt mean pieces big enough to kill people wouldnt fall when the beam ripped through the walls and though a lot of stonework was used there was still the danger of fire fire in an aquarium breathe in the irony but more important once that pentagram came upand it was coming now i could feel it a faint stirring of power that slid along the edges of my wizards senses like some huge and hungry snake passing by in the darknessit was going to shut the building off from the rest of the world magically speaking that meant that i wasnt going to be able to draw in any power to use to defend myself any more than id be able to breathe if someone plunged my head underwater usually when you work a spell you reach out into the environment around you and pull in energy it flows in from everywhere from the fabric of life in the whole planet you dont create a hole in the field of energy we call magic it all pours in together levels out instantly all across the world but the circle about to go up was going to change that the relatively tiny area inside the shedd would contain only so much energy granted it would be a fairly rich spotthere was a lot of life in the building and it had hosted a lot of visitors generating a lot of emotions especially the energy given off by all those children but even so it was a sealed box and given the number of people present who knew how to use magic the local supply wasnt going to last long try to imagine a knife fight in an airtight phone boothlots of heavy breathing and exertion but not for long one way or the other not for long that was their plan of course without magic to draw upon i was pretty much just a scrappy guy with a gun whereas nicodemus was still a nighinvincible engine of destruction for a few seconds my steps slowed put that way it almost sounded a little crazy of me to be rushing into this i mean i was basically opting for a cage match with a collection of demons and one that i would have to win within a matter of seconds or not at alland i hadnt been all that impressive against the denarians when id had relatively few constraints on what power i could wield against them i did some mental math if the symbol the denarians were using was approximately the same size as the one at marcones place it would be big enough to encompass only the oceanarium itself in the pentagram at its center murphy and the others if theyd stayed where wed come in would probably be safe more to the point if theyd stayed where they were they would have no way to enter the oceanarium that meant it would be just me and ivy and maybe kincaidagainst nicodemus tessa and every denarian they could beg borrow or steal those were long odds really really long odds ridiculously long odds really when you have to measure them in astronomical units it probably isnt a good bet so going in there would be bad if i didnt go in though it would be just ivy and kincaid against all of them in a deadly business kincaid was one of the deadliest at the top of the field for centuriesbut there was only one of him ivy had vast knowledge to draw upon of course but once shed been cut off and expended whatever magic she had immediately available to her the only thing shed be able to do with all that knowledge would be to calculate her worsening odds of escape every hair on my body tried to stand up all at the same time and i knew that the symbol was being energized in seconds it would howl to life i guess in the end it came down to a single question whether or not i was the kind of man who walks away when he knows a little kid is in danger id been down this road before not going in there would be worse heat shimmers filled the air in the hall in front of me as i sprinted toward the oceanarium fight smarter not harder harry i drew in power on the waya lot of power if there wasnt going to be any magic available for the taking once the symbol went up id just have to bring my own usually i draw in power only when its ready to flow directly out of me again channeling the energy through my mind and into the structure of a spell this time i brought it in without ever letting it out and it built up as a pressure behind my eyes my body temperature jumped by at least four or five degrees and my muscles and bones screamed with sudden pain while my vision went red and flickered with spots of black static electricity crackled with every single motion of my limbs bright green and painfully sharp until it sounded like i was running across a field of bubble wrap my head pounded like every new years hangover id ever had all in the same spot and my lungs felt like the air had turned to acid i concentrated on keeping my feet underneath me and moving one step at a time i pounded through the entry to the oceanarium felt a shivering sensation as i ran right through a veil i had not sensed was there and all but barreled into a demonic figure crouched down on the floor i skidded to a stop and there was an instant of surprise as we stared at each other the denarian was basically humanoid as most of them were a gaunt even skeletal greyskinned figure spurs of bone jutted out from every joint slightly curved and wickedly pointed greasy lanky hair hung from its knobby skull to its skinny shoulders and its two pairs of eyes one very human brown and one glowing demonic green were both wide and staring in shock it was crouched amidst the preparations of a spell of some kinda candle a chalk circle on the floor a cup made from a skull and filled with waterand it wore a heavy canvas messenger bag slung across one shoulder one hand was still down in the bag as if it had been in the midst of drawing something out of it when id come charging up fortunately for me my mind had been in motion his had been tangled up in whatever spell he was doing and he was slower to get back into gear than i was so i kicked him in the face he went down with a grunt and a chip of broken tooth skittered across the floor i didnt know what spell he was getting together but it seemed a good bet that i didnt want him to finish it i broke his circle with my will as i crossed it with my body unleashing a ripple of random and diffused energies that had never had the chance to coalesce into something more coherent i knocked his skull goblet into one of the enormous nearby tanks with my staff as i raised it and pointed one end of it at the stunned denarian snarling forzare some of that searing storm of power i was holding in screamed out of my body and down through my staff hurtling at the denarian an invisible cannonball surrounded by a cloud of static discharge it was more power than id meant to unleash if it hit him it was going to throw him halfway across lake michigan but while the denarians mortal set of eyes may have still been blank with shock and surprise the glowing green set was bright with rage the thorny denarian lifted his left hand in a sweeping gesture made a rippling motion of his fingers drawing his hand toward his mouth and and he just ate my spell he ate it and then that gaunt skeletal face spread in a toothy smile that i muttered is incredibly unfair i lifted my left hand just as the denarian crouched and vomited out a spinning cloud of black threads that came whirling through the air in dozens of tiny spiraling arcs i brought up my shield but none of the threads actually came down to touch methey landed all around me instead in a nearly perfect circle and an instant later my shield stuttered and shorted out i still had the energy for iti hadnt been cut off but somehow the denarians weird spell had disrupted the magic as it left my body i tried to throw another bolt of force at him and got to feel supremely silly waving my staff around to absolutely zero effect interruptions the denarian said in an odd accent always the interruptions his left hand returned to rummaging in his bag while his mortal eyes went back to the nowscattered remnants of the spell evidently dismissing my existence the green eyes remained focused on me though and darkness suddenly gathered around the forefinger of his upraised right hand time slowed down dark light leapt toward me sheer defiance made me step forward trying to brush past the little spinning columns of shadow that surrounded me only to find them as solid as steel bars and colder than a yetis fridge i threw my magic against those bars to no avail as a shaft of dark lightning streaked toward my heart something happened i dont know how to describe it i was trying to slam another bolt of force between the bars of my conjured prison when somethingelsegot involved ever been carrying something and had someone intentionally unexpectedly jostle your elbow it felt something like thata tiny but critically timed nudge just as i threw my will into a last futile effort of defiance power screamed as it wrenched its way out of my body it shattered the blackthread bars of my prison and left a streak of metallic light on the air behind it for an instant reflective like a trail of liquid chrome it caught the falling denarian in a massive silvery simulacrum of my own fist i actually felt my fingers close over the gaunt skeletal greyskinned figure felt the numerous spurs of bone jutting from its joints press painfully into my flesh i flung it away from me with a cry and the huge silver hand flung the denarian into the nearest wall ripping through several feet of expensive stone terracing and carefully simulated pacific northwest i stared for a second first at the stunned denarian and then at my own spread fingersand at the floating silvery hand beyond mirroring my movements then the skeletal denarian gathered itself and rose fast as helluntil i shoved the heel of my hand forward and drove his bony ass six inches into the wall of rock behind him oh yeah baby i heard myself howl elated talk to the hand i picked up the thorny fiend by a leg and laughed as it raked and bit and scrabbled at the construct that held it i could feel the pain of itbut it was a small thing really something i might have gotten from a rat unpleasant as hell but id felt much much worse and it was nothing compared to the agony of the power still burning inside me i slammed him into the wall again then swung him twenty feet through the air shoved him through a pane of unbroken threeinchthick glass on the outer wall of the oceanarium drew him back through and then rammed him through the next one and the next one and the one after that cutting him to tatters as i did i had maybe half of a seconds warning as my already overloaded nerves screamed that the circle was closing that the sign was rising as i felt the surge of energy approaching from no more than a dozen yards away there was still no time for a shield so spinyboy would have to do i flung him between me and where my instinct warned me the inbound power was coming from and then there was a roar like a dozen turbine engines howling to life in synchronization thirty feet from me the walls exploded in light and hellfire heat light and sheer intangible power slammed against my senses and threw me from my feet bits of molten rock hissed through the air deadlier than any bullet spinyboy caught a bunch of those they flew out his back and left gaping smoking cauterized holes in it i could see them through the silvery haze of the construct hand that still held him could feel the heat as they bored through the construct and and then my head bumped the ground hard enough to make me see stars i rolled to my feet and nearly wobbled over the railing and into the pool with the whales i slammed the end of my staff into the ground with my left hand and leaned heavily against it panting i was still alive i still retained an agonizing amount of energy so far i thought woozily everything was going exactly according to plan the skeletal spiny denarian lay twitching on the ground ten or twelve feet in front of me there were big smoking holes in its body one of its arms was moving so was its head but its legs and its lower body were completely limp i could see the bones of its spine standing out sharply from its gaunt emaciated back two of the smoking holes intersected that spine precisely heor she i supposed if it matteredwasnt going anywhere great currents of energy eight or nine feet thick intersected maybe fifty feet away it was likelooking at the crosssection of a river in floodif the river had been made of fire instead of water and if two rivers could have intersected and passed through each other without affecting each others courses i turned my head and saw through the walls of glass that id broken more of the same beams all around the oceanarium in an unbroken wall the eerie part was that the fiery current of energy was silent absolutely silent there was no crackle of flame no roar of superheated air no hiss of steam as snow and ice melted i heard some rubble falling stone landing on stone i heard a broken electrical line somewhere spitting and snapping for a few seconds before it too went silent that was when i realized a couple of things the silver energy construct that had gripped the denarian was gone and i couldnt feel my right hand i looked down in a panic but found that it was still there at least flopping loosely at the end of my arm i couldnt feel anything below my wrist my fingers were slightly curled and didnt respond when i told them to move crap i muttered then i gathered my wits about me gripped my staff more firmly in my left hand and took several rapid steps until i stood over spinyboy then i bashed him over the head with the solid length of oak until he stopped moving immobilized wasnt the same as unconscious he wouldnt be the only one of his kind in the building and i didnt want him shouting my location to anybody the second my back was turned one down who knew how many to go i crouched in the walkway with the wall on my right the windows facing the outside of the oceanarium on my left and the beam of hellfire at my back it was the most secure position i was likely to get there was still no sound which meant that they hadnt tried to take the archive yet kincaid would not go down quietly but they were in here with me they had to be but they didnt necessarily know i was in here with them that could be an advantage maybe even a huge advantage sure harry what cat ever expects the mouse to come after it i stuffed my numb right hand in my duster pocket tried to ignore the bonedeep ache of unspent power racking my body and the limbweakening tremors of raw terror radiating through my guts and stalked silently forward to sucker punch some fallen angels chapter thirtyone i ve read that dolphins are as smart as people ive even read one article by a researcher who claimed that her results indicated that the dolphins shed been working with had been throwing the tests and it had taken us years to realize itthat in fact they might be smarter than us id read other positions that said that they were quite a bit dumber than that being as how id never really sat down for a game of checkers with a dolphin my own personal meter for such things i didnt really have an opinion until that day in the shedd that was when those ugly little dolphins swam by me in perfect silence except for the swish of their dorsal fins breaking the surface to get my attentionand then raised holy hell seventy feet farther down the path beside the pool around the curve and out of my sight splashing and chattering and squeaking for all they were worth i stared stupidly for about half a second before the message got through bad guys sighted and close evidently the aquatic americans had decided that i was on the home team as quickly as the chattering had begun it ended the dolphins vanishing beneath the surface i heard a creaking skittering sound and instinct drew my face up shadows moved on the snowcovered glass roof of the oceanarium more of nicodemuss plan in delaying me became clear hed needed time to let his people get into position within and atop the building once hed been able to determine generally where the archive was within the aquarium i threw myself into the heavy ferns planted next to the footpath beside the outer pools crouching down in the thickest bunch of greenery i could find i held on hard to the power id drawn into me and hoped i could make my sucker punch last for more than a single hit a breath later glass shattered and fell dark inhuman forms dropped silently from overhead i picked the outermost of the invading denarians the one farthest from the center of action and attention pointed my staff at him from my hiding spot amidst the green and snarled forzare unleashing a moderate effort of will invisible force caught the shapeshifted fiend as he was falling i never got much of a look at him beyond the fact that he had a lot of muscle and a ridge of leathery plates running down his spine muscle doesnt do you any good in free fall no matter how many fallen angels youve got inside you unless youve got some wings to put it to use youre in the hands of mother earth and sir isaac newton i wasnt trying to smash him into the middle of the lake i applied just enough force to alter his trajectory shoving the falling denarian thirty feet off course and he landed in one of those beams of titanic energy there was a flash of white light a brief shadow of a human skeleton burned onto my vision and then a whitehot something went spinning out from the beam it landed in one of the pools in an angry gush of steam the dolphins darted away from it then i froze not moving denarians fell like rain more than a dozen of them landing with heavysounding thumps and a couple of splashes and a splat one of them a lizardlooking thing had fallen into the foliage behind me and not five feet from my hiding spot with about twothirds of its head simply missing from its shoulders it twitched wildly for several seconds pumping very humanlooking blood all over the place before it slowly went still and simply started draining my eyes tracked up to the roof and found a darkened corner kincaid hung in it like a spider suspended from some sort of harness and perfectly still and i realized that hed had the same idea i had remove them before theyd realized that the battle was well and truly begun while they were still holding back all their power to unleash in concentration he gave me a grim little smile moved his head in an after you sort of gesture and raised a rifle sporting a heavy outsized silencer to his cheek kincaid had once informed me quite calmly that if he ever wanted to kill me it would be with a rifle from more than a mile away this was more like a hundred feet maybe less but kincaid had dropped the denarian with a shot to the head maybe more than one while it fell to the ground amidst a shower of broken glass he was deadly as hell and he could just as easily be coming after me as my enemies but somehow my terror had dwindled to something familiarand ferocious sure i might be outnumbered but i was no longer at all certain that i was outclassed when the fallen were calling the shots they were arrogant to the extreme and they werent at all used to playing it by ear and adjusting to changes in the tempo when the coin bearers were running things they could be more dangerousbut no more so than anyone else i had crossed metaphorical swords with nicodemus then was dangerous because he was nicodemusnot because of a fallen angel or a lack of one and while i would be a fool to think him anything less than a deadly threat i had survived him once and seen the trap coming this time even if it had been at the last minute i spared a glance for the splattered twitching remains of the decapitated denarian in the ferns these creeps might have scary angels looking over their shouldersbut for the next couple of minutes at least so did i it didnt make them any less dangerous it just made me see that i had a chance of standing up to them no flash and thunder then i had no energy to spare for them no wasted time either i rose and stole through the ferns toward where i thought the nextnearest denarian had come down up a steep hillside that was murder to move over silently the denarian who had landed hadnt stayed immobile though i found the spread talon prints in the earth where it had touched down like those of a turkey but larger i froze as water splashed off to my right from the corner of my eye i saw a denarian haul herself out of the water of the dolphin poolmantis girl tessa she pulled herself over the pedestrian guardrail moving fast and warily i saw a flash of silver in the talons of one hand shed recovered the coin of the denarian id shoved into the beam she knew they werent alone i didnt have much in the way of cover between her and me but i didnt move and i didnt think she spotted me mantis girl landed on the concrete and vanished down the path and out of my sight something let out a chittering monkeylike sound from somewhere in the vast room but other than that everything remained silent i ghosted forward again straining to hear where was the drama where were the explosions the howling screams the deafening sound track this was just one big eerie game of hideandseek which i suddenly realized must have been the archives counterstrategy the energy output of the enormous symbol was too high to maintain for long if she could simply remain hidden from her enemies until the symbol could no longer be maintained she could depart at will there would then be no need for her to burn through her precious little available energy in a lastditch desperate effort to defend herselfprovided she could stay calm and focused enough to maintain a veil under these circumstances of course it would force the denarians to hunt ivyexpending their efforts on trying to pierce her veil while kincaid concentrated on isolating them and killing them while they were distracted it was a deucedly clever countertactic on the far side of the room one of the denarians started screaming a wail of agony my eyes snapped up to kincaids position he was gone a rope now dangled down over the foliage below where hed hung but hed abandoned the exposed shooting position after taking down one more enemy it would seem i found myself grinning fine if that was the game i could play too ready or not here i come i pressed on through the ferns angling over toward the amphitheater seats and dropped into a sudden crouch as the low mutter of voices came to me where is she demanded a heavy thicksounding mans voice i couldnt see the source of the voices from amidst the fake wilderness until i glanced up light and shadow played together in the room and conspired to create a reflective surface for me upon one of the panels of glass on the ceiling three of the denarians had gathered on the bleacher seats the one who spoke looked like nothing so much as a big leathery gorilla except for the goats horns and heavy claws shut up magog snarled mantis girl i cant think with you running your stupid mouth were nearly out of time magog growled she knows that snapped a third denarian i recognized this one which looked like a woman except for the reversejointed legs ending in panther claws the bright red skin and the mass of metallic tenfootlong independently moving blades in place of hair deirdre nicodemuss darling daughter she turned back to tessa but magog has a point mother scent tracking has been useless she held up a small pink sock bits of clothing with her scent on them have been scattered everywhere thats the hellhounds work magog spat bright green eyes glowing brightly over dull animalistic brown ones hes fought us before he hunts us deirdre said while she forces us to focus on piercing a veil they work too well together hes killed two of us three if you count urumviel tessa bounced the silver coin in her palm urumviels vessel may have been killed by his own idiocy she said her insectoid eyes seemed to narrow or perhaps the wizard managed to return before the sign was raised you think that pathetic sot bested father deirdre said with scorn i bristled he wouldnt need to best him you moron tessa said only to run faster and it would explain why thorned namshiel hasnt appeared as well yeah if spinyboy ever woke up it would be with one hell of a dresden hangover stick that in your pipe and smoke it deedee the wizard is nothing magog growled if the girl is not found and swiftly none of this will matter to us tessa snapped her fingers and once again did that disgusting little trick where the mouth of the mantis form opened and the head of a pretty young girl emerged smiling of course she said looking at deirdre i should have thought of it sooner deirdre tilted her head blades whispered murderously against one another at the gesture of what the entire strength of this plan is predicated upon attacking the child not the archive tessa said her smile turning vicious ignore the girl bring me the hellhound chapter thirtytwo i t took me about a second to see what mantis bitch had in mind and half that long to hate her for it ivy didnt have a family until id given one to her she hadnt even had a name shed just been the archive what she had was a world of power and responsibility and knowledge and dangerand kincaid while the archive would know that the proper decision would be to allow kincaid to die in order to protect the sanctity of the archive ivy wouldnt be making the decision with the same detached calm kincaid was the closest thing she had to family she wouldnt let them hurt him she couldnt damn them to take a little girls loneliness and use it against her like that grand schemes and sweeping plans to bring doom and darkness are all fine and scary but they at least have the advantage of being impersonal this was simple calculated cruel malice deliberately aimed at a childa childand it pissed me off deirdre was closest fine i stepped out of the ferns swept my staff in a broad backhanded swing and unleashed some of the power id been painfully holding back snarling ventas servitas a burst of wind gathered underneath deirdre lifting her out of the amphitheater seats and throwing her out over the pool like a dart shot from a childs air gun id thrown her at the nearest section of the pentagrams beam but the instant shed gone airborne those snakelike strips of her hair had fanned out like a tattered parachute and begun thrashing at the air slowing her and changing her course i didnt stop to watch where she landed magog spun before deirdres feet were more than a yard off the ground and broke into one of those diagonal simian charges coming right up the bleachers as smoothly as if theyd been level ground forget what id said about not reacting quickly magogs reaction time had been nothing if not a little less he had to have checked in at seven or eight hundred pounds and he covered the forty feet between us in the space of a couple of seconds the acceleration incredible of course reacting quickly isnt always the same thing as reacting intelligently magog looked like he was used to being an unstoppable force i brought up my shield bracelet slamming my will through it pushing most of the painful load of power still remaining to me into the barrier that sprang to life i shouted out in wordless challenge my voice thin and strained beside the deepchested bellow that magog unleashed in answer normally my shield manifests as a shimmering dome of mixed blue and silver light this time i left it transparent on the theory that what magog didnt know would hurt him the shapeshifted denarian slammed into the invisible barrier in an explosion of silver sparks and found it as immovable as the side of a mountain the force of the gorillathings charge was not simply physical though and ugly red light clung to the silver power of my defenses excess energy bled through my bracelet as heat scalding my skinbut the barrier held and magog staggered back stunned hey i said as i let the shield fall wheres an eighthundredpound gorilla sit i took a step forward and kicked him as hard as i could right in the coconuts then followed up with a stomping kick to the neck magog shrieked in agony and went tumbling back down the bleachers somewhere with lots of extra cushions i guess eh monkeyboy my instincts screamed a warning at me and i threw myself down behind the last row of bleacher seats just as mantis bitch pointed a finger at me and screamed amalbijal there was a crash of thunder a flash of light a wash of heat and a cloud of glowing splinters flew up a few feet away where a section of seating had been a second before hells bells a sorceress a damned dangerous one too i readied my shield already acutely aware of how little energy remained to me i kept it small maybe three feet across and had started to rise when i saw a shape flit into my peripheral vision above me tessa in the middle of an airborne leap she cried out again and i yelped and pulled into a tight fetal curl behind my shield as another bolt of lightning ripped through the air pressure slammed my shoulders against concrete floor light blinded me and sound deafened me leaving my world nothing but one long white tone my lungs forgot their job for a couple of seconds but my legs were on the ball scrambling to get beneath me i had just managed to sort out where i was when another deafening flash and crack hit somewhere close and flung me to the ground again and then a third i tried to keep my shield up but i couldnt see anything but yellow spots and there wasnt anything left to put into it anyway it was like walking along and suddenly finding myself without any floorwhich happened more literally a second later when i tripped over a bleacher seat and fell a couple of rows down banging myself up pretty well in the process some dazed part of me realized that id made a mistake in my assumptions tessa wasnt trying to take me out she was just trying to keep me dazed and disoriented long enough for her people to arrive that same part of me realized even more belatedly that id let myself be goaded into attacking by their words let my heart rule my decision instead of playing it smart something slapped my staff out of my hand i went for my gun only to be slammed to the ground by another terrific physical force then something like an iron bar slammed across my throat the light spots began to clear away in time for me to see a denarian id never seen before atop me this one like an androgynous naked bald statue of obsidian green eyes glowing above human eyes of bright blue a second shapeshifted creature this one covered in a shaggy coat of grey dustylooking feathers its face a grey mass of fleshy hanging tendrils had my wrists pinned to the ground tessa stood over me watching something on the far side of the room her eyes narrowed dont choke him out she snapped he cant talk if hes unconscious the obsidian statue eased up the pressure on my neck a little report tessa said we think the hellhound is hiding in the bathrooms came a strainedsounding harsh womans voice you think varthiel and ordiel are down and mckullen is dead they were searching there the exit is watched theres no way for him to escape the room their coins tessa asked recovered my lady thank you rosanna any other word weve found thorned namshiel unconscious and gravely wounded there was extensive damage all around the area in which he fell yes and yet it was done fairly quietly it seems our intelligence on our young wizard thug was faulty someone presumably mantis bitch kicked me in the ribs it hurt there wasnt much i could do about it other than try to suck in a breath very well tessa said take magog and deirdre for the hellhound take him alive do it within the next five minutes yes my lady rosanna rasped what sounded like hooves clopped away tessa stepped into view again sweetly pretty face visible atop the monstrous body she was smiling youre all kinds of feisty boy its cute the sort of thing my husband likes in his recruits she kicked me again i find it endlessly annoying personally but im willing to play nice since we might work together in the future ill give you this chance to cooperate tell me where the little girl is i wish i knew i panted that way i could exercise free will while telling you to go fuck yourself she let out a playful little laugh and reached down to tweak my broken nose okay ow they say to give a man three chances to say no she said save us both time and breath i said no twice thats three suit yourself tessa said she reached into the pocket of my duster withdrew my revolver pointed it at my head and pulled the trigger i had just enough time to gawk and think wait wait this isnt right the muzzle flashed there was a loud noise i reached for power tried to shield but there was simply nothing there nothing to use the magic was gone so it had to be someone elses spell that neatly intersected the bullets course and bounced it into the shaggyfeathered thing holding my arms my stomach sank as i realized what was happening ivy must have been there all along quietly sitting on the bleachers hidden by her veil from everything that was going on now she stood perhaps ten feet away just a young girl her expression solemnbut her eyes and cheeks were bright with tears get away from him she said quietly all of you i will not permit you to hurt him i hadnt really extended my line of thinking beyond kincaid but of all the people who had dealt with the archive id been one of the only ones to take any interest in her as anything but a font of knowledge id been the one to inquire after her personally id been the one to give her a name sad but true i was the closest thing that little girl had to a friend she couldnt have let anything happen to me either id just handed her to the denarians tessa threw back her head and loosed a long triumphant cry chapter thirtythree i vy i said in that tone you use with children who are up past their bedtime im better at it than youd think after so much time working with an apprentice get that veil back up and get out of here tessa kicked me in the ribs again hard enough to keep me from breathing much or talking at all when i want an opinion from you dresden she said ill read it in your entrails ivy took two steps forward at tessas gesture and narrowed her blue eyes for the benefit of the slow polonius lartessa i will repeat myself i will not allow you to harm him step away tessas eyes narrowed suddenly you know my name i know everything about you lartessa ivy said her tone flat passionless it was all recorded of course everything was in thessalonica in those days your fathers failing business your sale to the temple of isis if you like i could draw you a costbenefit analysis of your training versus your earnings in your first year at the temple before nicodemus came i could use charts to make it easier for you to understand and color them in with crayons i enjoy crayons i wasnt certain but it sounded like the kid was trying to give the bad guys some guff on my behalf she needed to work on her technique but it was the thought that counted if i could breathe i might have gotten a little choked up do you think im intimidated that you know where i come from child tessa snarled i know more about you than you do ivy replied her voice steady i know far more precisely than you how many youve harmed how many bad situations youve made worse cambodia colombia and rwanda most recently but whether in this century the wars of the roses or the hundred years war your story is the same stupid little story told over and over again you learned your lessons when you were a child and youve never swerved from them youre a vulture lartessa a maggot you survive on diseased flesh and rotting meat anything whole and healthy frightens you the little girl didnt see the denarian that came creeping through the ferns behind her and flung itself at her back several hundred pounds of scales and fangs ivy i choked out she had it covered there was a flash of light an overwhelming scent of ozone and fresh laundry and a silver denarius rolled away from a mound of ash that fell to the ground without ever getting within three feet of the small form of the archive the coin rolled past her on a straight line toward tessabut ivy stomped on it with one small shoe flattening it to the floor and preventing it from returning to tessas grasp tiny i said in an overblown imitation of sanyas russian accent unable to keep a crazed giggle out of my voice but fierce tessa regarded the fallen coin with a faint smile costly how many such spells do you think you can manage before you are out of energy little one ivy shrugged how many minions can you throw away how many will be willing to die for you tessa called out around her everyone make sure she knows where you are and nightmarish forms rose around the little girl huge beside her single slender little form deirdre soaked and smelling of dead fish and seawater gave me a sullen glare as she mounted the steps beside her mother the shaggyfeathered thing that still held my hands bled quietly keening under its breath it was wounded but it still kept my arms pinned magog came monkeying up over a bit of landscaping grinning an evil grin and i wondered where the hell kincaid had wandered off to the obsidian statue shifted its weight keeping one hand resting on my chesti had the feeling it could have shoved it right through to my spine if it wanted to there were half a dozen others rosanna proved to be a rather beautifullooking woman the classical demoness with scarlet skin and a goats legs complete with leathery black wings and delicately curling hornsthough her deep brown eyes were haunted beneath the demonic green glowing set she had a bag slung on a strap over her shoulder just like spinyboytessa had called him thorned namshielhad carried with him most of the others just looked big and mean in various unsettling flavors i guess even in hell its easier to find strong backs than strong brains ivy faced them and lifted her arms into a pose that vaguely resembled a defensive martial arts stance it wasnt she was preparing to manipulate defensive energies i just hadnt ever seen anyone getting ready to do two entirely separate spells in either hand at the same freaking time before two questions occurred to me at that point first if the plan was for the denarians to wear ivys magic down and then take her by main force before their trap ran out of power why werent they doing it already and second what was that hissing sound it rose up around us something i could just barely hear until i focused my senses on it tuning out the musty reek and iron bloodscent of shaggy feathers and the cold solidity of obsidian statues hand a definite steady hissing sound like air escaping from a tire or or hair spray issuing forth from a can i lifted my head twisting around enough to see through the crouched limbs of shaggy feathers which seemed to be neither arms or legs but something that served it as both like the extremities of a spider i couldnt see what it had my wrists pinned with and i didnt want to what i could see was a couple of leaves trembling on a nearby fern and a gleam of metal from somewhere near the source of the mysterious hiss gas the entire strength of this plan is predicated upon attacking the child not the archive children have very low body mass compared to adults a toxin dispersed in the air would be far more effective against ivy than one of the denariansor even a grown person all the bad guys had to do was pick something that caused unconsciousness and skewed heavily toward body mass and theyd have an ideal weapon to use against her tessa and nicodemus must have had several of their more capable lackeys carry in canisters of the stuff whatever it was then all they had to do was open the cans and wait for her to fall my thoughts flashed back to thorned namshiels spell the one hed been carrying out behind his concealing veil a detail id barely noticed at the time suddenly leapt out at me id been worried about what spell he was getting ready i should have been paying attention to where he was getting ready to cast itdirectly underneath a set of large vents hed probably been getting ready to set a wind spell in motion to keep air pumping through the vents and spreading the gas through the oceanarium could i smell something sort of mediciney had the end of my nose gone numb hells bells harry this is no time either to panic or to suddenly pass out i had to warn ivy i turned my head back toward her and caught tessas gaze halfway worked it out did you mantis girl murmured if he speaks she said presumably to obsidian statue crush his chest a weirdly modulated voice issued from the general area of the androgynous statues head yes mis and then there was a whup and a slap of air pressure against my skin and statues headand shaggy featherss tooexploded in simultaneous eruptions of distinctly different forms of gore the statue went out like some kind of faulty streetpaving machine splattering black sludge that looked like hot asphalt everywhere in a steadily spurting stream it flung itself onto its back then bounded to its hands and knees and started hammering its fists at the concrete i guess it intended to smash me i guess without a head it didnt know that it was actually six feet away and digging a hole through the bleachers and into the material beneath shaggy feathers just fell in a welter of very humanlooking smelling and tasting blood and maybe three hundred pounds of limp rubbery muscle landed on my chest ivy i screamed gas get clear and then things got noisy a series of cracking thumps came down faster than you could rapidly snap your fingers and denarians began to scream in pain and rage i was vaguely aware of them bounding left and right and saw a muzzle flash from the far side of the oceanarium at least i knew where kincaid had beengetting into a position to kill both demontaken madmen holding me down with a single freaking bullet since anything less would have meant my certain death he is nothing howled tessa tarsiel take the hellhound everyone else the girl come on harry time to pay kincaid back by getting the kid clear somehow my right hand wasnt moving much and my singed left arm didnt like it but i heaved and strained and got enough of the dead denarian off me to let me begin to squirm out from under it just as i was about to pull free a silver coin rolled out from amidst the ruined tentacles that had passed for the things head and dropped toward my face i jerked my head aside in a panic the falling coin missed touching my bare flesh by a hair and bounced off the concrete floor my left hand moved faster and smoother than i would have thought possible snapping the coin from the air on the bounce as smoothly and nimbly as if it had been whole and healthy and not burned and scarred and covered in a leather glove i looked between it and my numbtingling right hand for a quarter of a second what the hell that was not normal worry about it later harry i mean sure obviously something has happened to you but now is not the time to get distracted focus save the girl i jammed the cursed relic in my pocket hoped to god my s didnt have a hole in them and spun toward ivy i know im a wizard a cardcarrying member of the white council and all i know im a warden a certified combat expert of wizardkind a cop a soldierhave staff will kick ass if you will i thought id seen some real professionals in action the top of the wizarding game i was wrong it wasnt that ivy was slinging around a ton of power she wasnt but think about this one for a moment whats really more impressive a giant truck rumbling around on a great big old smoking engine or a little car just barely big enough to get the job done thats powered by a couple of aa batteries seven of them were going after ivy with magic and she was countering them all of them magog had charged her as he had me but she hadnt slammed him to a stop with a brick wall shed trapped him inside some kind of frictionless bubble and he was spinning uselessly in circles half an inch off the floor every motion making him spin faster whatever additional metaphysical mass hed brought to the fight hadnt cramped her style much her arms bobbing and weaving continuously between all the workings she had up flicked by the field containing him every few seconds and i swear struck his whirling snare for no reason other than to impart an additional nauseainducing vector to his spin deirdres tangle of living locks danced with purple saint elmos fire lashing out in a deadly webwork but ivy constantly cast out a spinning cats cradle of light tiny tiny threads of power that did not so much stop any of deirdres attacks as they fouled any one of her locks with others near it tangling them together into useless clumpssort of an enforced badhair day on the opposite side of ivy rosanna launched more traditional lances of flame from her open palms much like the ones i a savage pain went through my skull for a secondson of a bitch but ivy dispersed them with delicately applied wedges of air intercepting each burst of fire far enough short of her body to prevent the bloom of heat as they died from scorching herthough the two more physical denarians who strained to force their way past the barrier of snapping sparks that formed whenever they tried to get close had far less luck the hellmaids flames scorched them badly the sixth a wizened little thing that looked like a caricature of a woman carved from a dried tree root seemed to be holding the end of a rope of liquid shadow that curled like a hungry serpent darting now and then toward ivys head ivy faced it down steadily moving her head calmly in a dodge once swatting it aside with a little burst of silver energy a second later but mostly she faced an amusedlooking tessa who apparently just for the fun of it threw another thunderbolt at her now and again that told me something right there it told me tessa was no punk sorceress she was white council material herself if she could make that much flash and bang while expending that little energy either that or shed been able to hold back one whale of a lot more power than i had when she took her deep breath before the battle either way she was a bigleaguer and ivys response to the attack confirmed it each time the archive turned to fully face tessa and each time she dedicated one of her hands entirely to the defensive measure used to stop the incoming spell gulp holy moly it was one thing to have an academic appreciation that i still had a lot to learn about magic it was another to see a demonstration of exactly how much i still couldnt do in another circumstance it would be humbling in this one it was freaking terrifying for maybe ten seconds i stood there trying to figure out how the hell to help without getting myself incinerated skewered or otherwise obliterated without accomplishing anything i felt a little surge of dizziness the gas levels must be rising screw it the only reason someone hadnt killed me already was because i was so impotent at the moment that nobody gave a damn what i did i might be able to get the kid to another part of the building out of the gasand if someone killed me on the way i could try to level my death curse on them maybe get her out of this mess so i rushed toward her trying to use the hot zone and the trapped magog as shields and said ivy come on something took a swipe at me and several feet away my gun went off i ducked but i guess tessa wasnt much of a shot i didnt get hit a second later i grabbed ivy by the waist and lifted her to my hip keep clear of my arms please ivy commanded i made sure to i was getting dizzier but anywhere was better than here his legs tessa commanded i had a feeling that those people tried to do a lot of disturbing things to my pins but i didnt stop to watch them try it i ran for the stairs trusting the skill of the archive to keep me mobile it was a good bet ivy murmured and waved her arms the whole while and i felt her little body tingling with the live current of the energy she was working she was using what power she had left for all it was worth but it wasnt bottomless she was running dry this fight was almost over time i thought muzzily panting we just needed a little more time gravity suggested that i keep on going down and it seemed an excellent idea i staggered down the stairs into the lower level running past the underwater vistas of the whale and dolphin tanks past the cute penguins and the sea otters the denarians in pursuit their sorceries flashing past us while ivy shielded us with the last bits of energy in her reservoir i felt it when she ran dry and labored to keep my legs moving to keep ahead of the pursuit then the ground hit me with an uppercut everyone else in the oceanarium suddenly fell sideways or wait maybe it was me i realized belatedly that given that id been at ground level near that one container and breathing hard with pain and exertion to boot id probably given myself a nice large dose before id ever gotten up furthermore if the gas was heavier than air there was probably even more of it down here than there had been up in the bleachers i had bought us a few seconds it just hadnt been time enough ivy landed beside me she blinked and her eyes abruptly went wide with panic she lifted her arms again but they came up slowly sluggishly and her fingers stayed halfclosed like a sleepy childs the black ropespell wrapped around ivys throat and dozens of deirdres tendrils twined around her arms and legs they jerked her out of my sight i looked up to find the denarians standing as a group in the hallway lit by the eerie blue light coming in from the big tanks rosanna stared intently at ivy for a moment before she shuddered and folded her dark bat wings around herself shivering as if with cold and turned away from the scene her glowing eyes narrowed she reached into the bag and produced another canister she offered it to tessa without being prompted tessa took it twisted something on the nozzle and gave ivy a polite smile then she quite literally jammed the nozzle into the little girls mouth and held it there ivy panicked and cried out i saw her kick and twist she must have bitten her tongue or cut her lip on one of her teeth blood ran from her mouth she bucked and fought uselessly for a few seconds and then went ragdoll limp finally tessa said expelling her breath in irritation could it have been any more annoying damn you i slurred i shoved myself up to one knee and glared at tessa damn you all you cant have her clichйd tessa singsonged boring she tapped her chin with one clawhand let me see where were we when we were so rudely interrupted ah she stepped closer smiling cheerily and lifted my just then i felt the snap of magic rushing back into the oceanarium as the enormous symbol collapsed and the circle fell i took my frustration and rage and turned it into raw force screaming forzare i didnt direct it at tessa and her crew i aimed it at the glass wall that was the only thing between all of us and three million gallons of seawater the force of my will and my rage lashed out and shattered the wall into powder the sea came in with a roar one enormous impact that felt like the strike of a hammer being applied to every square inch of my body at once then it was cold and black chapter thirtyfour t he next thing i knew i was coughing and my chest hurt and my head hurt and everything else hurt and i was colder than hell i choked in a breath and felt my body getting ready to send up everything i tried to roll onto my side and couldnt until someone pulled on my coat and helped me fishy salt water and whatever had been in my stomach came out in equal proportions oh someone said oh thank you god michael then michael sanya shouted from somewhere nearby i need you work boots pounded away at a sprint easy harry murphy said easy she helped me turn back over when i was done puking i was lying at the top of the stairs to the lower level my lower legs were actually on the stairs my left foot was in cold water to the ankle i put a hand to my chest wincing murphy smoothed a hand over my head brushing hair and water away from my eyes the lines in her face looked a little deeper her eyes worried cpr i asked her my voice felt weak yeah guess were even i said like hell we are she said quietly i only spit fruit punch into your mouth i laughed weakly and that hurt too murphy leaned down and rested her forehead gently against mine you are such an enormous pain in my ass harry dont scare me like that again her fingers found mine and squeezed really tight i squeezed back too tired to do anything else something brushed my foot and i nearly screamed i sat up reaching for power raising my right hand while invisible force gathered around it in shimmering waves a corpse floated in the water nude facedown it was a man id never seen before his hair long grey and matted his limp outstretched hand had bumped against my foot jesus harry murphy said her voice shaking hes dead harry its okay hes dead harry my right hand remained where it was fingers outspread ripples of light flickering over them then they started shaking i lowered my hand again releasing the power id gathered and as i did i felt my fingers tingle and go numb once more i stared at them puzzled that wasnt right i was fairly sure that i should be a lot more worried about that than i was at the moment but i couldnt put together enough cohesive thought to remember why murphy was still talking her voice steady and soothing i dimly realized a minute later that it was the tone of voice you use with crazy people and frightened animals and that i was breathing hard and fast despite the lack of any exertion to explain it its all right harry she said hes dead you can let go of me that was when i realized that my left arm had pulled murphy tight against me drawing her across my body and away from the corpse as id gotten ready to dowhatever it was i had been about to do she was at the moment more or less sitting across my lap wherever she was touching me i was warm it took me a moment to figure out exactly why it was a good idea to let her go eventually though i did murphy slid carefully away from me shaking her head god she said what happened to you harry what did they do to you i slumped too tired to move my foot out of the water too tired to try to explain that id failed to stop the demons from carrying away a little girl after a moment of silence murphy said thats it im getting you to a doctor i dont care who these people think they are they cant just waltz into town and tear apart my she broke off suddenly hngh what do you make of this harry she took a step down into the water and bent over no i snapped she froze in place jesus those things get predictable i muttered silver coin just fall out of the corpses fingers murphy blinked and looked at me yes evil cursed dont touch it i shook my head and stood up the wall had to help me but i made it all the way up thinking out loud on the way okay weve got to make sure theres no more of these lying around first thing im already carrying one we limit the risk i carry them all for now until they can be properly disposed of harry murphy said in a steady voice youre mumbling and whats coming through is making a limited amount of sense ill explain bear with me i bent over and found another stained denarius gleaming guiltily in the water moron i muttered at the coin then picked it up with my gloved hand and put it in my pocket along with the other one in for a penny in for a pound ah hah hah damn im clever footsteps sounded brisk and precise and luccio walked into view beside gard there was a subtle difference in gards body language toward luccio something a shade more respectful than was there before the captain of the wardens was wiping her sword clean on her grey cloakblood wouldnt stain it which made it handy for such things luccio paused for a moment upon seeing me her expression carefully guarded then nodded warden how are you feeling ill live i rasped what happened two denarians gard replied she nodded her head briefly to luccio both dead luccio shook her head theyd been halfdrowned she said i only finished them off i shouldnt have liked to fight them fresh take me to the bodies i said quietly hurry there was a sighing sound from behind us i didnt freak out about it this time but murphy did her gun appearing in her hand to be fair luccio had her sword half out of its sheath too i checked and found what id more or less expected the body of the former denarian relieved of its coin was decomposing with unnatural speed even in the cold water the fallen angel in the coin might have been holding off the ravages of time but the old man with the hourglass is patient and he was collecting his due from the fallen denarian with compounded interest captain weve got to get every single coin we possibly can and weve got to do it now luccio cocked her head at me why look i dont know what arrangements kincaid made but somebody is going to notice something soon and then emergency services will be all over this place i dont want some poor fireman or cop accidentally picking up one of these things true enough she said noddingand then glanced at murphy sergeant do you concur murphy grimaced dammit theres always something she held up her hands as if pushing away a blanket that was wrapped too tightly around her and said yes yes round them up michael i said sanya when we got here murphy said a bunch of those things were pulling you out of the water they ran we went different directions pursuing them gard supplied wheres cujo i asked gard gave me a blank look hendricks ah she said lookout hell give us a warning when the authorities begin to arrive at least someone was thinking like a criminal i suppose she was the right person for the job i raised my voice as much as i could it came out sort of furry and rough michael here came the answer he came walking around the curving path toward us a few moments later wearing only his undershirt beneath his heavy denim jacket i hadnt seen him wearing that little before michael had some serious pecs maybe i should work out he was carrying with both hands part of his blueandwhite denim shirt folded into a careful bundle in front of him sanya came along behind michael soaking wet his chest bare underneath his coat never mind michaels pecs sanya made us both look like we needed to eat more wheat germ or something he was carrying esperacchius and amoracchius over one shoulderand kincaid over the other kincaid wasnt moving much though he was clearly trying to support some of his weight his skin was chalk white he was covered in blood the rest of michaels shirt and both of sanyas had been pressed into service as emergency bandagesand layers of duct tape had been wrapped around and around them sealing them into place around both arms over his belly and around one leg murphy hissed and went to him her voice raw jared jared huh dresden kincaid gasped dresden they laid him down and i shambled over i managed not to fall down on him as i knelt beside him id seen him wounded before but it hadnt been as bad as this hed used the tape the same way though i checked sure enough there was a roll of tape hanging from a loop on kincaids equipment harness just like the vampire lair i said quietly no claymores here kincaid said should have had claymores he shook his head and blinked his eyes a couple of times trying to focus them dresden not much time the girl they got out with her shes alive i grimaced and looked away his bloody hand shot out and seized the front of my coat look at me i did i expected rage hate and blame all i got was a look ofjust desperate desperate fear go after them bring her back save her kincaid i said softly swear it he said his eyes went out of focus for a second then glittered coldly swear it or im coming for you swear it to me dresden im too damned tired to be scared of you i said kincaid closed his eyes she doesnt have anybody else no one murphy knelt down by kincaid across from me she stared at me for a moment then said quietly jared rest hes going to help her i traded a faint tired smile with murphy she knows me but kincaid began she leaned down and kissed his forehead blood and all hush i promise kincaid subsided or passed out one of the two dresden get out of the way gard said in a patient voice dont tell me youre a doctor i said ive seen more battlefield injuries than any bonesawflourishing mortal hack gard said move harry murph said her voice tight please i creaked to my feet and shambled over to michael and sanya who stood looking out at the dolphins and the little whales in the big pool the water level had dropped seven or eight feet and the residents were giving the newly inundated area of the pool a wide berth if the presence of the rotting thing behind me made the water feel anything like the air was starting to smell i couldnt blame them he looks pretty bad i told them michael shook his head his eyes distant it isnt his time yet i spocked an eyebrow and gave him a look sanya gave him one very nearly as dubious as mine michael glanced at me and then back out at the water i asked uhhuh i said quietly sanya smiled faintly and shook his head i glanced at him still agnostic huh some things i am willing to take on faith sanya said with a shrug luccio took down two i told michael whats the count i didnt need to be any more specific than that sanyas grin broadened that is the good news i turned to face sanya those assholes just carried off a child that they plan to torture into accepting a fallen angel i said quietly there isnt any good news the big russians expression sobered good is where you find it he seriously eleven michael said quietly i blinked at him what eleven he repeated eleven of them fell here today judging from the wounds kincaid killed five of them captain luccio killed two more sanya and i caught a pair on the way out one of them was carrying a bag with the coins of those who had already fallen we found the coin of urumviel which we knew to be in possession of a victim sanya said but we were short by one body that one was mine i said hes tiny pieces of soot and ash now and that only brings us to ten one more drowned when that tank collapsed michael said theyre floating down there eleven of them harry he shook his head eleven do you realize what this means that if we whack one more we get the complimentary steak knives he turned to me his eyes intent and bright tessa escaped with only four other members of her retinue and nicodemus was nowhere to be found we have recovered thirteen coins alreadyand eleven more today assuming we can find them all only six coins remain free to do harm sanya said only six those six are the last and they are all here in chicago together the fallen in the coins have been waging a war for the minds and lives of mankind for two thousand years harry michael said and we have fought them that war could end it could all be over he turned back to the pool and shook his head his expression that of a man baffled i could go to alicias softball games teach little harry to ride a bicycle i could build houses harry the longing in his voice was so thick i could practically feel it brushing against my face lets round up the coins and get out of here before the flashing lights show up i said quietly michael open up the bundle he frowned at me but did revealing disks of tarnished silver i drew the pair of coins id found from my pocket with my gloved hand and added them to the pile thanks i said lets get moving i turned and walked away as michael folded the cloth closed around the coins again his eyes distant presumably focused on some dream of shoving those coins down a deep dark hole and living a boring simple normal life with his wife and kids i let him have it while he could i was going to have to take that dream away from him dammit whether he wanted to go along with the idea or not chapter thirtyfive i slept in the cab of michaels truck all the way back to his place leaning against the passengerside window sanya had the middle seat i was dimly aware that they were speaking quietly to each other on the way home but their voices were just low rumbles especially sanyas and i tuned them out until the truck crunched to a halt it doesnt matter michael was saying in a patient voice sanya we dont recruit members were not a chapter of the masons its got to be a calling we act in the interests of god on a daily basis sanya said in a reasonable voice if he is being slow to call a new wielder for fidelacchius perhaps it is a subtle hint that he wishes us to take on the responsibility for ourselves dont you keep assuring me you are undecided on whether or not god exists michael asked i am speaking to you in your idiom to make you comfortable sanya said she would make a good knight michael sighed perhaps the reason no new wielder has been called is because our task is nearly complete perhaps one isnt needed sanyas voice turned dry yes perhaps all evil everywhere is about to be destroyed forever and there will be no more need for the strength to protect those who cannot protect themselves he sighed or perhaps he began glancing at me he saw me blinking my eyes open and hurriedly said dresden how are you feeling nothing a few days in a hospital a new set of lungs a keg of macs dark and a pair of feisty redheads couldnt cure i mumbled i tried for cavalier but it came out a little flatter and darker than id meant it to ill live michael nodded and parked the truck when do we go after them we dont i said quietly theyve developed some kind of stealth defense against being found or scried upon magically michael frowned are you sure im sure its really hard to defeat someone you cant find michael i rubbed at my eyes and all but slapped my own hand away it hurt so much ow stupid broken nose stupid tessa tweaking it you need to get some sleep harry michael said quietly and perhaps a shower sanya suggested you smell like dolphin water too big guy i shot back but not nearly so much he said and i didnt throw up on myself i glowered at him for a second isnt sanya a girls name michael snorted get some sleep first harry after i said first things first war council in the kitchen and if someone doesnt make me a cup of coffee im going to shimmy dry all over everything like mouse mouse is too polite to do that in my house michael said like somebody elses dog then i said crap i forgot my staff michael swung out of the truck reached into the bed of the pickup and lifted my staff out of it i got out and he tossed it to me across the back of the truck i caught it in my left hand and nodded to him bless you its a real pain to make one of these way harder to carve out than uh i shook my head as my thoughts wandered offtrack sorry long day get inside before you take a chill michael said quietly good idea we trooped in the others arrived over the next twenty minutes or so gard had insisted on taking kincaid by one of marcones buildingsprobably someplace where he kept medical supplies for those times when he didnt want the police wondering why his employees came in with gunshot or knife wounds to my amusement murphy had insisted on accompanying kincaidwhich meant that the cops were about to learn the location of another of marcones secret stashes maybe even the name of whatever doctor he had on his payroll and since it was murphys car and murphy was with me and gard needed my help there wasnt diddly gard could do about it thats my murphy manufacturing her own damned silver lining when the clouds didnt cough one up mouse was delighted to see me and greeted me with much fond twitching and bumping against my legs and tail wagging he at least thought i merely smelled interesting molly greeted us with only slightly less enthusiasm and immediately set about making food for everyone it turns out that molly wasnt her mothers daughter in that respect charity was like the macgyver of the kitchen she could whip up a fivecourse meal for twelve from an egg two spaghetti noodles some household chemicals and a stick of chewing gum molly molly once burned my egg my boiled egg i dont know how she could however make a mean cup of coffee once kincaid had been settled down on the guest bed in charitys sewing room everyone else gathered in the kitchen murphy looked strained i poured her a cup of joe and she came to stand next to me i offered luccio one as well she accepted with a small grateful nod how is he she asked murphy sleeping murphy said gard got him some painkillers i guzzled coffee fighting off a round of chills okay people heres the situation we are bent over greased up and nicodemus and his crew are about to drive one of those japanese bullet trains right up our collective ass the room went quiet they took ivy i said thats bad harry murphy said i know im the new kid but youre going to have to explain this thing with the little girl to me again ivy is the archive i said quietly a long time agowe dont know whensomebodywe dont know whocreated the archive a kind of intellectual construct what sanya asked a kind of entity composed of pure information think of it as software for the brain luccio said like a very advanced database management system ah sanya said nodding i arched an eyebrow at luccio in surprise she shrugged smiling a little i like computers i read all about them itsmy hobby really i understand the theory behind them right i said ahem okay the archive is passed from one generation to the next mother to daughterall the memories of the previous bearers of the archive and all the facts they have gathered all that knowledge makes the archive powerfuland it was created as a repository of learning a safeguard against the possibility of a cataclysm of civilization a loss of all knowledge the destruction of all learning it was bound to neutrality to the preservation and gathering of knowledge gathering murphy said sothe archive reads a lot it goes deeper than that i said the archive is a magic so complex that its practically aliveand it just knows anything that gets printed or written down the archive knows hendricks said a bad word sideways i agreed thats what nicky and the nickelheads have taken with that kind of information at their disposal murphy said they couldmy god they could blackmail officials control governments launch nuclear warheads i said stop thinking so small i nodded at michael remember you told me that nicodemus was playing armageddon lotto he makes big plans but he plots them out so that he can make an incremental profit along the way this was just one more scheme michael frowned he was after the archive all along he deliberately came here and provoked a confrontation to get you to call her in to arbitrate that isnt much of a plan luccio said you could have chosen any one of a dozen neutral arbiters murphy snorted but its dresden hes lived in the same apartment since i first met him drives the same car drinks at that same little pub favorite restaurant is burger king he gets the same damned meal every time he goes there too you cant improve on perfection i said thats why its called perfection and whats your point youre a creature of habit harry you dont like change there wasnt much use denying that even if i hadnt called ivy nicodemus still could realize some gains maybe recruit marcone maybe kill off michael or sanya maybe ditch some deadwood within his own organization who knows the point is i did call ivy in he did get the opportunity to take her down and it paid off but the archive was created neutral sanya said constrained you said so yourself the archive was i said but ivy wasnt and ivy controls the archive shes still a child that child can be hurt frightened coerced tempted i rubbed at the spot between my eyes they want to make her one of them probably hoping to gobble up marcone along the way god help us if theyre taken murphy said quietly god help them if theyre taken michael murmured we have to find them harry not even mab could locate the denarians with magic i said gard could your firm do any better she shook her head i glanced at michael i dont suppose anyones drawn a big flashing arrow in the sky for you two to see michael shook his head his expression sober i looked okay then barring divine intervention we have no way of finding them i took a deep breath so were going to make them find us that would be a good trick if we could do it sanya said what did you have in mind hendricks lifted his head suddenly coins everyone turned to stare at him hendricks counted on his fingers for a second they only got six and six people so how they gonna get the creepy little girl a coin or one for the boss good thinking cujo i said itll only hurt for a minute but weve got to move fast to make it work nicodemus cant afford to throw away any more manpower but his conscience wont hesitate for one ittybitty second to kill one of his own people for their coin if it comes to that so were going to offer him a trade eleven old nickels in exchange for the girl michael and sanya both came to their feet in an instant speaking loudly and in two different languages it was hard to make out individual words but the gestalt of their protest amounted to are you out of your mind dammit all michael i said swinging around to face him thrusting out my jaw if nicodemus manages to take the archive it wont matter how many of the damned coins you have locked away silence the clock in the entry hall ticked very loudly i didnt back down right now six demons are torturing an elevenyearold girl the same way they tortured me the same way they tortured shiro michael flinched look me in the eye i told him and tell me you think that we should let that child suffer when we have the means to save her tick tock tick tock michael shook his head sanya subsided sinking back to lean against a cabinet again his expression pensive and solemn nicodemus will never accept that trade michael said quietly luccio smiled showing a lot of teeth of course he will why sacrifice a useful retainer when he can show up for the exchange doublecross us steal the coins and keep the archive bingo i said and well be ready for him captain do you know how to contact him through the channels outlined in the accords yes she said harry michael said gently were taking a terrible risk he and luccio exchanged a glance pregnant with silence swayed by deep undercurrents at this point luccio said the only riskier thing we can do is she shrugged and spread her hands nothing michael grimaced and crossed himself god be with us amen sanya said winking over michaels shoulder at me call nicodemus i said tell him i want to make a deal chapter thirtysix i t takes time to go through channels the last thing i wanted to do was get wet again but i was still freezing and shaky and as it turns out there are a number of other inconvenient and unpleasant side effects to accidentally gulping down gallons of salt water its the little things that get to you the most it took me a couple of hours to get my system straightened out get showered and get horizontal and by the time i finally did it i was so tired that i could barely focus my eyes molly was committing dinner by that time aided and abetted by sanya who seemed to take some kind of grim russian delight in watching train wrecks in progress i fell down on the couch to debate whether or not i wanted to risk putting anything else in the pipes and rip van winkled my way right through the danger i didnt want to wake up i was having a dream where i wasnt hurt and no one was kicking me around the walls were white and smooth and clean lit only by frosty moonlight and someone with a gentle voice was speaking quietly to me but my right hand had broken into fierce tingling all pins and needles and sleep began to retreat i started to wake slowly voices murmured in the room can she possibly be sure murphy demanded in a heated whisper it isnt my area of knowledge michael rumbled back maam luccios tone was cautious it is a delicate area of the art she said but the girl does have a gift then we need to say something you cant molly said her tone quiet and sad it wouldnt help it might make things worse and you know that murphy demanded you know that for a fact i was so tired id probably missed a sentence or three in there i blinked my eyes open and said muzzily the kid knows what shes talking about i fumbled about and found mouse lying on the floor beside the couch immediately under my arm i decided sitting up could wait for a minute what are we talking about molly gave murphy a look that said there see murphy shook her head and said im going to see if kincaid is awake yet she left her expression set in stony displeasure mouse set about industriously licking my right hand a canine grooming ritual he sometimes pursued it broke up the pins and needles a bit so i didnt argue i still had no idea what was up with my hand id never heard of anything like this happening to anyonebut it wasnt terribly uncomfortable and all things considered it wasnt anywhere near the top of my priority list at the moment nobody answered my question though the silence got awkward i coughed uncomfortably uh anyone know what time it is almost midnight luccio said quietly i waited for a minute but apparently no one was going to do me a favor and knock me unconscious again so i did my best to ignore the aches and pains and sat up whats the word from nicodemus he hasnt returned our call luccio said not really a surprise i muttered raking my fingers through my hair id gone to sleep wearing one of michaels old pairs of sweats and one of his tshirts so my ankles stuck way out and both shirt and sweats fit me as well as a tent whatever theyre doing to keep ivy restrained its got to be pretty elaborate id hold my calls until i was sure it was solid too as would i luccio agreed is she really that dangerous michael asked yes luccio said calmly the council regards her as a significant power in her own right on par with the youngest queens of the sidhe courts if anything i think that profile in the wardens files underestimates her i said quietly she had barely anything to work with and she was making tessa and her crew look like pygmies trying to capture an elephant if she hadnt been cut off so entirely i think shed have eaten them alive luccio frowned disturbed truly you had to have seen it i said ive never seen anyoneyou had to have seen it if shes that powerful michael said quietly can she be contained oh yes i said absolutely but it would take a greater circleheavyduty ritual stuff in a prepared location and it would have to be freaking flawless or she could break it molly screwed up her face in distress she wontwont take one of the coins will she she glanced back and forth between luccio and me and shrugged a little becauseit would be bad if she did i looked at michael the fallen cant just jump in and overwhelm someone can they outright nonconsensual possession not normally michael replied there are circumstances that can change that though mentally damaged people can be susceptible to it other things can open a spirit to possession drugs involvement with dark rituals extended deliberate contact with spiritual entities a few other things drugs i said tiredly jesus michael winced sorry even if a soul is made vulnerable to assault michael said the mind and will can fight against an invasive spirit surely the archive qualifies as a formidable mind and will sure but that doesnt necessarily mean that ivy does since she was born shes been the archive shes never had a chance to develop her own mind her own personality i stood up shaking my head and started to pace restlessly around the room shes going to be helpless probably for the first time since she could walk alone scared i looked at michael you think that thosepeoplewont know how to terrify a little girl he grimaced and bowed his head and then along comes the fallen and tells her how it can help her how it wants to be her friend how it can make the bad people stop hurting her i shook my head and clenched my hands maybe shell know the facts but those facts arent going to be much comfort to her they arent going to feel tr i blinked and looked at michael then molly then i stormed past them into the kitchen and grabbed the pad of paper charity kept stuck to the fridge with a magnet to use to make grocery lists i found a pencil on top of the fridge and sat down at the kitchen table writing furiously ivy you are not alone kincaid is alive im all right were coming after you dont listen to them hang on were coming you are not alone harry oh said molly reading over my shoulder thats clever if it works luccio said will she know it i dont know i said but i dont know what else i can do i rubbed at my forehead is there any food i made pot roast molly said but is there any food she swatted me on the back of the head though not too hard and went to the refrigerator i made a sandwich out of things im an american we can eat anything as long as its between two pieces of bread with enough mustard i almost couldnt taste the roast for a few minutes i paid attention to eating and was hungry enough to actually enjoy part of the experiencethe part where mollys pot roast finally terrified my growling stomach into silence the phone rang michael answered he listened for a moment and then said gently it isnt too late to seek redemption not even for you someone laughed merrily on the other end of the phone just a moment michael said a breath later he turned holding his hand over the phone and said harry him i said michael nodded i went to the phone and took it from him dresden im impressed dresden nicodemus said i expected the hellhound to make a good showing of course but you surprised me your skills are developing quite rapidly tessa is furious with you im tired i replied do you want to talk deal or not i wouldnt have called otherwise nicodemus replied but lets keep this a bit simpler shall we just you and me i have no desire to drag chicagos underworld or the rest of the white council into this ugly little affair mutually guaranteed safe passage of course we did that once i said and despite the fact that you betrayed the neutrality of the meeting well before i or any of my people took actionwhich i take as a highly promising act on your parti am willing to extend my trust to you once more i bit out a little laugh yeah youre a saint one day nicodemus said one day but for now lets say a facetoface meeting a talk just you and i so you and your posse can jump me alone no thanks come now as you say i do want to talk deal if youre willing to extend your word of safe passage we can even have it on your own ground oh i asked and where would that be it doesnt matter to me as long as i dont have to be seen with you while youre wearing that ridiculous borrowed ensemble the hairs on the back of my neck started crawling up into my hairline i turned my head around very slightly the windows to the carpenters backyard had blinds and curtains but neither was wholly drawn the kitchen lights made the windows into mirrors i couldnt see beyond them what is it going to be dresden nicodemus asked will you give me your word of safe passage for our talk or shall i have my men open fire on that lovely young lady at the kitchen sink i glanced over my shoulder to where molly was drying dishes she watched me out of the corner of her eye clearly interested in the discussion but trying not to look like it i couldnt possibly warn anyone before nicks men could open fireand i believed that he had them there probably up in the tree house it had a reasonably good view of the kitchen all right i said speaking so that everyone there could hear me im giving you my word of safe passage for ten minutes and hope to die nicodemus prompted i gritted my teeth at the rate were going someone will he laughed again keep the subject matter of this conversation between you and i and it wont have to be anyone in the kitchen the phone disconnected a beat later someone knocked at the front door mouses growl rumbled through the whole house even though hed remained in the front room harry michael asked i found my shoes and stuffed my bare feet into them im going out to talk to him keep an eye on us but dont do anything if he doesnt start it and watch your back the last chat with him was a distraction i stood up pulled on my duster and picked up my staff i met michaels eyes and said watch your back michaels head tilted slightly then he looked past me to the windows to the backyard be careful i took my shield bracelet out of my duster pocket and fastened it on wincing as it went over the mild burns on my wrist you know me michael im always careful i walked to the front door and looked out the window the lights on the street were all out except for the streetlight in front of michaels house nicodemus stood in the center of the street outside his shadow stretched out long and dark to one side of himthe side opposite the one it should have been on given the position of the light mouse came to my side and planted himself there firmly i rested my hand on my dogs thick neck for a moment searching the darkness outside for anything or anyone else i saw nothingwhich meant nothing really anything could be out there in the dark but the only thing i knew was out there was a scared little girl lets go i said to mouse and stalked out into the snow chapter thirtyseven i t was snowing again five or six inches had fallen since the last time anyone cleared the carpenters front walk my footsteps crunched through the silent winter air you could have heard them a block away nicodemus waited for me stylishly casual in a deep green silk shirt and black trousers he watched me come with a neutral expression his eyes narrowed i shivered when a breath of cold wind touched me and my weary muscles threatened to go out of control dammit i was the one working for the winter queen so how come everyone else got to be perfectly comfortable in the middle of a blizzard i stopped at the end of michaels driveway and planted my staff on the ground nicodemus stared silently at me for a while the shadows had shifted to mask his expression and i couldnt see his face very well what he said in a low deadly tone is that mouse stared at nicodemus and let out a growl so low that individual snowflakes jumped up off the ground all around him my dog bared his teeth showing long white fangs and his snarl rose in volume hells bells id never seen mouse react like that except in earnest combat and it looked like nicodemus didnt like mouse much either answer my question dresden nicodemus growled what is that a precaution against getting stuck in deep snow i said hes training to be a saint bernard excuse me nicodemus said i mimed covering one of mouses ears with my hand and stagewhispered dont tell him that they dont actually carry kegs of booze on their collars break his little heart nicodemus didnt move but his shadow shifted until it lay in a shapeless little pool between him and mouse his face came into view again and he was smiling its been a little while since anyone was quite that insolent to my face may i ask you a question why not do you always retreat into insouciance when youre frightened dresden i dont think of it as retreating i think of it as an advance to the cheer may i ask you a question the smile widened oh why not how come some of you losers seem to have personal names and the others just get called after the fallen in the coin it isnt complicated nicodemus said some of our order are active willing minds with strength enough to retain their sense of self others arehe shrugged a shoulder an elegant arrogant little motionof little consequence disposable vessels and nothing more like rasmussen i muttered nicodemus looked puzzled for a moment then his eyes narrowed suddenly focusing intently upon me his shadow stirred again and something made a noise that sounded like a disturbingly serpentine whisper oh yes ursiels vessel precisely he looked past me to the house have your friends begun whispering behind your back yet they sure as hell had though i had no idea why i hung on to my poker face why would they try to imagine the aquarium from their point of view they enter a building with you along with someone they would not normally bring alongbut you have insisted that the police detective accompany your group as a result you walk away to a private conference with just you me and the archives guard dog then the sign goes up and they can hear a terrible conflict raging they race to the scene as quickly as possible and find my people dragging you out of the waterto take back the coin you had in your pocket but your friends had no way of knowing that they find the archive gone her bodyguard wounded or dead and you being apparently assisted by my people and they never saw what happened nicodemus continued to a suspicious mind you might seem an accomplice to the act i swallowed i doubt that oh nicodemus said even though youre about to propose giving me back the coins you took at the aquarium eleven coins dresden should i recover them everything you and your people have done during the past few days will mean nothing ill be just as strong and possess the power of the archive to boot it is hardly a stretch to consider that you would be ideally positioned to betray them at a critical momentwhich this is ihadnt thought of it like that what if hes finally falling to the influence of her shadow theyre thinking what if hes not wholly in control of his own decisions theyre thinking treachery is a more dangerous weapon than any magic dresden ive had two thousand years to practice arranging it and your friends the knights know it suddenly michaels attitude began to make a lot more sense and the pot roast fought to come back up i tried to keep my poker face but it wouldnt stick ouch nicodemus said his eyes widening after all those years of baseless suspicion and hostility from your own council that must be a painful realization he smirked at mouse and then at me your little heart must be breaking mouse pressed his shoulder against my leg and snarled savagely at nicodemus taking a step forward nicodemus ignored him his focus all on me its a tempting offer he said exchanging the coins for the archive presenting me with an opportunity to walk away with every jewel in the vault its something i can hardly ignore welldone so i said where do you want to set it up he shook his head i dont he said quietly this is endgame dresden even if you and yours cant accept it once i have the archive the rest is simply an exercise losing the coins will hurt true but i dont need them thorned namshiel is of no real use to me in his current condition and i havent worked for two thousand years only to take a gamble at the last second no deal i swallowed then why are you here to give you a chance to reconsider nicodemus said i think you and i are not so very different both of us are creatures of will both of us live our lives for ideals not material things both of us are willing to sacrifice to attain our goals maybe we should wear matching outfits he spread his hands i could be an ally far more effective and dangerous than any you have now im willing to compromise with you and make some of your goals my own i can provide you with support beyond anything your own council has ever done for you the material gain of such a partnership is a passing matter ultimately but wouldnt you enjoy living in something other than a musty basement dont you get tired of coming home to cold showers cheap food and an empty bed i just stared at him a great deal of work needs to be done and not all of it is repugnant to you in fact i should imagine that some of it would prove to be quite satisfying to your personal sense of right and wrong to hell with the poker face i sneered at him like what the red court is one example nicodemus said theyre large well organized dangerous to my plans a plague upon mankind and aesthetically repugnant theyre parasites who are inconvenient in the short term dangerous in the middle distance and fatal to any longrange plan they need to be destroyed at some point in any case i should have no objection to giving my assistance to you and through you to the white council in their efforts to do so make the council into catspaws to wipe out the red court i asked as if you have not been made into their tool on many occasions the council doesnt need my help to be a bunch of tools i muttered and yet the reversal appeals to your sense of justice as does the notion of visiting destruction upon the red court especially given what they did to susan rodriguez he tilted his head to one side it may be possible to help her you know if anyone might know of a means to free her of her condition it is the fallen why not just offer me floating castles and world peace while youre at it nick he spread his hands i only suggest possibilities here is what is concrete you and i share a great many foes i am willing to help you fight them let me get this straight i said youre telling me that you want me to work with you and that i still get to keep being one of the good guys good and evil are relative you know that by now but i would never ask you to work against your conscience i have no need to do so in order to make use of your talents consider how many people you could help with the power im offering you yeah you seem like a real philanthropist as i said im willing to work with you and i am quite sincere he met my eyes look upon my soul dresden see for yourself my heart ripped out about a thousand beats in two seconds and i jerked my eyes away from him terrified i didnt want to see what was behind nicodemuss dark calm ancient eyes it could have been something monstrous his soul something that ripped away my sanity and left a stain of itself on my own like a smear of grease or it could be even worse what if he was telling the truth i glanced back at the carpenter house feeling very cold and very tired tired of everything tired of all of it i looked down at my borrowed clothes and my bare ankles covered with snow just like my shoes i dont have anything against you personally dresden he said i respect your integrity i would enjoy working with you but make no mistake if you stand in my way ill mow you down beside everyone else silence reigned i thought about what i knew of nicodemus i thought about my friends and those whispers behind my back i thought about the awkward silences i thought about what the world might become if nicodemus turned ivy i thought about how scared the little girl must be right now and i thought about a little old man from okinawa who had literally laid down his life for my own you and i i said quietly are both willing to give things up to reach our goals nicodemus tilted his head waiting but we have real different ideas when it comes to deciding who does the sacrificing and who gets sacrificed i shook my head no he took a slow deep breath and said pity good evening dresden best of luck to you in the new world but i expect we wont meet again in this life he turned to go and my heart sped up again shiro said i would know who to give the sword to wait i said nicodemus paused ive got more than coins to offer you he turned his face a mask you give me ivy and i give you eleven coins i said quietly plus fidelacchius nicodemus froze his shadow twisted and twitched you have it yeah that ugly whispering sound came again louder and faster nicodemus glanced down at his shadow frowning suppose you get ivy i said suppose you turn her and manage to control her its a great scheme suppose you get your apocalypse and your neo dark age do you think thats going to stop the knights do you think that one after the other new men and women wont take up the swords and fight you you think heavens just going to sit there letting you do whatever you want nicodemus had a better poker face than me but i had him he was listening how many times have the swords broken up your plans i asked how many times have they forced you to abandon one position or another i took a stab in the dark that seemed worth it dont you get tired of waking up from nightmares about taking a sword through the heart or the neck turning you into one more discarded dixie cup for the fallen terrified of what youre going to face once you shuffle off the mortal coil ive got the sword i said im willing to trade it and the coins alike his teeth showed no you arent im just as willing to give you the sword and the coins as you are to give me the archive i said im handing you an opportunity nick a chance to destroy one of the swords forever who knows if things go well you might have a shot at taking out the other two at the same time the whispering increased in volume and speed again nicodemus stared at me i couldnt read his expression but his right hand was slowly clenching and unclenching as if eager to take up a weapon and hate poured off him like heat from an oven so i said as nonchalantly as i could where do you want to do the exchange chapter thirtyeight i walked back up to the house again a few minutes later mouse at my side michael had been right before we went inside the big dog shook himself thoroughly i decided to follow his example and stomped whatever snow i could off my numb feet then went in i walked into the living room and found everyone there waiting for meluccio michael molly sanya and murphy everyone looked at me expectantly he went for it were going to have to haul ass in a minute but i need to speak with you first michael michael raised his eyebrows oh certainly alone i said quietly and bring your sword i turned and walked on through the house out the barely functioning back door the gruff had damaged before all this began and on to the workshop i didnt stop to look behind me i didnt need to look to know that everyone was trading significant glances if nicodemus actually did have people in the tree house they were gone now i wouldnt put it past the bastard to have been lying about them just to keep me honest i went inside the workshop and laid my staff down on the workbench it had a lot of dings and nicks in it it could benefit from a set of woodcarving tools sandpaper and patient attention michael came in silently a moment later i turned to face him he wore his fleecelined denim coat again and bore amoracchius in its sheath attached to a belt hed slung over one shoulder i took my duster off and put it next to the staff draw it please harry michael said what are you doing making a point i said just do it he frowned at me his expression uncertain but he drew the blade i added my energy rings to the pile on the workbench then my shield bracelet finally i took off my mothers silver pentacle necklace and put it down there too then i turned and walked over to michael i met his eyes steadily id already looked upon michaels soul i knew its quality and he knew that of mine then i reached down with my left hand gently grasped amoracchiuss blade and lifted it to rest against the left side of my neck just below my ear the jugular vein or the carotid artery i get them confused michael went pale harry shut up i said for the past couple of days youve done all kinds of nottalking you can do a little bit more of it until ive said my piece he subsided his eyes troubled and stood very very still what can i say i have a gift for getting peoples attention i stared at him down the length of shining deadly steel and then very slowly took my hand off the sword leaving its wickedly sharp edge resting against the beat of my life then i spread my hands and just stood there for a minute you are my friend michael i said barely louder than a whisper i trust you his eyes glittered and he closed them and you want to know he said heavily looking up again if i can say the same talk is cheap i said and moved my chin a little to indicate the sword i want to know if youll show me he lowered the sword carefully from my neck his hands shook a little but mine didnt it isnt that simple yes it is i told him im your friend or im not you trust meor you dont he sheathed the sword and turned away facing the window thats the real reason you didnt want to hat up and go gunning for the denarians right at first the way i wanted to you were worried i was leading you into a trap i didnt lie to you harry michael said but id be lying right now if i didnt admit that yes the thought had crossed my mind why i asked my voice perfectly calm what reason have i ever given you for that it isnt that simple harry ive fought and bled to defend you and your family i put my neck in a noose for molly when the council would have killed her i cant even tell you how much business ive missed out on because of the time ive got to spend teaching her what was it that tipped you off to my imminent villainhood harry nicodemus had been right about one thing it hurt to be suspected by my friends it hurt like hell i didnt even realize i had raised my voice until id already screamed look at me when im talking to you michael turned his face to me his expression grim do you think ive decided to side with nicodemus and his buddies i snarled do you really think that because if you do you might was well put that sword through my neck right now i dont know what to think harry he said quietly theres a lot you havent said i dont share everything with you i retorted i dont share everything with anyone thats nothing new i know it isnt he said then why some of the fire went out of my voice and i felt like a halfdeflated balloon youve known me for years man weve covered each other plenty of times why are you doubting me now because of lasciels shadow michael said quietly because as long as its in you it will tempt youand the longer it stays the more able it will be to do so i gave forthill the coin i said i figured that pretty much said it all michael grimaced the shadow can show you how to summon the coin its happened before thats why were so careful not to touch them its over michael there is no more shadow michael shook his head his eyes filled with something very like pity it doesnt work like that harry the fire came back the one thing i didnt want or need was pity id made my own choices lived my own life and even if they hadnt all been smart choices there werent many of them that i regretted how do you know i asked because in two thousand years no one has rid themselves of the shadow of one of the fallenexcept by accepting the demon into them entirely taking up the coin and living to feel remorse and discarding it and you claim that you never took up the coin thats right i said then either the shadow is still there michael said still twisting your thoughts still whispering to you or youre lying to me about taking up the coin those are the only options i just stared at him for a minute then i said hells bells and i thought wizards had a monopoly on arrogance he blinked or do you really expect me to believe that the church has been there to document every single instance of anyone picking up any of the cursed coins that theyve followed through with everyone tempted by a fallens shadow taken testimony made copies hell gotten it notarized especially given that youve told me that nicodemus has worked as hard as he could to destroy the churchs records and archives through the years michaels weight settled back on his heels he frowned this is what they want michael they want us at one anothers throats they want us to distrust one another i shook my head and right now is not the time to give it to them michael folded his arms studying me it could have done something to your mind michael said quietly you might not be in control of yourself harry i took a deep breath thatspossible i admitted anybodys head can be messed with but if you go rewiring someones brain it damages them badly the bigger the changes you make the worse it disorders their mind the way my daughter did to her friends michael said i know so there are signs i said if you know the person well enough there are almost always signs they act differently have i been acting differently have i suddenly gone crazy on you he arched an eyebrow more so than usual i amended he shook his head no then odds are pretty good no one has scrambled my noggin i said besides which it isnt the sort of thing one tends to overlook and as a gradea wizard of the white council i assure you that nothing like that has happened to me for a second he looked like he wanted to speak but he didnt which brings us back to the only real issue here i said do you think ive gone over to them do you think i could do such a thing after what ive seen my friend sighed no harry i stepped up to him and put my hand on his shoulder then trust me for a little longer help me for a little longer he searched my eyes again i will he whispered if you answer one question for me i frowned at him and tilted my head okay he took a deep breath and spoke carefully harry he said quietly what happened to your blasting rod for a second the question didnt make any sense the words sounded like noises like sounds infants make before they learn to speak especially the last part of the sentence iim sorry i said what did you say where he said gently is your blasting rod this time i heard the words pain stabbed me in the head ice picks plunging into both temples i flinched and doubled over blasting rod familiar words i fought to summon an image of what went with the words but i couldnt find anything i knew i had a memory associated with those words but try as i might i couldnt drag it out it was like a shape covered by some heavy tarp i knew an object was beneath but i couldnt get to it i donti dont i started breathing faster the pain got worse someone had been in my head someone had been in my head oh god i must have fallen at some point because the workshops floor was cold underneath one of my cheeks when i felt michaels broad workcalloused hand gently cover my forehead father he murmured humbly and with no drama whatsoever father please help my friend father of light banish the darkness that he may see father of truth expose the lies father of mercy ease his pain father of love honor this good mans heart amen michaels hand felt suddenly redhot and i felt power burning in the air around himnot magic the magic i worked with every day this was something different something more ancient more potent more pure this was the power of faith and as that heat settled into the spaces behind my eyes something cracked and shattered inside my thoughts the pain vanished so suddenly that it left me gasping even as the image of a simple wooden rod a couple of feet long heavily carved with sigils and runes leapt into the forefront of my thoughts along with the image of the blasting rod came thousands of memories everything i had ever known about using magic to summon and control fire in a hurry evocation combat magic and they hit me like a sledgehammer i lay there shuddering for a minute or two as i took it all back in the memories filled a hole inside me i hadnt even realized was there michael left his hand on my head easy harry easy just rest for a minute im right here i decided not to argue with him well i rasped weakly a moment later i opened my eyes and looked up to where michael sat crosslegged on the floor beside me somebody owes somebody here an apology he gave me a small concerned smile you dont owe me anything perhaps i should have spoken sooner but but confronting someone whos had his brain twisted out of shape about the fact can prove traumatic i said quietly especially if part of the twisting was making damned sure that he didnt remember any such thing happening he nodded molly became concerned sometime yesterday i asked her to have a look at you while you were sleeping earlier i apologize for that but i didnt know any other way to be sure that someone had tampered with you i shivered ugh molly playing in my head that wasnt necessarily the prettiest thing to think about molly had a gift for neuromancy mind magic but shed used it to do some fairly nasty things to people in the pastfor perfectly good reasons true but all the same it had been honesttoevilness black magic it was the kind of thing that people got addicted to and it wasnt the kind of candy store that i would ever want that kid to play in especially considering that the inventory was me hells bells michael i murmured you shouldnt have done that to her it was her idea actually and youre right harry we cant afford to be divided right now what can you remember i shook my head squinting while i sorted through the dumptruckload of loose memories the last time i remember having it was right after the gruffs attacked us here after thatnothing i dont know where it is now and no i dont remember who did it to me or why michael frowned but nodded well he doesnt always give us what we want only what we need i rubbed at my forehead i hope so i said sheepishly so um this is a little awkward after that thing with putting your sword to my throat and all michael let his head fall back and belted out a warm rich laugh you arent the sort of person to do things by halves harry grand gestures included i guess not i said quietly i have to ask michael said studying me intently lasciels shadow is it really gone i nodded how i looked away from him i dont like to talk about it he frowned but nodded slowly can you tell me why not because what happened to her wasnt fair i shook my head do you know why the denarians dont like going into churches michael he shrugged because the presence of the almighty makes them uncomfortable or so i always supposed no i said closing my eyes because it makes the fallen feel michael makes them remember makes them sad i felt his startled glance even with my eyes closed imagine how awful that would be i said after millennia of certainty of purpose suddenly you have doubts suddenly you question whether or not everything youve done has been one enormous futile lie if everything you sacrificed you sacrificed for nothing i smiled faintly couldnt be good for your confidence no michael said thoughtfully i dont suppose it would be shiro told me id know who to give the sword to i said yes i threw it into the deal with nicodemus the coins and the sword for the child michael drew in a sharp breath he would have walked away otherwise i said run out the clock and wed never have found him in time it was the only way it was almost like shiro knew even back then gods blood harry michael said he pressed a hand to his stomach im fairly sure that gambling is a sin and even if it isnt this probably should be im going to go get that little girl michael i said whatever it takes he rose frowning and buckled his sword belt around his hips i held up my right hand are you with me michaels palm smacked solidly into mine and he hauled me to my feet chapter thirtynine a s war councils go our meeting was fast and dirty it had to be afterward i tracked down murphy shed gone back to charitys sewing room to check on kincaid i stood quietly in the door for a minute there wasnt much room to be had in there it was piled high with plastic storage boxes filled with fabric and craft materials there was a sewing machine on a table a chair the bed and just enough floor space to let you get to them id been laid up in this room before it was a comforting sort of place awash in softness and color and it smelled like detergent and fabric softener kincaid looked like the mummys stunt double he had an iv in his arm and there was a unit of blood suspended from a small metal stand beside his bedcourtesy of marcones rogue medical facilities i supposed murphy sat beside the bed looking worried id seen the expression on her face before when id been the one lying horizontal i expected to feel a surge of jealousy but it didnt happen i just felt bad for murph how is he i asked her this is his third unit of blood murphy said his colors better his breathing is steadier but he needs a doctor maybe we should call butters if we do hes just going to look at us do his mccoy impersonation and tell you dammit murphy im a medical examiner not a pasta chef murphy choked out a little sound that was as much sob as chuckle i stepped forward and put a hand on her shoulder michael says hes going to make it she sat stiffly underneath my hand he isnt a doctor but he has very good contacts kincaid shuddered and his breath rasped harshly for several seconds murphys shoulder went steely with tension the wounded mans breathing steadied again hey i said quietly easy she shook her head i hate this hes tougher than you or me i said quietly thats not what i mean i remained silent waiting for her to speak i hate feeling like this im fucking terrified and i hate it the muscles in her jaw tensed this is why i dont want to get involved anymore it hurts too much i squeezed her shoulder gently involved huh no she said then she shook her head yes i dont know its complicated harry caring about someone isnt complicated i said it isnt easy but it isnt complicated either kinda like lifting the engine block out of a car she gave me an oblique glance leave it to a man to describe intimate relationships in terms of automotive mechanics yeah i was kinda proud of that one myself she huffed out a quiet breath squeezed her eyes shut and leaned her cheek down onto my hand the stupid part she said is that he isnt interested inin getting serious we get along we have fun together for him thats enough and its so stupid for me to get hung up on him i didnt think it was all that stupid murph didnt want to get too close let herself be too vulnerable kincaid didnt want that kind of relationship eitherwhich made him safe it made it all right for her to care it also explained why she and i had never gotten anywhere in the event that you havent figured it out im not the kind of person to be casually involved in much of anything i couldnt fit any of that into words though so i just leaned down and kissed the top of her head gently she shivered her tears made wet cool spots on the back of my hand i knelt it put my head more or less on level with hers where she sat beside the bed i put an arm around her shoulders and pulled her against me i still didnt say anything for murph that would be too much like i was actually in the room seeing her cry so she pretended that she wasnt crying and i pretended that i didnt notice she didnt cry for long a couple of minutes then her breathing steadied and i could feel her asserting control again a minute more and she sat up and away from me i let her they said you were under the influence she said her tone calmer more businesslike that someone had done something to your head your apprentice said that but michael didnt want to say anything in front of the other wizard i could tell and no one wanted to say anything in front of me secrets get to be a habit i said quietly and molly was right murphy nodded she said that we should listen for the first words out of your mouth when you woke up that if something had messed with your mind your subconscious might be able to communicate that way while you were on the edge of sleep and you told us to listen to her i thought about it and pursed my lips huh i did guess im smarter than i thought they shouldnt have suspected you murphy said im a paranoid bitch and i gave up suspecting you a long time ago they had a good reason i said i took a slow breath it was hard but i forced the words out nicodemus threw one of those coins at michaels kid i grabbed it before the kid could and i had a photocopy of a fallen angel living in my head for several years trying to talk me into picking up the coin and letting the rest of it into me murphy glanced obliquely at me you meanyou could have become one of those things yeah i said couple of times it was close is it stillis that what i shook my head its gone now shes gone now i guess the whole time she was trying to change me i was trying to change her right back and in the raith deeps last year she took a psychic bullet for meat the very end after everyone else had gotten out i shrugged i hadwed sort of become friends murph id gotten used to having her around i glanced at her and gave her a faint smile crazy huh get all broken up over what was essentially my imaginary friend her fingers found my hand and squeezed tight once were all imaginary friends to one another harry she sat with me for a moment and then gave me a shrewd glance you never told michael the details i shook my head i dont know why i do she said you remember when kravos stuck his fingers in my brain i shuddered hed been impersonating me when he did it yeah you said it caused some kind of damage what did you call it psychic trauma i said same thing happens when a loved one dies during big emotional tragedies that kind of thing takes a while to get over it but you do get over it murph said dresden it seems to me that youd lock yourself up pretty tight if someone took a regular bullet for you with a regular body much less if you were under psychic attack and this imaginary friend died right inside your own brain something like that happens shouldnt you have expected to be a basket case at least for a little while i frowned staring down at my hands i never even considered that she snorted gently theres a surprise dresden forgets that hes not invincible she had a point there this plan of yours she said do you really think its going to work i think ive got to try it i took a deep breath i dont think you should be involved in this one murph the denarians have human followers fanatic ones you think were going to have to kill some of them murphy said i think we probably wont have much choice i said besides that i wouldnt put it past them to send someone here for spite win or lose murphy glanced up at me rather sharply i shrugged they know that michael and sanya and i are going to be out there theyll know that there will be someone here unprotected whether or not they get the coins nicodemus might send someone here to finish off the wounded murphy stared at me for a second then looked back at kincaid you bastard she said without emphasis im not playing big brother with you karrin i replied but we are dealing with some very bad people mollys staying with kincaid im leaving mouse here too id appreciate it if someone with a little more experience was here to give the kid some direction if it was needed she scowled at kincaid then she said trying to guilt me into playing worried girlfriend domestic defender and surrogate mother figure eh i figured it would work better than telling you to shut up and get into the kitchen she took a deep breath studying the sleeping man then she reached out and touched his hand she stood and faced me no im coming with you i grunted rising you sure the girl is important to him murphy said more important to him than anything has been for a long time harry hed die to protect her if he was conscious hed be demanding to go with you but he cant do that so ill have to do it for him could be real messy murph she nodded ill worry about that after the girl is safe there was a clock ticking quietly on the wall the meetings in an hour murphy nodded and reached for her coat the tears were gone and there was no evidence of them in the lines of her face youd better excuse me then if were going to have an evening out i need to change into something more comfortable i never tell a lady how to accessorize going forth to do battle with the forces of darkness is one thing doing it in a pair of borrowed sweatpants and an illfitting tshirt is something else entirely fortunately molly had been thoughtful enough to drop my own clothes into the washer bless her heart i could forgive her for the pot roast in the laundry room i had skinned out of michaels clothes and was in the act of pulling up my jeans when luccio opened the door and leaned in her expression excited dresden i think i know whoh i jerked my jeans the rest of the way up and closed them as hurriedly as i could without causing any undue discomfort oh um excuse me i said luccio smiled the dimples in her cheeks making her look not much older than molly she didnt blush instead she folded her arms and leaned one shoulder on the door frame her dark eyes taking me in with evident pleasure oh not at all dresden not at all i paused and returned her look for a moment arent you supposed to be embarrassed apologize and quietly leave her smile widened lazily and she shrugged a shoulder when i was a girl perhaps but even then i had difficulty forcing myself to act awkward when looking at something that pleased me she tilted her head and moved toward me she reached out and rested her fingertips very lightly against a scar on my upper arm she traced its outline and glanced up at me lifting an eyebrow bullet wound i said fbi werewolves she nodded then her fingers touched the hollow of my throat and slid slowly down over my chest and belly in a straight line a shuddering sensation of heat fluttered through my skin in the wake of her fingertips she looked up at me again hook knife i said sorcerer tried to filet me at the field museum her touch trailed down my bare arms lingering on my forearms near my wrists avoiding the red scalded skin around my left wrist thorn manacles i said from when madrigal raith tried to sell me on ebay she lifted my scarred left hand between hers fingers stroking over the maimed flesh these days i could move it pretty well most of the time and it didnt look like some kind of hideous halfmelted wax image of a hand anymore but it still wasnt pretty a scourge of black court vampires had a renfield that got creative had a homemade flamethrower she shook her head i know men centuries older than you who have not collected so many scars maybe they lived that long because they were smart enough not to get them i said she flashed me that grin again at close range it was devastating and her eyes looked even darker anastasia i said quietly in a few minutes were going to go do something that might get us killed yes harry we are she said i nodded but thats not until a few minutes from now her eyes smoldered no no it isnt i lifted my stilltingling right hand to gently cup the line of her jaw and leaned down to press my mouth to hers she let out a quiet satisfied little moan and melted against me her body pressing fulllength to mine returning the kiss with slow sensuous intensity i felt her slide the fingers of one hand into my hair while the nails of the other wandered randomly over my chest and arm barely touching it left a trail of fire in my flesh and i found myself sinking the fingers of my right hand into the soft curls of her hair drawing her more deeply into the kiss i dont know how long that went on but it wound down deliciously by the time she drew her mouth away from mine both of us were breathing harder and my heart was pounding out a rapid beat against my chest and against my jeans she didnt open her eyes for five or ten seconds and when she did they were absolutely huge and molten with desire anastasia leaned her head back and arched in a slow stretch letting out a long low pleased sigh you dont mind i asked her not at all good i justwanted to see what that was like its been a long time since i kissed anyone almost forgot what it was like you have no idea she murmured how long it has been since ive kissed a man i wasnt sure i remembered how i let out a quiet laugh her dimples returned good she said satisfaction in her tone she looked me up and down taking in the sights again this time it didnt make me feel selfconscious you have a good smile you should show it more often once were done tonight i said maybe we could talk about that over dinner her smile widened and color touched her cheeks that would please me good i said i arched an eyebrow at her ill put my shirt on now if thats all right anastasia let out a merry laugh and stepped back from me though she didnt lift her fingertips from my skin until the distance forced her to do it very well warden as you were why thank you captain i tugged the rest of my clothes back on what were you going to tell me hmmm she said oh ah yes before i was so cleverly distracted i think i know where the denarians are holding the archive i blinked you got through with a tracking spell she shook her head no it failed miserably so i was forced to resort to the use of my brain she opened a hardsided leather case hanging from her sword belt she withdrew a plastic tube from it opened one end and withdrew a roll of papers she thumbed through them found one and put the rest back she unfolded the paper into what looked like a map and laid it out on the lid of the dryer i leaned over to look at it it was indeed a map but instead of being marked with state lines highways and towns it was dominated by natural featuresmost prominent of which was the outlines of the great lakes rivers forests and swamps figured prominently as well furthermore a webwork of intersecting lines flowed over the map marked in various colors of ink in several different thicknesses footsteps approached and molly appeared carrying a plastic laundry basket full of childrens clothing she blinked when she saw us but smiled and came over immediately whats that its a map i replied like the knowledgeable mentor i was supposed to be she snorted i can see that she said but a map of what then i got it ley lines i said looking up at luccio these are ley lines molly pursed her lips and studied the paper those are real yeah we just havent covered them yet theyrewell think of them as underground pipelines only instead of flowing with water they flow with magic they run all over the world usually running between hot spots of supernatural energy connect the dots with magic molly said cool exactly luccio said the only method that would have a chance of restraining the archives power would be the use of a greater circleand one that uses an enormous amount of energy at that i grunted acknowledgment it would have to be dead solid perfect too or she could break loose at the flaw correct how much energy are we talking about i asked her you might be able to empower such a circle for half an hour or an hour dresden i couldnt have kept it up that long even before my ahshe waved a hand down at herselfaccident so it would take loads of power i mused so how are they powering it thats the real question she said after all the sign they raised at the aquarium suggests that they have an ample supply i shook my head no i stated that was hellfire luccio pursed her lips you seem fairly certain of that i seem completely certain of that i said its powerful as hell literally but it isnt stable it fluctuates and stutters thats why they couldnt keep the sign up any longer than they did to imprison the archive they would need a steady flawless supply luccio said a supply that big would also be able to support a very complex veilone that could shield them from any tracking spell in fact its the only way they could establish a veil that impenetrable ley lines i breathed ley lines she said with satisfaction i know of a couple around town but i didnt realize there were that many of the things i said the great lakes region is rife with them luccio said its an energy nexus so molly asked what does that mean well its one reason why so much supernatural activity tends to happen in this area i said three times as many ships and planes have vanished in lake michigan as in the bermuda triangle wow molly said seriously yeah next summer i think ill stick to the pool luccio started tracing various lines on the map with a fingertip the colors denote what manner of energy seems to be most prevalent in the line defensive energy here disruptive force here restorative lines here and here and so on the thickness of the line indicates its relative potency right right i said growing excited so were looking for an energy source compatible with the use of a greater circle and strong enough to keep a big one powered up and stable and there are four locations that i think are most likely luccio said she pointed up toward the north end of lake michigan north and south manitou islands both have heavy concentrations of dark energy running through them theres plenty of spook stories around them too i said but thats better than two hundred miles away if i were nicodemus i wouldnt want to risk moving her that far agreed a third runs directly beneath the field museum she glanced up at me and arched an eyebrow as her voice turned dry but i think youre already familiar with that one i was going to put the dinosaur back i said but i was unconscious which brings us to number four luccio said her fingertip came to rest on a cluster of tiny islands out in the center of the lake northeast of the city and the heavy dark purple line running through it here molly leaned across me and frowned down at the map there arent any islands in that part of lake michigan its all open water listenstowind gave this map to me miss carpenter luccio said seriously hes spent several centuries living in this general region i grunted i hear a lot of things i think that there are some islands out there they were used as bases for wilderness fighters in several wars bootleggers used them as a transfer point for running booze in from canada back in the prohibition days but there were always stories around them molly frowned what kind of stories i shrugged the usual scary stuff hauntings people driven insane by unknown forces people dragged into the water by creatures unknown or found slaughtered by weaponry several centuries outofdate then why arent they on the maps and stuff molly asked the islands are dangerous i said long way from any help and the lake can be awfully mean in the winter there are stone reefs out there too that could gut a boat that came too close maybe someone down at city hall figured that the islands would prove less of a temptation to people if everyone thought they were just stories and invested some effort in removing them from the public record that wouldnt be possible molly said it might be luccio responded the energies concentrated around those islands would tend to make people unconsciously avoid them if one did not have a firm destination fixed in mind the vast majority of people in the area would swing around the islands without ever realizing what they were doing i grunted and if theres that much bad mojo spinning around out there it would play merry hell with navigational gear twenty bucks says that the major flight lanes dont come within five miles of the place i thumped my finger on the spot and nodded it feels right shes there if she is molly asked then what do we do about it luccio tilted her head at me frowning captain i assume you already contacted the council about getting reinforcements yes she said theyll be here as soon as possiblewhich is about nine hours from now not fast enough i said and narrowed my eyes in thought so we call in some favors favors luccio asked yeah i said i know a guy with a boat chapter forty i rushed around setting up details for the next half an hour everyone left to get into position except for me molly and kincaid and mouse my dog was clearly upset that i wasnt going to be bringing him along and though he dutifully settled down on the floor near mollys feet he looked absolutely miserable sorry boy i told him i want you here to help molly and warn her about any danger he sighed i got along just fine without you for quite a while i told him dont you worry about me he rolled onto his back and gave me another pathetic look hah just trying to cadge a tummy rub i knew it i leaned down and obliged him a minute later the back door opened and thomas came in finally he said ive been sitting in my car so long i think i left a dent in the seat sorry ill live what can i do to help get back in your car and give me a ride to my place thomas gave me a level look then he muttered something under his breath pulled his keys out of his pocket and stalked back out into the snow youre horrible molly said grinning what i said im expressing my brotherly affection i shrugged into my coat and picked up my staff remember the plan man the phone molly said ticking off each point on her fingers keep my eyes open make sure mouse stays in the same room as me check on kincaid every fifteen minutes at one time she would have been sullen about the prospect of being forced to sit at home when something exciting was under waybut she had grown up enough to realize just how dangerous things could be out there and to respect her own limitations molly was extraordinarily sensitive when it came to the various energies of magic it was one of the things that made her so good at psychomancy and neuromancy it also meant that when violent personal or supernatural events started happening she experienced them in such agonizing clarity that it would often incapacitate her altogether at least for a few minutes combat magic was never going to be her strong suit and in a real conflict she could prove to be a lethal liability to her own allies but at least the kid knew it she might not like it very much but shed applied herself diligently to finding other ways to help fight the good fight i was proud of her and dont forget your homework i said she frowned i still dont understand why you want to know about our family tree humor me grasshopper ill buy you a snow cone she glanced out the window at the world of white outside goody she looked back at me and gave me a small worried smile be careful hey there were almost twenty of these losers at the shedd now were down to six the six smartest strongest and oldest molly said the ones who really matter thank you for your optimism i said and turned to go lock up behind me molly bit her lip harry i paused her voice was very small look out for my dad okay i turned and met her eyes i drew an x over my heart and nodded she blinked her eyes quickly several times and gave me another smile all right lock the door i told her again and trudged out into the snow the lock clicked shut behind me and molly watched me slog through the snow to the street thomass military moving van came rumbling through the snow tires crunching and i got in he turned the heater up a little while i stomped snow off of my shoes so he said starting down the street whats the plan i told him that is a bad plan he said there wasnt time for a good one he grunted november is not a good time to be sailing on lake michigan harry the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust isnt a good time to be sailing there either thomas frowned you arent just running your mouth here are you youre serious its a worstcase scenario i said but nicodemus could do it so weve got to proceed under the presumption that his intentions are in that category the denarians want to disrupt civilization and with the archive under their control they could do it maybe theyd use biological or chemical weapons instead maybe theyd crash the world economy maybe theyd turn every program on television into one of those reality shows thats mostly done already harry oh well ive got to believe that the world is worth saving anyway we traded forced grins regardless of what they do the potential for really bad things is just too damned high to ignore and we need all the help we can get even help from one of those dastardly white court fiends thomas asked exactly good i was getting tired of dodging luccio theres a limited amount of help i can give you if i have to stay out of sight all the time its necessary if the council knew that you and i were related i know i know thomas said scowling outcast leper unclean i sighed and shook my head given that the white courts modus operandi generally consisted of twisting peoples minds around in one of several ways i didnt dare let anyone on the council know that thomas was my friend let alone my half brother everyone would immediately assume the worstthat the white court had gotten to me and was controlling my head through thomas and even if i convinced them that it wasnt the case it would look suspicious as hell the council would demand i demonstrate loyalty attempt to use thomas as a spy against the white court and in general behave like the pompous overbearing assholes that they are it wasnt easy for either of us to live withbut it wasnt going to change either we got to my apartment and i rushed inside it was cold the fire had burned down to nothing in the time id been gone i lifted my hand and murmured under my breath the spell lighting half a dozen candles at the same time i grabbed everything i was going to need waved the candles out again and hurried back out to thomass car youve got moms pentacle with you right i asked him i had a matching pendant on a silver chain around my own neckwhich other than thomas was my mothers only tangible legacy of course he said ill find you where now st marys i said figured thomas started driving i broke open my doublebarreled shotgun which id sawed down to an illegal length and loaded two shells into it tessa the mantis girl had rudely neglected to return my after the conclusion of hostilities at the aquarium and i have rarely regretted taking a gun with me into what could prove to be a hairy situation here i said when the truck got within a block or so of the church drop me off here gotcha thomas said hey harry yeah what if they arent keeping the little girl on the island i shook my head youll just have to figure something out im making this up as i go he frowned and shook his head what about those goons from summer what are you going to do if they show up again if i should be so lucky i winked at him and got out of the hummer the real question is what am i going to do if they dont show up and at the worst possible time to boot die of shock probably see you soon thomas said i nodded to my brother shut the door and trudged across the street and into the parking lot of st mary of the angels its a big church a really really big church it takes up a full city block and is one of the towns more famous landmarks chicagos version of notre dame the drive leading up to the delivery doors in the back of the church had been cleared as had the little parking lot outside it michaels truck was there the ambient glow of winter night showed me his form and sanyas standing outside the truck both of them wearing long white cloaks emblazoned with scarlet crosses over similarly decorated white surcoatsthe sundaygotomeeting wear of the knights of the cross they wore their swords at their hips michael wore an honesttogod breastplate while sanya opted for more modern body armor the big russian always the practical progressive also carried a kalashnikov assault rifle on a sling over his shoulder i wondered if sanya realized that michaels antiquatedlooking breastplate was lined with kevlar and ballistic strike plates the russians gear wouldnt do diddly to stop swords or claws id made some modification to my own gear as well the thong that usually secured my blasting rod on the inside of my duster now held up my shotgun id tied a similar strip of leather thong to either end of the simple wooden cane that held fidelacchius and now carried the holy blade slung over my shoulder michael nodded to me and then glanced down at his watch youre cutting it a little fine arent you punctuality is for people with nothing better to do i said or for those who have already taken care of the other details murmured a womans voice she stepped out of the shadows across the street a tall and striking woman in motorcycle leathers she had eyes that were the warm brown shade of hot chocolate and her hair was dark and braided tightly against her head she wore no makeup but even without it she was a knockout it was the expression on her face that tipped me off to who she wassadness mingled with regret and steely resolve rosanna i said quietly wizard she strode toward us somehow arrogant and reserved at the same time her hips rolling as she walked the jacket was open almost all the way to her belly button and there was nothing but skin showing where it was parted her eyes however remained on the knights these two were not a part of the arrangements and it was supposed to be nicodemus that met me i said not you circumstances necessitated a change rosanna replied i shrugged one shoulderthe one bearing fidelacchius same here what circumstances are those rosanna demanded the ones where im dealing with a pack of twofaced backstabbing treacherous murderous lunatics whom i trust no farther than i can kick she regarded me with level lovely eyes and what is the knights intended role theyre here to build trust trust she asked absolutely i can kick you a lot farther when theyre around a very small smile touched her mouth she inclined her head slightly to me then she turned to sanya those colors hardly suit you animal though it is more than agreeable to see you again i am not that man anymore rosanna sanya replied i have changed no you havent rosanna said those warm eyes locked onto sanyas now you still long for the fray still love the fight still revel in bloodshed that was never magog that was always you my beast sanya shook his head with a faint smile i still enjoy a fight he said i simply choose them a bit more carefully now it isnt too late you know rosanna said make a gift of that toy to my lord and my lady they will accept you again with open arms she took a step toward him you could be with me again animal you could have me again something very odd happened to her voice on the last couple of sentences it becamethicker somehow richer more musical the individual sounds seemed to have little to do with meaningbut the voice itself carried a honeyslow swirl of sensuality and desire that felt like it was going to glide into my ears and start glowing gently inside my brain i was only on the fringe of it too and had gotten only a watereddown version of the promise contained in that voice sanya got it at full potency he threw his head back and laughed a rich booming basso laugh that bounced back and forth from the icy stones of the church and the cold walls of the buildings around us rosanna took a step back at that her expression showing surprise i told you rosanna he rumbled laughter still bubbling in his tone i have changed then his expression sobered abruptly you could change too i know how much some of the things you have done disturb you ive been there when you had the nightmares it doesnt have to be like that she just stared at him sanya spread his hands give up the coin rosanna please let me help you her eyelids lowered into slits she shuddered once and looked down then she said it is too late for me sanya it has been too late for me for a long long time it is never too late sanya said earnestly not as long as you draw breath something like contempt touched rosannas features what do you know stupid child her gaze swung back to me show me the sword and the coins wizard i tapped the hilt of shiros sword hanging from its improvised strap over one shoulder then i drew the purple crown royal bag out of my pocket and held it up i shook it it jingled give the coins to me rosanna said i folded my arms no her eyes narrowed again our bargain you can see them after ive seen the girl i replied until then youll have to settle for some jingle i shook the bag again she glowered at me make up your mind i said i havent got all night do you want to explain to nicodemus how you threw away his chance of destroying the swords or do you want to get moving and take us to the kid her eyes flickered with something like anger and warm brown became brilliant gold but she only gave me a small stiff nod of her head and said i will take you to her this way please chapter fortyone t he next few minutes were intense and i didnt dare let it show if id been completely wrong in my deductionswhich was possible god knew it had happened beforethen michael sanya and i were about to walk into the lions den together granted that worked out for daniel but he was the exception to the rule most of the time it works out well only for the lions thats why the persians used it as a means of execution granted michael was working for the same employer and technically sanya was too even if he wasnt wholly decided on whether or not that was what he was doing but me and the almighty havent ever really sat down for a chat im not really sure where he stands on the harry dresden issue and as a result my theological stance has been pretty simple i try not to get noticed by anything godly godly or godish i think were all happier that way all the same given who i was up against i didnt think it would be inappropriate if a couple of breaks came my way hopefully michael had put in a good word for me rosanna walked down the street and lifted a hand a van cruised up out of the night it was occupied by a single driver a thicknecked brokennosed type whose eyes didnt look like he was all the way there one of nicks fanatics probably they had their tongues ritually removed as a point of honor and practicalityfrom nicodemuss perspective anyway i supposed i could ask him to open up and confirm it but it seemed a little gauche michael stuck his head in the van and checked it out then he politely opened the passenger door for rosanna the denarian stared levelly at him for a moment and then nodded her head and slid into the van sanya went in the van first taking the rearmost seat i went in after michael rosanna muttered something to the driver and the van took off i got nervous for a minute the van headed westin exactly the opposite direction from the lake then the driver turned north and after a few minutes i realized that we were headed for one of the marinas at the north end of lake shore drive i forced myself to keep my breathing smooth and even if the bad guys tumbled to the fact that wed already guessed their location the situation could devolve pretty quickly michael sat calmly his face imperturbable his hands resting on the sheathed form of amoracchius the picture of saintly serenity sanya behind us let out a low buzzing snore it wasnt as saintly as michael but it conveyed just as much blithe confidence i tried to match their calm with mixed results dont get jittery harry play it cool ice water in your veins the van stopped at one of the marinas off northerly island rosanna got out without a word and we followed her she stalked down to the shore out onto the docks and out to a modestly sized ski boat moored at the docks end michael and i went aboard after her sanya untied the lines holding the boat to the dock pushed it away from the pier and casually hopped across the widening distance and into the vessel it took her a couple of minutes but rosanna coaxed the old boats engines to life and turned us away from the lights of the city and out into the darkness of the great lake it was eerie how swiftly the world became pitchblack that strange faerielight of the night under a heavy snow vanished out on the waters of the lake where the snow simply sank into the depths the low overcast gave us a little light for a time reflecting the glow of the city but as the boat continued skimming out into the center of the lake even that faded away until i could barely distinguish the outline of the boat and its occupants against the water all around i wasnt sure how long we went on like that in the dark it seemed like an hour but it couldnt have been more than half that the boat bounced across waves whump whump whump throwing up splashes of spray that coated the bow in a shining crust of ice my stomach got a little queasy as i tried to anticipate the motion in the darkness and failed at length the rumble of the boats engine died away and then stopped altogether the silence was disorienting ive lived my entire adult life in chicago im used to the city to its rhythms its music the hum and hiss of traffic the clatter of elevated trains the blaring radios the beeping horns cell phones sirens music animals and people people people but out here in the center of the vast empty cold of the lake there was nothing no heartbeat of the city no voices no nothing except the glug and slap of water hitting the hull of the boat i waited for a couple of minutes while the boat was rocked by the waves of the lake now that we werent moving under power i thought that they were rocking the boat to a really alarming degree but i wasnt going to be the one to start whimpering well sanya demanded about five seconds before i would have cracked what are we waiting for a signal rosanna murmured i would as soon not tear out the boats bottom on rocks and drown us all dear animal i reached into my duster pocket and took out a chemical light i tore it out of its package snapped it and shook it to life up sprang a greenish glow that lit up the immediate area well enough considering how dark it had been for the past half an hour or so rosanna turned to look at the light sometime during the trip her human form had changed vanishing back into the shape of the scarletskinned goatlegged batwinged demoness i had seen at the aquarium her eyes both the brown ones and the glowing green pair focused on the chemical light and she smiled revealing white delicately pointed fangs no magic wizard are you so fearful about husbanding your strength out this far from shore floating over this much water it would have been difficult to put together a spell of any complexitybut i was sure rosanna knew that as well as i did if the flames id seen her tossing around back at the shedd were any indication it would have been a waste of energy i might need later but i reminded myself about the ice water alleged to be in my veins mostly i just think the glow lights are fun i said did you know that they used these things for the blood of the predator in that movie with arnold schwarzenegger the smile faltered what are you talking about thats the problem with you nearly immortal types i said you couldnt spot a pop culture reference if it skittered up and implanted an embryo down your esophagus at the back of the boat sanya started coughing rosanna stared at him for a moment her eyes unreadable then the barest shadow of something mournful touched her features and she turned away from him she walked to the front of the boat and stood facing east into the darkness her arms folded across her body in a posture of tightly closed insecurity her wings wrapping around her like a blanket sanya didnt miss it hed been forcing himself to conceal a grin but it faded into uneasy discomfort at rosannas reaction he looked like he was about to say something then frowned and shook his head he turned his face to stare out over the water large flakes of snow continued to drift down flickers of crystalline green in the glow light michael started humming contentedlyamazing grace he must have learned the song from some baptists somewhere he had a nice voice rich and steady i stepped up next to rosanna and said in a quiet voice tell me something this maidenofsorrow thing youve got goinghow many knights have you killed with it her eyes both pairs flicked aside to glance at me for a second then back out at the night what do you mean you know youve got that beautiful sad aura going you look mournful and tragic and pretty radiate that save me save me vibe probably get all kinds of young men who want to carry you off on a white horse is that what you think of me she asked lady i said a year or three ago id have been the first in line hell if i thought you were serious about getting out id probably still help you but i dont think you want out i think that if you were all that pathetic you wouldnt be controlling your fallenit would be controlling you i think youre tessas trusted lieutenant for a reason which means that either this tragic trappedlady routine is a bunch of crocodile tears or else its hypocrisy on such an epic scale that it probably qualifies as some kind of psychological dysfunction she stared out into darkness and said nothing you never did answer my question i said why not say it louder she asked me in a bitter undertone if that is what you think of me then your friends need to be forewarned of my treachery right i said i do that and then your eyes well up with tears and you turn away from me you let them see one tear fall down your cheek then turn your head enough to let the wind carry your hair over the rest maybe let your shoulders shake once then its the big bad suspicious wizard who doesnt forgive and doesnt understand picking on the poor little girl who is trapped in her bad situation and really just wants to be loved give me some credit rosanna im not going to help you set them up the glowing green eyes turned to examine me and rosannas mouth moved speaking in an entirely different feminine voice lasciel taught you something of us you might say that i replied ahead of us and slightly to the right a light flared up in the darknessa bonfire i thought i couldnt tell how far away it was given the night and the falling snow there rosanna murmured that way if you would excuse me as she walked back to the wheel of the boat a breath of wind sighed over the lake in itself that wasnt anything new wind had been blowing all the way through the snowstorm something about this breeze though caught my attention it wasnt right it took me another three or four seconds to realize what was wrong this was a south wind and it was warm uhoh i said i held up the chemical light and started scanning the waters all around us harry michael said what is it feel that breeze i asked da sanya said confusion in his voice is warm so michael caught on summer is on the way he said rosanna shot a glance over her shoulder at us what get us to shore i told her the things coming after me might not give a damn if they take you out along with me she turned back to the wheel and turned the ignition the boats engine stuttered and wheezed and didnt turn over the breeze picked up instead of snowflakes thick slushy drops of halffrozen sleet began to fall more ice began forming on the boat thickening almost visibly in the green glow of my light the waves began to grow steeper rocking the boat more and more severely come on i heard myself saying come on look there sanya called pointing a finger down at the water beside the boat something long brown fibrous and slimy lashed up out of the water and wrapped around the russian knights arm from wrist to elbow bozhe moi two more strands whipped up from different angles one seizing sanyas upper arm one wrapping around his face and skull and jerked him halfway from the boat in the time it took me to shift my weight and reach for him i managed to grab one of his boots before he could be pulled all the way over the side into the water i planted one foot on the wall of the boat and hauled on sanyas leg for all i was worth michael the boats engine coughed turned over stuttered and died in nomine dei patri michael roared as amoracchius cleared its sheath the broadsword flashed in a single sweeping slash and severed the strands strangling sanya the edges of the slashed material burned away from the touch of amoracchiuss steel like paper from an open flame i dragged sanya back into the boat and the big russian whipped his saber from its sheath just in time to neatly sever another lashing brown tendril of animate fiber what is it kelpies i growled if they tangled up the blades of the engine our boat wasnt going anywhere i howled at rosanna come on the boat suddenly rocked violently to the other side i twisted my head to look over my shoulder and saw kelpies coming up over the sides they were slimy nebulous things only vaguely humanoid in shape made up of masses of wet weeds with gaping mouths and pinpoints of glittering silver light for eyes i turned and swept my arm in a slewing arc unleashing my will as i cried out forzare invisible force ripped the kelpies from the sides of the boat leaving long strands of wet plant matter clinging limply to the fiberglass hull they let out gurgling screams as they flew back and splashed into the water the boats engine caught and rose to a roar the rear end of the boat sank and its nose rose as it surged forward one of my feet flew out from underneath me i went down flailing my arms and legs dimly aware that one of the kelpies had somehow gotten a limb tangled around my ankle i got dragged to the back of the boat in a quick series of painful jerks and impacts and had just enough time to realize that the boat was about to surge right out from under me leaving me in the drink then it would just be a question of what killed me firstthe icy water or the strangling embrace of the company within it then there was a flash of scarlet and white a whistle and a hissing sound and a lance of fire on one of my feet i went into free fall and bounced into the rear wall of the boat then to the floor icy rain and freezing water splashed up against me viciously cold i looked down to find a strand of fibrous weed curling and blackening as it fell from my bleeding ankle sanya reached down and plucked the remains clear of my leg before tossing it over the rear of the boat and back into the water my ankle was bleeding my blood black in the green chemical light more black stained the tip of esperacchius i clutched at my ankle hissing in pain dammit sanya sanya peered out at the darkness behind the boat and then down at my leg ah oops michael came back to kneel beside me and hunkered down over my foot harry hold still he poked at my ankle and it hurt enough to make me snarl something about his parentage it isnt bad long but shallow he opened a leather case on his sword belt opposite the sheath of amoracchius and withdrew a small medical kit sanyas sword had already slashed open my jeans but michael tore them a little more to get them out of the way of the cut then he cleaned the injury with some kind of disposable wipe smeared it with something from a plastic tube covered it with a thick white absorbent bandage and wrapped it in tape it took him all of two or three minutes his hands quick and sure which was just as well by the time he was done the shock of the injury had worn off and the hurt had started up not much to be done about the pain he said sorry harry pain i can live with i said wincing just give me a minute i am sorry dresden sanya said yeah dont you dare save my life ever again i told him then i lifted my leg onto one of the benches in the back of the boat to elevate it and closed my eyes there were a lot of ways to manage pain besides drugs granted most of them wouldnt help you much unless youd had several years of training in focus and concentration but fortunately i had lasciels shadow had shown me a mental technique for blocking pain so effective that it was a little scarywhen id used it before id pushed myself until my body had collapsed because i hadnt been aware of exactly how bad my condition was i could have died as a result body or mind heart or soul were all human and were supposed to feel pain you cut yourself off from it at your own risk that said given what was ahead of us and coming up behind us i could hardly put myself in any more danger relatively speaking and i couldnt afford any distractions so i closed my eyes controlled my breathing focused my mind and began to methodically wall away the pain of my new injury my broken nose my aching body it took me a couple of minutes and by the time i was done the pitch of the boats engine had changed dropping from a roar to a lower growl i opened my eyes to find sanya and michael standing on either side of me swords in hand watching over me up at the front of the boat rosanna cut the engine still more and turned her head to stare intently at me for a slow beat the side of her mouth curved up in a slight knowing smile then she turned to face front again and i realized that there was light enough to see the outline of her delicately curling demon horns i rose and found myself staring at an island that rose from the increasingly turbulent waters of the lake it was covered in the woods and brush of the midwestern united stateslots of trees less than a foot thick with the space beneath them filled in with brush thickets and thorns to a depth of four or five feet snow lay over everything and the light reflecting from it was what let me see rosannas profile the shoreline was covered in what looked like an old western ghost townonly one that had been abandoned for so long that the trees had come back to reclaim the space most of the buildings had fallen down trees rose out of most of the ones that hadnt and the sight reminded me somehow of an insect collection empty shells pinned to a card a sign weathered beyond reading hung from its only remaining link of rusting chain it swung in the wind aged metal squeaking there was the skeleton of an old dock down at the shoreline all broken wooden columns standing up out of the water like the stumps of rotten teeth looking at the place filled me with a sense of awareness of the attention of an empty sterile malevolence this place did not like me it did not want me there it did not have the least regard for me and the corpse of the little town ahead of me was a silent declaration that it had fought against folk like me beforeand won gee i called to rosanna are you sure this is the right place she pointed silently up i followed the direction of her finger up the slope of the island and spotted the light id seen from farther out in the lakedefinitely a bonfire i saw now up on a hill above the town at what looked like the highest point on the island something stood starkly against the sky there the dark shape of a building or tower though i couldnt make out any details rosanna cut the engine completely and the boat glided silently forward to the broken wooden post nearest the shore she climbed into the front of the boat and was waiting with a rope when the prow of the vessel bumped the column she tied the boat to the post then hopped down into the water and waded the rest of the way ashore oh good i muttered more wet from back behind us the stillrising wind carried forward a gurgling warbling cry id been up north a few times and it might have been the call of a loonbut all of us there knew better summer was still on our trail we arent going to make it any drier by waiting here michael said quietly there are men in those trees sanya murmured sheathing his sword and taking up the kalashnikov again thirty yards up there and over there those are machinegun positions i grunted lets get moving before they get bored and decide to start making like this is normandy god go with us michael prayed quietly i unlimbered my shotgun and said amen chapter fortytwo m ichael had planned ahead he had a dozen chemical heat bags with him the kind made for hunters to slip inside the wristbands of their coats he passed them around to us and we put them inside our socks after we waded ashore otherwise i dont know if we would have made it through the snow up that hill not with our pants soaked to the knees rosanna of course wasnt having any issues with the weather with her wings draped around her like a cloak the demonic form she wore seemed inured to the cold and her cloven hooves moved along the frozen stony hillside as nimbly as a mountain goats her barbtipped tail lashing back and forth dramatically as she went sanya walked along behind her then me and michael brought up the rear it wasnt a long walk but it fit in a lot of unpleasantness into a little bit of time the little town had been a company town built up around what looked like an old cannerya long building falling to pieces now at the very end of the ruined street partway up the hill we ran across a trail that had obviously been in use over the past several days someone had kept it clear of snow exposing a path that had been cut into the rock of the hillside including stone stairs that led up to its summit as we went up the stairs the shape at the top of the hill became clearer as light from the large fire beside it revealed it more clearly a lighthouse i murmured or whats left of one it might have been a fiftyfoot tower at one time but it had been broken off perhaps twenty feet up as if snapped by a giants hand beacon towers dotted the shorelines and islands of all of the great lakes and like all such structures they had accumulated more than their due of strange stories i hadnt heard any stories about this onebut staring up at the rough grey stones i got the impression that it might have had something to do with the fact that in order for strange stories to spread someone has to survive a dark encounter in order to start the tale this entire creepy place was giving me the idea that i wasnt merely walking on haunted groundbut that i was walking on majorleague haunted ground the kind of place that had never bowed its head to the advance of progress and civilization to science and reason that had no more regard for those children of human intellect than it did for their progenitors the island seemed almost alive aware of my presence in a sense that i couldnt really tangibly defineaware of it and sullenly spitefully hostile to it but that wasnt the creepy part the creepy part was that it felt familiar walking up those stone steps my legs settled into a steady pattern of motion as if theyd already walked up that path a thousand times i swerved slightly on one step for no reason that i could see only to hear michael behind me continue walking in a straight line and slip as the stone he stepped on shifted beneath his foot i found myself counting silently to myself backward and when i hit zero we mounted the last step and reached the summit of the hill somehow i knew even before i saw it that one side of the old lighthouse would be torn open to the sky revealing an interior that was as hollowedout and empty as the inside of a rifle barrel i knew that the little stone cottage built against the base of the tower would still be reasonably intact though about half of the slatetile roof had collapsed inward and would need repairs i knew that it had been made from the stones of the collapsed lighthouse i knew that the front door rattled when you opened it and that the back door which wasnt in sight from here would swell up during a rain and get stuck in its frame much like the door at at home i also knew that as freaking weird as all of that was i couldnt afford to let any of it matter right now nicodemus and company were waiting for us the sleeting rain was starting to cover everything in a thin layer of ice but the bonfire laid on the ground before the opening in the wall of the tower was large enough to ignore it the flames leapt ten or twelve feet in the air and burned with an eerie violettinged light and the ice forming everywhere created the illusion of a purple haze that clung to anything inanimate beside the bonfire stones had been piled up into something that resembled the throne of some ancient pagan king nicodemus sat atop them of course tessa stood at his right hand entirely in human form for the first time since i had seen her she was a little slip of a girl who barely looked old enough to hold a drivers license and was dressed in something black and skintight deirdre knelt at nicodemuss feet and with the three of them together like that i could see the blending of the parents features in their daughter especially around the eyes deirdres showed a full measure of both nicodemuss soulless calculation and tessas heartless selfishness magog crouched at the base of the pile of stones apelike and enormous sullen eyes burning with bloodlust the spined denarian i had beaten down with the silver constructhand lay reclining on the ground beside magog his face twisted with hate one hand twisting and clenchingbut his maimed body was otherwise motionless my heart sped up in sudden excitement there were still six of them they hadnt broken ivy yet i held up a hand we came to a stop while rosanna lightly mounted the steps to kneel down at tessas right hand wow i drawled that isnt a contrived tableau or anything are you here to do business or did you get lost on your way to auditions for family feud gunman in the cottage sanya murmured very quietly beasts in the shadows behind the tower michael whispered i kept myself from looking if my friends said there were bad guys there they were there end of story good evening dresden nicodemus said have you brought the merchandise i jingled the crown royal bag and bumped the hilt of shiros sword hanging over my shoulder with the side of my head yep but you knew that already or rosie there wouldnt have brought us this far so lets skip the small talk show me the girl by all means nicodemus said he gestured with one hand and the shadowshis shadow i should saysuddenly fell away from the interior of the ruined lighthouse tower red light filled that space pouring up from the sigils and glyphs of the most elaborate greater circle i had ever seenand id seen one made of silver gold and precious stones this one incorporated all of those things plus artgrotesque pieces mostlysound ringing forth in gentle steady waves from upright tuning forks and tubular bells and light focused through prisms and crystals refracted into dozens of colors that split and bent into perfectly geometric shapes in the air around the circle ivy was trapped inside ive seen some fairly extreme abuse in my time but it never gets easier to see more of it nicks people had gone with most of the classics for breaking someone down and then added in a few twists that wouldnt be available to regular folks theyd taken ivys clothes for starters which in this weather was sadistic on multiple levels theyd shaved her hair away leaving her bald except for a couple of sad ragged little tufts of gold she was curled up into a fetal position and she floated in the air spinning slowly and apparently at random her eyes were tightly closed her face pale with disorientation terrified outside the circle they had chained a number of those hideous hunting beasts hairless creatures that resembled nothing in the animal kingdom but fell somewhere between a big panther and a wolf the creatures looked hungry and stared intently at the floating morsel one of them snarled and threw itself to the end of its chain in an effort to snap its fanged maw closed upon the girls vulnerable flesh it couldnt reach her but ivy twitched and let out a thready whimper as she spun and twirleda deliberate echo of what shed done to magog at the aquarium i felt certainthe motion revealed dozens of tiny scratches and bruises evidence of a small legion of petty cruelties they would however seem nightmarish enough to a child who had never experienced real pain of her own all of thisthe pain the helplessness the indignity all of itwould be that much more horrific and terrifying to ivy for its novelty say what i would about pain being a part of the human condition when it comes to seeing it inflicted on children im as hypocritical as the day is long some things just shouldnt happen there you see the lord of the denarians said safe and sound as agreed i turned my gaze back to nicodemus who was about ten seconds from an ass kicking and caught a little glimmer of something approximating satisfaction in his eyes that made my combatreadying reflexes cool off almost instantly ivys treatment hadnt been only about putting her in the proper frame of mind to manipulate her it had also been about manipulating me it wasnt even all that tough to understand why after all id been in a situation something like this before it wasnt enough for the denarians to simply acquire the sword they couldnt break or smash or melt fidelacchius any more than the church could smash or melt the thirty silver coins the power of the sword was more than merely physical and as long as it was wielded by those of pure heart and intent it would take more than mere physical means to undo it of course if you handed the sword to for example a wizard who was known for playing it shady once in a while and who was known for having a bad temper and who was known for occasionally losing it and maybe for burning down a building or two when he got angry that could change the situation entirely put him in an intense situation give him a really good reason to be angry give him a mighty magical weapon near at hand and he might well seize it and use it out of sheer outragedespite the fact that he wouldnt exactly be acting from entirely pure motives by doing so after all i had come here ostensibly in peace to offer up the sword as a sacrifice for the life of a child if i then took up that same weapon and used it to strike at nicodemus and company instead i its rightful bearer would be employing fidelacchius the sword of faith in an act of treachery once id done that then the sword would just be a sword an object of steel and wood once id done that then nicodemus and his insane little family could destroy the weapon they needed someone to make that mistake someone to make that choice in order to unmake the weapon just as any bearer of a coin had to make the choice to give it up to be free of the fallen inside they needed someone with a right to the sword to choose to abuse that right id made that mistake once already on a stormy night much like this one when michael had asked me to carry amoracchius for him id used the sword of love to try to save my ass from the consequences of my own bad decisions and nearly gotten it destroyed as a result it would have been unmade in fact if not for the intervention of my brothereven if i hadnt known about our kinship at the time thomas had hed been looking out for his little brother even then dont get me wrong at times i can be a little thickparticularly when theres a woman involved theres just no way im stupid enough to make a mistake quite that enormous twice but nicodemus didnt know that id made it even once now did he oh he knew me pretty well he knew how angry his actions had made me how i would react to the sight of what theyd done to ivyand he was counting on me to react according to my nature in order to help him unmake fidelacchius this was going to be a dangerous game going up against an opponent who had been around as long as nick had but i couldnt win if i didnt playand i needed to buy a little more time and make sure that both of our prizes were on hand before we started the fireworks so i gave him what he wanted i slammed the end of my staff down onto the ground with my left hand reached up to seize the hilt of fidelacchius with my right and snarled get her the hell out of that thing nicodemus right now they laughed at me all of them together relaxed and insulting it would have sounded rehearsed if it were any less well coordinated instead it came off like something theyd done so often over the years that it simply came naturally now look at his face tessa murmured a littlegirl giggle in her voice its all red i clenched my jaw as hard as i could it wasnt much of a stretch to keep pretending to be angry but i tried to go all method actor on them eat your heart out sir ian i jerked the sword a couple of inches from its sheath im warning you i said trying to get a good look around let the girl go before this gets ugly i must have been doing a pretty good job with the acting michaels voice highpitched with alarm came from behind me harry he said urgently wait i took two steps forward ignoring michael and drew the sword from its sheath fidelacchius was a classic chiseltipped katana encased in what looked like an old wooden walking cane id kept the blade clean and oiled while it was in my care it came free of its casing without a sound and gleamed coldly in the violet light of the fire i brought the sword i told nicodemus throwing some taunt into my tone see you wanted this right in exchange for the girl his eyes narrowed as he stared at the blade and i noticed for the first time that he wore a sword of his own at his hipas did tessa for that matter super i made a mental note not to try fencing any of them im tall and quick and ive got a lunge that can hit from halfway across the county but when it comes to deadly swordplay im a piker compared to the serious swordsmen like michaeland michael considered himself barely more than a mild challenge to nicodemus what on earth makes you think hes going to go through with the deal wizard tessa asked me her voice a purr now that youre here the sword is here the coins are here maybe it escaped your notice bitch i snarled but the sword is here and the other two are as well maybe you want to think twice before making a fight of it thorned namshiel let out a croaking laugh you think six of us fear facing two knights i think theres about five and a half of you stumpy i shot back taking another step toward them i could see a little more of the towers interior from there and for all you know youre facing three knights nicodemus smiled showing teeth and for all michael and sanya know dresden the two of them are facing seven denarians not six you did lead them here after all harry michael said again his tone tense shut up i half screamed at nicodemus taking several steps closer almost magog let out a snorting rumble and shuffled a yard closer to me scraping at the ground with his feet and knuckles shaking his shaggy horned head threateningly i hefted the sword and bared my teeth in a snarl oh you want some of this magilla i taunted taking two more steps forward come get some ill show you what keeps happening to kong there at the base of the tower wall a crumpled human form bloodied bruised halffrozen but alive he lifted his face as i came into sight and i met the gaze of gentleman johnnie marcone theyd tied him to the wall with ropessomething of a mercy since metal chains would probably have killed him given the weather over the past few days one side of his face was puffy with bruises but both eyes were open he had a lot of blood on one side of his head in fact hells bells something had ripped off the top half of his left ear not neatly either the flesh had been raggedly torn the knuckles of his right hand were thickly crusted with blood marcone had torn them open on something before hed been bound hed fought them i stopped talking trash and started backpedaling toward michael and sanya immediately magog froze his head tilted comically to one side his expression confused nicodemus sat up in place on the throne sensing that the plan hed thought was going along so swimmingly had begun to fall apart michael i said and tossed fidelacchius into the air behind me kill them nicodemus snapped his voice ringing over the hilltop kill them now tessa let out a scream that sounded almost orgasmic and sections of scarletandblack chitin seemed to simply rip their way out of her flesh her body stretching and distending into her mantis shape deirdre hissed and arched her back in a kinetic echo of her mother her hair lengthening into steely blades her skin darkening rosanna howled and called firespecifically hellfireinto her spread hands while thorned namshiel lifted his hand into the air and gathered flickers of green lightning between his fingertips magog simply bellowed and charged and with howls of hunger and rage a dozen hairless beasts bounded from the shadows all around us and flung themselves at us with bloodthirsty disregard for their own lives and as if all of that werent enough half a dozen points of brilliant red light the emanations of laser sights of hidden gunmen flashed at us through the mist and sleet oh yeah super plan harry i had them right where i wanted them chapter fortythree i didnt stop to see what happened to the sword id just thrown toward michael i plunged my hand into my duster and came out with the sawedoff shotgun i dropped my staff lifted the gun in both hands turned my face away and shouted fire in the hole a second before i pulled the trigger once upon a time id seen kincaid use dragons breath rounds against red court vampires in a fight at wrigley field it had been impressive as hell watching those shotgun rounds belch out jets of flame forty feet long since then id done a bit of research on fun things you can fire out of a shotgun and as it turns out theres all kinds of interesting stuff you can shoot at people its astonishing really the creativity that goes into the design of all the different specialized ammunition available on the market today my personal favorite a round known as the fireball it fires out a spray of superheated particles of metaltiny tiny bits of metal blazing away at a temperature of over three thousand degrees they spread out into an enormous cone of fire and light more than two hundred and fifty feet long brighter and hotter than any fireworks youve ever seen forestry services use them to start backfires and special weapons units use them to create enormous eyecatching diversions i unleashed two fireball rounds simultaneously straight up into the air and for an instant turned that weirdly firelit hilltop as bright as a midsummer noon even with my eyes closed and my face turned away the world turned bright pink through my eyelids i heard gunfire from the direction of the cottage and more from the tree line off to the left but whatever gunmen nicodemus had positioned there had been blinded by the flash and it would take time for their night vision to recover that had been half the point of using the fireball rounds there in the dark it wouldnt give us much time to act no more than a handful of secondsbut a lot can happen in a handful of seconds if youre willing to use them well i dropped the shotgun grabbed my staff and charged forward screaming like a madman michael and sanya came hard on my heels michael bore amoracchius in his right hand and fidelacchius in his left and as he ran both blades suddenly became limned in a low flickering silver light one of the beasts that had been lurking behind the tower had bounded forward at nicodemuss command even blinded by the flash but it had the bad fortune to rush past me directly at michael the knight of the cross twisted his body left then right delivering a pair of slashes with each weapon there were hissthumps of swift impact a scream of pain from the beast and michael pounded on barely even slowing his stride leaving the stilltwitching body of the beast on the ground behind him then the air shook with the force of magogs battle roar and i jerked my gaze around to find the huge denarian thundering directly toward me id already tested my will against magogs power and i knew i could stop him if i had to do it i also knew that it would take an enormous effort to manage it and leave me vulnerable to one of his companionsso instead of trying to stop him i called upon my will and as the apelike creature bore down upon me i swept my staff in an upcurving stroke like the swing of a golf club and cried forzare the unseen force of my will reached out adding to the momentum of magogs charge and lifting him from the ground with a howl magog went flying over our heads and arched out into the air and over the steep rocky hillside wed just climbed the animalistic howl broke out into savage words in some ancientsounding tongue interspersed with screams of fury and grunts of pain as the huge denarian bounced down the stony frozen hillside he sounded more angry than injured and i knew that id taken him out of the equation for only a moment at most hopefully that would be enough deirdre came down from the mound of stones using all four limbs and individual bladestrands of her hair interchangeably for locomotion so that she looked like some kind of bizarre enormous spideruntil sanya raised his kalashnikov and began firing at her none of that sprayandpray automatic fire either the russian skidded to a stop and took swift aim he bounced one round off a rock an inch to deirdres left put the second shot through her thigh and raised a cloud of sparks from the steely blades of her hair near her skull with a third round she let out a shriek of startled pain and fear and scuttled sideways off into the shadows as swiftly as a roach caught out in the middle of the floor when the light comes on gunfire came at us from both sides still more or less blind and random but no less lethal for that bullets are the damnedest things going by they arent dramatic by themselves they sound almost like big bugs like something that might buzz by you real fast out in the country on a hot muggy summer afternoon its almost hard to feel afraid of them until it truly hits you exactly what they are its kind of handy actually that moment of disconnection between the time your senses tell you that death is flicking around randomly a couple of feet away and the time your mind manages to make you understand that moving around in it is an awful idea it gives you time to act before you get so scared that you just find a shady spot and stay there go go go i called still charging forward our only chance was to keep moving ahead to rattle nicodemus and company into jumping out of the way and to get into the only shelter on that hilltop kill them nicodemus roared his voice furious and then there was the sound of rushing wind from overhead he must have taken to the sky flying upon that shadow of his as if upon enormous bat wings more of the beasts had closed on michael and both swords were at work again striking out silver light gleaming more brightly now from their blades sanya let out a shout and more light flooded the hilltop casting my own shadow out darker in front of me as esperacchius joined the battle and more of the beasts cries of pain shook the air in front of me thorned namshiel howled out in frustration and evident terror in some tongue i didnt know and i saw that both tessa and hellmaid rosanna had pulled a vanishing act namshiel his arm outstretched in the general direction of the far side of the stone throne added despair in his voice come back then he turned toward me as he heard my feet churning through the wet snow he still held a corona of green lightning in his spiny hand and as his eyes focused on my general location he bared his teeth in a snarl of bitter hatred and flung out his hand hurling a sphere of crackling emerald electricity at me my shield bracelet was ready to go and i had terror and rage and determination in plenty to empower my defenses i deflected the sphere at an angle and sent it rebounding harmlessly up into the sky amateur puppy namshiel snarled and began to gather more sickly green power at his fingertips he made an odd little gesture and flicked his fingers and suddenly five tiny threads of green light leapt toward me on five separate spiraling paths i brought my shield around to intersect the new attackand realized at the last second that each individual thread of energy was coming at me on a slightly different wavelength of the spectrum of magical energy a variance of frequencies that my shield couldnt stretch to cover not all at the same time anyway i countered three of them and nearly got the fourth but it slipped by me and i never even touched the fifth strand something that felt like cold greasy piano wire wrapped around my throat and i couldnt breathe insufferable arrogant little monkey namshiel hissed playing with the fires of creation binding your soul to it as if you were one of us how dare you so presume how dare you wield soulfire against me i who was there when your pathetic kind was hewn from the muck it wasnt so much being strangled to death that i objected to or even the megalomaniacal monologue i was being subjected to in the process i just wished that i knew what the hell he was talking about granted i had busted him up pretty good with that silver hand thing but he was taking it so freaking personally i lost track of what id been thinking my head hurt so did my neck thorned namshiel was ranting about something practically foaming at the mouth reallyright up until amoracchius flashed in a line of silver fire and thorned namshiels head hopped up off his shoulders tumbled twice and fell into the snow suddenly i took a deep breath and the world started sorting itself out again michael stepped forward took one look at namshiels body and hewed the right hand off at the wrist he picked up the hand and dropped it into a pouch on his sword belt meanwhile sanya shouldered his rifle and dragged me to my feet go i choked out barely able to get the words out through my halfcrushed throat i regained my own feet and waved sanya off me gesturing ahead the lighthouse fast sanya looked from me to the hollow tower and promptly sheathed his sword to take up his rifle again the big russian advanced on the tower the kalashnikov at his shoulder and began putting precise shots through the heads of each of the beasts that had been chained to the walls inside to torment ivy who still floated bound within the greater circle i followed sanya as quickly as i could wheezing in breaths through my aching neck by the time michael and i had gotten into the shelter of the mostly closed ring of the towers stones the gunfire from around us had begun to close in on us again as the gunmens night vision returned the tiny window of opportunity the flash of the fireball rounds had created had waned how did you know michael asked panting how did you know they would break if we charged them you dont survive two thousand years in a game like this one without predator reflexes i replied any predator in the world reacts the same way to a loud noise a bright flash and a noisy and unexpected charge they get the hell out of the way cant really help themselves habit of a couple millennia is a bitch to break sanya calmly shot another beast i shrugged nicodemus and company thought that they knew how things were going to proceed and when they didnt go the way they expected they got flustered so the nickelheads got clear i pursed my lips of course theyre going to be back in a minute and very upset hey there marcone dresden marcone said as if wed passed each other outside the coffee shop he sounded a little tired but calm all things considered that was probably an indicator of exactly how much moxie the crime lord had can you help the child dammit thats the thing i hate most about marcone every once in a while he says or does something that makes it difficult to label him scum criminal and file him neatly away in a drawer somewhere i glared at him he returned the glare with a faint knowing smile i muttered under my breath and turned to study the elaborate circle while sanya finished the last of the beasts ive never seen anything like this michael said quietly staring i didnt blame him even among professionals this circle was impressive lots of luminous glowing lines and swirls involved and that always looks fantastic especially at night the gold and silver and precious stones didnt hurt things either the light and music show being put on by the chimes and crystals added a wonderful little eerie edge to it all especially given the grotesque art that framed the interior magical symbology this is some uppertier stuff i said quietly it will be another century maybe two before im good enough to come close to this level of work its delicate one single thing a fraction of an inch out of place and the whole thing goes kablooie its powerful when youre putting this together if any one of a couple of dozen of the power flows slips for even an instant the whole thing goes out of balance and could go up with enough force to blow the top off of this whole hillside it took a freaking genius to put this together michael i hefted my staff fortunately i said and took a twohanded swing at the nearest stand of slender delicate crystal it shattered with gratifying ease and the encasing light around the greater circle began to waver and dissipate it only takes a monkey with a big stick to take it apart and i waded into the circle smashing things with my staff it was therapeutic god knows how many times the bad guys had destroyed the careful work of lifetimes when theyd robbed people of homes of loved ones of life itself it felt sort of nice to bring a little cup of shiva d into their lives for a change i shattered the crystals that bent light into a cage to hold the archive prisoner i bent and mashed the tuning forks that focused sound into chains i crushed the depictions of bondage and imprisonment meant to restrain the very idea of freedom and from there i went on to break ivory rune sticks to crush glyphscribed gems to pound into illegibility golden plates inscribed with sigils of imprisonment im not sure at which point i started screaming in outrage somewhere along the line though it hit me that these people had taken magic the power of life of creation a force meant to create and protect to learn and preserve and they had bent and twisted it into a blasphemy an obscenity they had used it to imprison and torment to torture and maim all in an attempt to enslave and destroy worse they had turned magic against the archive against the safeguard of knowledge itselfand still worse against a child i didnt stop until i had shattered their expensive elaborate elegant torture chamber until i could deliberately drag my staff across the last smooth golden circle at the innermost point of the design marring it all the way across its surface breaking the last remaining structure of the spell the energies of the prison let loose with an outraged howl sailing straight up into the air overhead in a column of furious purple light i thought i could see faces twisting and spinning inside it for a few seconds but then the light faded and ivy fell limply to the cold ground just a naked little girl bruised and scratched and halfunconscious with cold michael was at my side at once removing his cloak i took it and wrapped ivy in it she made whimpering sounds of protest but she wasnt really conscious i picked her up and held her close to me getting as much of my own coat around her as i could i looked up and found marcone watching me steadily sanya had cut him free from the wall and evidently given the crime lord the cloak off his back marcone now hunched against the sleet in the white cloak holding one of the chemical warming packs between his hands he stood just a bit over average height and was of medium build so sanyas cloak covered him like a blanket will she be all right marcone asked she will i said with determination she damned well will down barked sanya bullets raised sparks off the inside of the lighthouse and rattled wildly around its interior everyone got down i made sure i had my body and my duster between ivy and any incoming rounds sanya leaned out for a second and squeezed off a couple of shots then hurriedly got back under cover again the volume of fire from the outside grew theyre bringing up reinforcements from down the hill sanya reported heavier weapons too marcone glanced around the featureless interior of the ruined lighthouse if any of them have grenades this is going to be a relatively brief rescue operation sanya leaned out and snapped off another pair of shots barely getting back before return fire started chewing at the stone where hed been he muttered under his breath and changed magazines on his rifle the enemy gunfire suddenly ceased there was silence on the hilltop for twenty or thirty seconds then nicodemuss voice filled with anger came through the air dresden what i called back im going to give you one chance to survive this give me the girl give me the coins give me the sword do that and ill let you walk away alive hah i said it was possible that i didnt feel quite as confident as i sounded or maybe ill just leave from here cross into the nevernever from where youre standing nicodemus asked youd be better off asking the russian to put a bullet through your head for you i know what lives on the other side given that theyd chosen this location for the greater circle precisely because it was a source of intense dark energy i had no trouble believing that it connected to some nasty portions of the nevernever there was every chance that nicodemus was not bluffing how do i know that you wont kill me the minute you get what you want i called back harry michael hissed i shushed him we both know what my word is worth nicodemus said his voice dry really dresden if we cant trust each other whats the point in talking at all heh gaining enough time to await the second half of what those fireballs were supposed to accomplish thats what the twin twohundredfiftyfoot jets of fire had briefly blinded our enemies true but theyd done something else too marcone tilted his head to one side for a moment and then murmured does anyone else hearstrings ah i said and pumped my fist in the air ahhahahah have you ever heard anything so magnificently pompous and overblown in your life deep ringing french horns joined the string sections echoing over the hilltop what is that sanya murmured that i crowed is wagner baby never let it be said that a chooser of the slain cant make an entrance miss gard brought the reconditioned huey up from the eastern side of the island flying about a quarter of an inch over the treetops blasting the ride of the valkyries from loudspeakers mounted on the choppers underside wind sleet and all still she flew flawlessly through the night having used the twin jets of the fireball rounds visible for miles over the pitchblack lake to orient herself as to where to arrive the huey turned broadside as it rose over the hilltop music blaring loud enough to shake snow from the treetops the side door of the chopper was open revealing mister hendricks manning a rotatingbarreled minigun fixed to the deck of the helicoptercompletely illegally of course but then i suppose thats really one major advantage to working with criminals they just dont care about that sort of thing the barrels began to spin and a tongue of flame licked out from the front of the gun snow and earth erupted into the air in a long trench in front of the cannon i risked a peek and saw men clad in dark fatigues leaping for cover as a swath of devastation slewed back and forth across the open hilltop and pounded the mound of stones into a mound of gravel theres our ride i said lets go sanya led the way firing off more or less random shots at anyone who wasnt already lying flat in an effort to avoid fire from the gun on the helicopter some of nicodemuss troops were crazier than others several of them jumped up and tried to come after us that minigun had been designed to shoot down airplanes what the rounds left of human bodies was barely recognizable as such there was no place for the chopper to land but a line came down from the other side lowered by a winch while the aircraft hovered above us i looked up to see luccio operating the winch her face pale but her eyes glittering with excitement she was how gard had been able to know where to look for the signalid given anastasia a couple of my hairs to use in a tracking spell and shed been following me ever since i left to meet rosanna for the trade the line came down with a lift harness attached to it marcone i shouted over the sound of the rotors and the minigunwhich is to say i was more or less mouthing it exaggeratedly you first that was the deal he shook his head and pointed his finger at ivy i snarled and pushed the girl into his arms then started slapping the harness over him he got it after a second and in a couple more we had him secured in the harness and holding the semiconscious ivy tight against him i gave luccio the thumbsup and marcone and ivy went zipping gracefully up the line to the chopper wrapped in the white cloak the scarlet crosses on it standing out sharply in the winter light luccio helped haul them in and a second later the empty harness came down again sanya i said the russian passed me the kalashnikov and slipped into the harness then ascended to the helicopter again the empty harness came downthough now there were occasional bursts of heavier rounds coming from down the slope of the hillside as evidenced by tracer fire that would sometimes go tumbling by in the night it would be immediately answered by the far heavier fire of the minigun but gard couldnt possibly keep the chopper there for long harry michael said offering me the harness i was about to take it but by chance i looked up and saw gard looking down at us through the plexiglas bubble around the pilots seatlooking at michael with an absolutely unnerving intensity that i had seen on her face once before and my heart started hammering in terror the last time shed looked like that id been in an alley outside bock ordered books back in chicago and a necromancer named corpsetaker and a ghoul named li xian had been about to murder me a few minutes later gard had told marcone that she had seen that it was my fate to die then and there the only reason that i survived it was that marcone had intervened but even if id never seen that look on her face before i figured that anytime a valkyrie hovering over a battlefield suddenly gets real interested in a particular warrior it aint good id made the grasshopper a promise if things were about to get hairy for whoever was left on the ground it wouldnt be mollys dad that had to deal with it you first i said he started to argue i shoved the harness into his chest dammit michael he grimaced shook his head at me and then sheathed amoracchius still holding fidelacchius in his hand he shrugged quickly into the harness i gave luccio the thumbsup and michael began to rise gard frowned faintly and some of my screaming tension started to ease tessa and rosanna came out from behind veils that were as good as anything molly could have done and i didnt have to be sherlock to deduce who had done the lions share of the work on the greater circle that had contained the archive i had half a second to act but i got tangled in the strap of sanyas gun which hed handed me so that i could defend myself in case i was suddenly attacked thank you sanya tessa her pretty human face showing her eyes gleaming with manic glee swept a mantis claw at my head and i at least managed to interpose the rifle before she ripped my head off only instead of smashing the gun as id expected she ripped it out of my hand just as easily as taking candy from a baby and spun away from me then she winked at me blew me a kiss and opened fire on michael with the kalashnikov on full automatic from no more than ten feet away my friend didnt scream as bullets tore into him he just jerked once in a spray of scarlet and went limp fidelacchius tumbled from his fingers and fell to the ground sparks flew from the huey as the bullets tore into it too and a burst of flame and smoke poured from a vent on one side of its fuselage it dipped sharply to one side and for a second i thought it was simply going to roll over and into the groundbut then it recovered drunkenly gathering momentum like a car sliding down an icy hill still dragging my friends unmoving body on the trailing cable like a baited hook at the end of a fishing line and vanished into the darkness chapter fortyfour e ven as some part of me noted all of that happening the rest of me started screaming in raw red rage in agony in denial i was pretty sure i had worked out who had taken my blasting rod away i was pretty sure i knew why theyd done it i even thought that looked at from a certain point of view it might not have been an entirely stupid idea but as of now i officially did not care i didnt have my blasting rod with me and i was not sure that my raw power no matter how furious would be enough to hurt tessa through the defenses the fallen gave her i had never been able to attain the kind of precision i would need without artificial aid as of right now i officially did not care about that either i focused my rage focused my anger focused my hate and my denial and my pain i blocked away everything in the entire universe but the thought of my friends bloody body hanging from that rope and a spot two inches across in the center of tessas chest then i drew in a breath whirling a hand over my head and bellowed through my ragged throat so loudly that it felt like something tore fuego pyrofuego i stabbed the first two fingers of my right hand forward as i did unleashing my fury and my will burn a bar of bluewhite fire so dense that it was nearly a solid object lashed across the distance from me to tessa and slammed into her like an enormous spear the mantislike denarian threw back her pretty face and screamed in agony as the shaft of fire bored cleanly through her melting a wide hole that burned wider still before searing itself shut she went down howling and thrashing burned by fire far deadlier and more destructive than any i had ever called before with a blasting rod or without one i sensed something moving toward me from the side and rolled out of the way just as one of rosannas cloven hooves slashed through the air where my thigh had been an instant before if shed struck she would have opened the flesh to the bone i whipped my staff at her face forcing her to duck away and followed with a surge of will and a shout of forzare it wasnt my best kinetic strike but it was a blow heavy enough to throw her a dozen feet through the air and into a tumble over the ground i seized the hilt of fidelacchius from where the sword had fallen as my fingers closed around the weapon i realized several points of cold logic as if having them explained to me by a calm rational wise old man who was utterly unperturbed by my rage first i realized that i was now alone on an uncharted island in the middle of lake michigan with nothing but madmen and fallen angels for company second that i still had the coins and the sword that nicodemus had been afterand that he was still going to be after them third that the denarians were sure to be really ticked off now that id taken their real prize from them fourth the ground shook as if with the impact of a heavy foot fourth that since i had confounded summers attempt to track me via use of the little oak leaf pin eldest brother gruff had probably been waiting for me to use fire magic in battlethe same magic that i had entwined with the power of the summer lady two years ago at arctis tor it was the most probable reason why mab the most likely suspect for messing with my head would have taken my blasting rod and my memories of how to use fire magic in battleto prevent me from inadvertently revealing my position to summer every time i got into a tussle only now that i had eldest gruff was probably on his way to visit and fifth and last i realized that i had no way to get off this stupid and creepily familiar islandunless i could get down to the docks and to the boat id come in on i still burned with the need to strike back at the people who had hurt my friend but the fact of the matter was that i couldnt strike back at them and surviveand if they took me down id only be handing them weapons to continue the war michael had spent a lifetime fighting to end my only option was to run realistically even escape wasnt looking likelybut it was my only chance so i slid the sword back into its scabbard oriented myself toward the rundown little town where wed first come ashore and ran fast now im not as strong as those really big guys like michael and sanya i dont do swordplay as well as folks like nicodemus or shiro i dont yet have the magical experience and knowhow to outfinesse the really experienced wizards and sorcerers who have been hanging around for centuries like the gatekeeper or thorned namshiel but ill take any of those guys in a footrace guaranteed i runand not so that ill be skinny and look good either i run so that when something that wants to kill me is chasing me ill be good at running and when youve got legs as long as mine youre skinny and in good shape you can really move i hit the woods running like a deer sticking to the path wed broken on the way up the snow made it easy to see the way and though in another hour or two it would be a sheet of frozen ice for the moment the footing was excellent i was benefiting from the chaos caused by gards entrance i could hear all kinds of confusion as men shouted in the woods and tried to figure out what was going on to get the wounded to help and to follow what were probably conflicting orders thanks to holes ripped in their chain of command by hendricks and his minigun radios clicked and voices buzzed over them functioning unreliably as they would in any area so rich with concentrated magical energy the fact that most of the men had had their tongues removed probably didnt help anything either nick should have taken my advice and read that eviloverlord list seriously someone a few yards off to my right shouted something at me it came out as totally mangled gobbledygook i shouted back at him in similar wordless garbage pretending that i didnt have a tongue either and added a rude gesture to the tirade i dont know if it was the perfect charade or if it just shocked him into stunned silence but either way it got the same effect i went on by him without garnering any further reaction whatsoever i thought i was home free as i reached the ruins of the little company town and its one main drag along the shoreline and then i heard magogs bellow coming down the hill behind mecoming fast too easily making twice the speed i could manage that was the damnedest thing about these demonic collaborator types even though they didnt work out and practice they still got to run faster than we dedicated roadsters who actually sweated and strained for our ability to haul ass jerks it seemed clear that magog was coming in pursuit of me or at least that he was coming down the hill toward the dock and the boat off the island to cut off any chance of escape i had little time to pick and choose where to go to avoid his notice and wound up ducking into the long heavily shadowed cavernous length of the building that looked as if it had once been a cannery the roof had fallen through in several places and snow covered perhaps a third of the floor providing the only thing even vaguely like light most of the walls were still standing but i had grave doubts about the floor there wasnt space for much of a basement above the waterline but there was plenty of room to break a leg if i fell through on a weak board i would just have to stay close to the wall and hope for the best for once enemy manpower was working in my favor if nicodemus had brought only his fellow denarians along there would have been nothing but the footprints of cloven hooves and giant mantises and grape apes and whatnot in the snow of the island but no hed had to bring along dozens and dozens of foot soldiers too and as a result there were regular old footprints everywhere one more set more or less wasnt going to stand out so all i had to do was get into the building get out of sight and lie low until magog had gone past i had no sooner crouched down and begun my impersonation of a mouse than the ancient halfrotted wood of the old cannery shuddered beneath me a vibration that i felt in the soles of my feet then another and another rhythmic like slow footsteps they were followed by the sound of magogs approach a heavy leathery shuffling through the snow accompanied by the steady heave of lungs like a blacksmiths bellows then i heard magog slide to a sudden halt in the snow and snort in surprisethen let out an enormous roar of challenge and a voice a very deep resonant voice said be thou gone from this place creature my quarrel is not with thee magog answered with a howl and spat out words in a language i did not understand be that as it may elder one the huge voice said gently and with respect i also have a duty from which i may not waver we need not be at odds this night depart in peace elder one with your beast of burden magog snarled again in that foreign tongue the deep voice hardened i seek no quarrel with thee fallen one i pray thee do not mistake peaceable intention for weakness i do not fear thee begone or i will smite thee down the gorillalike denarian howled i heard its claws dig and rip at the ground as it hurtled forward toward the source of the resonant voice magog it seemed had a really limited vocabulary when it came to repartee i couldnt see what happened next there was a flash of goldgreen light like sunlight reflected from fresh spring grass and a detonation in the air a sound that was not quite a crack of thunder not quite an explosion of fire it wasnt even loud so much as it was pervasive something that i felt along the whole surface of my body as much as i did on my eardrums the wall of the cannery shattered inward and magogwhat was left of magogcame hurtling through it it landed on the ground about twenty feet away from me enormous sections were missing from the front of the gorillalike body including its thighs and most of the front half of its torso it wasnt a messy wound either the empty chunks were limned with a gentle yellowgreen glow that seemed to seal in any blood even as i watched magog quivered once then went limp tiny sprouts of green flowered up from the fallen corpse over the course of a couple of seconds leaves spreading then budding out into wildflowers in a riot of colors the coating of flowering plants seemed to devour the body of the gorilla from around the mortal body beneaththat of a muscular young man which gradually emerged though was still modestly shrouded in a veil of flowers he was thoroughly dead his eyes glassy empty and there were flowers growing in a hole where his heart had been he wore a leather collar and hanging from it in a little rubber frame like a dog tag was another blackened denarius he was a kid mollys age at the oldest from outside there was a deep resonant sigh then another heavy groundshuddering thump and another coming closer my heart jumped right up into my teeth sure i had no idea who that really was out there but all those thees just screamed that it was one of the sidhe they really got into the archaic modes of speechor maybe it was fairer to say that they never got out of them anyway odds were running high that this was eldest brother gruff come to settle up with winters champion in this affair and given that hed just swatted down one of the denarians like he was an uppity pixie it didnt bode real well for me i found myself taking a step back as that thumping sound came again and the floorboard beneath my foot creaked precariously that gave me an idea the bigger they are et cetera if eldest gruff was even bigger than the last one had been maybe i could use the rickety flooring against himlong enough to get myself out to the boat and off the island in any case open water was another fantastic neutralizer for the enormous size discrepancy setting realistic goals has always been the key to my success i didnt have to win a fight with this thing i just had to survive long enough to run away i took a chance picked the most solidlooking floorboard i could see and eased across the floor to the far side of the building the one nearest the water and turned to face the hole in the wall that magogs body had smashed open on its way in thump thump thump i readied my will and shook out my shield bracelet in case i needed it i lifted my staff and pointed it at where i thought eldest gruff s head might be when he came in so he would know i was serious thump thump thump i adjusted the aim on the staff a little higher thump thump sweat trickled off my brow thump thump how far did this guy have to walk thump thump this was just getting ridiculous now thump thump and eldest gruff appeared in the opening he was five feet tall fivetwo tops he wore a robe with a cowl pulled back so that i could clearly see his curling rams horns the goatlike features the long white beard the yellow eyes with their hourglass pupils and in his right hand he carried a wooden staff carved with runes that looked almost precisely like my own he took a limping step forward leaning on his staff and when he planted the tool on the ground it flickered with green light that then splashed out onto the earth beneath it spreading outward in a resonating wave thump the floorboards creaked beneath him and he came to a cautious stop and faced me quietly both hands on his staff his robe was belted with an old bit of simple rope there were three stoles hanging through itpurple ones faded and frayed with the passage of time those were the mantles worn by members of the senior council the leaders of the white council of wizards they were generally speaking the oldest and strongest wizards on the planet and eldest brother gruff had evidently killed three of them in duels this i said has really not been my day the gruff regarded me solemnly hail young wizard he had a deep resonant voice far too huge and rich for the frame it came from thou knowest why i have come to slay me most likely i said aye said the gruff by my queens command and in defense of summers honor why i asked him why would summer want marcone taken by the denarians why would summer want the archive under their control the gruff only stared at me for a long moment but when he spoke i could have sworn that his voice sounded pensive maybe even troubled it is not my place to know such thingsor to ask the gruffs are summers champion in this matter arent they i demanded if not you then who what of thee wizard the gruff countered hast thou asked why the wicked queen of winter would wish thee to prevent marcone from being taken by those servants of the darkest shadow why she who embodies destruction and death would wish to protect and preserve the archive i have actually i said and what answers hast thou found gruff i said i find myself largely clueless about why mortal women do what they do it will take a wiser man than me to understand whats in a fae womans mind eldest gruff stared at me blankly for a second then he threw back his head and made a sound thatwell more than anything it sounded like a donkey heehaw heehaw heehaw he was laughing i laughed too i couldnt help it the whole day had just been too much and the laugh just felt too good i laughed until my stomach hurt and when the gruff saw me laughing it only made him laugh harderand more like a donkeyand that set me off in turn it was a good two or three minutes before we settled down they tell children stories about you guys you know i said still he said i nodded stories about clever little billy goats outsmarting big mean trolls until their bigger stronger brothers come along and put the trolls in their place the gruff grunted he said we hear tales of thee young wizard i blinked you uh we too like stories about his eyes searched his memory for a moment before he smiled pleased the gesture looked pleasantly nonviolent on his face underdogs i snorted well i guess this is another one the gruff s smile faded i dislike being cast as the troll so change the role i said the gruff shook his head that i cannot do i serve summer i serve my queen but its over i said marcone is already free sos ivy but thou art still here upon the field of conflict the gruff said gently as am i and so the matter is not closed and so i must fulfill my obligationsto my great regret wizard i have only admiration for thee in a personal sense i tilted my head and stared hard at him you say that you serve summer and the queen in that order the gruff mirrored my gesture his eyes questioning i fumbled in my pocket and came out with the other thing i had grabbed back at my apartmentthe little silver oak leaf pin mister had been batting all over little chicago id figured that theyd stopped using it to chase me once theyd gotten tired of mister having his catnipped way with them the gruff s eyes widened the confounding enchantment thou didst employ upon our tracking spell was most efficacious i had hoped to ask thee how it was done trade secret i said but you know what came with this pin indeed he said you were made an esquire of summer and granted a boon but he shook his head a boon can be a matter of importance but not one this grave thou canst not ask me to yield to thee in a matter of conflict between the courts themselves i wont i said but just so were clear once both of us have left this island the matter is closed once thou art safe again in chicago aye it would be then i ask for summer to honor its pledge to me and the debt it incurred to me when i struck at winters heart on its behalf the gruff s ears stood up facing me aye i want you i said to get me a doughnut a real genuine chicago doughnut not some glamoured doughnut an actual one freshly made the gruff s teeth began to show as he smiled again of course i said you could deny me the boon i rightfully earned in blood and fire and kill me instead thus ensuring that summer would renege on a debt and never be able to make good on it but i dont think that would be very good for summer and its honor do you indeed not wizard the gruff said indeed it would not be he bowed his head to me likest thou jelly within thy doughnut nay but prithee with sprinkles pon it instead i said solemnly and frosting of white it could take some time to locate such a pastry the gruff said seriously i bowed my head to him i trust in the honor of summers champions that it will arrive in good time he bowed his head in reply understand young wizard i may not aid thee further youre pushing the rules enough already i said dryly believe me i know how that is eldest gruff s golden eyes glittered then he lifted the staff and thumped it quietly onto the floorboards once again there was a pulse of green light and a surge of gentle thunderand he was simply gone so was the silver oak leaf pin just gone from my fingers and i hadnt felt a thing give it up for the fae they can do disappearing like nobodys business maybe i should have taken some lessons it might have helped me get out of this mess alive i made my way carefully back across the creaking floor to the body of the young man he looked relaxed in death peaceful i had the impression that whatever eldest gruff had done to him it had been painless it seemed like the sort of thing the old faerie would do i reached down with my gloved left hand and grasped the tag containing the blackened denarius of magog i jerked it sharply pulling it off the collar and pocketed it careful not to let it touch skin i was getting to be kind of blasй about handling these coins but it was difficult to keep getting terrified over and over again especially given the circumstances the risk of once more exposing my immortal soul to a fiendish presence seemed only a moderate danger compared to what still stalked the night outside the old building speaking of whichi took a deep breath and made my way quietly back out to the street i could still hear shouting from farther up the hillside i heard the sound of a boats engine on the far side of the island there must have been other vessels docked elsewhere along the shore well id known about only the one and it was close i slipped back out of the cannery and hurried down the street as quickly and quietly as i could down past the bottom of the rough stone staircase the boat still floated tied beside the broken stump of an old wooden column i restrained the urge to let out a whoop and settled for hustling down the frozen stones as fast as i could without breaking my neck the water was viciously cold but i still wasnt feeling itwhich probably wasnt a good thing there was going to be hell to pay in afterthought pain when this was over but compared to the other problems id had recently that one was a joy to think about i got to the boat tossed my staff in and clambered aboard i heard a shout up the hillside and froze a flashlight swept back and forth up in the trees but then moved off in another direction i hadnt been seen i grinned like a fool and crept up to the drivers seat once i got the engine started it would attract attention but all i had to do was drive west as fast as i could until i hit ground the whole western shoreline hereabouts was heavily occupied and it should be no problem to get to a spot public enough to avoid any further molestation i eased into the drivers seat and reached for the ignition key but it was gone i felt around for it rosanna had left it in the ignition i specifically remembered that she had done so the shadows rippled away from the passenger seat opposite the drivers seat revealing nicodemus he sat calmly in his black silk shirt and dark trousers the grey noose worn like a tie around his throat a naked sword across his lap his left elbow resting on his left knee in the fingertips of his left hand he held a key ring dangling the greasesmeared ignition key of the boat good evening dresden he said looking for this chapter fortyfive t he sleet had stopped coming down in favor of large wet flakes of snow again the boat rocked gently on the troubled waters of the lake water slapped against the sides and gurgled around the curve of the hull ice had begun to form all along the sides and front of the boat i think there are boat words for all the pieces that were being covered like prow and gunwale but im only vaguely aware of them harry dresden speechless nicodemus said i cant imagine this happens every day i just stared at him in the event that you hadnt worked it out for yourself yet nicodemus said this is endgame dresden the fingers of his right hand stroked the hilt of his sword can you puzzle out the next part or must i explain it to you you want the coins the sword the girl the money and the keys to the monte carlo i said or you shoot me and drop me over the side something like that he said the coins dresden i reached into the pocket of my duster and what the hell i said the crown royal bag was gone i checked my other pockets careful of the coin id taken from magogand careful not to reveal its presence to nicodemus no bag its gone dresden dont even try such a pathetic lie on m its gone i told him with considerable heat none of it feigned eleven coins eleven freaking cursed coins the last time i remembered definitely having them had been up at the tower when id jingled them for nicodemus he stared at me for a moment his eyes searching and then murmured something under his breath whispers rolled from the shadows around him i didnt recognize the language but i did recognize the tone i wondered if the angelic tongue had swear words or if they just said nice words backward or something doog teews doog nicodemuss sword came up as swiftly as a flickering snakes tongue and came to rest against my throat i didnt have time to flinch it was that fast i sucked in a quick breath and held very very still these marks he murmured thorned namshiels strangler spell his eyes drew a line from the last apparent mark on my neck down to the duster pocket that the bag of coins had been in ah the strangulation was the distraction he picked your pocket with one of the other wires before he was incapacitated he did that to saintsomeoneorother in glasgow in the thirteenth century theres nothing like getting taken with an old trick i guess but that meant that namshiel had been working together with someone elsesomeone else who had to have been hanging around to collect the coins after hed taken them from my pocket and tossed them off to the side in the confusion someone who hadnt been pulling a fade after all tessa and rosanna i said quietly they got their collection of thugs back they bailed at just the right moment to ruin your plan too deceitful bitches nicodemus murmured one of them is our own judas i was sure of it i lifted my eyebrows what thats why i let them handle the more shall we say memorable aspects of the archives initiation to our world nicodemus said i suppose now that the child is free shell have some rather unpleasant associations with those two and youre telling me this why he shrugged a shoulder its somewhat ironic dresden that i can talk to you about this particular aspect of family business youre the only one that im sure hasnt gone over to this new forcethis black council of yours how can you be so sure about me i asked him please no one so obstreperous has been corrupted by anything but his own pure muleheadedness nicodemus shook his head never taking his eyes off me still my time here has not been wasted the knights carried away namshiels coin so tessa has lost her sorcery teacher i heard magogs bellow end quite abruptly a few moments ago just before you walked out of the same building so with any luck tessas heaviest bruiser is out of the game for a time as well eh nicodemus smiled cheerily at me perhaps his collar is in one of your pockets and i have fidelacchius removal of one of the three is profit enough for one operation even if i did lose this chance at gaining control of the archive what makes you think i said that you have fidelacchius i told you nicodemus said this is endgame no more playing the pitch and intonation of his voice changed and though he still spoke in my direction it was clear that he was no longer speaking to me shadow if you would disable dresden well talk some sense into him later in a quieter setting he was talking to lasciels shadow hell wizards didnt have a monopoly on arrogance neither did the knights of the cross i stiffened in place my mouth halfopen then i fell over sideways body resting against the boats steering wheel my spine ramrod straight i didnt move not one little twitch nicodemus sighed and shook his head dresden i truly regret this necessity but time is growing short i must act and your talents could prove useful youll see once weve cleared some of these wellintentioned idiots out of our way he reached for fidelacchius and i punched him in the neck then i seized the noose and jerked it tight i hung on pulling it tighter the noose another leftover from judass field made nicodemus more or less invulnerable to harmfrom everything but itself nicodemus had worn the thing for centuries as far as i knew i was the only one who had worked out how to hurt him i was the only one who had truly terrified him he met my eyes for a panicked second lasciels shadow i told him doesnt live here anymore the fallen have no power over me and neither do you i jerked the noose a little tighter nicodemus would have screamed if he could have he thrashed uselessly reaching for his sword i kicked it out of reach he reached up and raked at my eyes but i hunched my head down and hung on and his motions were more panicked than practiced his shadow rose up in a wave of darkness and furybut as it plunged down to engulf me white light shone forth from the slits in the wooden cane sheath of the holy sword on my back and the shadow itself let out a hissing leathery scream flinching away from the light i was no knight but the sword did for me what it had always done for themit leveled the field stripping away all the supernatural trappings and leaving only a struggle of mind versus mind and will versus will one man against another nicodemus and i fought for the sword and our lives he threw savage kicks into my wounded leg and even through the blocks lash had taught me to build i felt them i had a great handle on his neck so in reply i slammed my forehead against nicodemuss nose it broke with really satisfying crunching sounds he hammered punches into my short ribs and he knew how to make them hurt unfortunately for him i knew how to be hurt i knew how to be hurt with the best of them it was going to take a whole hell of a lot more pain than this loser could dish out in the time he had left to put me down and i knew it i knew it i tightened my grip on that ancient rope and i hung on i took more blows to the body as his face turned red he got one of my knees with a vicious kick as his face turned purple i was screaming with the pain of it when the purple started looking more like blackand he collapsed body loosening and then going completely limp a lot of people let up when that happens when their opponent drops unconscious but it could have been a trick even if it hadnt been id been planning to hang on im not a knight in fact i squeezed harder i wasnt sure how much longer id had him down might have been thirty seconds might have been a minute and a half but i saw a flash of furious green light and looked up to see deirdre coming down the hillside toward me on her hair and three limbs one leg bound up in white bandages she had twenty or thirty tongueless soldier types with her and her glowing eyes burned with verdant fury like a pair of spotlights she focused on me for half a second hissed like a furious alley cat and screamed father crap i grabbed nicodemus by the shirt and pitched him over the side into the black waters of the lake he went down with hardly a splash his dark clothing making him all but invisible an instant after he hit the water i scanned the bottom of the boat frantically there the key i scooped it up and jammed it into the ignition dont shoot deirdre screamed you might hit my father she bounded into the air all that writhing hair folding back into a single sharklike swimming tail as she dove and hit the water with barely a splash i turned the key the old boats engine coughed and wheezed come on i breathed come on if i didnt get this boat moving before deirdre found her daddy game over shed order her soldiers to open fire id have to raise a shield to stop the bullets and once i did that the already wonky engine would sure as hell never get moving id be stuck and it would only be a matter of time before a combination of weariness mounting pain number of attackers and wrathful daughter took me down deirdre surfaced cast a glance around to orient herself and dove into the featureless darkness again the engine caught and then turned over drunkenly booya i screamed then i remembered that i hadnt untied the boat i lunged awkwardly up to the front and untied the rope very much aware of all the guns pointing at me the boat came free i pushed off the pole and the vessel began to sluggishly turn i hobbled back to the steering wheel cranked it around and gave the engine some power the boat throbbed and then roared and began to gather speed deirdre surfaced maybe twenty feet in front of me carrying her father before she even looked around she screamed kill him shoot him shoot him cheerfully i swerved the boat right at her something thumped hard against the hull i hoped for some kind of lawn mowerlike sound from the propellers but i didnt get one gunfire erupted from the shore meanwhile and it wasnt blinded by bright lights or hurried or panicked it started ripping the boat to splinters all around me i started shouting curse words and crouched down bullets hit my duster for several seconds the range was pretty close at least for the militarygrade weapons they were using and while the duster was up to the chore of stopping those rounds it wasnt any fun to experience my back got hit with half a dozen majorleague fastballs over the next few seconds and cold water washed over my feet and half a minute later over my ankles double crap the engines were making really odd noises too my back protested when i turned to look it was damned dark out here on the lake as i got farther and farther from shore but the disappearing form of the island was being blotted by a lot of black smoke coming out of the boats engines the pain blocks were falling now i was hurting a lot the water in the bottom of the boat was up to the bottom of my calves now and and there were three searchlights coming toward me from the direction of the island theyd sent out pursuit boats this just isnt fair i muttered to myself i gave the engine all the power i could but from the way it was rattling around that was more or less a formality it wasnt going to last long and it was sinking in any case i knew that if i went into the water id have about four or five minutes to live given the temperature i also knew that i had to get past the stone reefs around the islands the ones rosanna had needed the beacon light to navigate through nothing for it but to keep going i was struck by a sudden thought bob the skull was going to be crushed that he missed this one a genuine pirate adventure i started singing blow the man down at the top of my lungs then there was a horrible noise and the boat just stopped the steering wheel hit me in the chest pretty hard and then i bounced back into the drivers seat water started pouring in thick and fast and dark ahoy i slurred drunkenly reef i made sure i still had the coin and the sword i grabbed up my staff and got out the pentacle amulet from around my neck the lights of the pursuing boats were getting nearer by the moment this was going to be a close one the old ski boat was literally breaking apart around me its prow shattered on a thick spike of stone that had penetrated it just left of its center up by the front of the boat the old stone ridge that rose up through the waters of the lake came to within a couple of feet of the surface here it would give me a place to do something besides instantly immerse myself in cold water and go into hypothermia and it would give me solid rock on which to plant my feet and through which to draw power the water of the lake would wash some of it awaynot as much as freerunning water but somebut i would still be able to do something to defend myself so before the boat could capsize and dump me into the water i gritted my teeth and jumped in my body immediately informed me that i had made an insane decision you have no idea what the depths of cold can be until you have jumped into nearfreezing water i screamed my way into it finding places to stand with my frozen feet being careful of the leg that nicodemus had rendered gimpy for me then i held up my mothers amulet in my right hand and focused on it forcing energy into it carefully and slowly it happened sluggishly the way everything was happening in the mounting cold but i was able to draw power up through the stone beneath my feet and to call silverblue wizard light from the amuletbrighter and brighter light that spread out over the waters in a literal beacon that read clear as day here i am ttthomas i muttered to myself shivering so hard i could barely stand yyyoud bbetter bbe ccclose because deirdres men were the searchlights oriented on me instantly and the boatsrubber raft things that would skim right over the reefscame bouncing toward me over the waves it wouldnt have been impossible to sink one of the rafts but it would have killed every man inside and those werent people collaborating with demons for their own dark gain they were just people most of whom had been brought up from childhood to serve nicodemus and company and who probably thought that they were genuinely doing the right thing i could kill someone like nicodemus and sleep peacefully afterward but i wasnt sure i could live with myself if i sent those rafts down into the lake and condemned the men in them to die that isnt what magic is for more to the point killing them wouldnt save me even if i managed to sink every other raft out there send every man in them into the water it wouldnt stop me from freezing to death and drowning it would just mean that i had a lot of company im not a knight but that doesnt mean i dont draw the line somewhere they started shooting from about a hundred yards away and i raised a shield it was hard to do in the icy waters but i raised it and held it a shimmering quarterdome of silver light bullets smashed against it and skipped off it sending out little concentric rings of spreading energy as their force was distributed over the shield most of the shots never really came anywhere close shooting from a moving rubber raft at a hundred yards isnt exactly a recipe for precision marksmanship they got closer and i got colder i held the light and the shield please brother dont let me down i never heard anything until a wave of cold water hit my shoulder blades and all but knocked me over then the heavy chugchugchug of the water beetles engines shook the water around me as my brothers battered old ship bellied up dangerously close to the reef and i turned to find the ship wallowing broadside behind me i liked to give thomas a hard time about the water beetle teasing him that hed stolen it from the prop room of jaws but the fact of the matter was that i didnt know a damned thing about boats and that i was secretly impressed that he could sail the thing around the lake so blithely harry murphy called she came hurrying down the frozen deck slipping here and there on patches of ice as she did she slapped a line attached to a harness she wore to the ships safety railing and threw the other end of the line to me come on its about time you got outside the reef thomas complained from the top of the wheelhouse as i watched he drew his heavy desert eagle from his side aimed and loosed a round a dark form on one of the oncoming rafts let out a cry and fell into the water with a splash i scowled at thomas he doesnt even practice i stumbled forward and grabbed the line wrapping it around my right arm that was pretty much all i had enough energy left to do murphy began hauling it in and started yelling for thomas to help her cover me thomas yelled he came down from the wheelhouse pirate style just jumping down all graceful and stylish despite the roll of the ship despite the ice and the cold murphy her feet planted secured to the railing shifted her grip and produced the little assault weapon shed had on a strap around her backthe p kincaid had given her as a gift she raised it to her shoulder sighted through the scope at one of the oncoming rafts and started calmly squeezing out rounds one and two at a time fam famfam fam famfam fam fam one of the rafts foundered maybe shed struck whoever was steering it and caused him to misguide it maybe the lake had simply swamped it i dont know but a second raft immediately turned to start picking up men who had spilled into the water from the first murphy turned her gun onto the remaining raft thomas started hauling me out of the water by the line around my arm just pulling me up arm over arm as if id been a child and not an adult a hundred pounds heavier than he was he doesnt even work out i was tired enough that i just let him do it as a result i had enough spare attention to notice when my feet cleared the water and deirdre surged out of the blackness and seized my ankles kill you she snarled kill you for what you did to him holy crap thomas yelled ack i agreed most of those deadly strands of her hair were thrust into the stone reef below holding her down but a few that were free whipped wildly at thomas he ducked aside with a yell barely managing to hold on to the line it felt like she was going to pull my legs off at the ankles i screamed and kicked at her as best i could but my legs were so numb that i could barely move them much less shake her off thomas had all that he could do to simply hold on to the line and prevent those bladed strands from severing it karrin he screamed murphy swung her legs up over the railing of the ship still attached to it by the line fastened to her harness then she swung herself out into empty air above the water until she hung alongside me then she aimed the p down at deirdre and flicked the selector to full automatic but before she could pull the trigger deirdre hissed and a flickering blade swept up and struck murphy across the face she screamed and recoiled as the blade continued an sshaped cut that missed murphys throat by a fingers breadth and sliced through the strap that held the p on her body the weapon tumbled into the water bitch murphy snarled one side of her face a sheet of blood she tried to reach for her pistolin its shoulder holster beneath her harness beneath her coat it might as well have been on the surface of the moon murph i said i twisted my shoulders and thrust the end of fidelacchius to within reach of her hand murphys fingers closed on the hilt of the holy blade she drew it maybe an inch from the scabbard white light blinded me blinded deirdre blinded murphy blinded thomas blinded everyone no deirdre screamed utter despair and terror in her voice no no no the pressure on my ankles vanished and i heard the denarian splash into the water murphy released the hilt of the sword the light died it took maybe half a minute before i could see anything else thomas recovered faster of course and by that time he had us both back onto the deck of the water beetle there was no evidence of deirdre anywhere and the two boatloads of soldier boys were hightailing it away as fast as they could go murphy bleeding from a cut running parallel to her right eyebrow all the way into her hairline was staring in shock at me and at the sword what the fuck was that i slipped the sword off my shoulder i felt really tired i hurt everywhere offhand i mumbled id say it was a job offer weve got to move before we get carried onto the reef thomas muttered he hurried off pirate style he looked good doing it of course he doesnt even moisturize murphy stared at the sword for a second more then she looked at me and her bloody face went tight with concern jesus harry she moved to the side of my wounded leg and helped support my weight as i hobbled into the ships cabin come on lets get you warmed up well i asked her as she helped me how bout it i got this sword that needs somebody to use it she sat me down on one of the bench seats in the ships cabin she looked at the sword for a moment seriously then she shook her head and said quietly ive got a job i smiled faintly and closed my eyes i thought youd say that shut up harry okay i said and i did for hours it was glorious chapter fortysix i woke up covered in a couple of heavy down comforters and innumerable blankets and it was morning the bench seat on the water beetle had been folded out into a reasonably comfortable cot a kerosene heater was burning on the other side of the cabin it wasnt exactly toasty but it made the cabin warm enough to steam up the windows i came to slowly aching in every joint muscle and limb the afteraction hangover was every bit as bad as i had anticipated i tried to remind myself that this was a deliriously joyous problem to deal with all things considered i wasnt being a very good sport about it though i growled and complained bitterly and eventually worked up enough nerve to sit up and get out from under the covers i went to the tiny bathroomthough on a boat i guess its called a head for some stupid reasonand by the time i zombieshuffled out thomas had come down from the deck and slipped inside he was putting a cell phone back into his jacket pocket and his expression was serious harry he said how you doing i suggested what he could do with his reproductive organs he arched an eyebrow at me better than id expected i grunted then i added thank you he snorted that was all come on ive got coffee for you in the car im leaving everything to you in my will i said cool next time ill leave you in the water i pulled my coat on with a groan almost wish you had coin sword safe stowed below you want them i shook my head keep them here for now i followed him out to the truck gimping on my bad knee i noted that someone had at some point in the evening cleaned me up a bit and put new bandages on my leg and on a number of scrapes and contusions i didnt even remember getting i was wearing fresh clothing too thomas he didnt say anything about it and neither did i its a brother thing we got into the battered hummer and i seized a paper cup of coffee waiting for me next to a brown paper bag i grabbed the coffee dumped in a lot of sugar and creamer stirred it for about a quarter turn of the stick and started sipping then i checked out the bag doughnut i assaulted it thomas began to start the car but froze in place and blinked at the doughnut hey he said where the hell did that come from i took another bite cake doughnut white frosting sprinkles still warm and i had hot coffee to go with it pure heaven i gave my brother a cryptic look and just took another bite christ he muttered starting the truck you dont even explain the little things do you its like a drug i said through a mouthful of fattening goodness i enjoyed the doughnut while i could letting it fully occupy all my senses after id finished it and the coffee started kicking in i realized why id indulged myself so completely it was likely to be the last bit of pleasure i was going to feel for a while thomas hadnt said a damned thing about where we were goingor how anyone was doing after the events of the night before the stroger building the new hospital that has replaced the old cook county complex as chicagos nerve center of medicine is only a few yards away from the old clump of buildings it looks kind of like a castle if you scrunch up your eyes a little you can almost imagine its features as medieval ramparts and towers and crenellation standing like some ancient mountain bastion determined to defend the citizens of chicago against the plagues and evils of the world provided they have enough medical coverage of course i finished the coffee and thought to myself that i might have been feeling a little pessimistic thomas led me up to intensive care he stopped in the hallway outside luccios coordinating the information so i dont have many details but mollys in there shell have the rest of them for you what do you know i asked him michaels in bad shape he said still in surgery last i heard theyre waiting for him up here i guess the bullets all came up from underneath him and that armor he was wearing actually kept one of them in bounced around inside him like a bb inside a tin can i winced they said he only got hit by two or three rounds thomas continued but that it was more or less a miracle that he survived it at all they dont know if hes going to make it sanya didnt go into anything more specific than that i closed my eyes look thomas said im not exactly welcome around here right now but ill stay if you need me to thomas wasnt telling me the whole truth my brother wasnt comfortable in hospitals and i was pretty sure id figured out why they were full of the sick the injured and the elderlyie the kind of herd animals that predators instincts told them were weakest and the easiest targets my brother didnt like being reminded about that part of his nature he might hate that it happened but his instincts would react regardless of what he wanted or didnt want it would be torture for him to hang around here no i said ill be fine he frowned at me all right he said after a moment youve got my number call me ill give you a ride home thanks he put a hand on my arm for a second then turned hunched his shoulders bowed his head so that his hair fell to hide most of his face and walked quickly away i went on into the intensive care ward and found the waiting area molly was sitting inside next to charity mother and daughter sat side by side holding hands they looked strained and weary charity was wearing jeans and one of michaels flannel shirts her hair was pulled back into a ponytail and she didnt have any makeup on shed been pulled from her bed in the middle of the night to rush to the hospital her eyes were focused into the distance and blank small wonder this was her greatest nightmare come to life they looked up as i came in and their expressions were exactly the same neutral distant numb harry molly said her voice hollow ghostly hey kid i said it took charity a moment to react to my arrival she focused her eyes on the far wall blinked them a couple of times and then focused them on me she nodded and didnt speak i uh i said quietly molly raised her hand to stop me from speaking i shut up okay she said uh let me think she closed her eyes frowning in concentration and started ticking off one finger with each sentence luccio says that the archive is stable but unconscious shes at murphys house and needs to talk to you murphy says to tell you her face will be fine sanya says that he needs to talk to you alone and as soon as possible at st marys i waved a hand at all of that ill take care of it later hows your dad severe trauma to his liver charity said her voice toneless one of his kidneys was damaged too badly to be saved one of his lungs collapsed theres damage to his spine one of his ribs was fractured into multiple pieces his pelvis was broken in two places his jaw was shattered subdural hematoma there was trauma all through one ocular cavity they arent sure if hell lose the eye or not there might also be brain damage they dont know yet her eyes overflowed and focused into the distance again there was trauma to his heart fragments of broken bone in it from his ribs she shuddered and closed her eyes his heart they hurt his heart molly sat back down beside her mother and put her arm around charitys shoulders charity leaned against her eyes still spilling tears but she never made a sound im not a knight im not a hero either heroes keep their promises molly i said quietly im sorry she looked up at me and her lip started quivering she shook her head and said oh harry ill go i said charitys face snapped up and she said her voice suddenly very clear and distinct no molly blinked at her mother charity stood up her face blotched with tears creased with strain her eyes sunken with fatigue and worry she stared at me for a long moment and then said families stay harry she lifted her chin sudden and fierce pride briefly driving out the grief in her eyes he would stay for you my vision got a little blurry and i sat down in the nearest chair probably just a reaction to all the strain of the past couple of days yeah i said my throat thick he would i called everyone on the list molly had quoted me and told them they could wait to see me until we knew about michael except for murph they all got upset about that i told them they could go to hell and hung up on them then i settled in with molly and charity and waited hospital waits are bad ones the fact that they happen to pretty much all of us sooner or later doesnt make them any less hideous theyre always just a little bit too cold it always smells just a little bit too sharp and clean its always quiet so quiet that you can hear the fluorescent lightsanother constant those lightshumming pretty much everyone else there is in the same bad predicament you are and there isnt much in the way of cheerful conversation and theres always a clock in sight the clock has superpowers it always seems to move too slowly look up at it and it will tell you the time look up an hour and a half later and it will tell you two minutes have gone by yet it somehow simultaneously has the ability to remind you of how short life is to make you acutely aware of how little time someone you love might have remaining to them the day crawled by a doctor came to see charity twice to tell her that things were still bad and that they were still working the second visit came around suppertime and the doc suggested that she get some food if she could that they should know something more definite after the next procedure in three or four hours he asked if charity knew whether or not michael had agreed to be an organ donor just in case he said they hadnt been able to find his drivers license i could tell that charity wanted to tell the doctor where he could shove his question and just how far it could go but she told him what michael would have told himyes of course he had the doctor thanked her and left i walked down the cafeteria with charity and molly but i didnt feel like eating or having food urged upon me i figured that charity probably had a critical back pressure of mothering built up after this much time away from her kids on the way i claimed that i needed to stretch my legs which was the truth sometimes when theres too much going on in my head it helps to walk around a bit so i walked down hallways going nowhere in particular just being careful not to pass too near any equipment that might be busy keeping someone alive at the moment i wound up sitting down in the hospital chapel it was the usual for such a place quiet subdued colors and lights bench seating with an aisle in the middle and a podium up at the frontthe standard layout for the services of any number of faiths maybe it leaned a little harder toward catholicism than most but that might have been only natural the jesuits actually had a chaplaincy in residence and held mass there regularly it was quiet which was the important thing i sank onto a pew aching and closed my eyes lots of details chased their way around my head michael had come in with gunshot wounds the cops were going to ask lots of questions about that depending on the circumstances of the helicopters return to chicago that could get really complicated really fast on the other hand given the depth of marcones involvement the problems might just vanish he had his fingers in so many pies in chicagos city government that he could probably have any inquiry quashed if he really wanted it done given what hed been saved from it would be consistent with his character for marcone to repay the people who bailed him out with whatever aid he could render in turn it irked me that marcone could ever be in a position to offer significant aid to michael regardless of the circumstances of course for that to happen michael would first need to survive my thoughts kept coming full circle back to that would he be in danger right now if i hadnt insisted that he put on that harness if i hadnt shoved him onto that rope ahead of me would he still be up there under the knife dying could i really have been that arrogant to assume based on one glance at gards face that i not only knew the future but had the wisdom and the right to decide what that future should be maybe it should be me up there i didnt have a wife and a family waiting for me to come home id expected charity to scream and throw things at me maybe id even wanted that because while i intellectually understood that id had no way of knowing what was going to happen and that id only been trying to protect my friend a big part of me couldnt help but feel that i deserved charitys fury after all it reasoned i had gotten her husband killed as surely as if id murdered him myself except that he wasnt dead yetand thinking like that was too much like giving up on him i couldnt do that i looked up at the podium where whoever would presumably be when someone was there delivering a sermon i know that we dont talk much i said speaking out loud to the empty room and im not looking for a pen pal but i thought you should know that michael makes you look pretty good and if after all hes done it ends like this for him id think less of you he deserves better i think you should make sure he gets it if you want to bill it to me im fine with that its no problem nobody said anything back and while were on the subject i said i think the rules youve got set up suck you dont get involved as much as you used to apparently and your angels arent allowed to stick their toes in unless the bad guys do it first but ive been running some figures in my head and when the denarians pulled up those huge signs they had to have a lot of power to do it a lot of power more than i could ever have had even with lasciel archangel power and i can only think of one of those guys who would have been helping that crew i stood up and jabbed a finger at the podium suddenly furious and screamed the prince of fucking darkness gets to cheat and unload his power on the earthtwiceand you just sit there being holy while my friend who has fought for you his whole life is dying what the hell is wrong with you i guess this is a bad time said a voice from behind me i turned around and found a little old guy in a dark blue coverall whose stenciled name tag read jake he was pulling behind him a janitors cart with a trash bin and the usual assortment of brooms and mops and cleaning products he had a round belly and short curling silver hair that matched his beard both cropped close to his dark skin sorry ill come back later i felt like an idiot i shook my head at him no no im not doing anything i mean youre not keeping me from anything ill get out of your way you aint in my way young man said jake not at all you aint the first one i ever seen upset in a hospital chapel wont be the last either you sure you dont mind no i said come on in he did hauling the cart with him and went over to the trash can in the corner he took out the old liner you got a friend here huh yeah i said sitting down again its okay to be mad at god about it son it aint his fault what happened but he understands maybe he does i said with a shrug but he doesnt care i dont know why everyone thinks he does why would he jake paused and looked at me i mean this whole universe right all those stars and all those worlds i continued maybe sounding more bitter than i had intended probably so many different kinds of people out there that we couldnt count them all how could god really care about whats happening to one little person on one little planet among a practically infinite number of them jake tied off the trash bag and tossed it in the bin he replaced the liner with a thoughtful look on his face well he said i never been to much school you understand but seems to me that you assuming something you shouldnt assume whats that i asked that god sees the world like you do one thing at a time from just one spot seems to me that he is supposed to be everywhere know everything he put the lid back on the trash can think about that he knows what youre feeling how youre hurting feels my pain your pain like it was his own jake shook his head hell son question isnt how could god care about just one person question is how could he not i snorted and shook my head more optimism than you want to hear right now jake said i hear you son he turned and started pushing the cart out the door oh he said can an old man offer you one more thought sure i said without turning around you gotta think that maybe theres a matter of balance here he said maybe one archangel invested his strength in this situation overtly and immediately maybe another one was just quieter about it thinking longterm maybe he already gave you a hand my right hand erupted into pins and needles again i sucked in a swift breath and rose spinning around jake was gone the janitors cart was still there a rag hanging off the back was still swinging back and forth slightly a folded paperback book was shoved between the body of the cart and the handle i went over to the cart and looked up and down the hall there was no one in sight and nowhere they could have conveniently disappeared to i picked up the book it was a battered old copy of the two towers one page was dogeared and a bit of dialogue underlined in pencil the burned hand teaches best i read aloud i made my way back to my seat and shook my head what the hell is that supposed to mean grimalkin mewled from the pew beside me that your experience with resisting the shadow of the fallen one has garnered the respect of the watchman my emissary i twitched violently enough that i came up off my seat an inch or two and came back down with a grunt i slid down as far as i could to the end of the pew it wasnt far i bought myself only another inch or three before i turned to face mab she sat calmly dressed in a casual business suit of dark blue wearing plenty of elegant little diamonds her white hair was bound up into a braided bun held in place with ivory sticks decorated with lapis she held grimalkin on her lap like a favorite pet though only a lunatic would have mistaken the malk for a domestic cat it was the first time id seen grimalkin in clear light he was unusually large and muscular even for a malkand they tended to make your average lynx look a little bit scrawny grimalkin must have weighed sixty or seventy pounds all of it muscle and bone his fur was dark grey patterned with rippling black fur almost like a subtle watermark his eyes were yellowgreen very large and far too intelligent for any animal the watchman i stammered mabs head moved slightly with the words but it was grimalkins mewling voice that actually spoke the prince of the host is all pomp and ceremony and when he moves it is with the thunder of the wings of an army of seraphim the crash of drums and the clamor of horns the trumpeter never walks quietly when he can appear in a chorus of light the demon binder takes tasks upon his own shoulders and solves his problems with his own hands but the watchman mab smiled of the archangels i like him the most he is the quiet one the subtle one the one least known and by far the most dangerous i sorted through what knowledge i had of the archangels it was meager enough but i knew that much at least uriel i said quietly mab lifted a finger and continued speaking through the malk caution is called for emissary mine were i in your position i would speak his name sparingly if ever what has he done to me i asked her mab stared at me with iridescent eyes that is a question only you can answer but i can say this much he has given you the potential to be more of what you are huh she smiled reached to the bench on the other side of her body and produced my blasting rod the return of your property the malk said the need to keep it from you has passed then i was right i said accepting it you took it and you took the memory of it happening yes why because i deemed it proper she replied as if speaking to a rather slowwitted child you would have risked your own lifeand my purposeto protect your precious mortals had i not taken your fire from you summer would have tracked and killed you two days ago not having it could have gotten me killed too i said and then youd have wasted all that time youve put in trying to recruit me to be the next winter knight nonsense mab said if you died i would simply recruit your brother he would be well motivated to seek revenge upon your killers a little cold feeling shot through me i hadnt realized that mab knew who he was but i guess it made sense my godmother the leanansidhe had been tight with my mother one way or another if lea had known then it might make sense that mab did too he isnt a mortal i said quietly i thought the knights had to be mortals he is in love grimalkin mrowled for mab that is more than mortal enough for me she tilted her head though i suppose i might make him an offer while you yet live he would give much to hold his love again would he not i fixed her with a hard gaze and said you will stay away from him i will do as i please she said with himand with you i scowled at her you will not i do not belong to y the next thing i knew i was on my knees in the center aisle and mab was walking away from me toward the door oh but you do mortal until you have worked off your debt to me you are mine you owe one favor more i tried to get up and i couldnt my knees just wouldnt move my heart beat far too hard and i hated how frightened i felt why i demanded why did you want the denarians stopped why send the hobs to kill the archive why recruit me to save the archive and marcone in the event that the hobs failed mab paused turned casually showing off the gorgeous curves of her calves and tilted her head at me nicodemus and his ilk were clearly in violation of my accords and obviously planning to abuse them to further his ambition that was reason enough to see his designs disrupted and among the fallen was one with much to answer for to me personally for its attack upon my home the black council attack on arctis tor i said one of them used hellfire mab showed me her snowwhite teeth the watchman and i grimalkin mewled for her had a common enemy this day the enemy could not be allowed to gain the power represented by the child archive i frowned and thought of the silver hand that had batted the fallen angel and his master sorceries around as if hed been a stuffed practice dummy thorned namshiel mabs eyes flashed with sudden cold fury and frost literally formed over every surface of the chapel including upon my own eyelashes there are others yet who will pay for what they have done mab snarled in her own voice it sounded hideousnot unmelodious because it was as rich and full and musical as it ever had been but it was filled with such rage such fury such pain and such hate that every vowel clawed at my skin and every consonant felt like someone taking a staple gun to my ears i am sidhe she hissed i am the queen of air and darkness i am mab her chin lifted her eyes wide and white around the rippling colors of her irisesutterly insane and i repay my debts mortal all of them there was an enormous crack a sound like thick ice shattering on the surface of a lake and mab and her translator were gone i knelt there shaking in the wake of hearing her voice i realized a minute later that i had a nosebleed a minute after that i realized that there was a trickle of blood coming out of my ears too my eyes ached with strain as if id been outdoors in bright sunlight for too many hours it took me still another minute to get my legs to start moving again after that i staggered to the nearest bathroom and cleaned up i spent a little while poking at my memory and trying to see if there were any holes in it that hadnt been there before then i spent a while more wondering if id be able to tell if she had taken something else jesus christ i breathed shivering because though i hadnt been in on the original attack on mabs tower and when i did attack it i had been unwittingly serving mabs interests the fact remained that i had indeed offered her the same insult as thorned namshiel the lacerating fury that turned her voice into razor blades could very well be directed at me in the near future i hurried out of the chapel and went down to the cafeteria being bullied into eating dinner sounded a lot more pleasant than it had a few minutes ago the doctor came into the waiting room at ten seventeen that night charity came to her feet shed spent much of the day with her head bowed praying quietly she was beyond tears at least for the moment and she put a sheltering arm around her daughter pulling molly in close to her side hes in recovery the doctor said the procedures went the doctor sighed he looked at least as tired as either of the carpenter women as well as could be expected better really i hesitate to make any claims at this point but he seems to be stable and assuming there are no complications in the next hour or two i think hell pull through charity bit her lip hard molly threw her arms around her mother thank you doctor charity whispered the doctor smiled wearily you should realize thatthe injuries were quite extensive its unlikely that hell be able to fully recover from them brain damage is a possibilitywe wont know until he wakes up even if that isnt an issue the other trauma was severe he may need assistance possibly for the rest of his life charity nodded calmly hell have it thats right molly said when can i see him charity asked well bring him up in an hour or two the doctor said i cleared my throat excuse me doc is he going to be on a respirator for the time being the doctor said yes i nodded thank you the doctor nodded to us and charity thanked him again he left okay grasshopper i said time for us to clear out but theyre going to bring hi oh molly said crestfallen the respirator better not to take any chances huh i asked her its all right baby charity said quietly ill call home as soon as he wakes up they hugged tightly molly and i started walking out oh molly said her voice very tired i did that homework i felt pretty tired too yeah she nodded and smiled wearily up at me charlemagne i called thomas and he gave me and molly a ride to murphys place the night was clear the cloud cover had blown off and the moon and the stars got together with the snow to turn chicago into a winter wonderland months ahead of schedule the snow had stopped falling though i suppose that meant mab had turned her attention elsewhere thomas dropped me off a short distance away and then left to drive the grasshopper back to her home i covered the last hundred yards or so on foot murphy lives in a teeny little house that belonged to her grandmother it was just a single story with two bedrooms a living room and a little kitchen it was meant for one person to live in or possibly a couple with a single child it was certainly overloaded by the mob of wardens who had descended on the place luccios reinforcements had arrived there were four wardens in the little living room all of them grizzled veterans two young members in the kitchen and i was sure that there were at least two more outside standing watch behind veils i was challenged for a password in an amused tone by one of the young wardens when i came in the kitchen door i told him to do something impolite please and asked him where luccio might be thats anatomically unlikely the young man replied in a british accent he poured a second cup of steaming tea and said drink up ill let her know youre here thanks i was sipping tea and sitting at murphys table when luccio came in a few minutes later give us the room please chandler kostikos the younger men cleared out to the living rooma polite illusion really the house was too small to provide much in the way of privacy luccio poured herself a cup of tea and sat down across from me i felt my shoulders tense up a little i forced myself to remain quiet and sipped more tea im concerned luccio said quietly about the archive her name is ivy i said she frowned thatspart of my concern harry your personal closeness with her its dangerous i lifted my eyebrows dangerous im in danger because im treating her like a real person luccio grimaced as if tasting something bitter frankly yes i thought about being diplomatic and polite honest i really did but while i was thinking about it i accidentally bumped the button that puts my mouth on autopilot because it said thats a load of crap captain and you know it her expression went still as the whole of her attention focused on me is it yes shes a kid shes alone shes not some computer database and its inhuman to treat her like one yes luccio said bluntly it is and its also the safest way to deal with her safest for who i demanded luccio took a sip of tea for everyone i frowned down at my cup tell me she nodded the archivehas been around for a long time always passed down in a family line mother to daughter usually the archive is inherited by a woman when shes in her early to midthirties when her mother dies and after shes given birth to her own daughter accidents are rare part of the archives nature is a drive to protect itself a need to avoid exposing the person hosting it to risk and given the extensive knowledge available to it the archive is very good at avoiding risky situations in the first place and should they arise the power available to the archive generally ensures its survival it is extremely rare for the host of an archive to die young i grunted go on when the archive is passedharry try to imagine living your life with all of its triumphs and tragediesand suddenly you find yourself with a second set of memories every bit as real to you as your own a second set of heartaches loves triumphs losses all of them just as realand then a third and a fourth and a fifth and more and more and more the perfect memory the absolute recall of every archive that came before you five thousand years of them i blinked at that hells bells that would drive one insane luccio said yes and it generally does there is a reason that the historical record for many soothsayers and oracles presents them as being madwomen the pythia and many many others were simply the archive using her vast knowledge of the past to build models to predict the most probable future she was a madwomanbut she was also the archive as a defense the archives began to distance themselves from other human beings emotionally they reasoned that if they could stop adding the weight of continuing lifetimes of experience and grief to the already immense burden of carrying so much knowledge it might better enable them to function and it did the archive keeps its host emotionally remote for a reasonbecause otherwise the passions and prejudices and hatreds and jealousies of thousands of lifetimes have the potential to distill themselves into a single being normally an archive would have her own lifetime of experience to insulate her against all these other emotions and memories a baseline to contrast against them i suddenly got it but ivy doesnt ivy doesnt luccio agreed her grandmother was killed in a freak accident an automobile crash i believe her mother was a seventeenyearold girl who was in love and pregnant she hated her mother for dying and cursing her to carry the archive when she wanted to have her own lifeand she hated the child for having a lifetime of freedom ahead of her ivys mother killed herself rather than carry the archive i started feeling a little sick and ivy knows it she does knows it feels it she was born knowing exactly what her mother thought and felt about her how could you know this about her i frowned thinking then said kincaid the girl was in love with kincaid no luccio said but kincaid was working for ivys grandmother at the time and the girl confided in him man thats screwed up i said ivy has remained distant her whole life luccio said if she begins to involve her own emotions in her duties as the archive or in her life generally she runs the serious risk of being overwhelmed with emotions and passions which she simply is notand cannot bepsychologically equipped to handle youre afraid that she could go out of control the archive was created to be a neutral force a repository of knowledge but what if ivys unique circumstance allowed her to ignore those limitations imagine the results of the anger and bitterness and desire for revenge of all those lifetimes combined with the power of the archive and the restraint of a twelveyearold child id rather not i said quietly nor would i luccio said that could be a true nightmare all that knowledge without conscience to direct it the necromancer kemmler had such a spirit in his service a sort of miniature version of the archive nowhere near as powerful but it had been studying and learning beside wizards for generations and the things it was capable of were appalling she shook her head i took a sip of tea because otherwise the gulp would have been suspicious she was talking about bob and she was right about what bob was capable of doing when id unlocked the personality hed taken on under some of his former owners hed nearly killed me the wardens destroyed it of course she said no they hadnt justin dumorne former warden hadnt destroyed the skull hed smuggled it from kemmlers lab and kept it in his ownuntil id burned him to death and taken it from him in turn it was just too much power under too little restraint and its entirely possible that the archive could become a similar threat on a far larger scale i know you care about the child harry but you had to be warned you might not be doing her any favors by acting like her friend whos acting i said where is she weve been keeping her asleep luccio said until you or kincaid got here i get it i said you dont think i should get close to her unless youre worried about whats going to happen when you wake her up and shes really scared and confused luccios cheeks flushed and she looked away i dont have all the answers dresden i just have concerns i sighed whatever i said let me see her luccio led me into murphs guest bedroom ivy looked very tiny in the double bed i sat down beside her and luccio leaned over to gently rest her hand on ivys head she murmured something and drew her hand away ivy let out a small whimper and then blinked her eyes open suddenly hyperventilating she looked around wildly her eyes wide and let out a small cry easy easy i said gently ivy its all right youre safe she sobbed and flung herself tight against me i hugged her i just rocked her gently and hugged her while she cried and cried luccio watched me her eyes compassionate and sad after a long while ivy whispered i got your letter thank you i squeezed a little they did things to me she said i know i said quietly been there but i was all right after a while youre going to be all right its over she hugged me some more and cried herself back to sleep i looked up at luccio and said you still want me to push her away you want her baseline to be what she shared with those animals luccio frowned the senior council couldnt find its heart if it had a copy of greys anatomy xray vision and a stethoscope i said no they can lay down the law about magic but they arent telling me who im allowed to befriend she looked at me for a long moment and then a slow smile curled up one side of her mouth morgan told them youd say that so did mccoy and listenstowind the merlin wouldnt hear it the merlin doesnt like to hear anything that doesnt fit into his view of the world i said japanese excuse me japanese theres a japanese steakhouse i go to sometimes to celebrate surviving this mess qualifies come with me dinner tomorrow the teriyaki is to die for she smiled more broadly and inclined her head once the door opened and murphy and kincaid arrived kincaid was moving under his own power though very gingerly and with the aid of a walking stick i got out of the way and he came over to settle down next to ivy she woke up enough to murmur something about cookies and a happy meal he settled down on the bed beside her and she pressed up against his arm before settling down to rest again kincaid evidently exhausted himself drew a gun took the safety off placed it on his chest and went to sleep too its cute i whispered to murphy he has a teddy glock she was looking at kincaid and ivy with a decidedly odd expression she shook her head a little blinked up at me and said hmm oh hah very funny i had your car dug out of the snow by the way i blinked at her thank you got your keys yeah give you a ride to it she said groovy we took off once we were in the car and moving murphy said i like luccio yeah but shes all wrong for you uhhuh i said you come from different worlds and shes your boss there are secrets you have to keep from her thats going to make things difficult and there are other issues that could come up wait i said i mimed cleaning out my ears okay go ahead because for a second there it sounded like you were giving me relationship advice murphy gave me a narrow oblique look no offense dresden but if you want to compare total hours of good relationships and bad i leave you in the dust in both categories touchй i said sourly kincaid was looking awfully paternal in there wasnt he oh bite me murphy said scowling hows michael gonna make it i said hurt bad though dont know how mobile hes going to be after this murphy fretted her lower lip what happens if he cantkeep on with the knight business i shook my head i have no idea i justi didnt think that taking up one of the swords was the sort of job offer you could turn down i blinked at murphy no murph theres no mandatory martyrdom involved youve got a choice youve always got a choice thatssort of the whole point of faith the way i understand it she digested that in silence for a time then she said it isnt because i dont believe i know that i said she nodded it isnt for me though harry ive already chosen my ground ive taken an oath it meant more to me than accepting a job i know i said if you werent the way you are murph the sword of faith wouldnt have reacted to you as strongly as it did if someone as thick as me understands it i figure the almighty probably gets it too she snorted and gave me a faint smile and drove the rest of the way to my car in silence when we got there she parked next to the blue beetle harry she said do you ever feel like were going to wind up old and alone that werei dont knowdoomed never to have anyone anything that lasts i flexed the fingers of my stillscarred left hand and my mildly tingling right hand im more worried about all the things ill never be rid of i eyed her what brings on this cheerful topic she gave me a faint smile its justthe center cannot hold harry i think things are starting to fall apart i cant see it and i cant prove it but i know it she shook her head maybe im just losing my mind i looked intently at her frowning no murph you arent there are bad things happening she said yeah and i havent been able to put many pieces together yet but we shut down some of the bad guys last night they were using the denarians to get to the archive what do they want dont know i said but its going to be big and bad i want in on this fight harry she said okay all the way promise me done i offered her my hand she took it father forthill was already asleep but sanya answered the door when i dropped by st marys he was rumpled and looked tired but was smiling michael woke and was talking thats great i said grinning what did he say wanted to know if you made it out all right then he went back to sleep i laughed and sanya and i traded a hug a manly hug with a lot of back thumping which he then ruined with one of those russian kisses on both cheeks come in come in he said i apologize for trying to rush you earlier we wanted to be sure to collect the coins and get them safely stored as soon as possible i exhaled i dont have them his smile vanished what i told him about thorned namshiel sanya swore and rubbed at his face then he said come i followed him through the halls in the back of the enormous church until we got to the staff s kitchen he went to the fridge opened it and came out with a bottle of bourbon he poured some into a coffee cup drank it down and poured some more he offered me the bottle no thanks arent you supposed to drink vodka arent you supposed to wear pointy hat and ride on flying broomstick touchй i said sanya shook his head and flexed the fingers of his right hand eleven plus six seventeen it could be worse but we nailed thorned namshiel i said and eldest gruff laid out magog like a sack of potatoes ill get you his coin tomorrow a flicker of satisfaction went through sanyas eyes magog good but namshiel no what do you mean no i saw michael cut his hand off and drop it into his pouch da sanya said and the coin was under the skin of his right hand but it was not in his pouch when he went to the hospital what sanya nodded we took off his armor and gear in helicopter to stop the bleeding maybe it fell out into the lake i snorted he grimaced and nodded da i know that did not happen i sighed marcone ill look into it are you sure yeah i know those people ill go see them right now though i was looking forward to going home for a while i pushed my hips up off the counter they leaned on well whats one more thing right two more things sanya said he vanished and returned a moment later he was carrying amoracchius in its scabbard he offered it to me i lifted both eyebrows instructions sanya said im to give it to you and you will kn know who to give it to i muttered i eyed the ceiling someone is having a huge laugh right now at my expense i raised my voice a little i dont have to do this you know i have free will i could tell you to go jump in a lake sanya stood there offering me the sword i snatched it out of his hands grumbling under my breath and stalked out to my volkswagen i threw the sword into the back as if i didnt have enough problems i muttered slamming the passenger door and stalking around to the driverside door no i gotta be carrying around freaking excalibur now too unless it isnt who knows i slammed the driverside door and the old paperback copy of the two towers uriel had left me and which id dropped into the pocket of my duster dug into my side i frowned and pulled it out it fell open to the inside front cover where there was writing in a flowing hand the reward for work welldone is more work aint that the truth i muttered i stuffed the book back in my pocket and hit the road again it took a phone call and an hour to set it up but marcone met me at his office on the floor over executive priority i walked in carrying the sword to find marcone and hendricks in his officea plain and rather spartan place for the time being he had only recently moved in and it looked more like the office of an active college professor functional and put together primarily from expediency than that of a criminal mastermind i cut right to the chase someone is backstabbing the people who saved your life and i wont have it marcone raised his eyebrows please explain i told him about thorned namshiel and the coin i dont have it marcone said do any of your people i asked he frowned at that question then he leaned back in his chair and put his elbows on the arms of it resting the fingertips of his hands together where is gard i asked reporting to her home office he murmured i will make inquiries i wondered if marcone was lying to me it wasnt a habit of his but that only meant that when he did tell a lie it was all the more effective i wondered if he was telling the truth if so then maybe monoc securities had just acquired their own fallen angel and expert in magic and magical theory the child marcone said is she well shes safe i said shes with people who care about her he nodded good was there anything else no i said then you should get some rest marcone said you lookhis mouth twitched up at the cornerslike a raccoon who has been run over by a locomotive next time i leave your wise ass on the island i said scowling and stalked out i was on the way out of the building when i decided to make one more stop madam demeter was in her office dressed as stylishly as ever hello mister dresden she said as she put several files away neatly precisely ordering them im quite busy i hope this wont take too long no i said i just wanted to share a theory with you theory yeah see in all the excitement and explosions and demonic brouhaha everyones forgotten a small detail her fingers stopped moving someone gave the denarians the location of marcones panic room someone close to him someone who would know many of his secrets someone who would have a good reason to want to hurt him demeter turned just her head to face me eyes narrowed a lot of men talk to the women they sleep with i said thats always been true and it would give you a really good reason to get close to him hes like a lot of men demeter said quietly i know youve got a gun in that drawer i told her dont try it why shouldnt i she said because im not going to give you to marcone what do you want from me she asked i shrugged i might ask you for information sometimes if you could help me without endangering yourself id appreciate it either way it doesnt affect whether or not i talk to marcone her eyes narrowed why not maybe i want to see him go down someday i said but mostly because its none of my damned business i just wanted you to know that id seen you this time maybe he wont put it all together hes got more likely suspects than you inside his organizationand id be shocked if you hadnt already realized what a great patsy torelli is going to make demeter gave me a wintry smile but dont get overconfident if you make another move that obvious hell figure it out and youll disappear demeter let out a bare laugh and shut the filing cabinet i disappeared years ago she gave me a steady look are you here to do business mister dresden granted there was a building full of veryfit girls who would be happy to ah work on my tone and my tone was letting me know that it would be happy to be worked on the rest of my body however thought that a big meal and about two weeks of sleep was a much better idea and once you got up to my neck the rest of me thought that this whole place was looking prettier and hollower every time i visited its done i said and left at home i couldnt sleep finally i had enough spare time to worry about what the hell was wrong with my right hand i wound up in my lab dangling the packet of stale catnip for mister and filling bob in on the events of the past few days wow bob said soulfire are you sure he said soulfire yeah i said wearily why well the skull said soulfire iswell its hellfire essentially only from the other place heavenfire well bob said yes and no hellfire is something you use to destroy things soulfire is used the opposite wayto create stuff look basically what you do is you take a portion of your soul and you use it as a matrix for your magic i blinked what its sort of like using rebar inside concrete bob said you put a matrix of rebar in then pour concrete around it and the strength of the entire thing together is a great deal higher than either one would be separately you could do things that way that you could never do with either the rebar or the concrete alone but im doing that with my soul i demanded oh come on harry all you mortals get all hung up over your precious souls youve never seen your soul never touched it never done anything with it whats all the todo so what youre saying is that this hand construct was made out of my soul i said your soul and your magic fused together yeah bob said your soul converted into energy soulfire in this case the spirit energy drawn from your aura right around your right hand because it fit the construct so well it being a big version of your right hand and all your standard forceprojection spell formed around the matrix of soulfire and what had been an instantaneous exertion of force became a longterm entity capable of manipulation and exertion to the same degree not really more powerful than just the force spell as much as it was more than simply the force spell i wiggled my tingling fingers oh but my souls going to get better right oh sure bob said few days a week or two at most itll grow back in go out and have a good time enjoy yourself do some things that uplift the human spirit or whatever and itll come back even faster i grunted so what youre saying is that soulfire doesnt let me do anything new it just makes me more of what i already am a lot more bob said nodding cheerfully from his shelf its how angels do all of their stuff though admittedly theyve got a lot more in the way of soul to draw upon than you do i thought angels didnt have souls i said like i said people get all excited and twitchy when that word gets used bob said angels dont have anything else oh what happens if i uh you know use too much of it whats five minus five harry zero right think about that for a minute im sure youll come to the right conclusion its bad see youre not totally hopeless bob said and hey you got a new magic sword to custodianize too merlin eat your heart out he only got to look after one and working a case with uriel youre hitting the bigtime harry i havent really heard much about uriel i said i mean i know hes an archangel but hessort of old testament bob said you know the guy who killed the firstborn children of egypt him other than that well theres only suspicions and he isnt the sort to brag its always the quiet ones you know heaven has a spook i said and mab likes his style and he did you a favor bob said brightly you just know that cant be good i put my head down on the table and sighed but after that i was able to go upstairs and get some real sleep i always like the onionvolcano thing they do at the japanese steak houses me and the other sevenyearolds at the table i got to catch the shrimp in my mouth too when the chef flicked them up into a high arc with his knife i did so well he hit me with two one from a knife in either hand and i got them both to a round of applause from the table and a genuine laugh from anastasia we had a delicious meal and the two of us lingered after everyone else at our little tablegrill had left can i get your take on something i asked her certainly i told her about my experience on the island and the eerie sense of familiarity that had come with it oh that anastasia said your sights coming in thats all i blinked at her uh what the sight she replied calmly every wizard develops some measure of precognizance as he matures it sounds to me as if yours has begun to stir and has recognized a place that may be of significance to you in the future this happens to everyone i said incredulous to every wizard she said smiling yes then why have i never heard about it i demanded because young wizards who are anticipating the arrival of their sight have an appalling tendency to ignore uncomfortable truths by labeling more appealing fantasies revelations of their sight everything they care about turns into a prophecy its vastly irritating and the best way to avoid it is to keep it quiet until a young wizard finds out about it for himself i mulled over that idea for a few moments significant to my future eh potentially she replied quietly nodding one must proceed with extreme caution when acting upon any kind of precognizant information of coursebut in this case it seems clear that there is more to that island than meets the eye if it were me id look into itcautiously thank you i told her seriously for the advice i mean it cost me little enough she said smiling may i get your take on something seems only fair im surprised at you harry i always thought that you had an interest in karrin i shrugged my shoulders timing maybe its never seemed to be the right time for us but you do care for her she said of course i said shes gone with me into too many bad places for anything else that anastasia said her eyes steady i can understand i tilted my head and studied her face why ask about another woman she smiled i wanted to understand why you were here i leaned over to her touching her chin lightly with the fingertips of my right hand and kissed her very gently she returned it slowly savoring the touch of my mouth on hers i broke off the kiss several moments after it had become inappropriate for a public venue and said because its good for the soul an excellent answer she murmured her dark eyes huge one that should perhaps be further explored i rose and held out her chair for her and helped her into her coat as it turned out the rest of the night was good for the soul too authors note when i was seven years old i got a bad case of strep throat and was out of school for a whole week during that time my sisters bought me my first fantasy and scifi novels the boxed set of lord of the rings and the boxed set of the han solo adventure novels by brian daley i devoured them all during that week from that point on i was pretty much doomed to join sf f fandom from there it was only one more step to decide i wanted to be a writer of my favorite fiction material and here we are i blame my sisters my first love as a fan is swordsandhorses fantasy after tolkien i went after c s lewis after lewis it was lloyd alexander after them came fritz leiber roger zelazny robert howard john norman poul anderson david eddings weis and hickman terry brooks elizabeth moon glen cook and before i knew it i was a dual citizen of the united states and lankhmar narnia gor cimmeria krynn amberyou get the picture when i set out to become a writer i spent years writing swordsandhorses fantasy novelsand seemed to have little innate talent for it but i worked at my writing branching out into other areas as experiments including sf mystery and contemporary fantasy thats how the dresden files initially came aboutas a happy accident while trying to accomplish something else sort of like penicillin but i never forgot my first love and to my immense delight and excitement one day i got a call from my agent and found out that i was going to get to share my newest swordsandhorses fantasy novel with other fans the codex alera is a fantasy series set within the savage world of carna where spirits of the elements known as furies lurk in every facet of life and where many intelligent races vie for security and survival the realm

powers of carna and against savage creatures who would lay alera in waste and ruin yet even a realm as powerful as alera is not immune to destruction from within and the death of the heir apparent to the crown has triggered a frenzy of ambitious political maneuvering and infighting amongst the high lords those who wield the most powerful furies known to man plots are afoot traitors and spies abound and a civil war seems inevitableall while the enemies of the realm watch ready to strike at the first sign of weakness tavi is a young man living on the frontier of aleran civilizationbecause lets face it swordsandhorses fantasies start there born a freak unable to utilize any powers of furycrafting whatsoever tavi has grown up relying upon his own wits speed and courage to survive when an ambitious plot to discredit the crown lays tavis home the calderon valley naked and defenseless before a horde of the barbarian marat the boy and his family find themselves directly in harms way there
