charles todd a false mirror hampton regis early february it was a bitterly cold night of frost the stars sharp and piercingly bright overhead he pulled the motorcar to the verge and settled to watch the house that lay directly across the black expanse of water it stood out against the sky amazingly clear even from here he could tell there were lamps burning in three of the rooms he could picture them in his mind at the rear of the housethe sitting room very likely in the entry where the pattern of the fanlight over the front door shone starkly against the deep shadows therebehind it the staircase of course and one on the first floor under the eaves their bedroom surely the sitting room lamp went out after half an hour he could see for an instant the grotesque silhouette cast for a moment or two against the drawn shades as someone reached out to turn down the flame and then the silhouette reappeared briefly in the fanlight just as the second lamp was extinguished he leaned forward his concentration intense then swore as the windscreen clouded with his breath were there two people in the bedroom now he couldnt bear to think about it he couldnt bear to picture her in another mans arms wrapped in the warmth of the bedclothes whispering softly her hair falling over his shoulder and across his chest his fists pounded angrily on the steering wheel as he tried to force the images out of his mind and then the last lamp went out leaving the house in darkness shutting them in while he sat there like a fool in the windless night cold and wretched it was the fourth time hed driven into hampton regis he had promised the doctor hed do no such thing but the temptation was too strong overwhelming his better judgment haunted by the need to know he had told himself that once would do no harm but once had become twice and now here he was again dr beatie had said stephenyou arent healed yet do you understand emotional distress could put you back here in a worse state than before both of them knew it was a lie there could be no worse state than the one hed somehow miraculously survived he had had to kill the captain before dr beatie could set him free he wished now it had been matthew hamilton who had died he caught himself knowing it was wrong to wish such a thing but god he was tired and alone and sometimes afraid he wanted things the way they had been in before the warthe trenchesthe nightmares before matthew hamilton had walked into the clinic waiting room to comfort felicity and told herwhat lies or the sordid truth that her fiance was a coward after a time stephen got out to crank the motorcar the sound of the powerful engine roaring into life and filling the cold silence he would freeze to death if he sat here uselessly mourning setting his teeth he turned the motorcar and without looking again at the darkened house behind him drove back the way hed come he couldnt see behind the silken white curtains that covered the window under the eaves a pale face staring out into the night watching the puff of exhaust whip across the rear light a wraith shielding its brightness until it was out of sight matthew hamilton rose early quietly throwing back the bedclothes and the counterpane that covered him then tucking the ends around his wifes bare shoulder looking down at her he marveled again at his luck then reminded himself that it wasnt his luck at all but someone elses misfortune that he had married this lovely loving woman in his bed wryly turning away he dressed quickly and then set about making up the fire so that the room would be warm for her when it was drawing well he went down to the kitchen and blew the fire there into life for the kettle while he waited for it to boil he raised the shades and looked out at the clear cold morning the sun was not yet up but a pale rose had begun to streak the winterbrown lawns spreading to the cliff face overlooking the sea the water beyond was still waiting for the sun and farther out there was a soft mist blanketing it to the west across the harbor below the land rose up again running out to a point a little higher than the one on which his house was set the pair of headlands formed two arms embracing the molethe medieval stone pier that jutted out across the shingle to the tidelinecreating a haven for shipping along englands south coast in an age when sailing ships made hampton regis rich there had once been a watchtower on the far headland built to keep an eye on napoleon only ruins stood there now overgrown at the base a few feet of stone still reaching upward like pleading fingers two days ago hed seen a vixen and her kits romping there and hed been touched by their exuberance wondering how any man could hunt them down farmers were often a backward lot though it was an unkind thing to say but foxes kept vermin down and like the old owl in the belfry at the church deserved a better character than theyd been given the kettle whistled behind him startling him and he moved quickly to lift it off the plate he enjoyed these few minutes alone before the maid arrived before the house was abustle he also enjoyed spoiling his wife doing such small things for her pleasure a far cry from his long years of exile in other countries alone and often distrusted the voice of london when often london had left him to his own devices it was over and he called himself happy felicity was standing by the window when he brought her tea her robe belted tightly about her waist watching for the foxes he asked they should be active again this morning he handed her a cup as she turned but she hadnt been watching for the foxes he could see that in her face why was love so perceptive it would be better off blind he thought pretending not to notice her guilt she was saying we ought to have a fine day just as wellive a thousand things to do she smiled up at him then reached out to lay her free hand against his cheek i do love you matthew she told him softly he covered her fingers with his own im glad he responded simply i dont quite know how i managed to live so many years without you she set down her cup and walked over to the blazing fire shall i take the dogcart or the motorcar the motor of course it will be warmer she nodded thinking about her errands then she said must you call on miss trining today shell have something to say about you arriving in a dogcart far beneath your dignity he laughed yes i know i shall never live up to old petries standards queen victoria herself couldnt have found fault with him i should hope not she knighted him felicity answered laughing with him but just thinkthe next important man who chooses to reside here will be held up to your standards she lowered her voice not quite the man matthew hamilton was you know she said gruffly in imitation of miss trining i dont know what the foreign office is coming to these days it was perfect mimicry it would never do for you to attend a vestry meeting id see your face down the table know what you were thinking and lose any reputation i ever had for being a sober godfearing civil servant theyd chuck me out on the spot for unseemly levity not you she said quickly god knows theyre lucky to have someone under eighty willing to serve i on the other hand would be burned at the stake before sunrise like guinevere she bit her lip as she spoke the name wishing she could take it back she put her arms around his neck her eyes closed hold me she begged and he did her tea forgotten london end of february chief superintendent bowles sat at his cluttered desk chewing on the end of his mustache staring at his subordinate time off he said what on earth for apersonal matter inspector rutledge answered unforthcoming indeed bowles continued to stare the nurse whod sent him a copy of this mans medical file before rutledge returned to duty last june must have lied rutledge was still thin for his height and his face was drawn as if from lack of sleep but the eyes dark and haunted were intelligent and alert so much for cowardice and he hadnt shown a yellow streak in the north over that nasty business about the child the local man had complained of him of course and mickelson had been angry over the outcome of the case but the chief magistrate had told bowles in no uncertain terms that the investigation had been brilliantly handled and the chief magistrate had connections it wouldnt do to ignore that rutledge had also done well in northamptonshire though it had been a grave risk sending this man to see to hensley but then hed trusted hensley to keep his mouth shut and it had turned out all right there was no proof to be found that hed known what hensley was up to or none that he knew of his thoughts returned to the letter from the clinic bowles had half a mind to bring that fool nurse up on charges of incompetence for the past six months rutledge had somehow managed to turn every test into a small success what was he to do about this man who refused to destroy himself the nurse had sworn shed overheard him threatening suicide time and again she had sworn he wouldnt survive the rigors of the yard for more than a month two at best whats more how did rutledge manage to carry out his duties in such a way that others protected him protectors who were unaware that rutledge had come out of the trenches with shell shock and must have killed who knew how many brave soldiers through his own lack of moral fiber bowles would have given much to know who had pinned medals on this mans chest and called him a hero that officer deserved to be shot by god better still rutledge ought to have been shot he thought sourly and not for the first time it was the least the germans could have done after their rampage across belgium and france a nice clean bullet to the heart crossing no mans land if rutledge had ever crossed it of coursevery likely hed cowered in the trench out of harms way while his men died and no german fire could reach him there however hard the guns had tried his already bleak mood was turning into a nasty headache bowles suddenly became aware that hed been glaring at rutledge in silence he cleared his throat shifting in his chair to give the impression hed been preoccupied with other issues instead of sitting there like a fool daydreaming theres the shepherds market murder still to be solved not to mention that business about the men found dead in green park i dont see how i can spare you or anyone else for that matter rutledge said its rather important so is peace and order bowles snapped or do you think yourself above the rest of us jaunting about the countryside attending to personal affairs indeed while theres work to be done here neither of these cases is mine rutledge reminded him his voice neutral but something in his eyes warned bowles that this leave hed requested was a more serious business than rutledge was willing to admit bowles brought his attention back to his inspectors face was rutledge on the brink of breaking down was that what made him so anxious to get away for a bit the more bowles considered that possibility the more he began to believe in it what else could it be but a recognition on rutledges part that time was running out youre to stay in town and work with phipps do you hear me youll help him find out whats behind the green park murders and theres an end to it he sat back in his chair and studied the fountain pen in his fingers an end to it he repeated forcefully request denied chief inspector phipps was a nervous man whose efficiency was not in question but whose personality left much to be desired he seemed to feed on his own anxieties to the point of aggravating everyone around him inspector mickelson had sworn the chief inspector could drive god himself mad what would close contact with him do to a man facing a breakdown satisfied bowles picked up a file on his desk and opened it rutledge was dismissed chief inspector phipps walked into rutledges office without knocking his fingers beating a ragged tattoo on the back of the file he was carrying rutledge looked up his gaze going to the file the green park murders so close to buckingham palace had drawn the attention of the press two men had been killed there a week apart so far nothing uncovered in the investigation indicated any connection between them but each had been garroted and left in the bushes an early riser found the first victim when his dog was drawn to the shrubbery and began barking children playing hideandseek with their nursemaid had discovered the second victim their fathertitled and furioushad appeared at the yard in person demanding to know why his son and daughter had been subjected to such a gruesome experience they were distraught as was his wife hed told phipps in no uncertain terms and the yard was to blame for allowing murderers to roam unhindered in decent parts of town no mention was made of any anguish the nursemaid had suffered phipps set the file on rutledges desk and began to pace the narrow office as he spoke bowles has given you to me anything in particular on your desk at the moment rutledge said ive closed the file on george ferrell this morning good good phipps wheeled and paced back the other way each of our victims phipps went on was found on a sunday morning tomorrow is saturday i want green park covered from first light to first light youll be given a police matron dressed as a nanny shell be pushing a pram and youre her suitor a young clerk from a nearby shop who urges her to sit and talk for an hour he paused to consider rutledge you dont really look like a lovesick young clerk ill ask constable bevins to assume that role instead and you can walk bevinss dog several times during the day and early evening i want an inspector close by at all times you see youll have the damned dog on your hands until bevins is off duty see the beast doesnt annoy the chief superintendent if you must bring it back to the yard with so many people in the park it isnt likely that another murder will occur there rutledge pointed out and thats what im hoping dont you see we throw our man off balance make it difficult for him to plan phipps paused long enough to crack his knuckles one by one once the killer has lured his target into the park it wont be easy to shift him to another site what if hes already killed the two men hed intended to murder oh i dont think thats a very likely possibility weve got ourselves a trend here dont you know hell come to the park all right wait and see and hell have told his victim where and when to meet him i should think safer than arriving together someone might see them and remember he was pacing again rubbing his jaw with the back of his nails very well then were looking for two men arriving separately then meeting theyll go off together toward the shrubbery for privacy thats when well have them bevins is to bring his dog to the yard at six oclock tomorrow morning be here and make certain that you have a change of clotheswe shant want to be noticed hamish said aye but the dog will be the same dog but rutledges mind was elsewhere it was cold the trees bare the wind brutal coming down the thames huddled in a greatcoat he thought who would know whether he was wearing a blue or a gray suit beneath it but a change of hat and shoes might well be in order phipps was at the door tapping the frame as he changed his mind again no perhaps you ought to be the policeman on foot i hardly look like a young constable the dog and i will manage well enough unless he decides to bite you ive heard that bevinss dog has a nasty disposition and with that he was gone rutledge leaning back in his chair wished himself away from this place away from london away from the wretchedness of torn bodies bloody scenes of crimes although he suspected frances his sister had had a hand in it hed just been invited to kent to stay with melinda crawford whom hed known for as long as he was aware of knowing anyone other than his parents as a child melinda had seen enough of death herself in the great indian mutiny he could depend on her to keep him amused and to thrust him into her various projects never speaking about what had happened in november not twenty miles from her even a long weekend would be a godsend but there was nothing he could do about it as it happened bevinss dog was a great heavycoated black monster with more than a little mastiff in him he slavered heavily as he greeted rutledge and then trotted sedately at his side as the two of them left the yard and headed for green park in the back of rutledges mind hamish was unsettled this morning the voice was just behind his shoulder clear in spite of the traffic that moved through the streets even at this early hour or the jostling of people as they hurried past or stepped aside with a murmured comment about the dog on its leather lead ugly brute one man said and as if the dog understood he raised his massive head and stared back the man turned into the nearest shop out of reach of the strong white teeth grinning malevolently almost on a level with his throat hamish was saying yeve been reduced to this then a distraction any green constable on probation could ha provided not by choice rutledge answered curtly under his breath aye hes a bad enemy yon chief superintendent m granny would ha found him in the bowl of water and put a curse on him i wonder what my godfather would have to say to that hes no a scot he wouldna be told what went on below the stairs the voice was not really therealthough rutledge had never dared to turn his head to see it was in his own mind deepseated since july when both he and corporal macleod had cracked under the stress of the ferocious somme offensive but it was hamish macleod the good soldier the caring young scot putting his men ahead of himself who had faced the hastily collected firing squad intended to keep order in the midst of the bedlam of battle the charge was refusing an order but the order had been to lead his men back into heavy fire for one more hopeless attempt to reach the german machine gunnersone more suicidal command sent up from the rear hamish had continued to refuse and rutledge had had no choice but to execute his corporal for the greater good for the men who would have to die anyway whether their corporal was with them or not military necessity he himself had delivered the coup de grace refusing to leave to any of his men that last horroronly to be buried alive moments later by a british shell fired too short and rutledge knew then and in all his waking moments since that dreadful halfdeath that one more nightone more daywould have seen him refuse orders as well refuse to be a party to more ungodly slaughter instead hed been patched up at the nearest aid station and sent back to the trenches a man emotionally destroyed trying desperately to protect his men and all the while the voice of a dead man ringing in his head and in his dreams and in his ears rutledge said theres the park he wasnt aware that hed spoken aloud but the dog turned its head as if the words were meant for him good dog he said and then considered hamishs remark rutledges godfather david trevor had shut himself away in his scottish hunting lodge after the death of his son ross at sea there had been times when rutledge had been sorely tempted to confide in trevor about his own war about what he had done but scotland held too many memories now and however much trevor had wanted rutledge to befriend and guide fiona the young woman who was foster mother to trevors grandson it was not possible she was the girl hamish had intended to marry after the war and she still grieved for her dead fiance every time rutledge looked into her face his own wretched guilt closed his throat it should have been hamish not himself who had come home at the end of the war he could feel himself losing touch with the present the london street he was crossing in the midst of traffic his surroundings faded into images of torn and bloody young bodies lying in the mud and the sounds of men who screamed in agony as they were mortally hit or begged for their wives and mothers to help them he could hear the bolts on the rifles of the firing squad as a round was chambered and see his men shivering in a trench deathly afraid of going over the top one more time too exhausted to fire their weapons and yet driven to climb the ladders out of the greater fear of letting their comrades down ware a motorcars horn blew in his face jolting him into the realization that he and the dog were in the middle of the street vehicles swerving to miss them rutledge swore pulled the dogs lead closer and managed to get them to the far side of the road as hamish told him roundly to mind what he was about and what would chief inspector phipps think of half of london staring at the madman and dog intent on getting themselves killed on the mall if that didnt attract the attention of the murderer nothing phipps had planned would distract him but the shock of what had just happened reminded rutledge that it was cowardly to ask another man even his godfather to hear what no one should have to hear just to buy a little peace for himself hed managed on his own thus far he could manage a little longer but dear god it was lonely round and round it went the circle that had nowhere to end they had reached green park he and the dog and rutledge could see bevins courting the police matron in her demure nannys uniform the hardness of her face betrayed her but bevins was the epitome of a lovesick young clerk leaning earnestly toward the woman as if pleading with her his welsh charm was evident thrusting his wretched mood aside rutledge slowly walked the dog through the park giving the animal time to explore the smells frozen in the grass the very image of a man with time on his hands an exsoldier perhaps down on his luck the greatcoat and an old hat betraying his reduced circumstances he made himself stoop a little to change his appearance and fit his role the dog caught sight of bevins but the constable was prepared for that leaping to his feet and coming to kneel by the animal petting it while looking up at rutledge asking questions about the breed when rutledge called the dog to heel bevins got to his feet touched his hat to rutledge and went back to his wooing a good man during the interlude rutledge had glimpsed someone entering the park it was phipps walking too fast for a man strolling his eyes everywhere he took in the nanny and the constable looked across at a corporal who was leaning against a tree smoking a cigarette and a heavyset sergeant in a checked tweed coat seated on a bench casually reading the morning papers but the chief inspector passed through without speaking to anyone it was clear he had come to judge the authenticity of his actors and was satisfied rutledge finished his tour of the park and returned to the yard the dog thoroughly pleased with its outing he met inspector mickelson on the stairs and they passed without speaking mickelson was dressed as a banker furled umbrella hat set squarely on his head on his way to take his own part in phippss play the dog growled deep in his throat as mickelson went by and rutledge patted the massive head mickelson was a stickler for the rules and one of bowless favorites he had also nearly got rutledge killed in westmorland it was with some satisfaction that rutledge accepted the dogs judgment corroborating his own after half an hour bevins also returned his face flushed with the cold wind any luck rutledge asked meeting him in the corridor no sir then he grinned im a chimney sweep next got the clothes off a man we took up for housebreaking last week pray god theres no lice in them rutledge had walked the dog the third time glimpsing the sweep working on his brushes as if something about them troubled him the nanny was now unrecognizable as a shopgirl flirting with a young army private another man was arguing with a friend and rutledge caught part of what sergeant gibson was saying so earnestlyhis views on the labor party and what the government ought to do about people out of work weve got the same number of actorsrutledge thought bringing the dog to heel again after allowing it to explore among the trees along the edge of the grass it doesnt vary no murderer worth his salt would walk into such a carefully managed trap and then phipps was there again carrying his umbrella a folded copy of the times under his arm he looked like a retired solicitor his nose red from the cold his attention fixed on the distant traffic just barely heard here in the park it was a waste of time hamish was saying rutledge answered one of the murder victims sold pipes in a shop the other was a conductor on an omnibus what did they have in common that made them a target it wilna be how they earned their living true enough rutledge let the dog walk ahead to the base of one of the great trees that had given the park its name this was a place where men dueled once a long time ago oh aye but to use a garrote properly you must come from behind no facetoface its no an honorable encounter a woman then hamish answered thoughtful theres no woman else yon chief inspector would ha had her name by now fra someone eager to turn her in for prostitution a gaming debt a warning hamish countered and that thought rutledge was very likely the case a warning to stay in lineor die but for what from whom he had come to the end of the park buckingham palace gleaming in sootstreaked glory in the lateafternoon sun his father had brought him here as a child to watch the changing of the guard the ceremony had impressed him and for a week hed wanted nothing more than to be a soldier with a bearskin hat he smiled at the memory hed fallen in love with pageantry not war just as so many young men had done in august and theyd learned the difference soon enough in france there was a man leaning against a lamppost his face shadowed by his hat rutledge saw him but kept walking from where this man stood he could watch the comings and goings in green park the bare limbs of the trees offering none of the protection of summers shade rutledge passed him by ignoring him a hundred yards farther on he found a constable and surprised him by handing over the dog to him and then rutledge cut through st jamess park made his way back again to the mall and found a bench from which he could watch the man still leaning against the lamppost a low profile the wind was cold and he could feel his feet growing numb but he sat still his hat tilted over his eyes as if asleep when the man finally left his post and turned away rutledge followed at a discreet distance felicity never discovered why matthew went to walk on the shale beach below the breakwater that morning he enjoyed strolling by the sea it was hed often said a way of clearing his mind the fact that hed made it a habit of late had begun to worry her shed heard nothing by breakfast and ate her meal in anxious silence pretending that it was normal for her husband not to join her when he had business of his own in the town by ten oclock when there was no word she began to grow uneasy she went to find his diary to be certain hed had nothing scheduled for the day she couldnt settle to anything moving from task to task humming to herself to pretend all was well but it was a farce and failed to comfort her while nan the maid was dusting the stairs felicity slipped out to look for the motorcar and saw it was still in its shed the horse that drew the dogcart had been fed the stable mucked out chores matthew always dealt with before breakfast the cart was there where it always was nothing had changed he couldnt have returned from his walk if thered been someone at the door shed have heard it matthew wasnt in the gardens he wasnt in the house a mist still concealed the mole from view but she thought it was beginning to lift and no one had come to tell her that something had happened to him he couldnt simply disappearcould he she remembered those frightful landslips that occurred from time to time along the coast just west of here when an entire cliff face could vanish into the sea she shivered at the thought of never knowing what had become of him then scolded herself for letting her imagination exaggerate her fear by eleven she was verging on real anxiety pacing the floor listening for the sound of the latch lifting or a familiar footfall in the hall listening for the knocker to sound where was matthew she had just gone up to her room for her coat and hat when she heard the knocker clanging hard against the plate on the door felicity stood still for a moment her heart thudding and then calling to nan that shed see to it she flew down the stairs almost flinging herself at the door pulling it open with such force it startled the constable standing there mrs hamilton he said as if he didnt know her at all yes constable jordan what is it i was just on the point of going out he cut across her words its your husband mrs hamilton his tone of voice as much as matthews name stopped her in her tracks one hand outstretched as if to ward off the blow that was coming hes dead she said it so flatly that constable jordan stared at her no madam the relief was almost more than she could bear no she repeated here for an instant he thought she was going to faint before his eyes and he reached out for her arm steady on hes badly injured but hes not dead yet he added to himself theyve sent me to take you to him i can drive if you like drive yes he doesnt have the car does he she was bewildered trying to understand where is he at dr granvilles surgery yes madam stop calling me madam she told him irritably you know my name im not a stranger wait i was just getting my coat where were you going if i may ask to look for him of course he hasnt been home since early morning and she was already on her way up the stairs ignoring what jordan was saying to her back in a flash she was back with her coat and it wasnt until she stepped into the motorcar that she realized shed forgotten her hat inspector bennett knocked on the door of the house that was set above the little stream meandering down to the town through a broad valley it had once been a major river this forlorn little stream but over the centuries it had silted up and farmers had taken advantage of the fertile soil to carve out pasture and tillage more a pretty cottage than a house really bennett found himself thinking as he stood there left behind when one of the more prosperous farmers had built his family a grander home upstream restored in the s by a man retiring from ser vice in india it was what all expatriots seemed to dream of wisteriacovered doorway sweetly blooming in the spring thatched roof hanging low whitewashed stucco over stone and behind a white fence a front garden that in summer was filled with flowers that loved the cooler english weatherlupine and roses and sweet william and larkspur with hollyhocks towering over the lot the kind of garden his own grandmother had had come to that there was no answer to his knock and he tried again the cottage was actually outside bennetts jurisdiction set a good half mile from the towns inland boundaries he was within his rights to be here due to the nature of events and the charge would be murder soon enough the door seemed to open reluctantly and stephen mallory stuck his head out he was unshaven and smelled of whiskey bennett made a mental note of that examining mallorys eyes they were bloodshot and there was a cut on his cheekbone under the left one but mallory was fully dressed thats a nasty cut sir how did you come by it i dont know i think i fell out of bed what do you want its in connection with a body we found this morning might i come in sir a body mallory seemed to gather his wits here you mean in hampton regis yes sir not the war then he wiped a hand across his mouth relief evident hed dreamedbut let it go no sir mallory stepped out onto the vinecovered porch his eyes wary now what body id rather talk inside if you dont mind sir why theres no one here to listen saving the occasional sparrow what body it was bennetts turn to feel reluctance an early riser found the body of a man down by the breakwater mallory seemed to relax washed ashore you mean no sir though the tide had nearly taken him he hadnt been in the water long as far as we could tell whats it to do with me then you sometimes take an early walk along the water or the cliffs did you do either today you mean did i see the body and not report it no i didnt walk this morning i wasunder the weather does this body have a name or do you want me to identify him if i can is that why youre here standing facetoface with mallory bennett found it difficult to measure his man it would have been more usefuland more comfortableinside where he could have sat across the room and watched the play of emotions weve identified the victim sir but id like to ask you a few questions first if i may can you tell me where you were last evening and early this morning mallory was nothing if not quick the truth began to dawn on him and there was something in his eyes that startled the inspector relief anger certainly and then something else a very real fear hes dead you say i havent said bennett responded if youll just answer my questions its matthew hamilton theyve found isnt it for an instant bennett thought mallory was going to take the lapels of his coat and shake the answer out of him isnt it why should you think that sir bennett asked keeping his tone level unchallenging but stephen mallory was already out the door shoving him aside and racing toward the bicycle that bennett had left against the gatepost he caught the handlebars dragged the bicycle with him and opening the door tossed it high and into the rear of his motorcar he wheeled to reach the crank but bennett was there trying to catch him around the shoulders and wrestle him to the ground mallory threw him off with the strength of a madman bennett thought as he found himself hitting a fence post with a crack that made his head swim it was all the time mallory needed hed brought the engine to life with the crank and was already stepping into the motorcar when bennett charged him again tackling him around the hips mallory kicked out with his free leg bracing himself with the frame of the door and the steering wheel bennetts breath came out in a long whoosh then mallory was free and throwing himself into the drivers seat reaching for the gears he had just time enough to swing the door shut when bennett still game though breathing hard and struggling to keep on his feet leaped for the door mallory gunned the motor shifted into first and then as fast as he dared into second dragging inspector bennett with him as the motorcar jumped forward like a horse under the whip fighting for control of the wheel mallory drove on weaving at first and then more smoothly as his tires hit the lane and caught bennett holding on for dear life was being dragged his grunts of pain and anger jerked from his body as he bounced beside the car but then his grip slipped and mallory hammered with his fist on the other hand still clinging to the door bennett fell off with a wild yell and then screamed as the rear tire bumped over his foot mallory didnt stop there was only one thought in his head now reaching felicity before she could hear the news from anyone else felicity sat by her husbands bed in the small examining room near the garden door of the surgery where dr granville treated his more serious cases next to the bed were rolls of bandaging and a pan filled with bloody water a sponge on the floor beside it and a pair of scissors next to that matthew hamilton lying naked on the sheet seemed to be wrapped in gauze and tape his face was covered although she could just see the cut lip and the thickening bruise on his chin one arm was entirely swathed and there was more bandaging around his chest and on one thigh his color was ghastly she thought catching his good hand in hers and holding it tight matthew she whispered trying to keep her voice steady against the shock of seeing him like this matthew its me can you hear me oh darling can you hear me but there was only silence from the quiet figure on the bed dr granville behind her said impatiently i told you not to come in she whirled on him her face twisting with fear and anger hes my husband as if it explained anything anything at all come sit in my office granville was trying persuasion now until ive had a chance to finish my examination you mustnt interfere there could be internal bleeding for one thing he caught himself before he added brain damage why cant he hear me god in heaven youd think he would know my voice no matter how hurt he is hes not conscious mrs hamilton ive tried to explainit was a severe beating about the head one arm is broken theres a deep bruise on his thigh at least two ribs cracked as well thats as far as ive got for his sake hes better off out of his pain just now i cant administer any other relief until i know how his brain is affected if youll just sit there in my office she held on to hamiltons hand as if it were a lifeline i want to be here not somewhere else hes going to be all right isnt he and i want to be here when he wakes up granville thought shes hardly heard a word ive said to her aloud he went on i dont need two patients on my hands mrs hamilton think whats best for your husband still she refused to let go he ignored her then concentrating on running his hands over the broken body in front of him watching the thin trickle of blood that had begun to appear at the corner of hamiltons mouth there was a commotion out front and mrs granville came to the door doctor inspector bennett is here i think you ought to have a look at his foot granville glanced at her im busy he snapped all the same she answered and was gone after a moment he sighed and walked quietly out the door when his wife insisted he had learned to pay heed in the examining room behind his office granville found inspector bennett hunched in a chair his face gray with pain his eyes blazing with what appeared to be impotent fury dr granville looked down at the mans foot and his attention sharpened his wife had removed bennetts boot and the stocking was humped with the swelling broken he knelt by the inspector and his wife handed him a pair of scissors to cut away the policemans stocking bennett was biting his lip forcing down a groan of pain had to drag the bloody thing half a mile before i could find help he managed at last then glanced at the doctors wife begging your pardon maam what happened granville asked looking at the discolored ankle and twisted metatarsals the constable standing woodenly beside the inspector his face without expression waited bennett said in a growl that bastthat devil ran over me motorcar the inspector nodded and granville went on it will hurt but i need to run my hands hereand there he began gently and bennett all but screamed when the doctor pressed on the raised area just ahead of the big calloused toes dislocated i think your foot must have been on its side when the tire compressed it into sand i would guessany harder surface and the entire foot would have been crushed yes sand bennett answered between clenched teeth and i think this bone took the brunt and is probably broken he looked up nodding at his wife and she disappeared into the back reappearing almost immediately with a basin of soapy water and a cloth dr granville began to bathe the injured area keeping his hands away from the part that hurt the most then he proceeded to bandage the entire foot glancing again at his wife as he worked for right now swollen as it isand will beits most important to stay off your feet entirely but if you cant he turned and his wife set a pair of crutches into his hands if you cant then use these dont walk at all until the swelling is down im quite serious elevate your foot on a stool and soak it in this his wife passed him a small packet of crystals bandages and all every two hours and again before you go to bed after that well see ill come round to the house after my dinner and have another look at that bone mrs granville stood smiling at her husbands back as if hed worked a miracle for the inspector crutches bennett demanded cant you just set it put some plaster over it and let me be about my business youre not to put your weight on that foot bennett do you hear me not until i can look at it again who did this to you mrs blackwood mrs blackwood had learned to drive her husbands motorcar when he hadnt come home from france she was a terror on the roadway her control minimal and her attention seldom on the mechanics of driving the silent constable smothered a grin mrs blackwood bennett said almost snarling what has she to do with it no it was thatthat words failed him i was trying to bring in mallory in connection with mr hamiltons thrashing mrs granville tells me hamiltons still alive but not speaking mores the pity all he has to do is nod his head to a question or two and ill have my man granville said sharply you think stephen mallory is behind this beating surely not then why did he nearly break my neck and run over my foot in his hurry to get away from me when i set eyes on him again its charges hell be hearing assaulting a police officer with intent to do bodily harm suspicion of attempted murder and anything else i can think of id almost wish hamilton dead to make it murder you dont believe that granville answered him indignant why should mallory want to kill hamiltoni understood they were friends because bennett exclaimed his voice raised in fury he covets hamiltons wife didnt you know its the gossip all over town granville saw the inspector hobbling unsteadily on his crutches and in a foul temper out of the surgery for a moment he watched the man down the walk then cautioned the hovering constable to keep out of bennetts way his face thoughtful the doctor turned and strode back to hamiltons room he stepped across the threshold an apology for the delay on his lips and found his patient alone mrs hamilton had gone out through the garden door leaving it half ajar granville bent over matthew hamiltons broken body listening to his uneasy breathing to the doctors practiced eye his patients condition remained unchanged and if his wifes voice hadnt roused him it was safe to say that no one could for several more hours at the very least the body found its own methods of healing often enough and a wise medical man learned to leave it to work its own miracle he was almost grateful for bennetts injury to keep the man out of the sickroom with his loud badgering demands for answers and information you have twentyfour hours of peace make the most of them he added softly to the silent bandaged man after that i shall have to find another way of keeping the inspector at bay straightening granville looked toward the open door just behind him bits of conversation reached him down the passage two women in the midst of what must have been a lively discussion in one of the other rooms his wife speaking to someone in his office though he could only make out every other word there was a rumble of a reply then as the man raised his voice granville caught the end of the sentence if you wouldnt mind missus had mrs hamilton overheard any of his exchange with inspector bennett the man had all but shouted at times his anger getting the better of him had she heard bennett accuse stephen mallory of trying to murder her husband was that why she left so abruptly after hovering over hamilton nearly in tears he silently repeated bennetts last comment he covets hamiltons wife didnt you know its the gossip all over town dr granville found himself wondering how much of that was true felicity hamilton walked quickly through the streets without taking any notice of where she was going first one shock and then the other she wasnt sure she could deal with either of them she couldnt stop thinking about matthew lying there on the narrow bed of the doctors surgery looking like a dead man bruised battered his bones brokenit hurt to imagine what hed endured she hadnt thought to ask who had discovered him lying on the strand why hadnt she gone searching for him herself everyone knew he enjoyed walking along the tideline after a storm looking for treasures washed ashore not that he ever found manybut hed bring home a bit of driftwood or a smoothed shard of brown glass with the wide grin of a boy who had been out without leave offering his tokens in the hope of avoiding a scolding wrapped in a sea mist he particularly liked to stand at the edge of the sea listening to the waves break and roll toward him and there had been a sea mist this morning filling the gardens with a soft white veil smothering all sound as it swathed trees and walls with a pale dampness people would say she ought to have known tears ran down her face she loved him more than shed ever told him and if he died and didnt know it was her fault she refused to consider bennetts claim that stephen had attacked him it was too bizarre too unbelievable and yet she had almost believed it in the first shock of hearing inspector bennetts bold accusation it had torn at her heart and the icy truth of guilt had swept her you cant love two men not in the same way for gods sake its not possible the gates to the drive loomed ahead small things decorative hardly intended to keep intruders out or love inside she had no recollection of how she had got this far or how long it had taken her her feet had guided her home that was all that mattered had anyone spoken to her shed been deaf and blind absorbed in her own misery home the graceful tiled plate on the gatepost mocked her casa miranda the name of a house where matthew had lived in one of his postings hed liked it hed told her and had carried it with him ever after she had wanted to name the house on the hill windsong but hed laughed and said that was commonplace and shed soon grow to like miranda better it meant vantage point he said but it still sounded foreign to her like a womans name wasnt there a miranda in one of shakespeares plays she all but ran up the drive her gaze on the door and then stopped short why had she come back to the house why hadnt she gone to search for stephen she didnt know the answer to that except that shed run home like a hurt child to hide her face in her mothers skirts oryes she did know why she hadnt searchedshe hadnt wanted to look into his face and read shame and guilt and love there for an instant she debated going back to the doctors surgery but her feet were once more carrying her toward the front door not down the way she had come after what shed heard she couldnt bear to face any of them she was sure granvilles wife had never liked her this would only give mrs granville more fodder for gossip what bennett had said would be all over hampton regis before the day was out if no one believed it before everyone would believe it now opening her door she realized it was nans day to cleanshed forgotten that nan was here when the constable had knocked well shed just have to send the maid home she couldnt bear having someone there in the house moving about she needed to think stepping from the bright morning into the dimly lit foyer she once again stopped dead in her tracks matthew she said to the ghost of him sitting at the bottom of the staircase a sudden fear swept her had he died without her there to hold his hand had she left him to die and hed come to chide her but it wasnt matthews ghost it was stephen very much alive she watched his face crumple as he read the shock in her face how is he he asked his voice husky for gods sake tell me hes still alive hes alive she heard herself saying but hes soive never seen anyone that badly hurt thank god bennett told me theyd found a bodyi thought felicity shut the door and leaned against it her legs refusing to hold her up what are you doing here the policebennetts foot may be broken did you know that im sorry he tried to stop me it was his own doing i had to come here i had to tell you that i didnt harm matthew i didnt touch him felicity i would never have touched him tell me you believe me he got to his feet standing there with such pain in his eyes that she couldnt bear to see it felicity he put out his hand begging please felicity i didnt hurt him she took a deep shuddering breath i dont know what to think anymore if you were innocent why didnt you let bennett question you why did you run him down i didnt run him down he was clinging to the door of the car and wouldnt let go when he couldnt hold on any longer he dropped the wrong way i couldnt have stopped if id had angels holding the motorcar back all i could think of was that i had to see you had to tell you that i didnt touch matthew then who did she asked wearily i dont know im going to find out i promise you that oh stephen her voice broke he stepped forward intending to comfort her and then turned away for gods sake dont cry dont cry she repeated through her tears matthews probably dying and im here instead of there and i love you both and i dont want anything to happen to either of you why cant we just be happy and not think of anything else but that because i love you he told her bluntly and god help me i cant stop rutledge following his quarry through the busy london streets kept a good distance between himself and the man who had been leaning against the lamppost old bowels would have his head on a platter if he was wrong hamish was busy reminding him of that but instinct told him he wasnt wrong the mans interest had been too intense too personal his quarry moved briskly but without the illusion of hurrying they were into kensington now shops and flats on one side the palace grounds on the other at length the man turned down a side street walked four houses from the corner turned up the steps and let himself in the door rutledge stayed where he was it was an old trick walking into a building and waiting to see who was behind you and if someone was there he was often gullible enough to keep on going right past the window where you watched and you simply stepped out when he was past and went quietly in the opposite direction but after half an hour no one had come out the front door and rutledge was swearing with certainty that his quarry had gone out the back and disappeared he had resigned himself to losing the man altogether just as his quarry stepped out of the door again looked both ways and then came toward rutledge whist hamish warned in his ear there was nothing for it but to disappear into the door at his shoulder and rutledge found himself in a tobacconists the aroma of cigars strong in the confines of the small paneled shop may i help you sir he turned to find an elderly clerk behind the counter staring at him if he confessed to being a policeman rutledge thought it would be all over the neighborhood before tea and then his quarry came around the corner and opened the door to the shop rutledge quickly said to the clerk im looking for a mrs channing it was the first name that came into his head channing i dont believe i know any channings hereabouts mr fields is it a name youre familiar with and rutledge turning found himself confronting the observer at the lamppost his face was scarred giving it a bitter twist the slate blue eyes wary the mouth tight channings no i cant think of any sorry rutledge had no option he thanked the man and the clerk and went out the shop door into the street he made a pretense of standing there looking first one way and then the other as if uncertain what to do next hamish in the back of his mind said ye canna loiter rutledge snapped you neednt tell me he turned back the way hed come and moved on wondering where the constable whose patch this was might have taken himself he found a pub one street away and went inside do you know where i might find constable he left the name open the barkeeps face was closed constable waddington may i ask why youre looking for him is there trouble theres been a breakin at a neighbors house ive been sent to find him well thenhes just stepped over to mrs whittiers house sir heerhe looks in on her from time to time and where do i find mrs whittier rutledge asked patiently on linton street around the next corner but one you cant miss it number fortyone if i may ask whose house has had a break but rutledge was gone before the man had finished his question the whittier house was no more than a stairwellandaroom wide he went up the front steps and knocked firmly at the door a woman answered the summons her face a little flushed her curling fair hair more than a little mussed mrs whittier yes her voice was rather breathless and her manner dismissive as if he had no business knocking at her door at this hour of the day im looking for constable waddington will i find him here the flush deepened ohyes he was justhe was just helping me with theattic door i couldnt shift it at all and my trunk is in there but rutledge was already moving past her into the house waddington he bellowed and the constable came hurrying to the top of the stairs buttoning his tunic at the neck who are you the constable retorted and what do you want of me inspector rutledge scotland yard come down here and get on with your duty waddington moved swiftly down the steps straightening his tunic as he came and brought up short at the foot of the stairs braced for a reprimand and worse the skin around his eyes was tight with apprehension he was a short thin man with a ruddy complexion as flushed now as mrs whittiers rutledge said i need you to identify someone for me hurry relief flooded waddingtons face and he cast a swift glance at the woman watching anxiously a wordless warning rutledge was out the door with waddington at his heels and they had hardly reached the bottom step before the house door swung quietly shut the latch turned im sorry sir mrs whittier is a widow woman and the attic door wouldnt budge waddington trotted beside him attempting to keep up er yes sir theres a man called fields who appears to live on swan street the fourth house down the tobacconist knew him by name do you waddington responded scarred face tall yes thats his sisters house hes been living there since her husband was killed last month a widow three small children what happened to her husband whats his name they had nearly reached the tobacconists shop on the corner greene sir he was murdered by person or persons unknown someone had known whether the inquest had been aware of it or not any reason for the killing money sir a scheme that went wrong one that was to make his fortune only he was taken advantage of and lost everything instead all his savings this according to the widow at the inquest all the same she couldnt name the man who tricked him greene had kept his dealings to himself wanting to surprise her he said she begged him to go to the police but the next day he turned up hanging from a tree along the thames his killer tried to make it look like suicide but it didnt wash hed been garroted first and the men in green park had been garroted they had stopped at the corner and rutledge indicated the house in question is that where greene lived and fields now lives with his sister yes sir then lets walk on shall we as if were looking for someone else as they went on up the road waddington said whats this in aid of sir why are you asking about mr fields do you think he committed the murder no but i think hes been out for revenge a cab came along and rutledge hailed it i want you to maintain a close watch on fields for me if theres any change in his circumstances call me at once or sergeant gibson failing that meanwhile keep this to yourself i dont want gossip in the canteen or the shops do you understand yes sir am i to do anything else yes stay away from mrs whittier while youre on duty when he reached the yard rutledge learned that chief superintendent bowles was well on his way to an apoplexy and screaming for rutledges blood stephen mallory stood there at the foot of the stairs staring helplessly at the woman weeping in front of him no i didnt mean that ive put that all behind me felicity before she could answer the maid nan appeared at the top of the steps mrs hamilton she asked is everything all right noyes felicity said wiping her face with her gloved hands thank you nan ive just had bad news thats all not your mother nan said her strong face registering alarm oh not your mother maam shesits mr hamilton ill explain later could you find some tea for us please well be in the sitting room she walked briskly toward the rear of the house and into a room that looked out on the sea it was filled with windows two pairs on the front and one pair on the side and seemed to glow with the reflected light of the sun on the water vantage point it was certainly that sinking into a chair she said shut the door what are we to do bennett will be here before we know it after your blood casa miranda is the first place hell look and i must go back to matthew her voice broke again i dont know whether to believe you or not matthew hasnt an enemy in the world i cant imagine why anyone should attack him like that except in anger looking up at him she added irritably do sit down stephen im not accusing you im just terribly confused and worried and frightened what have you done with your motorcar its in your shed where bennett or his men cant see it from the road stephen took the chair farthest from her felicity what good would it possibly do me to hurt matthew he cleared his throat look even if i did away with matthew do you think id be fool enough to believe id have you then that youd forget him and walk off into the rainbow with me what good would it do me to hurt matthew for gods sakeit would be like hurting you bennett wont believe you you ran stephen it was the worst thing you could do i told you i ran to you not from him that was uppermost in my mind making sure you didnt believe what he was saying ill find bennett now and apologize and let him ask me whatever it is he wants to ask me hell take you into custody and therell be no end of fuss theyll drag our names through god knows what scandal and in the end it will be impossible to show our faces anywhere i heard him raving in dr granvilles office she stopped unwilling to repeat to mallory what had been said you cant imagine how furious he is how determined he is to blame you when matthew comes to his senses hell be able to tell them what happenedwho did this to him she looked at him what if he didnt see his attacker what if he doesnt remember what happened what if he dies without waking up what then stephen wheeled to the window blind to the distant sea glimmering at the bottom of the lawns and gulls wheeling above a fishing boat pulling for shore what would matthew do when he was in his right mind again and if he couldnt remember what would he think whom would he believe bennett he turned back to felicity trying to stifle the fear rising in him he said with more force than he felt hes bound to remember hes a stubborn old bird hell come through this felicity wait and see i must go back to the surgery what will you do she broke off as nan came in with the tea tray the womans eyes were busy moving from her mistresss face to stephen mallorys as she tried to make sense of the strained relations between them there was an avidness as well and stephen frowned what he saw worried him and his first thought was that nan would go rushing off to the police given the chance he got up hastily and took the tray from her saying thank you nan that will be all for now the maid reluctantly withdrew and after she had gone stephen went silently to the door and pulled it open suddenly expecting to find her there listening but she was not in the passage felicity was trying to pour the tea with shaking hands and sloshed half of hers into the saucer stephen gently took the teapot from her dabbed at her saucer with his handkerchief then gave her the clean cup adding sugar and milk to it she drank it thirstily as if it was a panacea for her problems i cant think my minds a blur she said setting her cup down at last i wish none of this had happened i wish it was all a bad dream and there was no truth in any of it i wish there was a pounding at the front door they stared at each other bennett stephen said the name with despair then added rapidly felicity if you believe im telling you the truth thats all that matters but she was at the sitting room door ahead of him never mind nan ill see to it she called and then turning back to stephen she said theres the revolver in matthews desk top drawer quickly stephen turned to the desk under the windows at the side of the room opened the drawer and found the weapon lying there under a handful of papers come with me felicity added all but pulling at him hurry to the door the pounding was louder filling the house with noise im not shooting a policeman no come on stephen hurry nan had stepped out of the kitchen passage half hidden by the morning shadows in that corner of the hall her inquisitiveness narrowing her eyes as she peered toward the door then she saw the weapon in stephens hand and cried out felicity said rapidly hold the revolver against my back do as i say but stephen was already there the weapon pointed at her even as he prayed it was empty driven by the strident pounding he refused to think beyond this moment beyond the need to protect felicity from any appearance of collusion in the tangle hed made of things she reached the front door and called out who is it her voice quivered but she had herself under control mallory marveled at her inspector bennett open the door mrs hamilton i cant she cried i cant please go away before he shoots me stephen flinched unprepared for her dramatic pronouncement he kept his finger away from the trigger bile filling his throat with a fear that had nothing to do with felicity or the inspector put the barrel into his mouth and end the torment thats all he had to do but not here not in front of her there was silence on the other side of the door then is stephen mallory with you mrs hamilton yes hes right behind me is he armed mrs hamilton yesyes he has my husbands revolver please dont open that door she could hear bennett speaking rapidly to one of the men with him then heard them speculating among themselves stephen seemed turned to stone behind her my maid is here too please go away please the anxiety in her voice was genuine her need to be rid of them pressing her into real fear very well mrs hamilton another voice said but well be back and id advise mr mallory that it would be in his own best interest to give himself up quietly theres no need to subject you to more horror i understand she thought she could hear them moving away to the drive still talking among themselves bennett would be furious at being thwarted a second time he wasnt a man to take frustration in his stride and try to deal with it sensibly she could feel her heart thudding in her chest realizing only then that shed made matters worse for herself and for mallory behind her stephen was exclaiming hoarsely what have you done in heavens name felicity do you want to see me hang they locked nan into one of the rooms in the servants quarters where a butler had kept a cot then went up the stairs into the sitting room again stephen drained sat down heavily in the chair by the window realizing he still held the revolver he gingerly set it on the desk and leaned back again stephen felicity was saying gently stephen no listen to me they arent going to treat you fairly bennett is vindictive at best hell have you up on a charge of attempted murder and if matthew dies she broke off her face horrified i cant go back to matthew i cant go back to sit with him you should have thought of that before you got me into this muddle but nan had seen you i couldnt pretend you werent here shed have told them everything she knows and made up the rest you dont know her all i could think of was that nan must surely have heard you say you still loved me its all they needed to be told bennett was already saying at the surgery that you and i she stopped what have i done i dont see any way out of this he glanced toward the revolver it would solve everything if i just went into the garden and ended it and let them think what they like felicity was out of her chair picking up the revolver and shoving it into the desk drawer again turning the key and then putting it in her pocket no dont ever say that again well find a way matthews man of businesswe can ask to speak to him and tell him the truth hes never liked you felicity you know that as well as i do it was true mr caldwell had had his hands on matthews fortune for years managing it while hamilton was out of the country he blamed felicity for the fact that hamilton had retired early and demanded an accounting shed always wondered if he had made free with the funds from time to time when his own accounts were in arrears if that was true hed covered his tracks by the time matthew resumed management of his money he would like nothing better than to watch matthew hamiltons wife begging him to defend her former lover and then refuse her pleas where else can we turn she considered the rector and the vestry members rejecting them one by one they would hardly defy the police on her account for the first time she realized how foolish shed been to antagonize the people matthew had tried to cultivate in his new circumstances unaccustomed to the narrowness of village life shed been quickly bored by the people here and with them and had told herself that soon enough matthew would be as well that this would become their country house for the summer months not their yearround residence in which case they neednt concern themselves with hampton regiss dull pretense at society she had slowly come to understand that he liked this part of england that he intended to live here because it was where hed hoped to live in his retirement it had been too late then to undo the first impression she must have made and her pride kept her from acknowledging her error to the likes of miss trining but she should have swallowed her pride and made the effort if need be she should have walked on hot coals barefoot for matthews sake instead matthews charm had become the key to her acceptance here and she had no illusions about that now when she was in need of kindness the restons and miss trining and the others would relish watching her being dragged through the mire it was what happened to older men who lost their heads and married unwisely they would say a beauty perhaps but look what such beauty came to in the end so sordid desperate now she added someone in london do you think friends of your uncle the bishop but his uncle the bishop had died in the autumn no theyd be useless he paused then said with obvious reluctance scotland yard even as he did stephen mallory knew what dr beatie would tell him dont open that wound again you arent healed yet you cant take the risk he got to his feet unable to sit still he wouldnt have to deal with the man surely he could just put his case to the yard and theyd send someone no they wouldnt not when they heard what bennett had to say he could feel his body tighten and his mind shut itself away even if he sent for the captain the man wouldnt come not when he realized who was asking for help yet where else could they turn he and felicity after what hed done and she had compounded this day but not the captainplease god not the captain he stood there looking down into felicitys face despair sweeping him with such force he felt sick for her sake he had to do something he must get her out of this nightmare unscathed whatever the cost and then he could go into the garden it wouldnt matter anymore he couldnt hide behind her skirts much longer he shuddered to think what half the town was whispering already stephen her eyes were pleading with him i dont know anyone at scotland yard do you he held out his hand for the key to the desk theres someonei need stationery an envelope she handed him the key reluctantly uncertain what he was going to do with it he rummaged in the drawer ignoring the weapon and drew out several sheets of stationery matthew hamiltons family crest stared back at him but he ignored it felicity pointed out the pen and ink and he began to write after a moment he stopped tore up the sheet and began again on the third try he appeared to be satisfied he handed her the sheet while he wrote a direction on the envelope she held the sheet of paper like a lifeline reading and rereading it bennett i refuse to surrender to anyone other than inspector ian rutledge of scotland yard bring him to me here as fast as you can i wont be had with promises and hed signed it simply mallory who is this man rutledge she asked frowning a policeman hell be sure to side with inspector bennett there must be someone else someone in the foreign officetheyll take matthews side wont they she rubbed her eyes with her hands i darent tell my mother shes not well it will kill her you wouldnt know this man wewe served together in france and just sending for him will give us a little time dont you see when matthew comes to his senses and tells bennett the truth i wont need the yard or anyone else it was sheer bravado his reward was a tiny flicker of hope in her eyes it faded as quickly as it had flared but will this man travel all the way from london just to let you surrender to him and what if he does and matthew is dead and cant ever speak there must be some other way weve got to find a way she looked at him her face flushed with distress and her eyes filling now with tears he wanted more than anything to take her in his arms and tell her it would be all right if rutledge wouldnt come there was always the revolver in the drawer he had seen the lock it was flimsy it could be broken and when he was dead felicity would be safe she could tell them whatever she pleased and it wouldnt matter how she must blacken his character he said none of that to her but there was bitterness in his voice when he finally answered her there isnt another way you should have thought of the consequences before you stopped inspector bennett from coming in its too late now we dont have many choices left to us bowles was livid where have you been not where you ought to be thats certain i sent men to the park to find you you were away from your post damn it i think i may have i dont give a dance in hell what you think man youre off the case if you will listen to mesir look at this bowles shot a sheet of paper across the desk know this man do you rutledge scanned the message it had come in as a telephone call from the south coast one stephen mallory holding two women at point of gun refuses to surrender to local authorities will speak only to inspector rutledge wanted for severely beating one matthew hamilton and leaving him for dead for assaulting a police officer in the course of his duties presently threatening to murder his first victims wife and her maid if rutledge does not come in person stephen mallory his memory rejected the name drew a deliberate blank but hamish said roughly lieutenant mallory reminding him against his will the war so many things came round to the war he couldnt escape it no matter where he turned for him it had really never ended he could feel himself sliding back there again to the trenches to the somme and lieutenant mallory standing in the summer rain cursing him cursing the war cursing the killing rutledge could smell the foulness of the mud and the fear of his men heard the noise that threatened to deafen himthe constant rattle of machinegun fire and the sharpness of rifle fire and the heavy pounding of the shelling men were screaming all around him and the dead or dying were everywhere he looked along the top of the trench under foot out in the wire and in shell holes the first day of that bloody battle when so many men died twenty thousand of them in one day hamish brought him out of the nightmare his voice loud in rutledges ears he was wounded but they sent him back to the front yes he answered silently they had been so short of men the medical staff had cleared anyone who could still hold a rifle as fit for duty days later rutledge himself had taken his own turn at the aid station resting a few hours then getting to his feet and stumbling out of the tent like a man sleepwalking rutledge remembered mallorys dazed eyes the stiffly bandaged shoulder the fearlessness that had bordered on recklessness it had turned his salient against the lieutenant and there had been whispers about him that he was bad luck that he got men killed and mallory had been hellbent on proving he was no coward whatever the doctors had murmured about possible shell shock missed the bone hed told everyone making light of it still it aches like the very devil but nothing for the pain until ive won the war and four days later he had been found crouched in a shell hole crying softly this time the wound was in his calf and he couldnt walk the stretcher bearers had got him back to the rear while rumor debated whether he had shot himself or been picked off by one of the new german snipers orby his own men they hadnt seen him again bowles was still waiting searching rutledges face dragging himself back to the present rutledge looked up at him he was in france it was a reply brief to the point of curtness but it was all he was prepared to say while the chief superintendent glared accusingly at him as if he bore the responsibility for whatever had happened along the south coast so was half the male population of britain in france why should this man mallory summon you in the circumstances with the war well over the suspicion in bowless voice was palpable i cant answer that sir we werentclose friends if thats what you are suggesting i cant imagine why he should wish to see me now it was the truth rutledge was still recalling more details about mallory details stuffed long ago into the bottom of the black well that was nightmare and the war a gifted officer yet he lacked the common touch that made tired and exhausted soldiers follow him over the top hamish macleod had possessed that touchand so although he had hated it had he himself he had felt like a charlatan a pied piper using his voice and his experience in command to lure unwilling men to their deaths a judas goat unharmed while so many were slaughtered around him like cattle at an abattoir but mallory had got out he had deserted his men and got out hmmpf bowles slammed a drawer shut taking out his impotent anger on the unoffending desk so you say well youd damned well better get down there and see what this is all about and youre not to play favorites you understand me the man this mallory is said to have attackedhes got friends in high places theyll be howling for my blood and yours if his wifes made free with you understand me are you sending me to he glanced down at the message again to hampton regis i dont have much choice do i who is the victim this matthew hamilton the name was not uncommon foreign office served on malta before he resigned went uninvited to the peace conference in paris im told and wasnt very popular with his views there but hes still too bloody important to ignore and if his wife wants you shes to have you i thought it was mallory who asked for me dont quibble rutledge just get yourself down there as soon as may be i dont want to see your face until this business has been resolved i must speak with phipps before i go sir theres something he ought to know about the green park killings phipps is perfectly capable of drawing his own conclusions i want you in hampton regis this night and i expect you to get to the bottom of this business as fast as you can sir theres a man in kensington are you deaf leave phipps to his own affairs and see to yours thats an order good day rutledge turned and walked out of the room hed have given much to know whether fields had had a hand in the green park killings and for a moment he considered going in search of sergeant gibson but if bowles got wind of that the sergeant would find himself caught in the middle rutledge went back to his own office collected his coat and hat and made his way out of the building to his motorcar if he wrapped up this business in hampton regis quickly he would be back in london in good time to look into the possibilities himself and he had a strong feeling that fields wouldnt kill again unless he was pressed rutledge had hoped that chance would throw sergeant gibson in his path before hed left the yard it would have been better for both of them if the encounter had come about naturally hed taken his time going down the stairs out the door listening to voices here and there but the sergeant was nowhere to be seen or heard what if yere wrong aboot fields hamish asked ye canna put him at risk withoot better proof a hunch wasnt proof a gut feeling wouldnt stand up in court but in hasty hands either could send an innocent man to die on the gallows bowles was right it was best to step aside and leave the case in phippss hands for the time being rutledge turned away from the yard and drove to kensington to find constable waddington if fields was guilty hed still be there when rutledge got back and it wouldnt do for waddington to become the third victim of the green park killer simply because rutledge had put the fear of god into him about duty it was time to call him off until there was something he himself could do about fields the drive to the south coast was long and cold this part of england held bitter memories for rutledge he hadnt been to the west country since last summer he caught himself thinking about those ghosts in his past cases hed dealt with even while he struggled to cope with hamish macleod driving him nearly to suicide he tried to shut the ghosts out by filling his mind with familiar lines of poetry then realized that from habit most of them came from a single author o a manning had been an echo of his war her poetry locked in his brain because it had touched a nerve at a time when he was grateful for any understanding he had found that in the slim volumes he carried with him in the trenches a voice of sanity in the middle of a nightmare o a manning had reached many men at the front though she herself had never set foot in france hamish was taunting him you were half in love wi her he wasnt sure whether it was half in loveor caught in her spell still ever since then hed found himself measuring other women by her memory that had not always been a wise thing to do for it had drawn him to one woman in particular and memory had been a false mirror as he had learned to his sorrow hamish said his voice unforgiving in france i lost fiona forever what right do you have to be happy now it was unanswerable they drove in silence for miles after that rutledge forcing his attention to stay on the road ahead and then as night fell on the sweep of his headlamps marking his path traffic had thinned and at times his vehicle was the only one he saw for long stretches he passed a lorry once and later a milk wagon trundling on its way an owl flitted through the light that guided him and later what looked like a hunting cat darted to the side of the road startling him awake he kept reminding himself that two lives hung in the balance in hampton regis if he failed two women might die and he couldnt be surehe couldnt be absolutely certain that mallory would spare them not if he was driven to the point of desperation because rutledge had no idea how mallory had changed in the past three years for better or for worse he heard a church clock striking the hour as he drove the last winding half mile into the heart of hampton regis although it was quite late he found a furious inspector bennett waiting impatiently for him in the police station off the harbor road what took you so long i expect the train would have been quicker rutledge his shoulders tight from pressing as hard as he had on the roads said only im here now hed refused to take the trains since hed come back from france they were crowded claustrophobic leaving him shaken and frantic to get down as soon as possible a hurtling coffin of metal and wood he doubted if bennett would understand that yes and id like to know what you intend to do about mallory made me look a fool having to send for you i manage my own patch thank you very much without outside interference i intend to do nothing at the moment rutledge glanced down at the mans foot in a thick and unwieldy cast that must be hurting like the very devil how did it happen hed been intent on changing the subject but was taken aback by the vehemence of bennetts retort mallory ran me down thats what happened when i went to arrest him flung me off the damned motorcar directly into its path if i hadnt been quicker i daresay hed have been glad to see me dead under his wheels the note had said something about mallory assaulting a police officer but rutledge had assumed there had been a brief exchange of blows or a shoving match such violence put an entirely different complexion on the coming confrontation and it seemed to underline mallorys guilt in attacking hamilton hed hoped to wait for daylight for his own sake as well as to give mallory time to rethink his position after all there had been no set timetable for his arrival and darkness often put fears and decisions into uncomfortable perspective men brooded in the night and were grateful for sanity in the morning are you up to answering questions he asked bennett now ill need a better picture of events than was available at the yard for one thing has anything changed in mallorys situation are the women still safe has he tried to harm either of them they walked back to bennetts office bennett sank into his chair like a man in pain easing the injured foot out of the way of his single crutch rutledge took the only other chair it was a tiny room hardly wide enough for the desk the chairs and the two men from the scatter of papers across the desktop rutledge could see that his counterpart was not a tidy man more impetuous than organized and likely to have a temperament to match bennett shuffled irritably at the papers turning some shoving others aside creating a small avalanche that he caught just before it went over the edge the near mishap did nothing for his mood hamish said hell no help you if he isna forced to a facade rutledge answered silently thats all im expected to be but well see about that bennett was saying theres not much to tell matthew hamiltonyou probably know the name coming as you do from londonwas walking on the strand early this morning in a heavy sea mist apparently its something he does to help him think thats what one of the other vestry members told me miss trining that was at any rate someone came up behind him footsteps no doubt muffled by the incoming tide and struck him down while he was still dazed his attacker hit him repeatedly with something heavy a stick a cane a bit of flotsamwho knows by the time someone saw him lying there and summoned help hamiltons feet were awash and all tracks had vanished if no one had seen him in time he might well have drowned in another quarter hour matthew hamiltonrutledge cudgeled his tired wits his sister had spoken of the man from time to time or one of her friends had done rutledge had paid scant attention but he possessed a good memory and he managed to dredge up a few details hamilton moved in good circles but he wasnt particularly enchanted with london and soon after his marriage hed disappeared from the social scene that accounted for the move to hampton regis but why had he chosen to close up his flat as well london gossips had looked for an answer to that and failed to find it the information bowles had given rutledge was lean to the point of skeletal that hamilton had been at the peace conference in paris coming unbidden from his station on malta and was sent back there posthaste wasnt it this same hamilton who had been against stiff reparations from germany french vengeance hed called it and hadnt he railed against the american president wilsons belief in selfdetermination publicly branding it foolishness in the extreme wilson had been tired ill his idealistic pronouncements according to hamilton failing to take into account the realities of world politics and setting the stage for grave consequences down the road the british and french delegations had been intent on ignoring the american president palming him off with his precious league of nations hamilton had tried repeatedly to convince them all that they were sowing the seeds of disaster which another generation would reap in blood it hadnt been a popular stance the british had all but disowned him as they had disowned lawrence and others with a clearer vision rutledge had been in hospital during most of the peace conference his knowledge of it secondhand but the displeasure of the foreign office hadnt sent a man of hamiltons stature to a backwater like hampton regis small wonder the gossips had been busy given hamiltons history what scandal or past indiscretion might have caught up with him here stephen mallory had had no role in hamiltons diplomatic career yet that had covered at least twenty years of hamiltons life bennett was still speaking his voice sour and how is it youre acquainted with this man mallory does he have friends in high places hardly high places i expect the yard was more concerned about the hamiltons and their maid than any connection i might have with your suspect then you wont mind telling me how it was you came to know him in the war rutledge answered him and changed the subject though he knew bennett wasnt satisfied any improvement in hamiltons condition not according to the doctor bennett grimaced as he shifted his foot again hes been close to consciousness a time or two but he never quite wakes up that doesnt bode well for his ability to recall who attacked him yes i see that what happened next i sent my constable jordan to the hamilton house to fetch mrs hamilton to him and i went to mallorys cottage myself it lies inland a few miles up the hampton river my intent was to question him about where hed been that morning but he lost his head and went directly to find mrs hamilton she was at dr granvilles surgery he waited until she came home and took both mrs hamilton and her maid hostage when we went to try and talk him into surrendering he threatened to kill both women if we didnt summon you directly since then you havent tried toerpersuade him to surrender i had myself driven up to the house shortly before nightfall and called to mrs hamilton mallory answered for her and reminded me that their safety depended on you coming down from london he considered rutledge his eyes hostile i still cant see why he should have sent for you by name there must be more to it his posture was insistent as if he were determined to get to the bottom of the connection ive told you we served together in france and i expect im the only policeman he knows bennett took out his watch ive posted two men near the house out of sight but where they could hear the women scream or a shot fired its time to relieve them i expect youll want to come along you can speak to mallory yourself they went out to the motorcar and bennett beckoned to two constables who had just arrived at the station to accompany him they nodded to rutledge and stepped into the rear seat where hamish usually sat the familiar scots voice rumbled with irritation all the while bennett was still pressing eager to wrap up the inquiry for him the matter was very simple rutledge was here therefore mallory ought to surrender himself to the police it neednt drag on any longer rutledge didnt interrupt understanding the pentup frustration that drove the man but the harangue also served to fix his own actions bennett was using the listening constables behind him to make certain that the man from london couldnt avoid doing his duty fate was never kind he wasnt prepared tonight no more than he expected mallory to be prepared his mind needed to be fresh and in the dark mallory would be on edge expecting trickery hamish spoke just behind his shoulder the voice seemed much nearer as if the scot had leaned forward to whisper mayhap he willna open the door and rutledge answered silently hell want to see what ive become hampton regis was fitted inside the curve of its tiny bay with the snugness of centuries houses along the molethe ancient harborwere timeless their facades much the same rutledge thought as he turned the motorcar since the days of drake and the duke of monmouth the later housesand they were barely later than the last centuryhad been built along streets set perpendicular to the waterfront like newcomers handed second best bennett suddenly aware that hed lost rutledges attention with his barrage of advice dropped the subject of mallory and nodded toward the western end of the mole disappearing behind them the river was broader once and the shipyards and fishing industry lined its banks once the river silted up victorian money leveled the ground and built there now the hamptons hardly more than a little stream passing under a stone bridge then he added with the satisfaction of the workingclass man my grandfather always said fish scales make the slopes of social climbing rather a slippery business he waited for rutledge to smile at his grandfathers plebeian sense of humor but the man seemed to be intent on his driving as if feeling the miles hed already come instead rutledge was struggling to marshal his thoughts wondering in another part of his mind if anything remained of the authority he had once exercised over the lieutenant under his command in france and whether he could wield it now the hamiltons lived out on the road hed come down from london the one that ran in a gentle bend down into the town traced its way along the water and then rose softly to the far headland following the coast for miles before vanishing into devon bennett was telling him now that the western stretch of cliffs was prone to landslips and from time to time over the centuries had sent houses and farms and churchyards down into the sea matthew hamilton on the other hand had chosen the more stable eastern heights living in one of the larger houses there on the seaward side with sufficient property around them to give them privacy the view of the water as the motorcar climbed was stippled with faint moonlight like a tarnished mirror bennett pointed and rutledge paused to drop off the pair of constables then he turned through gates into a trim garden the drive made a loop through the flower beds ending at the steps time had run out what was he to say to mallory he looked up at the house wondering what emotions ran rampant behind that late georgian front upright and gracious its weathered brick surely a lovely rose in the daylight very much the sort of classic design a career foreign ser vice officer might have yearned for in his long exile abroad in the heat of some godforsaken island or busy overcrowded capital an england that existed now only in homesick dreams the war had changed all that there were no lights that rutledge could see he hoped the household had gone to bed where he wished he was now but it would not be a peaceful sleep for the two women imprisoned there with a possible killer and he was their only hope he tried to picture mallory creeping up behind hamilton as he walked along the strand and striking him hard across the back of the head he wanted to believe it was impossible that a man hed known in the trenches could do such a thing but then theyd been taught to kill by masters and what was one more life in the long rolls of the dead bennett had been treated with equal callousness there had to be a reason and why if hed had the chance to run had mallory come here instead and that brought rutledge to hamiltons wife what was her relationship to mallory or his to her without warning hamish said you should ken how he feels rutledge caught his breath on the realization in spite of the promises theyd made to each other at the start of the war jean had left him to marry a diplomat serving now in canada had mallory been mrs hamiltons lover once was that the key bennett was staring at him waiting for him to act rutledge forced himself back to the present stay here he said to bennett and left the motor turning over quietly as he went to lift the knocker after a time a male voice called warily whos there he didnt recognize it rutledge from scotland yard he answered carefully its very late im aware of that i drove straight through after the summons i wanted you to know im here stand in your headlamps so that i can see you rutledge turned and did as he was asked after nearly a minute a curtain twitched in an upstairs room then the voice was back at the door calling youve changed but then so have i come back in the morning alone keep bennett out of this the tension behind the words was clear even through the doors wooden panels i told you bennett jeered wound like a spring i wont leave until im certain the women are safe rutledge responded returning to the door himself to listen for whatever sounds he could hear from inside someone had a candle its brightness wavering as if in an unsteady hand had mallory been drinking that was a bad sign rutledge tried to recall what theyd talked about in the lines and what the mans weaknesses were the problem was they hadnt been close mallory like rutledge himself had had other things on his mind rutledge had had more in common with hamish though they had come from vastly different backgrounds both had possessed an instinctive understanding of tactics and strategy and that had drawn them together over his head the fanlight was elegant reminding him of georgian houses in london it had been crafted he thought by a master hand but all the candles golden light showed him was a shadowy flight of stairs and the lamp hanging in the hall venetian he thought in one corner of his mind hamish was saying he broke mallory did only you didna shoot him and that summed up more than rutledge was prepared to deal with tonight the voice inside the house went on theyre safe i had promised as much if bennett sent for you theyll be safe until the morning i swear it i want to speak to mrs hamilton myself damn it man shes asleep nevertheless ive kept my half of the bargain there was a silence broken only by bennetts grumbling from the motorcar finally a womans voice nervous and uncertain called inspector he hasnt harmed us please do as he asks well be all right tonight mrs hamilton yes have you news of my husband ive been so worried about him hes resting mrs hamilton so im told but you need to be with him if mr mallory will allow it ill take you to the surgery myself so that you can be reassured your husband is going to live from the motorcar bennett called its not her we want out of there its him rutledge ignored him ii cant leave she answered iin the morning perhaps mallory surely youll relent for mrs hamiltons sake but there was only silence from the other side of the door after a time rutledge returned to the motorcar and climbed into his seat he could feel the tension of the last few minutes smothering him until his head seemed to thunder with it you should have pressed him bennett told him in no uncertain terms while you had the chance god knows what state those women will be in come morning rutledge said mallory is tired he wont be thinking very clearly anything that strikes him now as interference on our part will only make their situation worse i cant believe hell harm them tonight not after hed got what he wanted well leave him to wonder about tomorrow and how hes to explain himself thats foolishness bennett retorted youre coddling a murderer hamish said making clear his opinion of bennett hes no thinking sae verra clearly himsel he hasna considered that yon lieutenant would gladly see ye deid why do you so firmly believe mallory attacked hamilton rutledge asked the fuming inspector beside him as they drove out of the gates he could see that a new face had replaced the watcher hed glimpsed earlier in the shadows of a large tree he presumed that while he was speaking to mallory distracting him there had been a swift changing of the guard and the other constables had already walked back into hampton regis jealousy bennett said baldly mallory was involved with hamiltons wife he considered the ramification of this or only infatuated with her hamish derisive in his mind demanded does it make any difference i cant say bennett added grudgingly how much involvement there has been if gossip is to be believed certainly on mallorys part there was the desire to step into matthew hamiltons shoes or bed how mrs hamilton felt about it no one seems to know what else do the gossips whisper theres a difference in age between mr and mrs hamilton twenty years at a guess mallory on the other hand cant be more than three or four years older than mrs hamilton the rest is plain as the nose on your face isnt it she wouldnt be the first woman to see a young sweetheart off to war and then have second thoughts about waiting for him especially when her heads turned by the attentions of someone of hamiltons standing it explains why when young mallory is mustered out he comes straight to hampton regis to live not all that long after the hamiltons take casa miranda hes got no family here nor any connections that we know of what else could have brought him mallory returned to england in did he now then wheres he been since then bennett shook his head i dont see how it matters either way hes in love with her thats clear enough whenever it was he came to know her why else was he in such a hurry to see her once he knew he was caught out why indeed where theres smoke theres bound to be fire the road was quiet the town dark asleep and so hamilton was struck down beaten and left to drown but no one saw the attack no one has stepped forward id like to look in on matthew hamilton rutledge said its well after midnight man you cant go dragging the doctor out of his bed at this hour i doubt hes in his bed oh very well bennett gestured toward the first turning as they reached the mole down that street to the next corner the house with the delicate iron fencing along the back garden but the doctors house was dark and although rutledge went to tap lightly on the surgery door no one came to answer his summons he tested the handle and it turned in his hand did no one in the country lock their doors he stood in the opening listening intently but the dark passage before him was silent and he could feel inspector bennetts eyes boring into the back of his head if the doctor wasnt sitting up with his patient it was very likely a good sign that he was not expected to die this night they drove back to the mole where the sea beyond the harbor wall was a black presence restless and whispering as the wind picked up there they took the second turning and bennett pointed out a small inn set back from the street a black and white elizabethan building with a slate roof where once there must have been thatch and outbuildings in the yard behind it a small garden had replaced the yard in front and daffodils were already in bloom in sheltered patches this morning would be the first day of march rutledge reminded himself the winter had seemed endless unrelenting thats the duke of monmouth inn bennett told rutledge ive taken the liberty of putting you up there but id be obliged if youll drive me as far as my house which is down the end of the street and on the next corner damned foot rutledge went past the inn and on down the street you believe that mallory ran from you because hes guilty why didnt he keep going either into devon or toward the port towns it would have been a smarter move on his part bennett said i told you it was a matter of jealousy whats the sense in killing the husband if you dont succeed in getting the wife to yourself hardly to himself if the hangmans knocking at the door yes well i dont suppose hed expected to find himself the prime suspect so quickly nor her so hesitant about running off with him while her husband was still alive if the sea had taken the body itud been a different story bennett hesitated and then added id led mallory to believe hamilton was dead it seemed best at the time he must have been shocked when he learned his victim was still with us and thats my point rutledge countered pulling up before the small house that bennett was indicating youre looking at the connection between mallory and mrs hamilton as a strong motive instead mallory might have gone to her for fear he would be blamed youve told me of no direct evidence linking him to what happened except that he ran bennett answered simply reaching into the back of the motorcar for his crutch add to that he had no compunction about killing me as well and now hes holding those two women at the point of a gun does that cry innocence to you rutledge found he was holding his breath the rear seat of the motorcar belonged to hamish but bennetts fumbling was successful and he retrieved the crutch nearly striking rutledge in the face with the rubber tip id not heard it myself bennett repeated swinging the crutch out into the road and gingerly lowering his bad foot after it the worst of the gossip i mean but one of my men coxe by name brought it to my attention hes cousin to the housemaid nan weekes just as well he told me that gave me a jump on mallory or so id thought nearly had the bastard but ill have him yet with that he hobbled up to his door and went in without looking back rutledge waited to see bennett safely inside and then easing his stiff shoulders he turned the motorcar toward the hotel even hamish was ready to call it a night his presence heavily silent in the rear seat the duke of monmouth inn was named for the illegitimate but favored son of charles ii and there had been many people when charles died who preferred him over the catholic prince james the kings younger brother a short but bloody rebellion centered mostly in the west country had come to grief on the scaffold at the hands of bloody jeffreys the hanging judge of the bloody assizes and that was the end of the duke and so history had taken a different turn the intolerant james had assumed the crown only to face his own trouble in less than three years that had swept in his daughter mary and her dutch husband william there were not many inns named for him rutledge thought making the turning the building appeared to have been a coaching inn during the early s hardly the dukes era still there was a portrait of him in velvets a wig and a plumed hat on the sign hanging from an iron frame above the door if the artist was to be believed monmouth had been a rather handsome young man who bore no resemblance to the longfaced stuarts the sign creaked on its hinges as rutledge walked around to the door after leaving his motorcar in the yard behind the inn he could feel the seas breath salty and damp as he lifted the latch and stepped into the dark lobby a lamp bloomed from the door into the office and a sleepy night porter stepped out wary but curious inspector rutledge he said to the man setting down his valise and moving to the desk inspector bennett has taken a room for me the night porter reached inside a drawer and handed him a key first floor to your left number fifteen rutledge took the key retrieved his case and went up the shadowy stairs hamish said as they made their way down an even darker passage i wouldna be astonished to see a ghost outside yon door as long as he doesnt rattle chains as i sleep ive no quarrel with him hamish chuckled derisively there were other things rutledge feared in his dreams the rattle of machinegun fire he opened the door to number and discovered that it was large enough and pleasant enough with a view toward the sea through rows of chimney pots but standing at the glass careful not to place himself where he could see his own reflectionor hamishs behind himhe could just make out the rooftop of hamiltons house on its gentle rise above the harbor and the sweep of the drive as it reached the gates and turned in and it intrigued him that the house sheltered in its garden was so visible from this angle it would be easy to wait here and watch the comings and goings to the door he made a mental note tomorrow to look in the other rooms on this side of the inn to see if the view was as clear after conferring with the desk clerk after breakfast rutledge learned that the rooms to either side of his were not presently occupied and he took the opportunity to look out their windows but the inns chimneys blocked any view from the room to his right while to the left a clump of trees in the rear garden of a house across the way broke up his line of sight sufficiently to shield most activity at the hamilton home number offered the clearest view aye but to what end hamish asked him bluntly someone must have watched hamilton leave his house on the morning he was attacked without necessarily being seen as far as i can tell other than the church tower the inn offers the best vantage point the night desk clerk slept in his little room behind reception anyone could step quietly through the inn door without waking him and the stairs are only a stones throw away carpeted and dark as pitch rutledge decided to walk to the hamilton residence this morning a quieter approach than arriving by motorcar the air was damp and cloudy the sea a wintry gray and the tang of salt strong on the wind mixed with the reek of the tideline gulls wheeled dipping and calling raucously where a man sat cleaning his catch over the gunwale of his boat as he climbed the road rutledge turned to look at the headland across the bay the woman waiting tables at breakfast had told him there had been landslips there in living memory it no doubt explained why no one had built there but five minutes later showed him the stone foundation of what appeared to be an ecclesiastical building rather than a house hamish said belligerent this morning you canna be sure but he thought he could the pattern of the stones seemed to indicate a round small chapel perhaps once called st peters after the fisherman its tower a beacon to returning ships or dedicated to st michael since that militant saint seemed to fancy the high ground and then the other side of the bay was cut off from view and he could look down into the harbor and far out to sea a fishing boat bobbed in the near distance taking the weather in stride but a man in a rowboat coming around the cliff face and pulling for the mole was battling stiff currents rutledge reached the hamilton gate nodding to the damp constable huddled under his cape beside a cedar that seemed to drip constantly its own waterfall the tiled plate announcing casa miranda caught his attention an exotic name for a stately georgian house but hamilton might have wanted a nostalgic reminder of another life rutledge went directly to the door and lifted the brass knocker letting it fall heavily like the stroke of doom it was daylight now he thought such as it was he prayed the ghosts would stand more easily at bay after a moment a weary male voice called whos there rutledge im alone give me five minutes to be sure of that finally satisfied mallory let him inside but kept the door between himself and the gardens beyond as if expecting a sniper waiting to pick him off hes haggard hamish said not without satisfaction as rutledge and mallory confronted each other in silence both taking note of changes since they had fought together in france both searching for a middle ground that had nothing to do with france mallory looking at rutledge could see more clearly the toll the war had taken and the peace had not replaced rutledge could read all too well the long lines of pain in the other mans face the dark circles of sleeplessness and strain under the eyes how much of it had been put there by the past few days rutledge could only guess but mallory was tall and english fair and still handsome and it was easy to see that he might be very attractive to women hamish reminding rutledge added the men didna like him crossing hamishs words mallory was saying neither of us has prospered since france it would seem after a moment rutledge said no few of us did it was as if the empty words summed up four years of war for both men neither willing to admit to the personal shadows that dwelled under the surface of the mind neither wanting to bring any of it back and yet the very act of standing here opened the nightmare in ways neither had foreseen for rutledge it was the sound of a firing squad slamming a round home with nervous ragged precision and the memory of men lifting wooden stocks to their shoulders sighting down the steel barrels at one of their own all for nothingall for nothing for mallory it was the voice of dr beatie shouting at him urging him to do what had to be done to end his suffering driving him to kill the awkward silence lengthened and mallory was the first to turn away abruptly gesturing toward the drawing room in there where we wont be overheard his voice cracked on the words and he cast a backward glance toward the stairs as if expecting to see someone standing at the top of the flight rutledge reminded himself of the task hed been sent to accomplish where is mrs hamilton he asked not leaving the hall and her maid i shant bargain with you until im certain theyre safe mallory grimaced damn it theyre well enough felicitymrs hamiltonis still asleep the maidher name is nan weekesis threatening me with gods curse if i touch her she might well be the best cleaning woman in dorset but shes safe enough from rape even in the dark a few more days of the rough side of her tongue and shell stand in greater danger of murder hed meant it facetiously but it hung in the air like a threat and he cursed himself for a fool mrs hamilton has made no effort to escape rutledge asked listening to the undercurrents in the quiet voice for signs of instability building forces that could end in murdersuicide and leave nan to my tender mercies shes not that sort are you coming into the drawing room or not rutledge followed him into the pretty room facing the gardens and the road its walls covered in a shellcolored silk the drapes and chairs a pale green striped with a soft shade of lavender but the rooms feminine air didnt detract from its ornaments which appeared to reflect hamiltons years abroad in the foreign ser vice olive and other mediterranean woods framed penandink sketches of places hamilton must have visited on his travels and on a table by the window there were tiny figures that looked to be greek or roman many of them wearing masks and each of them elegantly made reminding rutledge of stage sets african carvings in ebony hellenic gods in marble and other exotic statuettes in clay and stone and wood were set out on the top of a cabinet containing two shelves of small ornate boxes in every imaginable material together these objects gave the room its masculine character one figure taking pride of place was a fat woman with pendulous breasts and enormous thighsbut no head mallory sat down heavily as if he were on the verge of falling asleep where he stood if he was armed rutledge could see no sign of it but then it would be wise not to have a weapon where it could be taken away in a surprise move to disarm him i heard about corporal macleods death mallory said into the silence long afterward i wish it had been me killed in that attack but i wasnt there was i i was behind the lines in that bloody hospital tent trying to remember where i was and why i was strapped to my stretcher you never told me how youd survived you werent there to tell rutledge caught unprepared nearly spoke the thought aloud but managed to say without inflection of any kind im not sure i did mallory nodded i hated you you know you kept going no matter what happened like a dead man who hadnt got the word i hated that discipline i hated your courage i felt diminished by it rutledge found he couldnt answer if you only knew after a moment when he could trust his voice he said it wasnt courage it was necessity yes well mallory looked at him for a moment and then said again i hated you the only way i could get a grip on my own sanity was to face that i didnt come here to talk about the war mallory ignored him i didnt leave france by my own choice you must know that my uncle the bishop had influence in high places he pulled me out when my father died compassionate leave then he saw to it that i stayed in england he was my mothers brother he must have believed he was doing the right thing she could have got on very well without me but there you are i didnt handle it very well i wasnt very good at teaching bumbling tenant farmers and green shop clerks how to kill i kept dreaming about them torn and dying and you standing over them blaming me for failing them and you i wanted one of them to kill you in the end i had to do that for myself i dont want to hear your confession i have no right to hear it you heard our confessions often enough in the trenches mallory retorted his voice tight but i didnt desert i didnt desert hamish growled deep in rutledges mind a wordless rejection of mallorys denial rutledge stood there with nothing to say and in some far corner of his being he could hear the guns again a perfect morning for gas and he had to stop himself from putting up a hand to test the direction of the wind he couldnt think of a way to deflect mallorys need to exonerate himself and tried to shut it out withdrawing from the insistent voice almost as he found himself withdrawing from the man i just wanted to make it clear that im expecting no favors mallory finished spare me your pity or whatever it is you feel toward me understand this the only reason i sent for you is that stubborn bastard bennett he wants my blood and hed have had it if i hadnt fended for myself you ran him down rutledge pointed out grateful for the shift in subject he sat down on the other side of the room his foot is probably broken mallory sat up did he tell you that he laughed harshly without humor yes well he would wouldnt he the truth is he was clinging to the motorcar wouldnt let go when he fell off the door it was bad luck that his foot was in the wrong place it wasnt intentional and dont you let him tell you it was nevertheless no listen to me i dont know why he came to arrest me without any physical evidence and no eyewitness to put me at the scene but he did someone must have told him i was once engaged to mrs hamilton and would have been glad to see her husband out of the way it looks now to be the truth no i tell you i had nothing to do with the assault on hamilton the first i knew of it was bennett standing in my doorway going on about a body found on the strand and asking me to come with him his voice was earnest as he leaned forward in his chair i didnt even understand that it was matthew he was talking about until he began insisting that i go with him and then all i could think of was felicitymrs hamilton i had to see her to tell her i hadnt harmed matthew if bennett believed it hed try to convince her as well you werent there you werent in my shoeshed already made up his mind he had no intention of looking anywhere else once i was in custody id be facing trial he was protesting too strongly rutledge thought and yet he sat there with no weapon visible speaking to scotland yard as if he had nothing to fear truth or a wellplanned fiction you must look at it from bennetts viewpoint you were the one person most likely to benefit if hamilton died of his injuries and therefore a strong suspect benefit oh yes i could woo the grieving widow couldnt i but she loves matthew and i dont think im likely to step into his place even if he dies i just didnt want her to hate me or believe i could hurt her in any way then why did you threaten the two women surely by the time bennett was knocking at the door here youd had a chance to explain yourself why go the next step mallory started to answer thought better of it and then finally said frowning im not really sure myself how it happened it justdid let them go that will be in your favor ill see them safely away from here and then well take you down to the station to tell your side of the story mallory laughed without humor im not a fool rutledge as soon as i set them free ive nothing to use as a means of bargaining with you i want you to find out who did attack hamilton and bring him here to tell mrs hamilton why im owed that and when youve done it ill give myself up mrs hamilton ought to be with her husband if you hold her here against her will and her husband dies shell never forgive you dont you see that for her sake you have to take the chance that youll stand trial let her go and i give you my word ill do everything i can for you mallory got to his feet and began to pace i cant let her leave bennett would never allow her to come back here again and if matthew dies whos to speak for me then let the maid go i cant dont you see if im shut in this house for days with mrs hamilton without a proper chaperone her reputation is ruined i hardly think the maid locked away as she is can speak on behalf of your honor or mrs hamiltons yes well nans staying you dont know the women in this town what if i offer myself in mrs hamiltons place she can go to the surgery look in on her husband comfort him and then come back again rutledge could see how torn the man before him was a range of emotions flitted across his face before he said i cant be sure bennett will agree to that hell leave you here to rot because youve invaded his patch and you wont be free to argue when he doesnt make any effort to get at the truth no we keep things as they are youll do what you can to learn who wanted matthew dead and ill give you my solemn word that both women are safe with me in gods name why should i harm either of them why did i drive all the way from london if youre unwilling to make any compromise now that im here or show good faith thats foolishness mallorys pacing stopped the trenches were foolishness a stalemate within a stalemate im just taking a leaf from the wars book right now its the only weapon i have and then rutledge asked the question that had been in the back of his mind all the way from london why did you turn to me why didnt you ask the bishop your uncle to help you it was flung at mallory almost viciously welling up out of rutledges own anguish hes dead after a moment mallory went on the words wrenched from him i had promised myself id never have to see you again do you think i wanted this any of it if there had been any other way rutledge stood up as well and took a deep breath attempting to break off the unforgiving savaging of each other throughout the exchange hamish had been ominously silent a dark presence like thunder in the distance like guns in the distancerutledge made an effort let me speak to mrs hamilton before i go shes in her room matthews room there was a bitter twist to his voice at the words at the head of the stairs turn right toward the sea its the last door but one rutledge climbed the stairs at a steady pace neither hurrying nor taking his time when he reached the passage at the top he turned right found the next but one door and tapped lightly there was no answer he opened the door gently and looked inside the bedclothes were a tangle spilling half off the bed in the midst of them was a tousled fair head buried in a sea of dark rose coverlet that matched flowers in the draperies and the fabric of one chair by the hearth her face was to the wall and out of his line of sight hed have to go round the bed to see it mrs hamilton he called quietly but she was deeply asleep or pretending to be he couldnt be certain he wasnt close enough to the bed to see how she breathed hamish said if she sleeps sae soundly theres naething on her conscience but women sleep deeply after love what role had felicity hamilton played in the events of the last twentyfour hours after a moment he closed the door and went back the way hed come mallory was waiting for him and without a word led him to the kitchen precincts the maid nan was wide awake and choleric a thin woman with weatherreddened skin and pale hair that showed streaks of graying she sat rigidly in her chair in a small pantry off the servants hall her eyes alive with fury whos that then she snapped at mallory as he brought rutledge in he ignored her but rutledge answered her identifying himself simply as a police inspector you havent kept her locked up like this all this time have you rutledge asked turning back to mallory there was no food or water in the room no sign even of a chamber pot good god no but she was banging on the door of the servants hall at six this morning and i couldnt have that i think she broke that other chair against it he gestured to the chair flung against the wall the splat shattered and who wouldnt be making a racket kept here by the likes of you she demanded ive a cousin at home a policeman hell be wanting your blood if you lay a hand on me i havent touched you mallory retorted except to shut you up down here so that we could have a little peace nan was on the point of answering him when rutledge asked quickly has he harmed you in any way hed not dare to but who can say what hes done to mrs hamilton there was something avid in her face that told him she wished for it as if there was little love between herself and her mistress and whatever felicity hamilton suffered she had earned so much for nan as chaperone mallory was right shed blacken his character with a vengeance and mrs hamiltons as well relishing the chance rutledge wondered how she felt about mr hamilton whether her loyalties lay thereor with neither of her employers she hadnt asked about matthew hamilton how he fared whether he was alive or dead did she even know why she and her mistress were being held against their wills shes no concerned for them only for hersel hamish replied but her tongue will clack once away fra here you cant leave them like this you have to feed them you know rutledge said to mallory its going to be a bigger problem than you think keeping them here ill manage mallory replied stiffly i can prepare food tea it wont be fancy but it will be edible ive even mucked out the stables this morning for the damned horse all right youve seen both of them they turned toward the door rutledge promising nan weekes help before very long and getting the sharp side of her tongue for letting that man get round him so poor excuse for a policeman you are it was as if shed expected him to overpower mallory in front of her and set her free and held it against him for failing to try hamish remarked theres the thorn in this dilemma it was true mrs hamilton might sleep soundly under the circumstances her door not locked but nan was another matter rutledge found himself more worried for her than for her mistress mallorys stability would be fragile after days of strain and nans belligerence outside as they walked to the back stairs rutledge said look tell me what it is you want me to do this has to end you know it as well as i do tell me what it will take to set the women free it was an appeal to mallorys better nature but even as he spoke the words he knew they were empty thats simple mallory answered find out who nearly killed matthew hamilton rutledge went to dr granvilles surgery next greeting the doctors wife and asking for a few minutes of the doctors time the waiting room behind him was crowded and he could feel every eye on him as he introduced himself to mrs granville mrs granville said doubtfully hes got his hands full just now what with mr hamilton and his usual hours i dont know if theres been an epidemic of sore throats and unsettled stomachs or if people are hoping for news of poor matthew perhaps you could take me to see mr hamilton then and i shant have to disturb the doctor well im not certain mr bennett would agree he smiled im handling the matter for inspector bennett until hes fit to do more on his own yes poor man in that case then she let him into a passage that ended in a door that was half glass with fenced lawns and bare trees beyond he followed her past a series of closed doors to the last but one hes in quite a bit of pain isnt he the inspector but he wouldnt hear of anything to help you know now he could see through the glass into the tidy garden just beyond and a table under a tree with chairs around it he had a picture of tea set out there on a summers day and children running through the grass laughing the england he and mallory and so many others had fought for bleak now in winter cold and quiet as if war had drained away the color and reality not the seasons hamiltons tiny room was windowless he lay there on the cot bed the lamp beside him lit but shielded to keep the light out of his eyes but matthew hamiltons bruised eyes were closed and his breathing was labored as if it hurt to draw too much air in at a time rutledge looking down at him took his measure a tall man broad shouldered with dark hair silvering at the temples long sunbronzed fingers lying idle on the coverlet slender body he could have put up a good fight if hed been attacked faceon a match for mallory or anyone else physically hamish said it was a vicious beating and that appeared to be true his ribs were wrapped tightly the broken arm set and lumps under the coverlet indicated bandaging on his legs as well to kill or simply vengeful without much caring about the outcome im told he was found near the tideline rutledge commented quietly oh his clothing was soaked with seawater mrs granville replied its a wonder cold as he was he didnt die of exposure but anthonythe doctor that isfeels that the cold may have prevented massive internal bleeding one good thing then no sign of returning to consciousness hes moaned a time or two the doctor is reluctant to administer anything to help with the pain at least for the next few hours because of possible brain injury but hes not conscious enough to speak as far as you know when he begins to moan he reached out and touched one of the hands on top of the coverlet and raised his voice a little mr hamilton can you hear me ive brought a message from your wife matthew do you understand what im telling you grasp my hand if you do there was no response how is mrs hamilton mrs granville asked him leaning forward a little as if eager for news he turned to look at her seeing her now as one of the village women rather than just the doctors assistant she hasnt been back to see him she continued ive heard that shes undererconstraint at the house a thin face thinner lips gray eyes alive with curiosity mrs hamilton is safe where she is he answered carefully i dont think you need to fear for her or the maid id hoped to bring her with me perhaps the next time could i see mr hamiltons clothing surprised mrs granville said well yes of course if you like its all in the cupboard there i dried the woolen things as best i could he was already opening the low cupboard at the foot of the bed the coat and trousers hamilton had been wearing were still dampish and had that odd feeling that salt water gives to fabric heavy and slightly stiff no hat as if the man had enjoyed the wind in his hair or had lost it in the struggle boots hamish said and rutledge saw the wellingtons under the neatly folded pile of undergarments he was planning from the start to walk by the sea rutledge responded silently he wasnt lured there mrs granville was saying the contents of his pockets are in that small box i was going to offer it to mrs hamilton yesterday but she left so suddenly rutledge took out the box and opened it wallet in some unusual leather now stiff and water stained several pounds in bills a handkerchief a handful of coins keys on a ring a pipe and tobacco in a pouch and a watch the fob on the gold chain an enameled shield with the cross of malta in red and white the watch must have been cleaned and wound for it was ticking softly nothing unusual or unexpected save for the keys he returned the items to the box and set it back where hed found it then as an afterthought he put them back as well as long as hamilton was alive they should be left for him just as he was closing the cupboard the man on the bed groaned in pain then stirred uncomfortably before subsiding into silence once more if he speaks at all no matter how trivial his words may seem to you write them down and summon me at once leave word at the station or at the duke of monmouth yes of course inspector she followed him to the door ill tell the doctor you came and if he has any need to speak with you hell reach you he walked down the passage and was almost at the outside door when a woman came out of the surgery waiting room nearly colliding with him miss trining mrs granville said in the tone of voice reserved for someone of substance i shant wait any longer miss trining said i feel better now anyway are you sure you oughtnt stay until the doctor sees you indigestion is sometimes i know my own body best miss trining said shortly then looked rutledge up and down who are you he gave her his best smile inspector rutledge from scotland yard he said and you are charlotte trining im a member of the vestry along with matthew have you been to see him dr granville wont let me near him and rightly so rest is the best cure sometimes he said ive my motorcar outside may i drive you somewhere over miss trinings head mrs granville shot him a grateful look yes thank you she nodded to the doctors wife and let rutledge hold the door for her he said goodbye to mrs granville and followed miss trining to the car opening the passenger door for her he had met many women like her over the years imperious and selfimportant accustomed to having their way and as often as not a force in any community out of sheer natural gall and ferocious driving energy the sort of women who had connections and were never shy about alluding to them her dark blue eyes were scanning him as he turned the crank and then climbed in beside her hamish said ware and was silent again miss trining said i shouldnt have thought bennetts foot injury was sufficiently serious to summon scotland yard to his aid i expect he felt he couldnt remain objective rutledge answered and rightly so i never liked that man mallory she went on im not surprised he attacked matthew what does surprise me is that he didnt finish the job while he was at it lack of moral fiber i expect im told by a cousin in sussex that he suffered shell shock during the war i dont hold with cowards watch where youre driving young man you nearly hit that cart he had her words had struck him like a physical blow and he had swerved without realizing where he was saying nothing he fought to regain his composure and she looked at him sharply turning her head to stare at him dont tell me you feel differently on the subject i was at the front miss trining he answered after a moment i saw firsthand what men had to endure i cant stand in judgment of them now i should have thought you would know better than most how they let their friends and comrades down it was harshly said and harshly meant he remembered a line from o a manning the war poet who was in reality olivia marlow without looking at miss trining he quoted courage is not measured by marching bands and banners in the wind if you have not walked the bloody lines and seen the faces you have no right to describe it so we die here to keep you safe at home and what we suffer pray you may never know yes yes i know the poem what does it say to anything that you werent there miss trining and have no right to judge she turned away in a huff you can let me down here if you will she said pointing to a milliners shop to his left but when he drew up to the shop he said you appear to know the hamiltons well tell me about matthew theres not much to tell hes been a valued civil servant he came back to england married a much younger woman and seems to have settled into his new life without looking back did you know him before he came to hampton regis something in her face belied her response no i must say that hes been an asset to us here recognizing his responsibility to set a good example for all of us i admire that and mrs hamilton she could do far more than she has to be frank i dont think she realizes how she lets her husband down at every turn refusing to serve on committees refusing to take up charitable work refusing to entertain in the style that im sure matthew was accustomed to abroad after all a senior foreign ser vice officer does have a certain social position but thats what comes of marrying someone so much younger you know no sense of whats due a man of matthews stature does matthew hamilton have enemies she stared at him again enemies her emphasis on the word was noticeable i shouldnt think anyone in hampton regis has any connection with his past why should they most of them have never been abroad unless they were in the war much less to malta and sicily and crete i was thinking more specifically than that here in hampton regis you are entirely too young and inexperienced to handle this inquiry she said flatly i shall have a word with the chief constable about that when he comes to tea and without waiting for him to come around and open her door for her she did it herself and stepped out good day inspector when felicity wandered down for breakfast there were dark shadows under her eyes and she seemed distracted rutledge was here again mallory said you were asleep just pretending i heard him knock at my door and panicked i dont think he believed the hostage story but nan gave him an earful yes im sure she did i wish we could let her leave just to be rid of her i dont feel comfortable when shes in the house i never have she adores matthew she hesitated did he sayis matthew all right she was asking if he still lived mallory could feel his heart turn over what would she do if matthew died turn on him slip out of the house in the middle of the night when he finally sank into deep sleep unable to keep his eyes open any longer and then he felt guilty for even considering such a cruel betrayal still unconscious he didnt tell her that rutledge had offered to let her visit her husband he wasnt sure how shed respond to that felicity shook her head and pulled her shawl closer as if she felt cold you dont suppose we could build a fire in the study or the sitting room it would be so much cozier felicity she looked up at him then looked away what are we going to do i thought this inspector was here to sort it all out for us thats why you wanted him to come isnt it the question is will he be strong enough to stand up to bennett he hesitated he wanted to know if wed had an affair hardly an affair i was in love with you long before i met matthew i was going to marry you only you didnt want to marry me not then there was a hurt expression on her face as if she remembered the past more clearly or at the very least differently dear girl i told you i didnt want to come home to you a lame beggar but you didnt did you there was accusation in her voice as if he had tricked her somehow you came home whole i couldnt know that it was you who refused to wait who didnt have faith in the future how could i when youd painted it so bleakly she stood in the doorway to the dining room i dont suppose you could make a pot of tea matthew always brought me my morning tea he hesitated and then said yes of course breakfast as if it had just struck him what time it was weve got to feed nan as well felicity frowned wed be so much better off without her i wish she was gone no we shouldnt be shes your chaperone little good she is at chaperoning locked up belowstairs he smiled appearances my dear appearances he said in a voice that was so like miss trinings that she laughed nan must have heard it as well for she began to bang ominously on the door of her prison i wish she was dead felicity said in anger and then covered her mouth with her hand i didnt mean that truly i didnt she waited to be forgiven like a child no of course you didnt but he turned away his appetite gone and went on to prepare a meal he couldnt swallow bennett was in a foul mood his foot had kept him awake most of the night and this morning rutledge had proceeded to act without him it was unprofessional and in his present state of mind unforgivable he sat in his office hunched over his desk like a poisonous toad waiting for rutledge to appear then he said with understated anger i hear youve been busy i couldnt sleep rutledge said blandly his face giving nothing away and so i went to the house the women are safe but their situation isnt the best id like to bring this business to a conclusion today and so would i bennett thought if only to be rid of the likes of you his feelings were so clear in his expression that hamish said watch your back he doesna care how it ends yes at least mallory is right there rutledge answered silently and to bennett perhaps it would help if we could go over the evidence against mallory again ive told you twice before there was reason to believe he might have had a hand in the assault and i went to confront him he ran me down and fled what more do you want in the way of evidence i believe you of course but what id prefer are witnesses some sort of direct proof at the scene that he might have been there i daresay mallory can afford a decent barrister we had better be prepared for that the only tracks were ours the ones we made coming down to have a look at hamilton we didnt know then hed been beaten did we first thought was hed walked too far and his heart had given out dr granville was with us id sent for him straightaway and he was anxious hamiltons had malaria dysentery and god knows what other diseases out where hes been bennett retorted easing his leg in front of him bones are the very devil youd think theyd have no feeling in them at any rate i cast about for footprints a weapon some sign of a struggleand i came up emptyhanded here was a badly injured man he had no enemies that we knew of and the only person with any reason to see him out of the picture is the man now hiding behind the skirts of two frightened women that should tell you something if hes innocent why didnt mallory stand and take questioning like a man because hamish was pointing out mallory didna trust the police to be fair rutledge tried to quell the voice in his head who were matthew hamiltons friends he served on the vestry what does the rector have to say to this business i havent asked him when have i had the time then perhaps we should see him now ill drive you rutledge went on as bennett was on the point of protesting he stood by the door waiting and bennett had no choice but to get to his feet and clumsily adjust his crutch under his arm rutledge had passed the church coming into hampton regis last night and heard the clock strike the hour it stood not far from the turning to casa miranda a tall rather austere stone edifice well set out in its churchyard to the west of it behind a massive victorian shrubbery this morning he glimpsed the sunlit windows of what must be the rectory the rector wasnt a man to take sides slim and frail he looked to be older than he was a man so trodden down by life that only his faith sustained him when they found him in the church staring at the baptismal font as if expecting it to break into speech at any moment he seemed surprised to see them bennett made the introductions and said without further ado mr rutledge would like your opinion of matthew hamilton matthew augustus putnam faltered is he dead then ive been remiss i havent been to see him hes still very much alive rutledge responded shall we sit down over there he gestured to the chairs at the back of the nave inspector bennett would appreciate it yes yesby all means putnam led the way to the chairs and waited as if the host until both men were seated then he sat down heavily as if worn out by the interview to come matthew hamilton rutledge reminded him ah well you probably know his history foreign office and all that hes been so helpful with church affairs ive been grateful sometimes the vestry board can be he hesitated looking for the right word then smiled obstreperous he ended too many demands and not enough money rutledge asked yes exactly putnam agreed gratefully we have to make dothe war you know it changed so much the rector lost his only son at passchendaele bennett told rutledge with some bluntness as if that explained the rectors situation im sorry rutledges voice carried more than the usual polite murmuring of sympathy putnam nodded in acknowledgment thank you its still amazingly raw the loss his thoughts seemed to wander away as if searching for some explanation for why his son had been taken after a moment he came back to the present ive the greatest respect and admiration for matthew hamilton he said theres been much comment about his interest in foreign gods but i can tell you hes a fine example of what a good parishioner ought to be kind considerate intelligent compassionate foreign gods rutledge asked he was something of an amateur archaeologist in his spare time part of the collection he brought home with him haserstirred up some confusion in the minds of a few people especially the goddess for an instant rutledge found himself wondering if the reference was to mrs hamilton and then he remembered the headless figure in the drawing room have you seen this collection he asked with interest putnam smiled yes i was particularly asked to view it george reston was most insistent about that he was shocked you see i expect matthew had enjoyed a little amusement at his expense we arent very worldly here he cast a swift glance toward the silent bennett then added to rutledge have you been to malta inspector or to some of the other early sites in the mediterranean ive read a little about them and i must confess they tend to be extraordinary in their perspectives rutledge held back a grin in so many words putnam had told him more than bennett had understood putnam he realized wasnt quite as childlike as he appeared it was a facade developed over time to shield himself from the wrath of the restons and the trinings among his flock and mrs hamilton do you know her well at all a lovely young woman he said weve been saddened by the fact that she doesnt come to ser vices as often as wed like but she seems sincere in her faith hamish said the auld biddies must ha driven her away yes im sure rutledge answered aloud then winced bennett put in were here to inquire if you can think of anyone who might wish mr hamilton ill putnam considered that for a moment then shook his head i would say hes universally liked which left the impression that no one felt that way about his wife and mr mallory rutledge asked ah mr mallory weve had long talks you know on the nature of faith he lost his in france not too surprising im told but not lost forever one hopes translated it seemed to say that putnam had enjoyed very little success with mallory but there was an undercurrent of compassion that spoke of understanding and sadness sometimes rutledge thought reading between the lines was a skill a policeman ought to develop early on but bennett sitting there with righteous stolidity was not listening to the nuances he was a blunt man with little imagination and his foot must have been hurting him after the exertion of getting in and out of the motorcar there was a grim downturn to his mouth as though he was consciously suppressing the pain and then putnam commented as if reminded by something only he could see i should like to know what you think of our bosses will you take a moment to look at them bennett opened his mouth to say that they had other calls to make but rutledge was before him intrigued by the rectors shift in subject by all means he told putnam with enthusiasm infusing his voice ive a fondness for architecture he turned to bennett and said it shouldnt take more than five minutes bennett said stiffly ill just wait in the motorcar then he adjusted his crutch and walked off clearly put out by the distraction putnam led rutledge down the nave where they could look up into the darkness of the high vaulted ceiling pointing to the ribs of the vaulting where what appeared to be flat stone buttons pinned them into place he said if your eyes are younger and better than mine you can just pick out the devices on each boss the rectors words echoed above their heads as clear to bennett as they were to him and rutledge could as the west door closed behind bennett he stared upward into the shadows the bosses were from henry viis day he thought with the white rose of lancaster and the red rose of york melded into the tudor rose healing all wounds of the long bloody wrangling among the descendants of edward i or such was the hope henry tudor had certainly done his best to rid himself of any opposition the device of the portcullis was there too and while they were both of interest they werent unique to this church but rutledge waited patiently for putnam to explain the significance of them after a moment he said quietly one morning matthew hamilton was standing where you are now as we were discussing a vestry matter the subject turned to mistakes weve all made in our lives and he said to me theres a miss cole who could tell you much about a mistake that altered my life ive carried more than a little guilt about that over the years and ive wondered how to make amends only ive put it off too long now the rector shrugged diffidently i recall almost his exact words because whatever he had done still greatly distressed him i asked if hed care to tell me more and he said it was his own cross to bear this may have nothing to do with the attack on him but you did ask if there might be someone who wished him ill i would be grateful if you kept this to yourself it could cause needless pain if im wrong did he ever mention this woman again it was not a subject i cared to bring up myself i appreciate your advice rutledge answered slowly and your wisdom he added after a moment putnam smiled one learns diplomacy in many arenas inspector im sure the police and the foreign ser vice have nothing on the church when it comes to treading with care he escorted rutledge up the aisle to the west door and added as it swung inward bringing in the cold air some things are best left unsaid and then there is no necessity for explanation or retraction they shook hands and rutledge left hamish said yons a canny man bennett fuming in the motorcar demanded whats so unique about the bosses then putnam takes pride in them rutledge answered simply and sometimes its wise to give a lonely man a few minutes of ones time it may encourage him to remember something we ought to know grunting bennett let rutledge crank the motor on his own as the other man stepped behind the wheel bennett said in my view finding our man is more important than pacifying the rector you live here you know best rutledge said without emphasis standing around on those cold pavestones has made my foot ache like all the imps of hell taking hot tongs to it ill have to rest it it was obvious that the man was of two minds torn between putting up his foot and staying the course ill drive you home after that ill call in again at the surgery with any luck there should be news if hes going to live you mean hamilton ive got a bad feeling about that you could tell mrs hamilton that her husband is dying in the hope mallory will let her visit him and if he wont shell be distressed to no purpose her feelings arent our concern winking mallory out of there is in good time rutledge promised driving through the town and turning down the road to bennetts house and nan weekes is still there remember if hamilton lives mallory wont hang bennett commented ignoring his reply its a pity he clambered down with an effort and hobbled up the walk to his door hamish said he wants his revenge and im here to see he doesnt have it but there was no news although matthew hamilton seemed to be breathing less stressfully as if hes coming up from the depths granville said although it might be the body and not the mind thats healing he examined rutledge with some curiosity and rutledge found himself flushing under the scrutiny what did the doctor read in his face shell shock nightmares i dont quite see scotland yards interest in this business granville commented his blue eyes were concerned was it mrs hamilton who sent for you are you a friend ive never met her before this im worried about her to be truthful he ran a hand through his hair if mallory will allow it ill be happy to come to the house and make certain shes holding up well under the circumstances something to help her sleep might be in order shes a strong woman but even the strong can break under the weight of anxiety and fear ill see what i can do meanwhile ill be here again rutledge said as often as i can until theres news is there any hope that mallory will allow mrs hamilton to come here to speak to her husband he might respond to her voice if not to ours its worth trying his words seemed to fall flat in the small room that might well depend rutledge answered him on whether mallory believes hamilton will clear him or condemn him once hes awake he looked the doctor over in his turn seeing the competent hands the strong face the dark hair prematurely graying at the temples it gave the man a distinguished air one that patients must find comforting he thought when they were very ill he was wasted here in hampton regis granville said if you want my professional opinion youll be wise to convince that young hothead to come to his senses this is as vicious a beating as ive dealt with in many years my guess is mallorys unstable and god knows what he intends to do with mrs hamilton if she rejects him he may turn to murder and suicide as his only way out what are hamiltons chances i need to be told worst case he could very well be helpless and in a wheelchair for the rest of his life thats my greatest fear hamish said irascibly he isna dead ye shouldna speak oer him as if he were and yet it seemed that matthew hamilton had no reality his bruises like caesars wounds speaking for him what would he have to say when he opened his eyes would he know where he wasor even who he was or would he lunge upright and swear at the memory of his attack what had miss trining had to say about mallory that he was a cowardand as far as anyone knew this attack had been cowardly too from behind it was easy to see why guilt had been assigned so quickly mallory was the perfect scapegoat with a last look at the injured man rutledge left and this time openly drove to the hamilton house mallory answered his summons reluctantly what now id like to speak to mrs hamilton if you dont mind mallory frowned is hehave you come to say hes dead no but the doctor feels it would be a good thing to have his wife speak to hamilton encourage him as it were something to cling to in the darkness for gods sake dont tell her that shell be frantic as she should be rutledge replied shes his wife man after all mallory shook his head i cant let you talk to her i cantit isnt something that will work get me out of this if you can its the best solution for all of us matthew hamilton included i didnt harm him he shut the door firmly but inside rutledge could hear voices raised as if in anger hamish said its no sae simple no it never is i have a feeling it will get worse before it gets any better but how best to find this miss cole whom the rector had mentioned without asking questions and giving half the town something more to discuss behind their hands he went back to the hotel and stopped at the desk to ask if there had been any messages for him the clerk assured him there had not been and rutledge started toward the stairs heading for his room then he turned back to the desk friends in london he said asked me to look up someone here a miss cole do you know where i can find her but the clerk shook his head are you sure of the name the only cole here was a friend of my fathers and long since in the churchyard its not important rutledge replied and went on his way hamish in his mind reminded him that he should have asked the rector where to find the woman if hed known it i rather think hed have given me her direction rutledge said walking into his room and coming to stand by the window looking out on the street im not sure why he was quite so guarded that interests me he may believe that hamilton spoke of her in confidence below him in the street he glimpsed a knot of women talking their hats close together as they stood there in deep discussion he rather thought the subject was matthew hamilton and his wife a prisoner of hamiltons alleged attacker he wondered how any of themmallory hamilton or his wifewould manage after the fact when they must live here in spite of gossip and suspicion of what might have transpired in that house while mrs hamilton was held against her will or was she he remembered the tousled head among the bedclothes how many women in mrs hamiltons situation could sleep so deeply and so free from anxiety she knows mallory hamish offered she mayna believe hes guilty and that was a good point but why isnt she by her husbands side even if she had to fight her way out of that house mallory cant stay awake forever he can lock doors but he cant prevent her from trying to climb out her window or even stop her from standing there screaming for all the world to hear it would go a long way that screaming toward making the neighbors aware that she was held against her will would it please her husband if she makes hersel a spectacle if i were married to her and couldnt get there to help her id have liked to know she wasnt taking the separation without some effort to defend her honor aye but then you havena a wife it was a blow that rutledge hadnt expected hed spoken without thinking considering the issue theoretically jean was in canada married to her diplomat what if he rutledge had gone there after her and held her against her will what would she have done then but she would know of course that hed do no such thing he hadnt been able to fight for her when she released him from their engagement hed been too ill in his mind to find the strength to defend his love for her or explain that he was haunted by what had happened in france by the dying and the turmoil and the horror of watching men he knew fall with appalling wounds he hadnt been able to tell her what it was like to know with certainty that carrying out his orders had killed so many of them never mind that the orders were only his to give not his to change hed failed his men in a way that no amount of argument or reason or excuse could alter hed held their lives in his hands and hed let them slip through his fingers it was as simpleand as complicatedas that how could he have explained hamish come to that how could he explain to any woman what war had done to him and to so many others how could he describe watching hamish fall how could he tell anyone how the man had lain there trying to speak to him begging for release and how could he ever condone drawing his revolver and delivering the coup de grace the blow of grace to put corporal hamish macleod out of his pain and torment jean would have despised him walked away in disgust long before hed finished telling her half of it and so he had let her go without a struggle knowing that he was abhorrent to her in his battered state knowing that he couldnt ask her to love him when hamish macleod owned him body and soul better to let her go let the last hope of his salvation walk out the door of his hospital room and never come back again better to let her think that he was a pathetic remnant of the man shed loved rather than believe he was what he truly wasa man who had killed other men including his own a common murderer come to that rutledge straightened up from the window and turned around to look at the room the draperies beside him the desk to the other side one chair and a chest with drawers a bed a room in a hotel a man without roots without a home without any ties of love he and mallory in an attempt to shrug off the mood that had swept him he tried to think what to do next where to turn in this investigation that had been thrust upon him for one thing what did he know about matthew hamilton the face behind the diplomatic mask where had the man served besides malta had his career been blameless a civil servant doing his duty through long years of exile and why had hamilton chosen exile that was something that would require an answer too to serve abroad took a willingness to sever ties and rely totally on ones self even on precious weeks of leave it must be difficult to reestablish intimacy with friends and family to fit in again when he knew so little about the ordinary lives of the people hed left behind when he hadnt been there to be a part of the small events the everyday trials and hopes and dreams of people who hadnt spoken with him for years what had he found to take back with him to his station to fill the empty weeks and months and even years of absence an outcast at homeand an outcast in the field for all intents and purposes rutledge went to find a telephone and once shut into the tiny room where it stood he put in a call to scotland yard it took all of ten minutes to bring sergeant gibson to the telephone the deep gruff voice sounded tense unwelcoming rutledge thought and this is how it must have been when hamilton called to say he was in london for a few weeks and would like to meet a friend aloud he said to gibson im calling in regard to one matthew hamilton foreign office stationed in his last years of ser vice in malta there must have been earlier postings if he was successful in his position why did he end his career in the foreign ser vice equivalent to coventry why not in a better posting but the answer to that was already in his mind the war half of europe was a battlefield there were no gracious capitals available to reward senior civil servants for long years of doing their duty and matthew hamilton hadnt distinguished himself at the peace conference in paris ill look into it sir gibson answered that wariness still apparent rutledge was on the point of asking how the search for the green park murderer was progressing and thought better of it wariness from gibson was a form of warning and he didnt take that lightly chief superintendent bowles was no doubt in a foul mood and everyone was walking clear of him whenever possible there was a pause lengthening and nothing more was said thats the lot rutledge added into the silence call me here when you have something and the connection was broken whatever was happening in london even gibson was apprehensive it didnt bode well for the inquiry hed left behind rutledge forced himself to return to the hamilton house knocking at the door and going on knocking until finally mallory answered he said irritation in his voice and in his face go away if you havent come to tell me im free to leave we have nothing to say to each other i thought rutledge retorted that youd sent for me to help how can i if im shut out i need information and with luck you can give it to me mallory surprised said what kind of information i cant tell you who it was struck hamilton down i wasnt there i didnt come into town yesterday morning if you want the truth id finished a bottle of whiskey the night before and was still asleep when bennett came pounding on my door i need to speak to mrs hamilton then there may be something she hasnt told either you or me something she may not consider important or has forgotten in the stress of events we may not have a great deal of time if hamilton dies bennett will have his way and bring you in for trial whatever the cost yes well that was his intention from the start ive only delayed him for a little while mallory replied moodily i dont like being in debt to you or anyone else i should have ended this while i still could rutledge could almost feel hamish behind his shoulder alert to something in mallorys quiet voice it isna the same he isna the same it was true reality setting in with morning light or had something happened between mallory and mrs hamilton this morning what if she no longer believed his protestations of innocence murder followed by suicidetime was running out faster than even rutledge had expected the door was suddenly pushed wider you wanted to speak to me inspector is it matthew is he all right the woman standing there was quite beautiful in a fragile and defenseless way the kind of woman in his experience who brought out protectiveness in men the need to shield and guard rutledge had found such women to be very capable of looking after themselves jean had been fragile too until her own needs had driven her to strength you ought to be with him mrs hamilton rutledge spoke directly to her he needs to feel your presence there beside him then you must do something to end this silly business she said fiercely even her voice was intriguing low and gentle it enhanced the helpless image she was like a child he thought but by no means childish he could see her mind working behind the pretty eyes focused on his face when he said nothing she looked from rutledge to mallory pulling her blue woolen sweater closer about her almost to the point of wrapping her arms about herself she added quickly the anger gone and worry in its place are you lying to me is he better and you arent telling me just to frighten me or is he truly worse and youre afraid to let me hear it she stood there waiting for him to commit himself to a lie or the truth theres little change rutledge told her finally he was suddenly afraid to pit her against mallory and add to the mans agitation which may not be a very good sign the doctor feels he ought to have come round by now and he hasnt something stirred in her eyes fear coiling and uncoiling and if i wanted to go to him what then who would take my place here and would you let me come back again she glanced quickly at mallory then away i must come back you see forfor nans sake i cant leave her in this predicament all alone i could stay here in your place rutledge offered for a second time i think mr mallory would accept that no the word was explosive angry i warned you not to bring it up damn you youre no use to either of us caught in bennetts trap with me mallory had stepped in front of felicity hamilton as if half expecting her to push through the door and run out to the motorcar or down the drive before he could stop her get out of here rutledge and dont come again until youve got news ive had enough of your meddling do you hear me help me by finding the man responsible for this or stay away from me but stephen mrs hamilton said turning to him pleading its not meddling i wouldnt be longid go and sit with matthew for just a little while and then come straight back here i promise you felicity they wouldnt let you come back dont you understand theyre using matthew to make trouble frightening you so that youll rush down to granvilles surgery and he broke off dont look at me like that he pleaded this is none of my doing you didnt see him lying there stephen you didnt see the blood and the bandages i did she whirled back to rutledge youll give me your word i can come back wont you its not his word that matters for gods sake bennett wont have given his and so hes free to do as he pleases i dont want to hang for something i didnt do even if matthew dies no dont say that she exclaimed i wont let you even think it rutledge could see the anguish in mallorys face and the intensity in mrs hamiltons each with a need the other couldnt meet a confrontation neither had anticipated at the start of this debacle hamish said its no a very good thing and rutledge cut his words short saying quickly to mrs hamilton hes right bennett wont be bound by my promises if you leave here theres no turning back he looked over her head to mallorys tight face we neednt stand here on the steps quarreling let me in no mallory said again youve already made matters worse why havent you done as i asked why havent you got to the bottom of this business i dont understand whats taking so long its not as if matthew had other enemies he stopped and then tried to change his own words someone hated matthew hamilton enough to give him that beating someone you havent found yet but not for lack of trying rutledge retorted his impatience getting the best of him and then he added rapidly before mallory could move to the door to shut it mrs hamilton you must tell me about your husbands work in the mediterranean who it was who envied him who it was who resented his skill in carrying out his duties or was angry about what happened in paris who it was who caught up with him on the strand and tried to kill him she stared at him but i dont know what matthew did i dont know that part of the world i met him after hed come back to london i asked him once if we could travel to malta and let me see the places he knew there and he wouldnt hear of it he said that part of his life was finished done with and neither of us should dwell on what had gone before then who would know who might have seen him at work who might have been to malta and understood what he was doing there mrs hamiltons face crumpled tears heavy in her voice dont you see i believed he was telling me that my engagement to stephen was closed that the bargain was neither of us would look back and so i never pressed him because i didnt want him to press me it never seemed to matter not really though sometimes he would grow quiet and stand there in the drawing room his hands on that ugly female figure and i knew his thoughts werent in the room with me and it hurt to be shut out because id have liked to ask him about her where hed found her and what he knew about the other figures he kept there but i was afraid it would open pandoras box for both of us and i couldnt bear it i dont know whats in his past it was a difficult admission to make that the marriage had had its secrets but had it been a true bargain rutledge wondered had her own guilty memories made her believe that matthew hamilton was deliberately concealing something from her his silences might have been no more than a deep and abiding fear of one day losing his wife by the same token felicity hamilton had no way of judging young as she was the breadth of hamiltons experiences in foreign ser vice what secrets he was privy to what mistakes he had made there was anguish in mallorys eyes as he watched her cry and his hands moved once to comfort her and then drew back surely there was someone at the wedding someone who came to call when you were in londona place for me to start rutledge pressed her but she shook her head and mallory said protectively shes told you she cant help and then he shut the door as if raising a shield between felicity hamilton and the world outside it was a tender gesture in a way an odd sort of moment between captor and captive as he stood there staring at the brass knocker and the solid wood panels of the door closed in his face rutledge found himself thinking that this was more a wretched triangle than what it had seemed in the beginningmallorys desperate effort to stay out of prison over hamishs objections rutledge drove back to dr granvilles surgery let himself in quietly through the back garden and sat down by the bedside of the wounded man you mustna do this the voice in his head warned him and he shut it out after a time rutledge began to speak to the unconscious hamilton at first about that island in the mediterranean that had been such a large part of hamiltons life and then of his marriage and finally running short of material to fill the gaps in his knowledge of husband or wife about the war rutledge found himself back in the trenches as he spoke his body tense and his mind distracted not by fear of dying but by the unbearable fear that he wouldnt die hamish rumbled in the back of his mind emotions filling the narrow room and spilling over into silences that grew increasingly longer as rutledge tried to avoid the personal and keep to an objective view of the war except for what hed read or been told since he knew nothing about the peace that had been fought over and turned into punishment for germany each participating nation stretching out greedy hands for what they wanted out of the shambles of dead mens suffering hed been locked in his own private hell while wilson and lloyd george and clemenceau created the new world in their own images the defeated kaiser was gone shut in his tiny estate in holland and the tsar deposed and dragged around russia like a trophy until he was no longer of any value to anyone was dead wilson had been fixated on his league of nations and he was willing to trade like a tinker for anything of value in return for support ill and heartbroken hed been defeated in turn carrying the league home like a dying comrade and the concept of selfdetermination had brought arabs and slavs and africans and indians to the table to plead for their tiny patches what did hamilton know about any of this why had he gone to paris uninvited and then been sent away as sharply as if he had overstepped his bounds if the foreign office hadnt named him to the official delegation he had no business there and certainly no right to speak his mind as he had done or did the war have nothing to do with hampton regis and what had happened on the strand below the mole rutledge brought himself sharply back to the present and for want of any other topic began to talk about the case hed left behind in london hamish receding into the shadows only a little was crowding him now seeming to block the door and shut out the very air with his ominous presence why were there no windows in this wretched room why was there no sunlight to brighten it or a wind from the sea to refresh it it smelled of antiseptic and death and pain hardly an encouragement to live increasingly claustrophobic and uneasy wishing himself anywhere but here rutledge at first didnt hear the grunt as hamilton moved a little on his narrow bed it was followed by what sounded like a word garbled and twisted by the bruised lips rutledge turned to stare at the bandageswathed patient beside him and this time hamilton said quite clearly water rutledge reached for the carafe standing on the small table next to the bed and in his haste almost knocked the glass onto the floor he half filled it and knelt by the cot holding up hamiltons head so that he could try to sip the water it was difficult at first clumsily done but then hamilton seemed to find the knack of drinking without hurting his mouth or spilling the contents of the glass down his chest he was thirsty but after a time exhausted by sheer effort he closed his eyes and lay back again on rutledges arm rutledge lowered him gently back to the pillows and set the glass aside hamilton seemed to be breathing quietly and for a time rutledge thought he must have lapsed into unconsciousness again but then he said hoarsely felicity and after that whos there rutledge answered im from london i came to investigate what happened to you do you remember can you remember he groaned again as he moved a little then touched his bandages lightly as if not sure what they were or why they covered him do i know this place youre in dr granvilles surgery in hampton regis someone found you hamilton interrupted saying fretfully you came all this way from london but ive resigned you know its finished ive only to close up the house in valletta and then as if there was a crack in the confusion he added roughly felicity forgive me rutledge waited trying to decide what to say to him about her circumstances and in the end saying nothing but the injured man had tired himself slipping easily into sleep or into unconsciousness rutledge couldnt tell he waited there for another five minutes but there was no further response after that he went in search of dr granville the doctor was not impressed by rutledges account of hamiltons brief period of apparent wakefulness rutledge could also feel the mans unspoken condemnation for interfering with the welfare of a patient but he believed hed done no harm and stood silently beside the doctor looking down at hamilton as granville examined him he made sense you say of a kind yes ive told you he was thirsty drank a little and twice spoke his wifes name he wanted to know who i was and then there was something more about closing up the house he touched his bandages but didnt ask how hed come by them he wasnt rambling at the same time he wasnt fully aware of his circumstances i wish youd called me straightaway so that i could have judged for myself there wasnt time dr granville was considering rutledge as if hed deliberately delayed in calling for help in the hope that hamilton might say something that would shed light on the beating he turned back to the bed as hamilton started moving his head from side to side on the pillow in silent distress hamish said softly hes reliving the blows granville gestured toward his patient look you can see for yourself hes at a level of consciousness now where hes beginning to feel the full force of his pain i shall have to sedate him and thats dangerous its never wise to push head injuries too soon leave well enough alone thats an order after a moment rutledge said still he should begin to recover now wouldnt you think having come this far granville was busy hes warmer than he ought to be a degree or two of fever in fact if im not mistaken did you upset him telling him why his wife wasnt sitting here with him most certainly not i said nothing about mrs hamilton and nothing about mallory nothing granville opened the door and gestured for rutledge to precede him from the room well leave him to rest if his fever continues to rise ill give him something for it later and ill see that theres some broth to hand in the event he wakes again someone should be here you cant hear him while youre busy with your other patients rutledge pressed following granville down the passage or for that matter from your house the doctor said ill have to find someone i can trust as soon as possible if i can walk in here without being seen anyone can lock that garden door for starters i cant my wife and i use it regularly granville ushered rutledge out and went to sit at his desk his fingers laced on the blotter in front of him and then after a moment he got up and went back to where hamilton lay silent and vulnerable rutledge returned to the inn for a late luncheon and sat there quietly by himself in a corner of the small dining room on the walls were photographs of sailing vessels usually in full rig sails billowing out and the sea breaking as the bow cleaved it one was a chinese junk another a felucca on the nile a third making its way up what appeared to be the amazon the rain forest bending out over the river spreading deep and ominous shadows across the water the technique was good and the photographer had had a nice eye for composition using it subtly and to great effect the woman who was serving him was a little flustered as if this wasnt her normal duty she smiled ruefully as his soup spilled onto the plate under the bowl and said sorry becky usually does this but shes not been well enough this week im a very poor substitute not at all he responded politely shes recovering i hope mumps she said with a sigh and at her age dr granville tells me that one can have them again if the first time was long enough ago and quite mild i look in my mirror every morning wondering if ill come down with them next the doctor is a good man he sat with her most of sunday night when her fever was so high and were not allowed to visit one of the maids looks after her shes here in the inn in the servants wing its the only home she has rutledge tried to remember when hed had mumps bowles would call for his head if he got them now measles had spread through the trenches that had been nothing compared with the sweep of the influenza epidemic when the woman brought his next course he asked is there anyone living in or near hampton regis by the name of cole a miss cole no sorry i dont believe there is perhaps it would help if you knew her married name but he didnt and she was off to the kitchen once more for once even hamish was quiet there were only a handful of people in the room two women who looked enough alike to be sisters two men having an earnest discussion at a table by the window three women nearer the door who cast occasional glances in his direction as if they knew who he was their lowvoiced conversation had about it the intensity of gossip but it was one of the men by the window who came across to his table as they were leaving the shorter one with graying hair and a scar across his face im george reston he said not holding out his hand i serve with matthew hamilton on the vestry committee is there any improvement in his condition restonwho held the goddess against hamilton or so the rector had told him hes in guarded condition rutledge responded such a pity but the cold expression in his eyes belied his words hamishs voice rumbled through rutledges mind hes of the opinion hamilton came by his just reward rutledge had to agree with that aloud he said yes assault usually is reston stared at him i beg your pardon he was struck from behind a cowardly way of settling a score as im sure youll agree reston said only we are praying for him and he turned on his heel to go but rutledge stopped him rising to stand looking down at him were asking everyone in hampton regis to tell us where he or she was early monday morning reston retorted tightly are you suggesting that im a suspect his jaw was flexing with his anger rutledge replied blandly were looking for witnesses anyone who might have seen anything anyone who might have heard something perhaps unwittingly able to give us a small piece of information to solve the puzzle of what transpired there on the strand im sure youll want to assist us with the inquiry reston seemed taken aback i was probably having breakfast with my wife when do you have breakfast when er seven oclock i should think and when do you leave the houseas a rule im in my office at the bank by eight the women at the other table had turned to stare absorbing every word to repeat later to friends reston cast them a dark glance over his shoulder i dont pass the mole on my way to the bank he went on collecting himself if thats what interests you did you know matthew hamilton before he went to his posting in the mediterranean something in restons face changed so swiftly that rutledge wasnt sure what it signified im afraid not my first contact with him was through correspondence when he was in search of a house along this stretch of the coast thank you mr reston i appreciate your cooperation rutledge retrieved his serviette and sat down again ending the conversation it was on the tip of restons tongue to say something more but he stopped himself and this time took his leave his companion for lunch had already gone out and reston seemed annoyed when the woman serving tables told him as much rutledge went back to his meal and made a point not to look at the three women who had been eavesdropping after a time they resumed their lowvoiced conversation hamish said will ye speak to them as well not now rutledge answered i dont think one of them could have overpowered hamilton someone took a chance striking him from behind the first blow might not have been enough to stop him but id wager whoever it was was prepared to finish what hed started if hamilton did turn the youngest lass has a cane it was an observation that rutledge had failed to make he quietly examined the woman more closely she was indeed younger than her companions perhaps in her early thirties and taller that was food for thought he nodded to the woman serving settled his reckoning and went out to the desk in the lobby the middleaged clerk was still there reading a book that he hastily closed and put away when he saw that rutledge was coming toward him can you give me the names of the three women seated together in the dining room the clerk was surprised he repeated the three women yes rutledge answered impatiently the clerk took a sheet of paper from a drawer behind the desk and carefully printed out three names how do i tell them apart rutledge asked mrs jordan is in black shes a widow mrs tibbet is in blue the one with the graying hair miss esterley uses a cane since her accident accident yes mr hamilton struck her bicycle one night during a rainstorm as he was coming down from london i see could you give me her direction the clerk stared at him shes still in the dining room if youd care to speak with her rutledge smiled in front of her friends i think not he was waiting by the gate to miss esterleys front garden when she walked around the corner on her way home she hesitated then after a moments consideration she continued in his direction and as she came up with him she said im to be favored by a visit from the man from london i wonder why rutledge smiled and gave his name yes yes everyone knows who you are come in therell be gossip enough as it is we might as well sit and be comfortable he followed her up the walk and into the house it was small comfortable and nicely set up the parlor to the right of the door was uncluttered and a gray cat was curled up on a mat by the small fire in the hearth rutledge had noted her stride she seemed to manage quite well and he found himself wondering if the cane was now an affectation it was of rosewood with a silver figure for a handle a swan he thought although it was mostly hidden by her gloved hand feminine and very elegant she ushered him into the parlor as a maid appeared from the back of the house and took miss esterleys coat and gloves that will be all nell she said dismissing the girl now inspector why should you be standing at my gate has someone told you that matthew hamilton put me in hospital for three months i hardly think thats cause to batter him to death but you may look at my cane if you wish he met her smile with one of his own im interested in anyone who has a connection with him how did the accident happen it was my fault actually id stayed late with a friend who was ill reading to her the storm came up rather suddenly and i made a dash for it unfortunately i didnt dash soon enough and the rain caught me halfway home it was dark as pitch wind lashing the trees and i should have stopped but i thought only a little farther and im safe his motor came around the next bend and struck me before he even knew i was there id seen his lights but thought i had time to pull across the road and into the shelter of some trees ridiculous to be worried about being splashed i was already as wet as i could ever be but you dont always think rationally do you on the spur of the moment she had an interesting face square jawed with a straight nose and deepset eyes the kind hamish was saying that could lie well without betraying the thoughts behind the words were you badly injured my knee took the brunt of the blow it was weeks before i could walk on it again and then it was stiff for ages after that who was your doctor he asked intending to verify details of the accident and how she might have felt at the time it occurred dr granville of course and i must say he worked a miracle but it was clear she preferred to talk about hamilton it was my claim to fame you know meeting matthew hamilton on his very first visit to hampton regis i have first acquaintance it quite puts miss trinings nose out of joint he smothered a laugh when was this last year i was disappointed to discover that he was married were short of eligible bachelors here he thought she was mocking him miss esterley was in fact striking while felicity hamilton could be described as beautiful but there were attractions other than beauty intelligence for one character spirit a shared background are you on good terms with mrs hamilton i have no reason not to be i dont dally with married men i didnt mean that you did what you were asking inspector was whether or not his wife was jealous of me i doubt it was i jealous of her no i enjoyed matthew hamiltons visits to hospital immensely and later at the convalescent home he has a very pleasant manner and it passed the time ive traveled a little and we shared an interest in that otherwise he came out of kindness and a sense of duty he felt responsible and as i had no one else to look out for me it was rather nice to be taken care of before she could stop herself she cast a wistful glance at a photograph on the table at his elbow an artillery captain he saw smiling at the camera with a devilmaycare expression he didnt need to ask miss esterley if the captain had come home from france hamish said aye but she wanted you to notice rutledge responded silently if she was jealous of hamilton it would have been his wife struck down on the strand a woman scorned the scots voice retorted almost as if shed heard hamish she said i grew up in kenya mr rutledge matthew hamilton hadnt traveled to nairobi but id been to crete and malta and cyprus on holiday with my parents we could only afford the slow steamer not the fast packet you see and that was our good fortune because we enjoyed exploring it was what took my father out to kenya in the first place do you know matthew hamilton well enough to tell me who might have wished to see him die whispers say it must be stephen mallory but i doubt it she frowned its going to make it difficult for all three of them when matthew hamilton is recovered even if stephen didnt harm him hes destroyed felicity hamiltons reputation here theres the maid yes well you dont know nan as i do she used to work for a friend before the hamiltons came if it had been felicity who was attacked id have thought of nan before anyone else its a terrible thing to say about someone you know but i see her stooping to murder if she thought it would free her employer from his wifes spell and spell it is make no mistake as they were leaving the esterley house hamish said whats the secret of matthew hamilton then miss trining is jealous of him in her own fashion rutledge answered thoughtfully miss esterley enjoyed his company more than perhaps wassuitable for want of a better word if shed been as fond of the doctor responsible for seeing to it that she walked again id find that more commendable and theres miss cole i expect the rector heard something in hamiltons voice that betrayed more than hed intended to say when he brought up her name i wonder what frances would make of him his sister was a very good judge of people and often better than most when it came to understanding the roots of relationships the trouble was the force of character and the vitality of the help less man lying on the cot in dr granvilles examining room were obscured by bandaging and silence it was hard to tell whether his charm was real or merely cultivated through years of diplomatic necessity even felicity might not know the answer even though she had married him hamish could be right that what people wanted to see in him they did see the eye of the beholder rutledge threaded his way through the busy streets intent on going to the police station but he paused briefly to look out across the mole toward the open sea the view beckoned the day clear enough to see for miles the water lapping softly at the strand of shingle where hamilton had been walking there were boats there now drawn up out of reach of the tide and gulls sat on the jutting pier calling to one another he had always loved the water and this afternoon it was a mirror deep blue and peaceful but the sea was not always so quiet inspector bennett was waiting for him demanding to know why mr reston had been questioned like a common suspect hes respected in these parts bennett pointed out a man of business even men of business commit murder rutledge said blandly more to the purpose he might well have been walking to the bank that morning and passed someone hurrying away from the mole id have thought a prominent citizen would be more than happy to help the police with their inquiries instead he complains to you thats as may be ive already put my men to questioning the fishermen and the loungers who hang about the mole theyre a more likely source of information have they had anything to tell you so far they saw nothing worst luck bennett admitted there was a mist that morning some people like walking in mists i dont see it myself quickest way to lose your bearings and find yourself in trouble yes well set your men to questioning the shopkeepers along the mole the man who sweeps out the pub the milliner who comes early to workanyone who might have seen hamilton before he reached the mole or noticed someone following him on monday morning sourly bennett said this isnt london with limitless resources if someone was going to come forward of his own accord to tell us what he saw hed have done it by now what were after is what people dont realize is important and whats more bennett went on moving to his next grievance im told you woke hamilton up questioned him and then summoned the doctor to him what was that about it was hardly questioning him he came to his senses on his own spoke a few words that indicated he was only just aware of my presence and that was the extent of it so you say how do i know that was all that took place irritated rutledge said good lord bennett why should i keep such information from you if it didnt look good for your friend you might not wish to tell me rutledge let it go aware that anything he could say would only make matters worse how was hamilton did you see him after i did we were there granville and i in the room trying to rouse him again it was a reluctant admission any luck rutledge wondered just how theyd gone about it none it looked to me as if he was in a deep sleep whats to be done now i dont know rutledge confessed until hamilton can talk to us were at an impasse it might be just as well to set a watch over him did dr granville mention that to you not only to write down anything he may say its possible someone might decide it was prudent to finish what began yesterday morning hamiltons no danger with mallory clapped up in the house with the women and under guard himself but what if it isnt mallory who attacked him how many men do you think i have two are watching the house in turns ive got two more questioning the loungers and fishermen along the harbor and now you want to set a watch on the doctors surgery hes calling in a woman to sit with hamilton that will suffice but would it hamish was asking as rutledge left the station it will have to was the clipped reply the afternoon was unproductive rutledge went to find the rector to learn more about miss cole but there was no answer to his knock he was walking back to his motorcar when he saw miss trining coming out the door of a neighboring house she lifted a hand in recognition hamish said she watched you go to yon rectory very likely he murmured in reply and waited for her to reach him good morning inspector are you in need of the rector im afraid hes been called away mrs tomlinson is not well she stood there as if expecting him to tell her his business but he said pleasantly thank you miss trining ill come again in the afternoon i understand youve been questioning mr reston may i know the purpose of your interest in him mr restons bank is just off the mole id hoped he could tell me who was on the street that morning her attention sharpened and could he rutledge smiled to take the sting out of his response im afraid i cant answer that her mouth tightened indeed i thought perhaps you were curious about his past but since you dont choose to confide in me i feel no compunction to confide in you good day inspector he watched her walk away her back stiff and straight now what he wondered had possessed her to cast doubt on mr restons past whatever it was she knewor thought she knewbennett was unaware of it and that was intriguing he found the reston house after asking the shy girl behind the counter at a flower shop near the mole for directions the shop smelled of dried lavender and lilies the girl a brunette in her early twenties was dressed in a white shirtwaist and a dark blue skirt her hair pulled back becomingly to a knot at the nape of her neck she smiled at him as he entered the obligatory smile of someone hoping to make a sale when she recognized him she was suddenly wary as if he had come to question her ive already spoken to constable jordan she said in a soft voice i didnt see anyone out and about the morning that mr hamilton was hurt did you see the doctor and the police removing him to dr granvilles surgery oh no i looked away it was upsetting hamish said it must ha been but why was she no curious did you know it was mr hamilton they were bringing up from the strand not then ii thought someone had drowned is drowning common off the mole she shook her head not very theres no bathing here not with the currents but sometimes especially in the war seamen washed up along the south coast a good many were never identified which is sadno one to mourn for them and perhaps a wife or mother somewhere waiting and waiting for them to come home and no one to buy flowers to put on their graves he thought he asked her the question that had brought him to the shop and thanked her the banker lived in what bennett had called the fish scale side of hampton regis an imposing gray stone edifice with a mock turret and a battlemented porch over the drive that looped past the side of the house mrs reston he was told by an elderly maid in a prim starched cap that was more suited to an edwardian household was not at home this morning feeling thwarted rutledge retraced his steps and went again to casa miranda asking to speak to mrs hamilton mallory he noted looked haggard she came to the door with red eyes as if shed been crying for some time her first words were is there news if its bad tell me quickly he couldnt bear the distress in her voice your husband was briefly awake mrs hamilton he said gently then added with a glance toward mallory not awake long enough to know where he is or why he is there i must tell you he spoke your name and we must take that as a good sign dr granville is doing all he can please tell him im grateful felicity hamilton began to weep her face in her hands he thought tears of relief both men looked away from her uncertain how to comfort her after a moment mallory said quietly what do you want rutledge let me in for ten minutes if im to help i need more information than i have now anything that you can tell me no but felicity finding her handkerchief said emphatically dont be foolish stephen if it will somehow help reluctantly mallory stepped aside to allow rutledge into the hall the house already had a dismal air as if without someone polishing and cleaning without an ordinary schedule for the day it was deteriorating they went to the sitting room where the luncheon dishes still stood on trays rutledge thought theyd had sandwiches of some kind and tea makeshift meals tell me about miss esterley he began as they sat down mallory anxiously watching felicity hamilton she said blankly miss esterley but surely you dont thinki mean it wasnt matthews fault that she was injured im not suggesting anything still she has come in contact with your husband under difficult circumstances and i must ask what effect her accident might have had on their relationship there was no relationship as you put it felicity replied irritably he felt responsible for her he saw to it that she had every care and she has no problem with her knee now she still uses that cane because shes grown accustomed to it or to make sure hamilton didnt forget he could feel hamishs presence behind him the thought leaping across the space between them as if it didnt exist that may be true rutledge hesitated trying to choose his next words carefully felicity was there before him if youre asking me whether she read more into matthews attentions than he intended i shouldnt be surprised it doesnt trouble me matthew is mine he always will be she broke off in embarrassment casting a quick glance over her shoulder at mallory standing behind her chair and was suddenly rattled i meant to say his affections arent likely to stray in that direction but rutledge wondered if she was protesting too strongly a man could love one woman very deeply and still be unfaithful to her in his mind as felicity hamilton herself could have loved matthew and still dreamed of stephen mallory wi the right weapon a woman could ha knocked hamilton doon hamish reminded rutledge softly it doesna have to be a man do you by any chance know a miss cole im not sure if thats her name still or if shes married now cole she shook her head should i the name had come up in another interview i had the feeling she might live nearby ask the rector he should know i havent heard of any coles in hampton regis have you she turned to mallory he said no i dont recognize the name either although there are a number of coles in kent i think i was in school with a hugh cole rutledge posed his next question what do you know about the restons she smiled grimly her pretty face suddenly cold and hard hes not what he seems i can tell you that he raised such a fuss about the goddess as if hed never set foot in a museum and the rest of matthews collection as well obscene and disgusting those were his exact words insufferable little man he thinks hes the arbiter of morality here in hampton regis but i happen to know for a fact that when he was an officer in a london bank he had a vicious temper and nearly she stopped her hand over her mouth gentle god id forgotten he struck down a man during a disagreement outside his london club it was hushed up of course but the man was in hospital for days he could have attacked matthew over that stupid stupid clay figure how do you know about this rutledge asked her breaking in the mother of a friend of mine when i told clarissa i was coming to live in hampton regis her mother said but thats where that awful man went the one your father saw clarissa outside his club shocking to say the least her voice unconsciously took on the tones of the older woman speaking giving force to the words what weapon did he use in this beating he had a weighted cane for protection he claimed since he often carried large sums of money for the bank the other man wouldnt press charges hed apparently said some very inflammatory things to mr reston that he didnt wish to be made public but theres your murderer inspector youve only to arrest him and our ordeal will be finished there was an expression of such hope on her face behind her mallorys lips tightened and his eyes met rutledges in mute appeal it isnt that simple mrs hamilton rutledge told her but thank you ill look into this and see what comes of it i dont see why it isnt simple go to his house inspect the cane and youll have all the proof you need she pleaded and i can sit with matthew mallory winced but said nothing yes as soon as possible can you tell me who clarissas mother is and how i can find her ill need to speak to her felicity hamilton went flying from the room and came back with a sheet of paper bearing a name and an address here call on her whatever you must do but today please i cant bear any more of this yes thank you mrs hamilton if theres anything else you can think of just ask mr mallory to call to the constable standing near the gate hell see that i get word she seemed to have bloomed into brightness her face flushed with the prospect of resolution her hopes high like a child waiting for a treat he thought would this soon grow tiresome to a man like matthew hamilton or was he still enthralled with his wifes beauty and brightness and waywardness hamish had no answer for that as rutledge asked mallory to allow him to look in on nan weekes she was still angry and resentful after a time he was able to calm her tirade sufficiently to say im here to ask if youve thought of anyone we might question or investigate someone who may have come to the house and quarreled with mr hamilton or someone who upset him in any way you know who it was struck down mr hamilton hes standing there behind you or if it wasnt him it was her youd do well to arrest both of them before im murdered in my bed you think he might harm you rather than mrs hamilton hes barged in here hasnt he and had his way with her when hes tired of that hell likely rid himself of both of us and shed like to see me dead now so there are no ears in this house to hear what goes on mallory was already objecting vociferously his voice rising in fury above hers no one has touched her and if you say i have then youre a liar over his shoulder rutledge ordered him to be silent this must be done and you know it mallory turned his back on both of them and slammed the door behind him hes got a temper on him its just a matter of time before he kills again nan said spitefully mark my words rutledge said listen to me miss weekes your anger does you credit but it wont serve you here do you understand me youll only antagonize your keeper if hamilton dies before he can speak we may never get at the truth and whether you like it or not your life may come to depend on something you can tell us something you may know that we dont he tried to keep his voice level reasonable in an effort to break through the maids stiff resistance put aside your feelings and help me there must surely be others in hampton regis who had a reason to dislike hamilton or even his wife you keep house for people you overhear conversations in the course of your duties you have friends who clean for other families and who gossip with you we were godfearing people in hampton regis before he brought her here a good christian woman wouldnt have let him put those idols up in plain sight in his drawing room she encourages him if you ask me all very well in parts of the world where people believe in such nasty things but not here rubbed in our faces and when she tires of that sport she lures her lover here if she didnt wield the stick that struck down her husband she drove that man into doing it for her if that isnt true tell me why she and her lover plotted this business of keeping us locked up here oh yes i saw it with my own eyes youd think if she truly loved her husband shed want to be there sitting beside him and nothing would stand in her way that man has to sleep some time youre telling me that it was mrs hamilton who devised the plan to hold you both at gunpoint i heard them didnt i and ill testify to that in a courtroom see if i dont with another spiteful glance at the closed door where mallory must be listening she added ask anyone at night hed drive to the headland across the way and watch this house he doesnt think people know about that but they do they whisper behind his back hes been plotting to murder mr hamilton for months if you want my opinion but as long as the poor man is breathing she wont leave with him because she loves hamilton after all because hes better off than mr mallory shes a little hussy that one and she married mr hamilton for his money ask anyone and theyll tell you the same and if hamilton was dead shed inherit that moneyassuming she came through this ordeal unscathed it was hamish commented as rutledge left nan sitting there and rejoined a very tense mallory in the passage a very good motive for murder they walked through the house in silence then at the door mallory asked rutledge quietly making certain that his voice didnt carry up the stairs or into the drawing room are you keeping something from me did he say anything why should i lie to you he was in no state to answer questions but we can hope that by tomorrow the news is better mallory listen to me encourage mrs hamilton to remember the names of wedding guests and friends she and hamilton visited in london it could be your salvation if reston is in the clear with that he stepped outside and walked on without turning back the child began to scream at two in the morning when nanny failed to comfort the boy she went to his mothers room and knocked hes hysterical i dont understand why theres nothing amiss that i can find the anxiety in her normally calm voice was a counterpoint to the heartbreaking wails issuing from the nursery should we summon dr granville mrs cornelius asked quickly knotting her dressing gown around her is he feverish you think has he been sick hes very well it was the window you see he insisted i close it and put down the shade he said something out there wanted in was the shade raised whatever for mrs cornelius followed nanny down the passage and opened the nursery door she could hear her son before she got there sobbing inconsolably now and calling for her she crossed to the bed and put her arms around him he clung to her burying his face in the dark hair that tumbled down her shoulder what is it my love what is it she repeated in a singsong voice ignoring the hovering nanny but he shook his head with some force as if he didnt want to tell her nanny said softly sometimes in the night hell wake up and go to the window seat it looks out to the sea he likes that hes learned to lift the shade for himself was it the sea that frightened you she asked the clinging child but he shook his head again or the mist youve seen mists before havent you my love nanny had closed the window but had not pulled down the shade mrs cornelius turned to peer out this window looked down on the street but she could see the water just beyond the next house but one or could have done in the moonlight a sea mist had crept in a filmy white wraith that made the street and the rooftops and the outlines of houses seem unfamiliar and unfriendly cradling the child in her arms she shivered anything could be out there she thought what had jeremy seen and it was in just such a mist that mr hamilton had been struck down what if someone lurked in the shadows watching this lighted window perhaps knowing it was her sons nursery what if he had lured the boy to slip down and open the house door they were wealthy enough to pay a goodly ransom she had caught her sons fear she said to nanny rouse mr cornelius if you please ask him to send for inspector bennett it may be nothing but on the other hand better safe than sorry tell him to take benedict with him the footman she thought would be protection enough and beg him to remember to lock the door behind him hurry when nanny had gone she said soothingly its all right jeremy theres nothing to worry you would you like to sleep in my bed for a bit anything to take him away from here and the lighted window she could feel his head bob against her breast then you must stand up like the little man you are and take my hand youre far too big for me to carry after a time he sat up and then got down from her lap but held tightly to her hand as they went back along the dark passage and into her room watching him climb into her bed and snuggle under the bedclothes she thought he might be going on seven but hes still a baby she took the precaution of locking the bedroom door until her husband returned moments later cornelius sitting in his dressing room was dragging his trousers on over his nightclothes and searching for his stockings and shoes all the while grumbling under his breath but he was accustomed to doing his wifes bidding and pulling on his heavy coat and finding a scarf he set out in the darkness for the police station two streets over he had rejected as foolishness taking benedict with him but had sensibly brought his cane he didnt like the sea mist any more than his son had done and he listened to the muffled echo of his heels thinking that matthew hamilton had been walking out later than this and someone invisible in just such a mist had nearly killed him had jeremys terror somehow been intended to bring another prominent man out into the dark streets to be assaulted nonsense he told himself briskly the child had had a nightmare and his wife had been frightened by the unexpected intensity of it nevertheless he found himself looking over his shoulder whenever there was a sound behind him and he walked a little faster why the devil did a street appear to be so different on a night of mist the shrubbery in back of mrs pickerings house looked like hunched monsters brooding over a pool of cotton wool shrouding their feet and a chimney atop the reston house sported a gull that floated in midair when a cat ran out of a doorway on the mole it startled him so badly he nearly dropped his cane a black cat he was certain of it whatever jeremy had seen by the time he reached the police station theo cornelius had convinced himself that something indeed was abroad and his heart was pounding from a sense of being watched the police station was empty a lamp stood on the desk in the main room and beside it a note that sent him on to bennetts house growling as he went all for a silly childs nightmare he told himself now otherwise hed be at home in his own bed sound asleep jeremy had been begging sweets in the kitchen again and cook spoiled him recklessly but bravado did nothing to stop the hairs on the back of his neck from prickling as he stepped into the street again it took him several minutes to rouse someone at bennetts house the inspector came to the door his crutch propping him up as he looked out at the man on his step mr cornelius he said instantly recognizing his caller whats to do sir is there any trouble my son is having a nightmare my wife insisted that i summon you it sounded ridiculous putting it that way and he took a step backward ershe felt that since mr hamilton had been attacked on a morning when there was sea mist it might be important to discover what had upset my son i see but it was evident bennett didnt he cleared his throat and said you must fetch mr rutledge at the duke of monmouth sir hes in charge of the inquiry into what happened to mr hamilton look cornelius began irritably ive been to the station and ive come here im damned if ill spend whats left of the night but bennett was there before him he pointed to his bandaged foot and said its all i can do to walk down the stairs sir much less as far as your house were spread thin and thats why mr rutledge has come youd do better speaking with him hes from scotland yard you know a london policeman he smiled grimly cornelius turned away angry and feeling a worse fool he was of half a mind to go home and to bed be damned to alarums in the night but his wife would simply send him out again and so he went instead to the duke of monmouth inn the sense of danger had faded replaced by anger and resentment what he should have done was hunt the fool down himself not come for the incompetent and unhelpful police the chief constable would hear about this it seemed to be the middle of the night when rutledge came out of a deep sleep to hear voices in the passage outside his door he listened for a moment or two and recognized the desk clerks as one of them by the time the man knocked rutledge was on his feet and reaching for his clothes rutledge opened his door to the desk clerk his hair disheveled and trousers thrown on with haste behind him was a taller man fair and flustered but well dressed mr rutledge this is mr cornelius inspector bennett has sent him to you he turned slightly to include cornelius in the conversation the man said theres something wrong at my house my sons had a shock and my wife sent me to fetch you will you come what kind of shock rutledge asked swiftly finishing dressing i dont know he was screaming the house down half an hour ago theres a mist coming in my wife was concerned about that what with the assault on mr hamilton he stopped seeming at a loss for words his story hadnt come out the way hed intended it should but rutledge followed him without argument with hamish alert and awake in his mind quarreling and taunting during the silent walk to where cornelius lived the mist had grown denser and it was a strangely quiet soft world the sea itself hissing somewhere to his left instead of rolling in with its usual thunder the cornelius house was on mercer street which curved away from the center of town but still allowed a very nice view of the water more prosperous residents lived hererestons house was just down the roadand the victorian flavor of money and respectability was reflected in the size and style of the dwellings rutledge was reminded of bennetts comment that fish scales made for slippery social climbing they went up the walk to number and cornelius let them in with his key there was a lamp at the foot of the stairs but the ground floor was in darkness carrying the lamp cornelius took the steps two at a time to the first floor and rutledge followed the man was annoyed that his wife had locked the bedroom door and knocked briskly she came out to them shushing them jeremys just gone to sleep again she stared uncertainly at rutledge and her husband hastily presented him adding hes here in bennetts stead what seems to be the trouble rutledge asked her its probably a wildgoose chase she began apologetically confronted now with this stranger from london instead of mr bennett she was beginning to wonder if shed been wise to call in the police but the memory of her sons distress kept her from making light of her fears nanny tells me my son sits by his window late at night and tonight there was something in the mist that frightened him he began to cry and it took me some time to calm him down again but after what happened to matthew hamilton yes you did the right thing rutledge replied cutting short the apology did he describe to you what hed seen a hunchback creature stumbling along the road at the head of the street he believes it was a monster of some kind but of course thats only a childs interpretation i cant think what it might actually have been she glanced at her husband jeremy is possessed of a lively imagination and his grandfather encourages him by reading to him books that are well perhaps a little mature for him but he doesnt make up stories something was there im convinced of it a fisherman carrying his nets down to the boat rutledge took out his watch when do the fishermen set sail before dawn surely i hadnt thought of thatbut why should that frighten jeremy he must have seen them dozens of times and thisthis creature wasnt walking toward the mole but away from it following the west road and yet hamish put in she didna fear to send her husband out in the dark which was an interesting point mr cornelius was a prime target if someone was intent on distracting the police from the attack on hamilton by hunting other likely prey in the night rutledge shifted his emphasis slightly but that was in effect his next question if you were concerned about who or what was out there was it wise to send mr cornelius to the police she stared at rutledge but he took benedict with him and besides my husband has no enemies over her head rutledge and cornelius exchanged glances in silent agreement that she neednt be told her husband had gone out alone neither apparently did hamilton have enemies rutledge answered her mrs cornelius refused to wake the boy for rutledge to question further tonight the problem is out there not in here ive told you everything my son told me theres been enough time wasted already inspector if this monster is to be found youd best hurry in the end he didnt press and cornelius saw him out again with heartfelt apologies walking back through the mist rutledge could understand the sense of unease that had triggered the boys fear nothing appeared to have its normal shape in this white shroud a cat skirting a garden walk loomed large as it rounded the corner of a wall as if magnified by the murky light and a small boat putting out to sea seemed to be sailing into a milky curtain that clung to it and draped it until it vanished a captive of some voracious sea monster rooftops appeared and disappeared chimney pots were heads poking out of the swirls as if strange creatures were dancing there high above the street a wandering dog knocked over a pail and the noise of it rolled among the houses with waves of echoes he spent half an hour searching for whatever it was young jeremy had seen but there was nothing to account for it the lad should ha been abed and asleep and if the nanny had caught jeremy disobeying rules he might have invented a monster to distract her it had to be considered rutledge had circled back to the head of mercer street and now stood still looking down it toward the cornelius house the windows were dark everyone settled in his bed he found himself wondering who would see him if he raised his arms high threw back his head and howled silently chances were no one perhaps whoever had passed here briefly crossing jeremy corneliuss line of sight had counted on that and in the mist everyone was all but invisible a straying husband hurrying back to his wife a drunk hoping to find his bed at last or a housebreaker taking his chances or yon doctor on his way to a confinement hamish put in it needna be more out of the ordinary than that rutledge turned toward the inn grateful for his heavy coat against the night chill odd that bennett had sent cornelius to him he found himself thinking as the inn came into sight the sign was disembodied a floating man high above the street catching the light from the lamp that rutledge had left burning in his room even with its tenuous connection to the hamilton matter jeremy corneliuss ghostly figure was not a case for the yard bennett had hoped to make him look like a fool chasing a childs hobgoblins in the middle of the night a notsosubtle attempt to show the outsider that the local man knew what he was about and at the same time placating a prominent citizen in need rain came an hour later a downpour that went on until the eaves were dripping and the dawn was lost in the heavy clouds that seemed to rest on the very rooftops replicating last nights fog rutledge awoke some forty minutes later than he usually did the darkness in his room and the regular pattering of the rain blotting out nightmares allowing him for once to sleep deeply the dining room was empty his breakfast set out on the long table by the kitchen door he filled his plate and sat down hamish seeming to hover behind him in the shadows the woman who was now serving at meals brought him his tea and stood by his table for a moment looking out the windows at the weather he thought to ask about becky and was assured that she was expected to resume her duties by early next week thank goodness this wasnt a busier time of year she went on and then nodded toward the rain coming down harder as they watched my grandmother told us last night this was coming her knees ached something fierce the barometer bore her out but we didnt know did we that it would be such a stormy morning she sighed poor daffodils theyll have muddy faces now he offered a smile and she went back to the kitchen it was a depressing morning true enough and hamish was vigorously reminding him of the rain in the trenches the sour smells of unwashed bodies wet wool mud and despair in equal measure finishing the last of his toast and tea he rose and walked out to the lobby opening the door to a gust of air so heavy with moisture it seemed to have come from the sea not the sky he had expected to go back to matthew hamilton this morning to sit there again and talk to the man hoping to bring him back to the present once more he had the feeling that hamilton had understood more than rutledge or the doctor realized and that the words flowing around him had partly roused him out of the pain and blackness that engulfed him but it was late and his first duty must be to mrs hamilton and her maid the situation there was unstable enough to change by the hour he fetched his hat and coat and with a sigh dashed through the downpour to the motorcar feeling his shoulders and his shoes taking the brunt of what was pelting down and swirling in puddles under foot he turned the crank and ran for the drivers door nearly colliding with a man half hidden behind a large black umbrella he seemed to appear out of nowhere from the boot of the motorcar the umbrella flexed as it struck rutledge and dumped a shower of water into his face as he ducked away from the points the man holding it swore and then as it shifted a little so that he could peer under the dripping edge he said rutledge it was dr granville are you looking for me rutledge asked and then added for gods sake come inside before were both wet through leaving the motorcar running he urged the doctor through the yard door into the inn they found themselves in the narrow flagged passage that led from the back hall and granville left his umbrella outside taking out a handkerchief to wipe his face what is it has hamilton taken a turn for the worst rutledge asked when the man seemed to hesitate or is he dead rutledge went on staring hard at the doctor i dont know the doctors voice was diffident as if he were embarrassed to say what had brought him here you didnt put a guard on him is that it after id warned you well what has happened to him now come on man speak up the doctor looked up at him hes gone he said simply justgone at first rutledge took that to mean that hamilton had died in the night alone and without regaining his senses but then he realized that the doctor meant what he said quite literally the shock in his eyes was unmistakable gone when where rutledge demanded i dont know for gods sake i dont know his bed was empty when i went to check on him half an hour ago are you quite sure he hasnt passed out in another room as he tried to find help ive searched the premises hes gone i tell you to the house to find his wife rutledge swore and wheeled toward the door come on man weve got to search for him he cant have made it far its not a climb he can but rutledge had the sleeve of his coat pulling at him and the doctor came reluctantly behind him catching up his umbrella but with no time to open it they made for the motorcar and climbed in bringing the miasma of wet wool after them steaming up the windscreen with the heat of their bodies rutledge found a cloth under his seat and scrubbed at the inside of the glass swearing again then he tossed the cloth to the doctor put the motorcar into gear and turned in a shimmering fan of spray they came out of the inn drive and went toward the street that ran along the mole have you spoken to bennett rutledge asked taking the next turn far too fast feeling the tires slipping sideways in a spin he brought the vehicle back under control and headed to the east no i couldnt face him i came straightaway for you instead i thought perhapslook out you fool theres a bicycle aheaddamn it were no good to hamilton or anyone else if were dead but rutledge paid him no heed every second counted now three minutes later he found a very wet constable standing under a tree some distance from the drive to the house where hed taken what shelter he could find against the trunk how long have you been on duty rutledge asked lowering the window since six sir the man answered looking as wretched as he must feel its been all quiet at the house not a sound out of them and no one has come in or out no sir no one but if the earlier watcher had been standing where this man was it would be hard in the dark to know who had come or gone rutledge thanked him and drove up to the door the shrubbery by the drive was as wet as a rain forest he thought getting out to hammer on the house door and the downpour had hardly lessened since it began mallory came to answer his impatient summons looking as tired as rutledge had ever seen him what do you want now he glanced over rutledges shoulder and saw the doctor in the motorcar for gods sake why have you brought him ive done them no harm hamilton has disappeared rutledge told him bluntly he may have come here i want to search the house and after that the grounds its a trick hes dead isnt he well you arent bringing any of your men or bennetts here on a pretense to search ill use the revolver if i have to do you hear me hes missing rutledge said grimly youd better listen to me mallory im not here to play at cat and mouse if hes been out in this rain for hours hell be running a fever by now or he could have bled to death from his internal injuriesgod only knows will you let me in to search or not mallory called out to dr granville is this true is hamilton gone in the night the doctor confirmed he must have come here man where else would he go in his condition mallory swore he isnt here i tell you but his gaze moved toward the dark silent house behind him id have known stay here if you like and guard the door but let me search rutledge said rapidly ill do it alone and i give you my word now that i have no other motive i wont leave a window or door unlocked i wont frighten either of the women its his house mallory he knows it better than you do i thought he was too badly injured to know where he was much less walk away you told me as much damn it he retorted accusingly you lied to me we believed it to be true but you know as well as i do that badly injured men are capable of heroic effort we saw that often enough in the war for gods sake if hes determined to know why his wife hasnt visited him he may have tried to reach her for fear something has happened to her as well or he may be out for revenge its better if i find him first before you come on him in the dark the other man stood there undecided and then he opened the door wider and let rutledge step inside watching the water dripping relentlessly from his coat and his trousers to puddle on the floor mallory gestured to it and said ruefully i cant even call the maid to clear it up just stay away from nan and from mrs hamilton and dont linger i dont trust you and ill be searching the house again after you leave im quite serious rutledge dont drive me into a corner he said to mallory if hamilton managed to make his way here pray that his mind is clear it could be your salvation and with hamish behind him alternately warning and driving him rutledge set about his search it would be to mallorys advantage to bring the wounded man to his wife rutledge kept telling himself since she couldnt go to him and yet he went into every room belowstairs and on the ground floor testing the window locks looking for signs of a breakin while mallory slept he searched for wet footprints on carpets and felt for damp draperies where windows might have been thrown open during the heavy rain and he listened intently for any sounds that might tell him that hamilton was here and also a prisoner but a quarter of an hour later he had found nothing except the irate nan demanding to know why she hadnt been set free long since passing mallory where he sat on the staircase rutledge moved on to the first floor methodically going from bedroom to bedroom even as he began to realize it was hopeless looking under beds into wardrobes behind screens even behind the stiff brocade draperies that hung at each window he tried to think where hamilton might have gone if he hadnt come here to casa miranda but there were still the grounds to search the only room he didnt enter was mrs hamiltons when hed finished in the attics he stood outside her door and tapped lightly on the panel he had the feeling she was cowering inside unwilling to face him without stephen mallorys knowledge had she gone to the doctors surgery during the night and somehow managed to bring her husband back with her it would have been a disastrous act of courage and determination even to try and she couldnt have moved hamilton if hed been unconscious still mallory had to sleep sometime although he looked as if hed never closed his eyes was that her solution to the need to know how her husband fared and if it was then he himself must now tread with care mayhap she doesna know who is at the door hamish pointed out the room must look out to the sea and the headland on the other side of the mole she may not have heard his motorcar with the rain making such a racket its inspector rutledge mrs hamilton no one else is with me except for hamish he added silently but how would she know after a moment he called to her again more insistently this time and she said her voice tremulous what do you want is there news are you alone in there mrs hamilton there was a pause before she came to the door opening it a crack she too looked very tired her face already losing some of the soft vulnerability he remembered warily she said what do you mean of course im alone may i come in and look around your room mrs hamilton i wont take more than a moment or two lookwhat is it youre looking for i want to see that all is well with you as mr mallory has assured me it is but with the intuition of a woman she could sense that something wasnt right have you interviewed george reston she demanded suspiciously what has he said to you im looking into that i promise you just now pulling her shawl closer as if trying to warm herself she said no i dont want to see you or anyone else go away mrs hamilton he studied her hair but it appeared dry to him yet out in this storm nothing stayed dry for very long had matthew hamilton been moved before the rains began under cover of the mist im not feeling very well this morning i want to be left alone dont disturb me again until you can bring me good news she looked away from him tears filling her eyes i cant bear much more she closed the door in his face and he heard the key turn in the lock hamish said she didna ask how her husband was this morning there was nothing for it after that but to search the grounds and the heavy rain hadnt let up rutledge briefly explained to granville what he was doing and why then asked to borrow his umbrella the doctor said before he handed it over i really ought to look in on mrs hamilton while im here when she hears whats become of her husband shell be distraught if youll have a word with mallory rutledge cut him short stay out of it if you want to be useful think where we ought to look if hamilton isnt here he took the umbrella effectively stranding granville in the motorcar the umbrella turned out to be all but worthless and after a time he gave up and furled it there was no sign of matthew hamilton on the grounds or in the outbuildings no sign even that someone had been there no muddy marks on floors in the garden shed or the small stable that had been partly converted to a garage rutledge put his hand on the bonnets of the motorcars therethey were cool to the touchand hunted for deep footprints in the soft wet earth the lone horse nickered as he leaned into its stall and blew as he offered his hand to it and he used his instincts as well lifting rainheavy branches burrowing under shrubs putting himself in the shoes of a man desperately tired or overcome by weakness he even poked a hand around the iron seat in the back garden now draped in a tentlike covering of oiled cloth to prevent rusting over the winter mrs hamilton and her husband must have sat here and watched the sunset of a summers evening today the sea and the sky seemed to have merged a gray mass that was nearly indistinguishable behind the curtain of fresh squalls on the horizon rutledge was just turning away when he realized that closer to hand there was a gathering of men down along the mole bennett among them leaning on his crutches they were all getting into a line of carts and carriages and motorcars hurry evident even at this distance hamish said theyve found him then mallory was once more sitting at the bottom of the staircase this time with a whiskey glass in his hand he was staring at it morosely and barely glanced up as rutledge stepped through the door then something in rutledges face brought him to his feet what what have you found nothing here but i think perhaps bennett has been more successful in the village i must go he turned away toward the motorcar but mallory called him back did you tell her he was missing i must knowdid you tell her no rutledge said standing there looking closely at him how much more would it take to make this man break he was grateful now that he hadnt discovered matthew hamilton hidden in the house i saw no point in adding to her distress but if we find hamilton has crept out and diedor has been left somewhere to dieit will be hard to stop bennett from wanting your liver nailed to the police station door damn you the curse followed rutledge down the drive as dr granville demanded whats that you were saying damn it man how did bennett find out about hamilton someone must have stumbled on him i could see from the gardensa dozen or two men by the mole sorting themselves out into vehicles bennett must be wondering where i got to i should be there when they bring him in rather than wasting my time here granville was tense with worry it wasnt a waste of time rutledge said nodding to the constable under his tree as they turned out of the drive after all this was the most likely place he drove fast but with care on the wet roads air passing through the car brought a chill with it that cut through the drenched clothes clinging to his body although the morning appeared to be warming up noticeably they reached the mole as the last man was getting into a cart dragging a canvas sack over his head to keep dry bennett stood up in the wagon in which he was a passenger thought better of clambering down again and shouted across to rutledge where have you been to the house but the inspector wasnt interested he called theres been a landslip to the west of here a bad one im told were on our way to see the extent of the damage he motioned for rutledge to follow but the doctor objected angrily a landslip is it then put me down here he said in an hour ill have a surgery full of patients and theres still hamilton ifwhenyou find him you must tell bennett whats happened i cant take the time rutledge paused to set the doctor down and the man hurried off without a word his umbrella bent to the wind his feet sloshing through the rivulets of water running through the street then rutledge put the car into gear again and hurried to catch up the tag end of the convoy heading west along the devon road hamish was vocal reminding rutledge of the alarums in the night what the laddie saw a man carrying anither man oer his shoulder and heading in the opposite direction from the hamilton house yes i was just thinking about that before the rain came aye no tracks and no tracks the last time a wily bastard this one he followed the convoy along the road that led toward the devon border but it wasnt very long before they stopped and got out in the downpour moving across a rising green headland that seemed to end in a jagged line across the horizon of the sea bennett stood there crutch digging deep into the wet earth the cottage is gone he was saying and a good ten feet this side of it he raised his voice to call peremptorily damn it tatum dont go any closer theres no certainty its finished falling and wed have no way of getting you out one of the towns people stopped where he was then gingerly backed away from the edge nodding true he said if it werent for this infernal rain we could have a better look from the water there were cows grazing peacefully nearer the road but none had ventured as far as the landslip seagulls were wheeling overhead calling to one another and dipping out of sight to where the land had shifted and fallen a feast for the likes of them tatum went on the men were strung out in a rough line staring at the sight one of them turned to rutledge and said it happens from time to time in my granddas day three houses and a barn went over that was a bad one you said there was a cottage here if you could call it that a tumbledown ruin where no one cared to live and you can see why cant you the last resident there was a brother to mr reston the black sheep in the family you might say he grinned hell be glad enough that the cottage is gone now people will finally forget it existed black sheep rutledge asked curious there had been no mention of a brother does he drink the man shook his head nothing so tame a general reprobate wild for the ladies if you could call them that gambled on whether a fly would land on his dinner a petty thief and a troublemaker when freddy died brother george must have fallen down on his knees in gratitude what happened to him the man frowned odd now that you mention it he drowned on the strand not a dozen yards from where they found mr hamiltons body bennett was calling to his men theres nothing we can do here after all might as well get out of the wet he limped heavily toward the vehicle that had brought him out here then veered as if the prospect of jolting back to town in a wagon wasnt a welcome one seeing that youre here rutledge ill drive back with you save some time the man who had been talking with rutledge quietly faded away as if their conversation had never taken place rutledge nodded to him but there was no return nod rutledge had left the motor running and as he climbed in and bennett swung his muddy crutch into the rear seat hamish said ware turning the motorcar was a dicey proposition for the ground was saturated and the tires sank deep rutledge gave the maneuver the attention it deserved while bennett took out a handkerchief to dry his face i saw dr granville with you one of the women having hysterics nan weekes most likely mrs hamilton doesnt appear to be the sort but then you never know especially if mallory decided to make free with her rutledge responded in a neutral voice matthew hamilton is missing bennett swung around so that he could see rutledges face missing what the hell are you talking about when dr granville looked in on him this morning he wasnt there youre saying he came to his senses and just walked out we dont know he wasnt there i went at once to search the hamilton house and grounds but if hes at casa miranda i cant find him unless he knows some way of concealing himself there when i saw the gathering on the mole i assumed someone had sent for you to tell you where to look that this was a search party setting out bennett swore long and feelingly why didnt granville come to me damn it and what possessed the fool to leave hell take his death in this rain that blow on the head must have unsettled his mind or someone was afraid he might regain his senses and remember more than was safe bennett stared at him again youre saying he didnt walk away that someones got rid of him there was the cornelius boys nightmare he saw something in the night his mother told me it was a hunchback walking through the mist pshaw thats nonsense it might fit if someone carried matthew hamilton over his shoulder then where in hells name would he have taken him and on foot hes no lightweight is hamilton a good question rutledge slowed as he reached the mole he didnt add that there were two motorcars to choose from at casa miranda and a horse or that the constable had taken shelter under a tree where in the heavier downpours he could hear very little do you want to get down here id like to find a boat willing to take me around to the landslip before that i want to speak to corneliuss son in light of whats happened since last night a boat in this weather and whats there to see i ask you dont be a fool youre here to attend to hamilton and his affairs not to see the sights take me to granvilles surgery if you will a childs nightmare wont help us forward there may be something dr granville missed in his panic rutledge stopped at the walk to granvilles surgery door and waited while bennett got down bennett stood for a moment in the rain as if torn between duties youre not coming he asked finally are you insisting on going to the cornelius house first the last thing rutledge wanted was bennetts harsh impatience frightening an already frightened child he compromised all right ill come here after i have a chat with young jeremy he glanced at the sky the clouds had darkened again as another heavy squall approached not the best conditions for an open boat as even hamish was pointing out if hamilton is loose hes in that house bennett shifted his umbrella against the shadow of more rain sweeping across behind them what im hoping is that mallory was careless if he was the one who took hamilton away ive told you i searched the grounds and the house carefully not carefully enough in my book what better place to keep an eye on the man and his recovering memory than under your thumb no one ever said mallory was a fool thats not something i want to contemplate rutledge replied whats even more worrying is if hamilton went there under his own power he could be out for revenge do you think hes that sort you know him i dont bennett gave it a moments thought if i were mallory if i didnt have the man myself id be looking over my shoulder about now then he was gone making his way up the walk to the surgery door hamish watched him go saying it could be true rutledge answered slowly he could also have been taken to that cottage that just fell into the sea in which case we might never see him again or find his body its no verra likely a verra long way to carry a mans body withoot being seen rutledge drew up in front of the cornelius house i grant you but if i were planning to do away with matthew hamilton id have carried him as far as i could on foot well away from granvilles surgery and put him somewhere out of sight until i could come back with some sort of transportation it had been a risk with the constable on duty the horse then not a motorcar but jeremy hadnt seen a horse ye ken mallorys cottage is standing empty theres that as well when rutledge presented himself at her door mrs cornelius was reluctant to let even an inspector from london interview her son this morning her manner was polite but firm her expression cool and distant he seems to have got over his fright and i dont want to remind him i shant worry him about it rutledge said with a smile but i need to have a better feeling for what was out thereif anything you say the nanny never saw whatever it was no one saw it but jeremy i expect he was half asleep and hardly knew how to describe what he witnessed except in terms of monsters ive told you hes a child of immense imagination and too young to tell anything but the exact truth rutledge reminded her i wont do him any harm i promise you in the end he got his way and the boy was brought down from the nursery to meet him well aware that his clothes were too wet to sit on the blue silk that covered the sitting room chairs rutledge pulled a wooden one away from the cherry desk under the windows and tried to make himself appear comfortable as he waited in the doorway mrs cornelius stood aside and let her son precede her across the threshold a sturdy sixyearold with intelligent dark eyes and a rather sensitive face rutledge thought as jeremy walked into the sitting room he was his fathers son in build and his mothers in looks an only child and not spoiled hamish agreed no a lad to imagine something sae grisly rutledge greeted the boy and asked him to sit down for a moment your mother tells me you enjoy looking out your window at night do you have an interest in the stars jeremy glanced at his mother and then said i like the night i see the fishermen going out sometimes and the stars when theres no moon he smiled broadly mrs ingrams cat digs up mrs witherspoons roses she thinks its the harmon dog rutledge laughed pleased to find the boy so articulate i shant tell her that no i like the cat the dog is small and nips at my heels when my mother takes me to visit mrs harmon she always smells of peppermint but the dog is always in need of a bath his mother was about to admonish him then thought better of it standing guard at his back with her gaze fixed on rutledges face but it was jeremy who was more perceptive were you in the war sir yes i was in france my uncle died of wounds at gallipoli i dont remember him very well he was quite brave my grandfather tells me im sure he was rutledge answered were you brave too mrs cornelius said jeremy but rutledge his throat tight said i was given a medal as if that was a measure of courage there were others who deserved it more he coughed then changed the direction of the conversation tell me what you saw in the streets last night do you remember the child nodded gravely taking courage from his mothers presence i didnt like it he said was it shaped like a bear there arent any bears in hampton regis the boy answered him scornfully and ive never been to the zoo in london have you many times rutledge informed him my parents took me once i particularly liked the giraffes they have purple tongues jeremy seemed enthralled with the idea truly purple truly now tell me about what you saw if it wasnt a bear what was it a man without a head he said uneasily moving closer to his mother i didnt like it a big man taller than i am i dont know wider than i am i couldnt tell i didnt like it that he didnt have a head i expect thats true i wouldnt care for it myself mrs cornelius was once more on the point of commenting then fell silent again but her eyes had grown anxious you were quite a brave boy to tell your mother what you saw i expect it was a fisherman with a heavy net over his shoulders you werent likely to see his head then were you the boy was suddenly still you think so it could be rutledge answered but i wasnt there and i didnt see him jeremy appeared to be replaying the scene in his mind but i dont think it was he finally said he stumbled as he walked as if he couldnt see was it two men do you think one with another over his shoulders carrying him because his friend couldnt walk far the boy seemed to relax yes i hadnt thought of that he smiled that was a nice thing to do although i shouldnt like to be carried with my head hanging down it would hurt after a while wouldnt it perhaps they didnt have far to go over the boys head his eyes met mrs corneliuss and then jeremy said out of the blue i saw mr harmon bring his son home that way one night after hed stayed late at the merry tinker he was walking beside his father and then didnt seem to be able to find his legs they went in different directions and his father put him across his shoulder for the rest of the way did mr harmon have a head no i couldnt see it for lawrence well there you are youve been a very great help jeremy your mother must be proud of you rutledge rose to leave yes very proud mrs cornelius replied but jeremy was still thinking about other matters and he said as rutledge reached the sitting room door it wasnt quite the same you know as mr harmon somehow i didnt like it on the street in front of the cornelius house rutledge was met by an outofbreath constable who nearly collided with him before he could slow his pace mr rutledge sir he leaned one hand against the wing of the motorcar fighting to get the words out mr bennett sayscome at once rutledge turned the crank and stepped behind the wheel whats happened the constable shook his head im not to say sironly come at once he hauled himself into the passenger seat and pointed toward the mole the sea had yielded its secret then but as rutledge reached the mole and realized that no crowd was gathered there the constable gestured east and added dr granvilles surgery theyve found hamilton rutledge said to hamish alive or dead he wasnt aware that hed spoken the words aloud the constable stirred uneasily i dont know sir truly it was a grimfaced bennett who met him at the surgery leaving the constable to take up his station on the front walk he ushered rutledge down the passage to the door that led to the doctors consulting room granville was seated in a chair usually reserved for patients looking drained and ill there was a whiskey glass in one hand but it was shaking with such force that the man couldnt even bring it to his lips bennett on rutledges heels said look behind the desk rutledge went to the massive desk and leaned over it he had been prepared to see hamilton lying there dead but it wasnt hamilton on the floor just out of sight from the doorway it was a woman facedown the hair on the back of her head matted with blood her legs crumpled under her he knew her at once mrs granville rutledge glanced at bennett then knelt to touch the side of her throat the flesh was cool and there was no pulse he straightened up and stepped away looking down at the body he could picture her coming into the room and crossing to the desk perhaps to leave a note for her husband if there had been someone behind her she hadnt feared him or perhaps if the room was dark she hadnt even realized anyone was there and as she reached the side of the desk whoever it was had struck her hard enough to kill her he noted that she was wearing a nightdress with a matching blue silk robe over it her bare feet encased in incongruously plain woolly slippers she hadnt expected to find a murderer here a woman with no defenses and no need to die surely a doctors wife used to tending patients unprepared for violence he felt a wash of pity she would not have cared to be seen by so many men while in her nightdress hamish said she couldna be mistaken for the doctor even in the dark she was a slight woman compared with granville and not nearly as tall hamilton or perhaps she had thought it was he standing there in the dark asking her to help him and she had stepped behind the desk to turn up the lamp on the far side that would have sealed her fate was it stephen mallory who had killed her because she had caught him trying to carry hamilton out into the night what was it the doctor had told him earlier the garden door had been ajar but where was her husband and why was she here in the surgery alone in the dead of night unless she had answered a summons at the door because dr granville wasnt at home yet the surgery doors were seldom lockedrutledge had discovered that for himself and anyone else could have done the same rutledge turned back to the room and said dr granville informed me that hed already searched the surgery for hamilton so he had but i expect he never thought to look behind the desk it wasnt likely that hamilton would be crouching back there was it not with his injuries rutledge turned to granville doctor he roused himself with an effort no i neverhe couldnt have been behind there my first thought was hed come to his senses and dragged himself out of bed to find something for his pain and so id gone through every room expecting him to be lying in one of them unconscious hes a large mani didnt think to lookthere not over there the cabinets behind the desk contain files the bottom drawer i keep locked because it has certain drugs in it that i dont like to leave in the dispensary why should he hide over there from me he got to his feet but then i saw that the garden door was ajar and it occurred to me that hed tried to reach his house why should your wife be in the surgery alone in the middle of the night surely you missed her at breakfast granville wiped his hand across his mouth i wasnt here for breakfast i had he broke off and ran from the room they could hear him vomiting outside the garden door after a moment he came back in his face still pale his hands fumbling with a handkerchief i couldnt bear to touch her i could see she was dead i just sat here and then somehow bennett was here and i made him look he swallowed hard id been out with a case of congestive heart failure william joyner that was when i got back i came directly to the surgery to look in on hamilton he was gone and i came for you i didnt go to my housei didnt want to disturb mymy wife i saw no reason to worry her with sudden ferocity he twisted the handkerchief in his hands ill kill mallory for you you neednt wait for the hangman they caught him as he lunged for the door and bennett swore as the doctor kicked out at his foot in his frantic effort to break free cursing and fighting with the strength of fury it took them several minutes to settle him in the chair again and this time rutledge held the glass so that granville could drink a little of the whiskey still he managed to spill most of it down his shirt and bennett said testily its not doing much good let it go granville began to cry his eyes red rimmed and unfocused im sorry he said over and over again im sorry rutledge wasnt certain whether he was apologizing to them or to his dead wife for somehow failing her they could hear the outside door opening and closing the constable came to the consulting room door and said its the rector mr putnam shall i let him in inspector rutledge ive turned away all the others as inspector bennett instructed but i thought yes yes bring him here warn him beforehand will you rutledge went to the door as he heard putnam coming down the passage with the constable the two men speaking in subdued voices mr putnam i think dr granville has need of you sir and constable where is the nearest doctor send someone for him if you please directly take my motorcar it will be faster and lock the surgery door before you go we dont want people walking in putnam stepped into the room and went across to the doctor kneeling by his chair this is shocking i havent quitewill you not come with me to the house for a bit he asked gently ill make you a pot of tea and you can leave these gentlemen to their duties granville turned to face him and at first rutledge thought he was going to refuse to go with the rector but then he stood up docilely and walked out of the room without looking back bennett said as soon as he was out of sight well rutledge will you arrest that bastard now or shall i wheres the proof that mallory attacked mrs granville it could have been hamilton bennett stared at him in shocked silence then found his tongue hamilton men with severe head wounds are sometimes muddled if mrs granville startled him in the dark he might have thought she was whoever had attacked him in the first place youre a fool if you believe that rutledge was out of patience stop thinking with your foot and your pride we have a dead woman on our hands and a missing man mallory has two witnesses at that house remember and we have no idea when hamilton went missing at least not yet what was mrs granville doing here at the surgery in the middle of the night if she hadnt let mallory in i dont know what brought her here she could have seen a light and expected to find her husband in the surgery not mallory she could have come to look in on hamilton and he woke up dazed confused and afraid of the shadowy figure standing over his bed when she turned away and went into granvilles office he could have followed her she could even have been on the point of turning up the lamp by the desk to see if her husband was asleep in his chair farradiddle if it was hamilton what did he use for a weapon theres none lying about that i can see it was useless but rutledge was irritated and snapped a good barrister will bring up the possibility we must be there before him bennett would hear none of it youve done nothing since you got here but make excuses for that murderer i told you from the start youd come to protect him not arrest him its plain as the nose on your face did he serve under you is that it rutledge started to reply but thought better of it how was he to explain to bennett that he was striving to be fair to mallory because he had once hated the man with a passion built of despair and aching resentment that strings pulled for one man had done nothing for so many others in greater need had done nothing in fact to save hamish macleod and all those like him a tense silence between the two policemen lengthened rutledge went to stand by the window looking out at the rain forming puddles that became rivers through the back garden any tracks of importance long since washed away bennett sat cushioning his foot as best he could on a stool in front of his chair the smell of whiskey was still strong in the room from where granville had spilled it and mrs granvilles body was a forceful presence even though she was out of sight around the corner of the desk restless with waiting rutledge used the next half hour to search the surgery for himself with particular care given to the room where hamilton had been lying but there was no indication of a scuffle the bedclothes thrown back haphazardly were the only sign of agitation on hamiltons partor haste on mallorys the crown would be hardpressed to say with any certainty what had happened adding to that hamiltons clothing and possessions were missing as well there was a brush of what appeared to be blood only a thin streak on the edge of the door as if hamilton had grasped it to steady himselfor mallory had had difficulty hoisting hamilton over his shoulder in the small space and how could he have carried a dead weight out of the building and as far as the mole hamish said a barrow from the shed then where is it now and why didnt jeremy cornelius see it no if it was mallory he came prepared to make hamiltons disappearance as inconspicuous as possible and so far hes succeeded but hamish was not in the mood to agree what if the lad saw but one man no two hamilton himself stooped in pain his head covered to hide the bandaging but what had possessed him to walk away from casa miranda unless he was too muddled to know what he was doing rutledge went back to the doctors office but bennetts unvoiced condemnation beat against him and he felt as if he would suffocate if he stayed there he had already looked in the closet where medicines and supplies were kept searched the waiting room the other examining rooms scanned the shelves behind the doctors desk reached over it to pull open drawers and close them again thumbed through shelves of files in another closet nothing appeared to be out of order nor had he found anything that might conceivably be the weapon that had killed margaret granville all the same for want of anything better to do he returned to the waiting room dr granvilles medical bag stood forlornly where he must have set it down on his return from joyners house a reminder that medicine was powerless against death rutledge squatted beside it and opened the top inside there were boxes of pills and powders he took out the nearest one an emetic the next he recognized as digitalis a small notebook caught his eye and he opened that to the page where a fountain pen had been clipped lines were scrawled there dated today with the time given as four in the morning describing treatment of one william joyner whose heart was failing thumbing through earlier pages he found that granville kept careful records of patients he saw outside surgery hours joyners name came up a dozen times with a list of symptoms and medicines prescribed treatment instituted he heard brisk footsteps in the passage setting the notebook back in the bag rutledge closed it and stood up a youngish man with prematurely white hair stepped into the room the constable following on his heels said only dr hester sir from middlebury thank you for coming rutledge introduced himself and added this way he led hester to the office hester nodded to bennett who said its dr granvilles wife sir shes there behind the desk i didnt like to ask him to touch her perfectly right hester set his bag on the desktop and knelt beside the body working efficiently and carefully in the small space i daresay the cause of death will be skull fracture from the blow on the back of the head she was probably unconscious before she hit the floor and most likely dead shortly thereafter hard to tell until ive examined her in better lighting shes been dead for several hoursthe body is cool but rigor hasnt set in as far as i can tell shes not been interfered with in any way i should think the body lies as it fell moving very little after that as im sure dr granville is already aware she probably knew nothing from the time she was struck i cant say what instrument was used but if theres nothing out of place here he gestured to the room at large most likely the weapon was taken away by whoever did this a cane bennett asked we saw that the doctor has an assortment of canes and crutches in a closet for all we know one is missing it would depend on the shape of the canes head id guess more round than angular with sufficient force and room enough to bring ones full weight into play a single blow in the right area of the skull could kill rutledge said most of them have a knob at the end for a better grip yes thats the sort i keep on hand hester agreed it couldnt have done this but thats not to say its the only kind granville has used he glanced at the body poor woman it was the first time his professional manner slipped rutledge saw in his minds eye the rounded breast of the swan on miss esterleys cane then it wouldnt have mattered whether the killer was a man or a woman given the right weapon probably not hester got to his feet thats all i can give you here you might have a look at those tongs by the hearth though i dont expect they were used unwieldy id say rutledge said ive examined them no hair no blood unless they were wiped clean bennett looked around the room as hester had done hoping to see it through new eyes the silver candlesticks a pair of carved bookends in the shape of globes europe and asia on one side the americas on the other a paperweight in the form of a frog a display of early airplane models in bottles the tiny canvas bodies and thin wooden struts too delicate to survive use as a weapon even if the glass didnt shatter hester said following his gaze apparently one of granvilles cousins flew the damned things in france and before he was killed he made models of various types of craft for his parents i expect no one wanted them in the house as a reminder either of you know what a knobkerrie is used in africa for killing like a prehistoric club actually with a round knob at the end very efficient at caving in skulls ive seen them my grandfather spent some time in south africa and up the western coast he earned more as a doctor than as a prospector and came home as poor as he left tells you something doesnt it and who else had been in south africa certainly not mallory he could see the thought flit across bennetts face but miss esterley had grown up in kenya it doesnt serve to guess rutledge said finally if its not here were wasting time a simple hammer brought with the killer who can say but that argued premeditation and pointed to mallory yes possible hester took a deep breath all right if youre finished here help me get her to my motorcar theres a proper canvas carrier bennett if your constable will fetch it in ill have more to tell you when i know more when the body of mrs granville had been removed rutledge went to the house where the rector was keeping the doctor company bennett stumped after him on his single crutch trying to keep pace the constable was once more set to guard the surgery his young face already older in the watery noon light there was a fresh pot of tea waiting for them and a plate of biscuits that putnam had found somewhere set out on a pretty floral plate granville was sitting at the table staring vacantly out at the rain his mind clearly somewhere else bennett refused the offer of a chair and leaned against the wall with his teacup balanced in one hand rutledge found himself thinking that mrs granville wouldnt have cared for people making free with her fine china and would have worried about the cup in bennetts fist rutledge took his tea and drank a little of it to please putnam but then set it down and walked through the house looking about him but touching nothing on the first floor he found the bedrooms and in what appeared to be mrs granvilles room the coverlet had been thrown back as if she had expected to return to her bed from the window of her room she could look down on the rear of the surgery and the back door to the garden an interesting thought was that the way that hamilton had left either under his own power or over someones shoulder the door set ajar might also have been a diversion or mrs granville could have left it open nothing else was in disarray but there was a light film of face powder spilled across the top of the dressing table although mrs granvilles hairbrush was placed next to her comb with tidy precision rutledge wondered if she was farsighted and failed to notice the powder there which would mean she could undoubtedly see as far as the surgery door why had she risen from her bed and gone to the surgery hamish said she thought she heard the doctor return but he didna come into the house after a time she went to find him because she feared hamilton was worse and granville might need her yes it could be that he stood there in the middle of the room it seemed cold as if the living part of it had died with its owner the wrong place at the wrong time he went back down the stairs to find bennett waiting for him in the hall well im not up to walking about to no purpose nothing bennett returned to the kitchen but putnam waylaid rutledge in the passage i came to the surgery this morning to speak to hamilton or at least sit with him for a time he said in a low voice i never expected this none of us did least of all granville damn it i warned him to find someone to watch over hamilton and there might have been two dead instead of one putnam replied quietly whats become of him hamilton granville told me hes nowhere to be found thats hard to believe god knows where he is where could he go under his own power and if someone took him away where is he now thrown into the sea from a headland left to die where we havent thought to look carried far from here and the body hidden rutledges own sense of failure was burning inside him along with the fear that mrs granvilles death lay at his door either way taken or escaped he could well be dead by now id rather believe mrs hamilton spirited him out of here mrs hamilton would have had no need to kill that poor woman yes thats true but someone else might have come found hamilton gone and taken his frustration out on mrs granville rutledge looked at putnam thats a very perceptive suggestion but ive been to the house and i cant convince myself hes there hamish reminded him ye didna search the womans room it was true but to force his way in would have brought mallory up the stairs and what then his instincts told him that mrs hamilton had probably considered such a solution at some point then failed to act on it shed have needed a motorcar or the dogcart and with either one she risked mallory storming out to stop her what did felicity hamilton really want or to put it another way which of the two men tied to her emotionally did she love he deliberately changed the direction of the conversation you suggested in the nave of your church that i might wish to speak to a miss cole where do i find her i cant tell you that im afraid i only know of her because matthew hamilton spoke of her that one time he described her as the most honorable and the most stubborn person hed ever known an odd compliment to pay a lady youd have thought it stayed with me what hed said i had the feeling it was very important to him somehow the most honorable womanin what sense and felicity hamilton hadnt recognized the name theres one other possibility rutledge continued theres a cottage just west of here where restons brother freddy lived for some time putnams eyebrows flew up but that cottage was derelict and if it went over with the landslip this morning there will be nothing left but splintered wood no one could have foreseen that could they and freddy reston drowned not far from where hamilton was discovered on the strand putnam clicked his tongue as a matter of fact the finding was that hed fallen asleep there drunk as a lord and choked on his own vomit its the family that prefers to tell everyone he drowned freddy restons death could have given someone the idea of leaving hamilton there by the tideline and later it could also have occurred to someone that the cottage where reston had lived stood empty im not overly fond of coincidences but surely you arent suggesting that george restonand what reason could he have that ridiculous clay figure is hardly grounds for murdering a man for all any of us know rutledge told him smiling ruefully hamiltons relationship with reston could have gone far beyond the original disagreement he stopped himself from saying anything about restons past history of violence but did add george reston is a man of temper youve seen it and so have i yes alas its true still a good man underneath was that what he truly felt or was it only a priests need to believe that no man could be wholly evil as rutledge started to walk on putnam said you arent going to be foolish enough to take a boat around to the slip in this weather are you youll be lucky to reach the slip without swamping much less be able to clamber about whats left of the cottage rutledge stopped and said over his shoulder yes well perhaps someone was lucky the question is who would you mind if i asked dr granville to come with me to the rectory i dont care for the idea of leaving him here with so many reminders of his wife everywhere he looks hell be better able to cope with them later remembering the threat granville had made against mallory rutledge said by all means id ask bennett as well if i were you putnam smiled indeed he said as if he had felt the tension between the two policemen bennett waiting for them in the kitchen agreed at once to the suggestion with the caveat that he didnt think granville would leave his surgery but the persuasive rector was able to convince dr granville to stay in the rectory for a few days away from here until you can come to grips with all thats happened granville got to his feet looking around as if he barely recognized his own kitchen its raining he said ill need my coat and my bag he was less pale now as the nausea faded but his features were slack with exhaustion and he had asked twice to rutledges knowledge what had become of his wifes body as if hed failed to take in the answer the first time indeed whatever was proposed to him was accepted without question and rutledge thought if we asked him to walk into the sea he might well do it rutledge found the doctors coat and helped him into it then handed him his hat at that point the trained medical man came to the fore and granville said frowning i have hours this morning and will joyner is quite ill i intended to look in on him again this afternoon your patients will be taken care of putnam said soothingly if theres anyone in dire need like joyner we can send again for dr hester ill ask miss trining to post a note on your door and people can come to her to be sorted out shes very trustworthy yes granville stood there as if unconvinced bennett said best go with him sir at least for the present when putnam and granville had left for the rectory bennett turned to rutledge well then what do you expect to do now weve hamilton missing and mrs granville dead rutledge considered taking the boat around the headland and then dismissed it the rain was heavier although the wind shifting to the south was considerably warmer he said now is there a gate from the back garden to the street behind the house in fact there is look you can just glimpse it where the ash tree overhangs it he led rutledge to the window and pointed ornamental not meant to keep people out the granvilles had a little dog once i expect thats why they put in the fence you can also see that the distance from the surgery door to the gate is not that great whats on the other side a lane used to bring horses and carriages round from the stables rutledge stood looking out the window his back half to bennett apparently granville didnt see fit to lock his doors which tells me the gate wasnt locked either i dont think most people lock up even at night why should they but granville knew hamilton could still be in danger he should have taken a few precautions he remembered what putnam had saidthat there would have been two dead in the surgery not one bennett ought to have posted a constable at the door but hed complained of being shorthanded you cant blame him more than hes already blamed himself there was a nurse set to come tonight she was to sleep in the room next to hamiltons he shook his head she was a good woman mrs granville youd be hardpressed to find anyone who disagreed with that the wrong place at the wrong timerutledge sighed ill drive you wherever youd like to go for the moment theres nothing more we can do here he told bennett and i should have put a call in to london an hour ago i wont argue with that my foot has all the imps of hell pounding it ever since the doctor kicked it give me an hour to rest it and ill be waiting for you to come for me youll do well to get out of those wet clothes while you can when he had rid himself of bennett instead of returning to the duke of monmouth rutledge made his way to mallorys cottage outside of hampton regis it wasnt very hard to find just down a short lane off the main road leading inland there were no near neighbors if anyone had been inside since mallory left in such haste there was no sign of it the rooms were tidy the bed made with military precision the kitchen clear of dirty dishes but there was an empty whiskey bottle on the table by the best chair in the parlor and a glass beside it with dregs in the bottom the air still smelled faintly of a long night of drinking as if mallory had never gone to bed drowning his sorrows hamish said ye ken theres no witness to call him a liar it would be difficult to prove otherwise and this cottage was the perfect place to conceal hamilton alive dead or about to be killed rutledge had been too busy searching the house above the harbor to think of coming here after that mrs granvilles death had changed the course of the day if bennett or one of his men had discovered hamilton here it would serve to condemn mallory by the same token even the constable outside casa miranda would have to swear he hadnt seen anyone leave the house hamish said it isna sae perfect a place then not if the intent was to see mallory hang rutledge walked around the outside of the cottage searching for tracks or indications that anyone had tried to use a shovel in the wet earth it was only for thoroughness he knew hed find nothing he drove next to miss esterleys house she owed matthew hamilton for the care given to her after her accident and he might have felt he could turn to her miss esterley received him in the small parlor concern on her face gossip is rampant inspector mr hamilton missing possibly dead im not particularly happy living here alone with murderers about i can sympathize he answered taking the chair she indicated across from her but theres nothing i can tell you that will offer comfort which says she told him bluntly you have no idea who is behind this madness i was hoping he said keeping his voice neutral as he glanced toward the cane at her side that matthew hamilton might have felt he could turn to you in his time of need the beautifully wrought silver swan seemed to mock him the way the head was drawn back the breast thrust forward under it it was possible he thought but only just she was staring at him are you suggesting that im hiding matthew here in my house im suggesting that if he asked you to help him leave hampton regis until hes recovered sufficiently to face his enemy whoever it might be you would at least entertain his request her face was cold i havent spoken to him for more than a week and then only as we left the sundaymorning ser vice i cant imagine why he would turn to me he may have thought you were a friend that stopped her short for a moment she looked away from him her gaze finding the titles of books in a shelf along the wall under the windows i should have thought he would go straight to his wife it was as if the admission cost her dearly you know he couldnt you know he wasnt a match for stephen mallory not in his condition if mallory was the one who attacked him monday morning hamilton would surely wait until he was well enough to challenge the man when miss esterley turned back to him there were tears in her eyes the man i care about would have risked everything for her sake the shining knight to the rescue of the damsel in distress he wondered if that was how she really saw hamilton or if it was her own disappointment speaking the fact that he hadnt come to this house instead then you didnt know him well it would have been foolhardy it was said gently without condemnation youre wrong i can tell you that if matthew hamilton was alive and in his right mind his only thought would have been felicity no matter what the cost and if he didnt go to casa miranda to her then hes dead the tears began to fall then and she wiped them away angrily when i heard that dr granville couldnt find him my heart turned to stone i refuse to believe hes dead but in my heart i know he must be someone came back to stop him from telling what he knows knew then why not kill him in his bed there in the surgery why go to the trouble of removing him and taking the chance of being seen doing it for the very reason youre here you dont know what has happened to him and youll likely never know he handed her his handkerchief and she took it without thanking him trying to staunch the humiliating flow im not in love with him i never was but i valuevalued himand i never believed i would lose him like this i thoughti felt he would be there a friend for many years and i was comforted by that belief rutledge sat there his mouth dry unable to think of words of consolation she had put the case for hamiltons death very succinctly and he knew that whatever she might say about felicity and another womans husband she thought of herself as under hamiltons protection too she went on relentlessly you dont know what its like living alone for the rest of your life the man you were intending to marry dead on a battlefield youve never seen and will never visit you dont know how he died or when he died or even why he died whether he was screaming in pain or unconscious or bleeding badly and left on the wire you picture it in your mind night after night and try to reach out to him to put an end to not knowing trying to tell yourself what youd have said to him if you could have held him at the end but theres nothing left only a polite letter from an officer on the heels of the official notification and after that silence and emptiness as if hed been swallowed up by the sea and no one knew she choked off the rest i understand he began but susan esterley said harshly no you cant you couldnt possibly rutledge left soon afterward and it wasnt until he was on the street by the motorcar that hamish said shed lie for him if he asked her to and rutledge realized that shed never answered his questions except with a question of her own he swore as he remembered that hed also planned to ask her about miss cole when rutledge rang up london from the duke of monmouth inn it wasnt to speak to gibson at the yard his instinct warned him off reminding him of the cold reception the last time hed spoken to the sergeant and hed also be obliged to report the fact that hamilton was missing and that there had been a second attack this one ending in murder just now he needed time to think before chief superintendent bowles summoned him in a blazing fury the call was to his sister frances was surprised to hear from him i thought youd been sent to coventry she said how is the weather along the south coast wretched but warmer if the sun comes out well have a taste of spring she laughed then bring it back with you london is as dreary as london can be i need information about someone who was in the foreign office hes retired now to england but his last posting was to malta one matthew hamilton hed expected her to tell him that the name was familiar but it would take several hours to track down whatever it was he wanted to learn instead she said but you must know him as well he was at that party at melinda crawfords house the one where you broke out in measles and had to be carried home mother was quite upset with you for making her miss a brilliant dinner i dont remember much of that weekend hed been twelve and wretchedly sick a long time agoeighteen years you played croquet with him and won it was his turn to laugh that was matthew hamilton of course it was good god i thought him quite ancient i expect hes only fortyeight now and still an attractive man i must say i saw photographs of him when he was at versailles they were in the newspapers for all of a week he looked quite distinguished in that company of ancient men even as a girl i envied the women who played tennis with him but i had my revenge you know he took me in to dinner either because he felt sorry for me abandoned and alone or more likely melinda put him up to it i was elated my dinner companions were generally callow boys with spots who either refused to speak to me or bored me to tears with their cricket exploits i quite forgave you the measles there was a pause ian why are you asking about him please dont tell me hes dead no a person of interest in the inquiry that brought me here he said evading the question his wife is many years younger and cant tell me very much about his past has he killed someone her voice was tight i refuse to believe he could do such a thing the fact is hes gone missing there was a silence on the other end of the line then frances said all right youd rather not tell me more so i wont pry what do you want to know why he should have disappeared more to the point has there been gossip about him most especially about his career he wasnt very popular after expressing an opinion about the peace conference at versailles hed been on the ambassadors staff in turkey before the war and as i remember in germany even earlier than that the general view was that he should have been consulted but his position wasnt in accord with the intent of the french at the talks rather like that man lawrence and his arab connections matthew hamilton had friends in turkey and in germany who were pushing for a different outcome i daresay he was in the right but no one cared to hear it and so he chose to retire and return to england not under a cloud not precisely a cloud but some very important people were not pleased with him and he knew very well what that would mean to his career or perhaps he was disillusioned or they threatened him with paraguay there are ways of getting even without actually sending him home in disgrace i dont think hed have cared for a south american posting after europe and his interests lay there of course what interests he liked to poke about in the old ruins a way to pass the time at a guess and if one lives somewhere long enough its natural to start to wonder whats outside ones window so to speak remember barton wallace who got caught up in those strange poles in canada and wrote about what the indians were carving on them barton wallace had been a friend of his fathers sent to vancouver to handle the wallace familys pacific trade for their firm while there hed written a treatise on indian totems and it proved immensely popular yes wallace sent mother a copy of it one boxing day well i expect a man like matthew hamilton spent many of his holidays traveling to places hed heard local people talking about and word got out that he was there it was rumored in the markets that hed buy objects he liked without asking either provenance or source of course he couldnt dig himself but thievery is rampant and important much less unknown sites cant be guarded all the time such people sell real finds or competent fakes for whatever price they can ask he sent melinda crawford the loveliest little marble figure of the god pan dancing she was pleased sure it was real and put it in that curio cabinet of hers when he left turkey there was some talk about his baggage being searched but nothing came of it and there have been other incidents where he was stopped by customs but nothing of value was ever found part of it was probably no more than bloodymindedness by the customs people but once talk starts it tends to cling or he thought a wellplaced bribe had done its work and the objects in the hamilton drawing room hardly looked like replicas sometimes quality spoke to the eye even when one didnt have the training or knowledge to back it up a rare skill a touch of elegance or excellence that surely hamilton had recognized too theres luck as well hamish reminded him but it didnt signify there were too many pieces frances was adding add to that the fact that matthew hamilton seldom came home to england on leave it isnt surprising that people jumped to the conclusion he had an ulterior motive for his travels was there a reason for staying away friends abroad that sort of thing he could picture her holding the receiver as one shoulder lifted in an expressive shrug ian i dont know i dont expect anyone does except matthew himself i was only ten my dear i didnt know what secrets a young man would have would melinda know did she stay in close touch with him you must ask her that there was another pause and then she said darling is anything wrong you soundi dont knowrather down she waited for him to answer and then added you cant hide it not from me which he should have thought of before he telephoned her he told himself with a sigh one of the people involved in the business that brought me here had served under me in france for a short time it brings back memories id rather not have raised yes i understand that might be difficult but youre going to be all right arent you he made himself laugh for her sake if im not bowles will have my liver she didnt press but he found himself thinking that it was easier to talk to stephen mallory about the war than to his own sister it was something he hadnt expected this isolation at first hed believed it was his own need his own desperation that locked the war in silence a vain hope for time and peace in which to heal now he realized that somehow those who had served in france and elsewhere knew a world that couldnt be shared how could he tell his sisteror even his father if the elder rutledge was still alivewhat had been done on bloody ground far from home it would be criminal to fill their minds with scenes that no one should have to remember no one frances was on the point of signing off when he thought of something he hadnt brought up do you know a miss cole who might have been a friend or relative of hamiltons her name has come up here in connection with his but no one seems to be able to tell me where to find her cole do you have a first name sadly no its not an uncommon name a proverbial needle in the proverbial haystack surely sergeant gibson or someone at the yard can locate her for you theyve got their hands full just now and i dont have enough information about her yet to warrant taking up the yards time they ought to be pleased with themselves at the moment theyve taken someone into custody for those wretched killings in green park the newspapers are calling it masterly police work who did they say who it was he asked urgently i dont think a name has been released yet gentle god he could feel hamish in the back of his mind thundering like the guns in france the walls of the telephone closet seemed to press in on him was it fields theyd taken into custody had inspector phipps come to suspect the same man in his own roundabout fashion or had constable waddington to shield himself from charges that he was courting while on duty ignored rutledges instructions and reported fields to the yard he felt a strong sense of personal responsibility for dragging fields into the search and told himself that phipps had been thorough it was chief superintendent bowles pressed by his own superiors to bring in the killer who was not always reliable in drawing conclusions by the same token what if someone else had been taken into custody in error and the yard knew nothing about fields but rutledge had been ordered off that case in no uncertain terms it had nothing to do with him now aye hamish retorted duty before conscience its what got me shot frances was saying ian are you still there ian yes just digesting the news id been dealing with the green park inquiry just before i was sent down here if theres a name given will you let me know he told frances how to reach him and then rang off he sat there for a moment trying to reorder his thoughts melinda crawfords wideranging correspondence spanned continents and if hamilton had kept in touch with anyone in england during his years abroad it might well have been with her she had traveled most of her life and knew the world as few did her mind was razor sharp even in age her wit was dry and entertaining and her charm hadnt diminished with time he himself had treasured her letters in france reading them over and over because they took him away from the war for a little while rutledge stood up and stepped into the passage considering what to say to her she would demand to know what his interest in hamilton was and she could spot a wellintentioned lie before hed finished uttering it the respite from the cramped confines of the telephone closet was a relief and he went as far as the front windows of the inn flexing his shoulders one glance at the sky showed him it was now much lighter as though the worst of the squalls had passed if he was going to risk taking a boat out to the landslip he must do it while he could melinda crawford could wait miss cole could wait he had to know what was in the cottage that had gone down with the cliff face if hamilton was deadand rutledge was beginning to feel he wasthen there were two murders to deal with he set out briskly for the harbor to look for the fisherman who had been cleaning his catch earlier hed gone but another man was standing on the mole staring out at the sea rutledge came to stand beside him and said it appears to be a little calmer out there the man turned aye i was thinking the same he looked at rutledge youre the man from london yes rutledge the man nodded perkins he said in response his weathered face deeply wrinkled from exposure to the sea and the sun it was difficult to tell his age but rutledge put him down as close to fifty do you have a boat mr perkins that i do you arent of a mind to take her out are you i dont let my boat to any man i was thinking of hiring you to row me out to where i could have a good look at the landslip this morning its a crazy thought what for im sure it is nevertheless i have a sound reason we dont know if anyone was in that cottage when it went over and dr granville is missing one of his patients hed be a fool to take himself out to the cottage it was derelict before and will be matchwood now a policeman cant write that in his report rutledge answered its mr hamilton youre looking for he nodded its not a thing hed do i dont know him well mind you but weve talked a time or two he was used to the sea serving as he did on that island malta hed take a boat out of that harbor just to see it from the sea and then sail back through he said it was built by knights who knew what they were about and even the turks couldnt take it by water i understand the fortifications are formidable rutledge agreed did you talk about anything else he said there were ruins there that were older than the pyramids i had a hard time believing it but he said it was true and i never knew him to be a liar will you take me out today if it isnt safe i wont press but i need to see for myself that theres no one there therell be no one there now perkins said darkly rutledge waited after several minutes of silence had passed perkins nodded youll need rain gear if youre to stay dry do you have any i could borrow youre a fair bit taller than me but my sons things ought to fit a little large mind you but theyll keep you dry do you have wellingtons then it was a small boat her name boldly painted on the prowbellathe mast useless in such variable winds but two men could just manage her pulling out from the mole against the drag of the current then making for a point under the headland from which they could feel the tug of the current back to the shore even from there they could see the raw spill of the landslip its heavy soil flowing like a river to the water taking with it clumps of grass young trees and what appeared to be a chimney sticking up at an odd angle among a scatter of bricks it was a hard run to get closer and rutledge was sweating heavily inside his rain gear by the time they got there but the waves hitting them at the wrong angle left the bottom of the boat awash and his sleeves wet to the wrist water spilling down his head and under his collar and reaching as far as his back as he twisted and turned for a better view and called instructions to perkins in due course they were within good range of the clumped and riddled earth it looked out of place reaching into the sea as if it still belonged to the high reaches of land above and had lost its way the eddies about it were muddy sucking at this foreign bit of land as if hungry then coming back for more larger chunks sinking as he watched the cottage was a ruin beams and walls only so much lumber now without form or structure a cabinet peeked from under an edge of roof and a small tin washbasin was caught on a rake banging like a cheap bell against the handle a table leg floated out to them and then was pushed forlornly back again a lumpy pillow lay like a dead bird against part of a door as if it had been caught in the storm and taken shelter there only part of the chimney surprisingly intact spoke of what the debris had once been rotted wood to start with it wont last long out here perkins told him shouting over the noisy waves lashing at the coastline this is as near as i can go or well be aground on what we cant see and theres another squall on the horizon look there rutledge turned to see but calculated there was still time is that ground firm enough for me to walk on if it is i need to go closer what for you cant tell floor from roof and if theres any man in there hes long since buried beneath whatever fell on top of him as the lot went over it was true it would take men digging with shovels to find matthew hamiltons body in that morass and even they couldnt do it before the water took it away for good but he had to be sure there would be doubts uncertainties no body to allow the police to prove matthew hamilton was dead or that murder had been done clever barristers and clever doubts carefully placed unless his bones washed ashore somewhere and were found then identified they couldnt wait for that matthew hamilton victim and witness get me as close as you can and hold her steady ill give it a try did living in londons fogs turn your wits perkins asked sharply im not about to risk my boat on a fools errand look at the water man its clear just over there if you can reach the foot of the cliff there i can make it to that large rock and then move across to firmer ground can you see where im pointing perkins growled deep in his throat and rutledge startled at the similarity to the sound that hamish made sometimes turned quickly and almost swamped them here you idiot policeman or not youll watch what youre about perkins told him harshly in the end rutledge got his way at a price and perkins did what he could to hold the boat steady enough for him to reach the boulder and then claw himself up on the flat surface it was slick underfoot and he thought ill never make it back to the boat above him the high rise of land loomed and as he stepped across to the earth he heard pebbles skittering down like a warning that one false move could bring another twenty yards of solid ground down on his head breaking up and burying him as it came crashing toward him but nothing happened and he made the leap to the landslip his feet sinking above the ankles in the soft pliant earth laboring to bring one foot out and then another he wallowed like a drunkard toward the first of the shards of lumber that littered the ground many of the bits sticking straight out of the mud others buried and only recognizable when his boots struck something solid underfoot it was a wildgoose chase hamish was telling him roundly and how yell manage to clamber back into yon boat again god alone kens but he was here now and the only thing to do was go forward casting a glance back at the squall line he wondered if perkins would abandon him if it came to a choice between the boat and the stubborn fool who had brought them out here he struggled on searching with his eyes his hands busy keeping his balance the footing was so treacherous he found a length of door framing and tried to use it as a cane only to find that it sank too deep and nearly had him stumbling in its wake sticks of furniture a rusted pot a vasemiraculously in one piece the lilacs on its surface a small bit of color in the shambleslay among the ruins as perkins had predicted rutledge could barely tell what room or what part of the structure lay where the whole smashed to nothing like an iceberg the debris went deep only a portion of it showing on the surface where he walked he rescued the small vase and tucked it in a coat pocket intending to take it back to perkins as a souvenir bending over invited disaster again and he slipped and fell swearing against a protruding beam and part of the chimney corner for an instant he could feel the earth under his body shift and he thought this was not a very wise decision with a fatalism born of long practice hamish was after him urging him back to the boat telling him to take the warning seriously after a moment of perfect stillness he could sense that all movement had stopped nothing more was going to happen at least not now and he shoved himself upright testing his weight with extreme gentleness just where he stood it was then that he saw something on the far side of the chimney caught in what appeared to be the splat of a chair back with great care he shifted himself to one side and then found a length of planking wide enough to use as a footbridge to the other side of the chimney and then another added to that walking on the slippery boards he kept his gaze fixed to where his feet were set and he didnt look up again until hed come to the far end of his improvised bridge what hed seen was there in front of him a wad of bloody bandaging the dark red already turned to a running pink in the rain but bandaging it was a doctors work he thought to himself he reached out for it and in the nick of time stopped remembering what hed risked retrieving the vase move his weight a bare few inches more and the plank behind him would dip like a board over a pool sending him headlong and facefirst into the smothering earth just the fear of it made him shiver like a man in fever but he caught himself and took a deep breath shutting out the voice roaring now in his mind hed been buried alive once in france it didnt bear thinking of and this time there would be no body lying above him giving him a precious pocket of air to keep him alive hamishs bodylong since rotted to bones in the rains of the somme valley to one side he saw a rung from the broken chair or perhaps its brother and carefully squatted down until he could retrieve it though his feet slipped and nearly launched him where he most feared to go catching himself again he used the muscles in his thighs to bring himself upright once more and felt them burn with the effort he had himself under control now and gingerly using the chair rung as a tool he slowly brought the length of bandage toward him until he could grasp it safely and shove it inside his coat water and all matthew hamilton had been here or had been brought here but whether hed gone over the cliff with the cottage or not god alone knew there was no way human agency could answer that over the next five minutes rutledge thought he might not make it back to the bella after all it took enormous physical effort to reach the boat climb up on the rock and lower himself onto the thwart once more by that time his thigh muscles quivered from fatigue in the cold air alternately burning and tightening in spasms youre a fair fool the man shouted at him with resignation id not have brought you out if id guessed i should have left you there a lucky fool rutledge replied with what little breath he could spare in fact it had taken far more than his share of luck to cross that unstable ground back to where perkins was struggling to keep the bella in the eddies off the rock the words were hardly out of his mouth when another five feet of earth came roaring down toward them missing the wooden stern where he was sitting by no more than a few yards and sending them bouncing like a ball across the impact wave for an instant he thought the swell would surely swamp them theyd taken on a dangerous amount of water and rutledge who had been using an oar to shove off hard from the rock face swung it inboard as quickly as he could to begin bailing like a madman in an effort to lighten the load they were carrying but perkins was nothing if not an experienced seaman and he kept them afloat until the waves had subsided and there was only the sea itself to fight then the long hard pull to the mole began one eye to the weather the other on their destination every time rutledge looked up hampton regis seemed to be no closer than it was before while the squall line was bearing down on them faster than they could row it was he told himself going to be a very near thing and very possibly theyd lose the race but miraculously the rain held off until they had reached the street that ran along the harbor rutledge welcomed it then to wash off the worst of the muddy earth that clung to him like a skin he was glad to rid himself of his gear at the small house where perkins lived and feel the cool air strike him as he walked back to the police station perkins hadnt asked what hed found but refused to accept the small vase rutledge had given him along with the exorbitant sum owed him thats an unlucky thing that vase he said it survived rutledge pointed out that should make it lucky im a superstitious man mr rutledge i thank you for the thought but im not happy with looking at that bit of clay and wondering why it was not crushed by what it endured he looked up at rutledge with sober eyes what the sea wants it takes in the end itud pounded that thing to white dust and then washed it away as nothing i dont want it to claim me in its place but why rutledge found himself thinking if hamilton had been on the sea so many times had the sea waited until hed returned to england to claim him what gods of clay or wood had he disturbed that came after him so great a distance the sea had nearly drowned hamilton three days ago but it had been cheated of its prey perhaps it hadnt forgotten shaking off his black mood rutledge turned his mind to what he must tell inspector bennett the police station was a beehive of activity bennett was in a sober mood i waited half an hour for you where the hell have you been he demanded looking rutledge over crawling through a farmers field ill be bound close enough ive bennett interrupted him the chief constable was here i dont know who told him what has happenedill wager you it was miss trining damn her eyesbut he has given us twentyfour hours to find out where hamilton is and who killed mrs granville hes not a man to be crossed the chief constable weve got one and twenty hours left its likely that hamilton is dead i went out to the landslip and this was caught on the back of a chair that had been splintered by the fall he held out the wet bandage and bennett stared at it as if it could bite him good god i cant think of anyone else who might have left it there we must show it to granville to see if he recognizes his handiwork then we should have a talk with mr reston reston couldnt have killed the doctors wife whatever youre suggesting theres no sound reason for it unless she got in his way when he came for hamilton but why should he want to harm hamilton you wont make me believe its because of some bits of clay on a shelf at the mans house mr reston may be a fanatic for religion but that doesnt make him a murderer there was a man in london he assaulted restons victim didnt press charges so theres no record of it and hes got a violent nature still bennett was already fitting his crutch under his shoulder and getting to his feet have it your way then but youll be proved wrong i wont walk there i cant ill fetch my motorcar give me five minutes it was twenty minutes before he was back again having taken the time to clean himself up he carried his trousers down to the kitchen to be dried and pressed asked for a length of oiled cloth for the bandages and persuaded the young girl in the pantry to make him a sandwich from pickle last nights beef and a little cheese though she protested that the luncheon ham would be ready in no more than a quarter of an hour bennett came out and climbed into the passengers side just as a strong beam of sunlight broke through the clouds and swept the rooftops and wet streets with a warm and brilliant light bennett looked up at it and said we could do with a shift in the weather i smell pickle rutledge didnt answer he put the motorcar into gear and drove to the reston house mr reston was at home they were told by the maid but was feeling a touch of dyspepsia please tell him inspector rutledge and inspector bennett are here on police business and require a word with him well wait until he can join us she still appeared to be doubtful and rutledge could see that she was on the point of refusing them admittance he stepped forward and she retreated a step he moved into the entry where does mr reston receive his business acquaintances well wait for him there the maid reluctantly showed them to a small study where books on law and finance lined the shelves behind the broad polished desk and other calfbound titles stood in orderly rows across the room considerably older works on the romans the kingdom of wessex and the history of the southwest of england on one of the spines the name reston was set out in gold lettering rutledge took it from the shelf and opened it the title was great sermons for the mind and the reston who had written it was either the father or grandfather of the present owner from what he could see the sermons were long and ponderous their heavy victorian righteous ness apparent in their arguments for ser vice and duty as a gentlemans responsibility to god and england and his less fortunate fellow men rutledge turned pages at random reading a line here and there the strong victorian voice spoke through words that stared up at him an upright man whatever his calling will address his business affairs with the same honesty he will show his family to do other is to be guilty of a grievous fault that will lead him down the road to corrupt practices god resides in the heart and a cruel heart is godless a man to be feared for the harm he will do to others in his wickedness servants must be led to the path of godliness and it is the duty of the head of every household to see to their training up in faith and to provide the guidance and example that will set their feet firmly on the way to gods grace children will obey their fathers in all things and show he got no further the door behind him opened and george reston stood there on the threshold that is a very valuable book youre holding inspector rutledge ill ask you to set it back carefully in its place reston looked tired or ill as if he had had an unsettled digestionor a long and arduous night his face paler than usual was set in harsh lines and he seemed to be holding to the doors frame to steady himself then he let it go and stepped into the room i cant think why you are here but i have been told of mrs granvilles death its a disgrace that with two policemen in my study we are still no closer to learning why she was attacked bennett opened his mouth then closed it again rutledge thought he was biting his tongue he himself said i understand that the cottage that went over the cliff in this mornings downpour belonged to you raising his brows in surprise reston answered yes inspector bennett could have confirmed that without disturbing me and that your brother lived there for a time before hiseruntimely death thats true as well he was not a worldly man my brother i was forced to see to his welfare more than once in the end i kept him in hampton regis under my eye what does this have to do with the murder of mrs granville pray has anyone else used this cottage since he drowned restons mouth twitched at the last word certainly not freddy lived there because he preferred to shame me he could have been perfectly comfortable here with us but he chose to make it appear that i was derelict in my duty to him i let it go he seemed to find the isolation to his liking and it calmed him there was a sense of being wronged in his voice the good brother taking the blame for the bad brothers ill treatment of himself hamish who had been quiet for some time said aye a drunkard is no a very easy man to deal with two men sharing the same blood and as different as night and day had the writer of the sermons succeeded with one of the brothers and failed the other or had reston been the one to drive his brother to drink rutledge found himself thinking that reston was not a pleasant man to deal with twisted in his belief that what he knew and what he had been taught set him above others a man of limited intellect perhaps who had struggled where his brother might have soared and made his tormentor pay for it the rest of his life as if reston had listened to rutledges judgment he said forcibly he was the favorite you know my grandfather adored him but he had no backbone and he failed in life because of it i did my best to protect and shield him and i did my best to bring him around to his duty no man can say that i didnt he turned and glared at bennett you will confirm that if you please inspector its true bennett answered the whole of hampton regis can tell you as much satisfied reston said and if you have finished with the subject of my brother rutledge said i went out to the landslip by sea and in the ruins of the cottage i found a fresh bandage it appears that matthew hamilton was either taken there or went there sometime in the earlymorning hours there is no other explanation for bandaging to be found there reston seemed to fold in on himself as if his stomach had failed him he crossed the room and sat down behind the desk his head in his hands i have had nothing to do with matthew hamiltons assault or his disappearance why must you drag my brother into this business your brother drowned mr reston only a few yards from where matthew hamilton nearly died the cottage is your property hamilton was in that cottage if the bandages prove to be his if you arent responsible tell me if anyone else had access to it borrowed it used it or could have unlocked the door the door was never locked the cottage was falling down what purpose would locking it serve i daresay half the homeowners in hampton regis fail to lock their doors at night we are not a violent place he lifted his eyes to rutledges face drawing on some inner strength that seemed to rise and sustain him i will not be badgered in this fashion i have a solicitor who will speak to you on my behalf good day inspector rutledge stood there for a moment judging his man i am not accusing you of anything mr reston but perhaps it would be wise to account for your hours last night between eleven oclock and this morning at first light i was at home in my bed as a decent man should be the words were spat out anger barely controlled and your wife can confirm that i will not have my wife dragged into a murder inquiry shes delicate and ill not have her upset you can accept my word as a gentleman but that would not stand up in a courtroom rutledge let it go he had a feeling that mrs reston might well tell him whatever it was her husband wished whether it was true or a lie delicate might well be translated as browbeaten bennett said surprising rutledge i have no choice but to ask her sir if you will summon her the chief constable will insist he was here earlier and made plain the fact that he expected full cooperation with the police in the end reston sent for his wife and after five or six minutes she came into the room henrietta reston wasnt what rutledge had expected a tall slender woman with reddish gold hair that seemed to shine in the dimness of the room and blue eyes that were intense in a long aristocratic face she greeted her husbands guests with courtesy and waited for an explanation rutledge put the question to her choosing his words carefully mrs reston as a matter of course we are asking people where they were last night and into this morning from perhaps shortly before midnight until dawn in the hope that someone might have looked out a window and can help us with our search for mr hamilton reston began to speak then fell silent waiting his gaze on his wifes face my husband wasnt well in the night inspector i read for a little while worried about him but after a time i fell asleep and didnt wake up until the children came in to say good morning i dont remember looking out my window and you cared for your husband in the night she smiled we have separate bedrooms inspector but i could hear him moving about pacing the floor between visits to his dressing room if thats what you want to know it was a very restless night for him she turned as she said the last words her eyes going directly to her husband a message passed between them but it wasnt rutledge would have taken his oath a message of collusion it was daring him to contradict her outside bennett followed rutledge down the walk to the motorcar he said as if continuing a conversation begun in the reston house its an odd marriage if you want the truth the money is hers but hes built his empire and he doesnt let her forget it it was the first time bennett had been so honest about reston and rutledge turned to look at him youre saying that there are strains on the marriage there was talk that shed been in love with his brother first i dont know the truth of that the fact remains she came of a better class you can see it for yourself miss trining has kept her tongue off mrs reston that will tell you which way the winds blow a better class but no beauty except for her hair which seemed to give life to her face rutledge cranked the car his thoughts straying from what bennett was saying then he heard part of it and said abruptly sorry i missed that he stepped behind the wheel and turned to stare at bennett i said she knew mr hamilton from her childhood or so i was told not well but their families moved in the same circles was that what drove george reston to fury jealousy rather than a fanatical dislike for stone goddesses from foreign assignments that had kept hamilton out of england most of his adult life and had the bane of his marriage without warning moved to the same village on the south coast of england bringing back all that should have been buried and perhaps forgotten over the long years of exile what was mrs restons maiden name rutledge asked bennett good god how should i know reston married her long before he came here youll have to speak to the rector or mrs trining not me he shifted his foot to ease it a little the bennetts arent on the same social rung as the restons they went next to the rectory granville putnam told rutledge quietly had fallen into an uneasy sleep in one of the guest rooms if you could wait until a little time has passed before you question him he asked without much hope it would be a kindness but there was no time to be kind and in the event the doctor had heard voices and he came to the head of the stairs i shouldnt have listened to you rector i should have rested in a chair in your study i kept dreaming thatthat all was well he began to descend the stairs his face pale in the wan sunlight coming through the open door mr bennett is there news sadly sir no bennett told him just that we need to have you confirm something for us he turned to rutledge who brought out the oiled cloth and opened it so that dr granville could see what it held putnam gasped and stepped aside to give his houseguest a better view he seemed shocked by the sight thats my work or as near as i can be sure see how the pads are placed to absorb bleeding and then another over that in the opposite direction four such in a row and more bandaging to keep the pads from shifting as hamilton moved his head which explains why this has held together professional pride had taken over the truth hadnt yet dawned on him and notice here how i turn the end of the tape back on itself to make it easier to find for changing without disturbing the patient he looked up at the two policemen but where did you find this at the hamilton house why is it so wet does this meanhave you found hamilton then i thought you said there was no news this was in the cottage that went into the sea with the landslip the cottage where restons brother lived until his death rutledge repeated for what seemed like the tenth time that morning what was it doing there granville was genuinely surprised you arent trying to tell me that someone carried hamilton out there i can tell you as his doctor that he couldnt have walked that far on his own if he was in the cottage when it went over then hamilton is dead but we can only confirm so far that he was there at some point if you are quite sure about these yes yes who else could these belong to hes my only patient just now with a head injury but none of this business makes any sense to me did hamilton have visitors while he was in your surgery other than his wife half hampton regis tried to get in to see him i left strict instructions that he wasnt to be disturbed by anyone my wifehe cleared his throatmy wife understood the seriousness of that but anyone could have stepped in the garden door or come down the passage from the surgery door if no one was about to stop him or her even at night well yes but people arent savages here they asked after hamilton but never pressed when we informed them that he was too ill to see anyone i made it quite clear that his rest was essential to a full recovery his voice was testy as if rutledge was questioning how he ran his surgery look are you trying to suggest that my wife neglected not at all putnam cut in soothingly the mans asking if it could have happened quite by chanceno one around and someone opening doors dr granville said curtly its possible it isnt likely even miss trining took no for an answer but in the back of the doctors mind rutledge was certain loomed the fact that he had failed to provide a nurse to stay with hamilton and keep visitors away both day and night and by not doing so he might very well carry the guilt of his wifes death whether he realized that yet or not down the years when all was said and done it might come back to haunt him putnam looking stricken said only i think we should all have a little sherry none of us has felt like eating any lunch i daresay it will do us good and he left them there walking into the rectory parlor to find the tray with decanter and glasses bennett called after the rector that they had no time for sherry thank you very much and nodded to dr granville as he took his leave rutledge noted as they closed the door behind them that granville seemed to shrink inside himself as if it had taken all the strength he possessed to keep up appearances bennett was saying you were a little hard on him he had to identify what id found and it was important to know who might have slipped into that back room out of concern for hamilton or even to scout in broad daylight how difficult it would be to come again at night im beginning to think no one turned a lamp on he or she may have had a shielded torch mrs granville must have been awake waiting for her husband and either an unguarded flash of light or some sound from the surgery attracted her attention it was she who reached for the office lamp and before she could light it she had to be stopped ill wager you thats precisely what happened dr granville wouldnt have used a torch hed have felt free to turn up the lamp on the other hand he might well have left a lamp burning and it went out and she came down to see why yes thats bound to be what happened but why take hamilton away why not simply finish him there and be done with it because without hamilton we cant clear up what took place by the sea on monday and without hamilton we dont know what happened last night if wed been able to broaden our search for him before the cottage vanished would we have found hamilton there dead of his wounds or exposure or only this bit of bandage to make us think hes still alive somewhere you make it far more complicated than it needs to be bennett complained as the motorcar began to roll someone wanted hamilton out of the way and that someone also wants his wife add those facts together and were back to where we were when you arrived and in my view if we dont arrest mallory were derelict in our duty now where is the proof other than walking into that house and holding mrs hamilton at gunpoint you cant support trial on that alone you went out after him bennett and put the wind up he could very well be telling the truth that he believed he would hang if you had your way and he went to the one person who mattered to him to tell her not to believe the police or turn it another wayhe was desperately afraid that it was felicity hamilton whod attacked her husband youve taken his side i say again it was bound to happen you were in the war and thats a tie hard to break the war has precious little to do with this id have gladly seen stephen mallory die in the trenches instead of he stopped but the words were spoken even if not finished instead of hamish who had no bishop uncle to pull him out before he broke who had had to go on fighting because he wasnt an officer and men in the british army did their duty to god and king dying if need be without complaint instead of all the others i couldnt save better men better soldiers who deserved a chance to live to see their children and their childrens children he tried desperately to cover his blunder ending lamely even to his own ears instead of being accused of murder today and a dishonor to his uniform but bennett said nothing staring down the road his face shadowed in the uncertain light inside the motorcar as the sun came and went something in his stillness was different now as if a sudden thought had occurred to him or as if hed read into rutledges short sharp silence and unsuccessful recovery a revelation that shifted the relationship between the two men whether for better or worse rutledge was still too stunned to judge bennett insisted that they go to casa miranda directly to speak to mallory hell be expecting us sooner or later and id like to know how mrs hamilton feels when she learns she could be a widow that length of bandage is damning evidence that hamiltons dead and it just might shock her into her senses make her see mallory for what he is but he wont let me in on my own its the two of us then together rutledge paused at the intersection where he must make a choice to rising land where the house stood or back toward the mole and the police station bennett was right it was the next logical step in confirming what they feared but would it turn out the way the inspector was convinced it would better to be there to watch faces for himself the question was would mallory feel cornered and explode or would he simply give himself up knowing that there was nothing more hamilton could tell the police now had that been his reason for sending for rutledge in the first place gaining a little time until hamilton died of his wounds without ever regaining consciousness if so he hadnt reckoned on dr granvilles medical skills still without hamilton to testify against him with no murder weapon found with the constable on duty swearing mallory hadnt left the hamilton house last night there was precious little evidence to hold him even if bennett succeeded in taking him into custody the entire complexion of the case had changed he willna give himsel up hamish said you remember he was a verra stubborn man stubbornand sometimes impetuous failing to look ahead at the consequences of his actions hed shown that impetuosity again in his flight from inspector bennett and now it could still drive him to suicide guilty or not guilty it wouldnt matter if he believed he could exonerate himself in felicitys eyes a last grand gesture because the bubble of infatuation had burst and it was unlikely even if mallory didnt stand trial that felicity would marry him now that she was free rutledge considered postponing the confrontation until hed made his call to melinda crawford but what she could tell him about matthew hamilton had no bearing on what must be said to stephen mallory and what would bennett do while rutledge was speaking with melinda decide to storm the heights on his own he willna be put off hamish warned true enough the die as it were was cast rutledge pulled up the hill in a shower of the brightest light yet although the wind was cool beneath the warmth of the sun as he stepped out of the motorcar by the house door he looked to the horizon where the squall line had been hours earlier a long stretch of pale blue rainwashed sky was spreading motioning for bennett to stay where he was for the time being rutledge walked around the boot trying to put words together to make their visit worthwhile but he had condemned mallory out of his own mouth now and it still jarred him he hadnt meant it hed never wanted to see any of his men dead the knocker seemed to resound through his head as well as the house in due course he heard mallory call whats this visit in aid of then was it hamilton theyd found in the village no but there appear to be new developments youre not bringing bennett in with you i wont be outnumbered that easily a truce then rutledge said quietly you dont want mrs hamilton hearing what we will be shouting at you through the door mallory swore dont take me for a fool but the words were more bravado rutledge thought than anger unlock this damned door and listen to me then make up your mind the door after a moment swung slowly open a small slit that showed mallorys face in shadow you know hamilton went missing weve found something to indicate where and possibly why bennett and i are here to put you in the picture it is not going to be something mrs hamilton will find comforting or reassuring bennett peering out of the car moved his crutch to the front seat mallory said sharply tell him to keep his distance bennett stopped his face flaring with anger but he had the sense to know that patience would gain him more in the end without a word he simply set the crutch across his lap the shoulder end out the far side window step out here for five minutes i give you my word this is no trap there isnt a sniper waiting with a rifle there isnt a covey of policemen under cover in the garden but bennett is the local man its his problem as well as yours and the sooner we sort it out the better he willna come hamish said but in the end mallory after a long look at rutledge stepped outside and behind him drew the door nearly shut mrs hamilton is in the kitchen he said grimly looking at the larder there was a wealth of information in the statement food was running low and his own attempts at cooking were a failure whats more nan weekes was still uncooperative rutledge wondered what the maid would have to say when she was told that hamilton was dead at a nod from rutledge bennett heaved himself out of the motorcar put his crutch under his arm and hobbled forward for an instant the three men seemed to stand there like flies in amber their positions determined by the strained relationships that separated them and made them antagonists holding them in a pattern that had no beginning and no end mallory broke the stiff silence get on with it rutledge said while i was here in the grounds earlier this morning a houseor rather a cottageout on the devon road went over the cliff and into the sea in a subsidence what does this have to do with hamilton i mistakenly thought the activity i saw along the mole meant that bennett here had found him back to the cottage it was uninhabited thank god derelict in fact and no one was hurt but i went around by sea to have a look at what was left it had to be done in the event hamilton had been inside and we could recover his body mallory had been listening impassively his face schooled to show no expression now he said braced lines about his eyes cut it short man was he there is he dead there was no hope of digging through the silt without grave risk to the searchers but i found one of the mans bandages caught on a broken chair dr granville has confirmed that its very likely the one covering hamiltons head and face mallory seemed to catch his breath on a word and then he said you cant prove how it got there or why and without a body you cant be sure hamilton is dead the evidence is very strong now that he is but how the hellunless you were lying to me about his injuriescould he have walked out of the surgery much less down the devon road how far is the cottage from here a goodly distance a mile or so restons cottage was it thats the only one he stopped well aware that he might have said too much then he added look i live here ive driven that road theres a working farm just up the way ive stopped there for eggs bennett watching him with intensity said nothing rutledge replied well be questioning the farmer and his family now that we have the evidence from the cottage well i shouldnt have cared to walk out on a landslip but im not surprised that you did it what i find inexplicable is the fact that you cant put your hands on hamilton my god he was my only hope his face suddenly changed the problem now is who took him away and that my friend should be proof i wasnt the one who attacked him in the first place bennett said by my way of thinking if hamilton had come to his senses in the middle of the night hed have dragged himself this far to find out whats amiss with his wife and in all likelihood hed have shot you where you slept mallory winced but he retorted if hes lucid enough to walk this far hed have been lucid enough to remember i hadnt touched him why the hell wasnt someone sitting with him at night no dont answer that i can guess what the good doctor saidthat hamilton was safe as houses where he was his mouth turned down with the bitterness of experience why do medical men assume that god gives them special dispensation ive never met one who didnt think he could manage very well thank you in any crisis something made his head lift and his gaze sharpen did i hear something out there by the road theres a constable under the tree outside the wall hes been here from the start anerprecaution i dont intend to shoot anyone mallory told them irritably as long as no one tries to take the house by storm is that all you have to tell me theres another problem involving hamiltons disappearance we havent discussed it appears that someone in the surgery in the dark either mistook mrs granville for hamilton or was seen by her while searching for him she came to investigate and whoever it was killed her gentle god mallory exclaimed you cant lay that at my door you have no witnesses to prove you were here all night not if mrs hamilton was locked in her room and nan weekes was closed up belowstairs no the word was explosive youre telling me that i must compromise her reputation to prove i didnt do this murder and besides if youll think about it while i was out trolling half of hampton regis last night what was to stop her from setting that blasted maid free and running to your constable out there for protection tell me that did he see me leave did she try to leave you put him there by god hes your man and im not up to shinnying down cliff faces into a stormy sea much less clawing my way back in her room she couldnt hear you go shes not a fool either rutledge if shed had any inkling i was not in the house shed have screamed the place down probably for fear id gone back to the surgery to finish what i started she may be my prisoner but im hers as well did either of you stop to think about that shes kept me from going near her husband by seeing to it that i cant walk out this door and if i do ive lost the only chance i have of seeing myself through this tangle to the other side bennett opening his mouth to speak shut it again and then clearly against his better judgment he said weve got off on the wrong foot you and i mr mallory he gestured with his crutch im paying for that as well as you it would be simpler all round if we left this nasty business in inspector rutledges capable hands its what he was sent here to do let him get to the bottom of these deaths before theres another and in the long run it will be easier on you and on hampton regis not to speak of mrs hamilton shes suffered enough on her husbands account she needs to consider how she wants to go about mourning him and marking his memory it was a reasonable speech delivered in a reasonable voice only bennetts eyes belied his calm professional assessment of events the local policeman pushed to admit that hed been wrong at the start and offering a clear way out of a very difficult dilemma a desperate man might have believed it a tired man might want to believe it and mallory was both but he was also a man whod spent time at the front and was used to weighing up his chances he might well see the hangmans noose at the end of his present road but hed crossed no mans land in the teeth of enemy fire and he had felt death very close to him it had left its mark in his courage he turned toward bennett yes we did get off to a bad start and im sorry for what happened to your foot ill tell you that frankly his voice was also calm and reasonable stating what he might actually believe and making it sound sincere just as bennett had tried to do but the damage is done as far as mrs hamilton is concerned i cant offer amends to her reputation even if i shoot myself hanging me would only make matters worse for her because it will all be dragged through the courtroom and the newspapers raked up again for gossip and condemnation and matthew hamilton dead is no good to my case i needed him alive whether you believe me or not he could have saved me he could have taken felicity back and id have left england it would all have ended in the only possible way mallory stopped then he said to rutledge your brief is still to find who has killed two people who didnt deserve to die but make it soon i dont think i can take much more of this he started to step back through the door and then paused with one foot on the threshold weve got no supplies let the rector bring us what we need i wont shut him in with us and he wont tell felicitymrs hamiltonabout her husbands death or mrs granvilles she doesnt need to suffer any more than she has already rutledge said to the closing door mallory there was silence behind the wooden paneling but rutledge had the most vivid image of mallory standing there in the dimness on the other side head bowed hands over his face climbing painfully into the motorcar bennett said i tried no one can say i didnt try rutledge took a deep breath it was admirably done id hoped he would accept your offer it was generous but he found himself thinking that perhaps the visit of the chief constable had had a salutary effect on bennetts determination to hang mallory out of hand it might still be there but the policeman had triumphed over the broken bones in his foot when it was most needed but hamish wasnt satisfied he said ye ken he doesna wish to go down in flames with you or the lieutenant it was a chilling analogy how many airplanes had they watched crash in flames over the front even if the pilot got out he seldom survived but bennett was determined to see that whatever the outcome for rutledge or mallory he remained the local policeman in hampton regis the inspector was saying did you believe him then that hes pinned in that house by mrs hamiltons fears and never set foot outside it could well be the truth certainly if mrs hamilton woke in the night and realized that mallory was nowhere to be found her first thought must be that hed used the cover of darkness to go down to granvilles surgery theres no telling with women bennett said with a sigh she might have decided to cut her losses heres hamilton dying and her reputation damaged she might well decide that her future was safer with mallory than as a widow whose name was under a cloud husband murdered gossip swirling about her wherever she went rutledge tried to picture mrs hamilton as a schemer and found to his surprise that while he couldnt put it beyond her to look to the future all things considered she might well be better off with her husband at the end of this ordeal just as mallory had admitted he also found it hard to believe that any feelings she might have had for mallory would survive what the two of them were going through now but bennett was right there was no certainty with women they saw their world in a very different light they had to face condemnation of a different sort the look in a mans eyes as he recalled a hint of scandal the glance that passed around a circle of other women as she walked into a room a hostesss hesitation in greeting her an older womans reluctance to present her to impressionable daughters a whisper behind a fan a mans hand slipping as they danced as if testing her willingness and there was nan weekes who would gladly add to rumors and speculation rutledge dragged his thoughts back to matthew hamilton why had he been attacked in the first place that was still the most urgent question for once that had happened hamiltons death must have become a foregone conclusion to prevent him from telling the police what he remembered if granville had failed to save hamiltons life that first morning margaret granville might still be alive or if hed had the sense to put a guard on his patient she might not have been killed but it had all begun in the mist early on monday morning an opportunity seized or a victim stalked what secret was so important that an innocent womans life had to be taken to protect it rutledge delivered inspector bennett to the police station and then turned the motorcar in the direction of the surgery but after an hour of walking through the rooms putting himself into hamiltons shoes and then into mrs granvilles he was no closer to an answer it was while he was opening closets and searching through shelves that he did make one new discovery while the bedclothes in the room where hamilton had lain were thrown back as far as he rutledge could determine none of them had been taken away hamiltons clothing and all his personal belongings were missing yeswhether put on his body or tied in a bundle but now he noticed that blankets had been removed from the cupboard in the passage where they were stored for ready use the evidence was so slim it wasnt surprising that he hadnt noticed it before like the sheets below them the remaining half dozen blankets were folded perfectly and set squarely on their shelf but the top one was skewed very slightly as if by a hand disturbing them in the dark mrs granville would have left these as she had everything else in perfect order the doctors wife carrying out every instruction with care and attention to detail not proof of course and such as it was it would have to be confirmed by dr granville but possibly an indication that hamilton was still out of his head and needed to be hauled away like a sack of goods there had been sea mist and a rain to keep hamilton dry was inconsequential surely if the intent was to kill him anyway no trundled in a barrow or carried over the shoulder it was prudent to shield him from sight what still struck rutledge was the mind behind every move that the killer had made so far meticulous planning and execution nothing left to chance but mrs granvilles sudden appearance and even that deterrent had been overcome was mallory capable of such planning in the trenches hed followed orders and carried them out with a soldiers skill but without passion or flair to spur on his men foresight was deeply imbedded in most officers who had survived through to and the somme they learned they profited from the costly mistakes of others if positions had been reversed hamilton the foreign ser vice career officer might have plotted mallorys death and seen it through with such precise skill hed dealt with the turks and the germans where every word and gesture had been watched and scrutinized for its nuances it was a hard school and hed survived in it who had turned just such cunning against the man and why rutledge went back to the inn for a late luncheon eating quickly without speaking to anyone he could feel the other diners regarding him surreptitiously their ears cocked for his voice bennett nursing his foot had all but dropped out of his usual haunts growling in his cave like a wounded bear and one didnt call on the policemans wife not socially without a damned good excuse he on the other hand was a fish in a glass globe rutledge told himself wryly living here at the duke of monmouth the one man who could tell the inhabitants of hampton regis what had happened at the surgery this morning had to take his meal somewhere and such a small town ran either to tearooms suitable for women or a pub or two where workmen could pick up their midday meal or stop by for a sandwich and a pint at the end of the day he had seen the latter tucked into back streets with perhaps a small dining room on the far side of the bar and names like fishermans rest or the plough and share plain food but filling and faster ser vice than the hotel nearer the mole was the drowned man with a lurid sign of a corpse wrapped in seaweed lying on the pub doorstep on one side and being handed a pint of what appeared to be bitter on the other it wouldnt have mattered today if the roast beef was lightly burned the potatoes dry the beets hard though he had to admit the duke of monmouth had outdone itself in the kitchen this morning in fact the meal was excellent and he was grateful that the cook hadnt been struck down by beckys mumps guests had come to overhear a brief exchange like the one hed had earlier with george reston or a comment dropped into the silence as he was being served those whod misjudged their timing had had to linger over their pudding or savory longer than was customary conversation had flagged noticeably as he walked into the dining room and took his table at one corner of the room but he wasnt the friendly local man someone who might be hailed with good god bennett are we all to be murdered in our beds and was that the chief constable coming out your door this morning whats going on at the surgery my wife was turned away and the youngest with colic mind you is mr hamilton dead was it his body dr hester took away word was out that there had been a death it couldnt be avoided dr granvilles neighbors had seen enough to hurry to a friends home or a shop passing on their eyewitness accounts the question was would any of them also remember anything from the previous night that would be useful to the police hed rousted one of bennetts men from bed and withdrawn the other from casa miranda for the day and set them going doortodoor wherever windows looked out on the surgery it would be a matter of great good fortune if they came back with reliable reports he walked out a subdued scraping of chairs behind him to follow his progress and went directly to the telephone in its cramped closet there he put through the longdelayed call to kent prepared to wait patiently while it was answered at the other end and melinda crawford was summoned to the telephone instead the maid informed him that miss crawford had gone to dine with friends and would be home at nine oclock that evening was anything wrong miss crawford would wish to know straightaway rather than worry herself sick until she could reach him you know how she is inspector the voice at the other end of the line chided him i neednt remind you tell her its a duty call after id been swept by a strong sense of guilt he said smothering his disappointment at missing her and not a minute too soon as you well know good day inspector it had been boxing day when he last spoke to her nearly three months ago hanging up the receiver rutledge was still standing in the shadows of the closet when he heard someone at reception speak his name the desk clerk was saying he was in the dining room a short while ago sir shall i see if hes still in the building the male voice said breezily dont bother ill be staying if you have a large room with a sea view available we have very few rooms with a sea view sir the duke of monmouth was a coaching inn in its day and most of our guests were grateful to be spared the dampness of the mole a large room then after a moment the man went on i hear youve had a spot of trouble here cleared up is it the desk clerk answered with the caution of a local resident as to that sir youll have to speak to mr rutledge if youll just sign here sir ah well i shall require tea if thats possible ive had a long wet drive at least the rain has stopped here its pouring farther to the east ill take you up sir and then have a word with the dining room staff just tea will do and perhaps the new guest was saying as his voice faded in the distance rutledge listened as the clerk led the way up the stairs waiting for a moment longer until theyd turned into the firstfloor passage and it was safe to step out of concealment he hadnt recognized the newcomer but the name would be there in the hotel register walking quietly he crossed to the desk and turned the heavy book his way r g h stratton was scrawled on the page rutledge didnt know anyone by that name either at the yard or in london he left the duke of monmouth and went out to his motorcar stratton whatever his business was could wait who was he not sent by bowles surelybowles preferred his chosen minions but perhaps from the home office following on the heels of a report from the chief constable that all was not well in hampton regis the first of the firestorm hamish said itll no be your inquiry for verra long and mallory would not care for that he drove again to miss esterleys house and knocked at the door she received him with concern writ large in her eyes but her cane was nowhere in sight im told that a body was removed from dr granvilles surgery this morning im also told that it appeared to be too slight for a mans i warned you earlier that matthew was dead if he hadnt gone to casa miranda and to felicity was i right after all he followed her into the room where they had spoken before and took the seat she offered him there has been a death yes but it wasnt hamiltons body that was brought out it was mrs granvilles if he had slapped her hard across the face she wouldnt have been more shocked blood rushed to her cheeks and she said her voice not quite steady butmrs granville i dont quite she was found behind her husbands desk this morning dead of a blow to the head meanwhile we havent found hamilton alive or dead but the only conclusion we can draw now is that he was killed as well if not at the surgery then elsewhere it was blunt and hed intended it to be though hamish growled at him for it but if she had helped hamilton to leave the surgery last night he wanted her to know the cost and where was her cane he had seen it this morning tears welled in her eyes and to keep them from spilling down her cheeks she gripped the arms of her chair until her knuckles were white whatever she might tell him about her relationship with matthew hamilton on her side it went beyond simple friendship i thought policemen she said huskily were taught to break bad news as gently as possible there is no gentle way to speak of murder after a moment she replied thats a frightful word i dont like it i cant believe anyone would wish to harm mrs granville what does she have to do with matthew she was always so eager to please and she adored her husband shed have done anything he asked of her as an epitaph it summed up the doctors wife very well she had lived for her husband and perhaps died in his place we dont know the full story but it appears she was there in the surgery when hamilton went missing that she either knew or saw something that she shouldnt have and that knowledge was costly then matthew couldnt possibly have left of his own accord hed have done his best to defend her why was she there in the middle of the night had he been waking up thats what everyone was hoping for was she sitting with him dr granville had gone out to a patient and mrs granville had retired for the night someone may have seen him leave realized that hamilton was alone and took the chance that it would be safe to walk into the surgery but somethinga noise a light we dont knowmust have disturbed her and she went to investigate she couldnt have known there was an intruder either she thought her husband had returned home or she was afraid that hamilton had come to his senses and was disoriented or in pain yes yes it would be just like her i didnt know her well but well enough to recognize her sense of duty she smiled sadly she hadnt wanted to be a nurse you know she didnt have the stomach for it she told me as much when dr granville sent her round with flowers the day i was brought home from hospital she worked with him simply because she liked to be close to him how is he coping hell blame himself you know i dont want to think about what he must be feeling ive known loss myself did you know dr granville well before your accident we met socially from time to time hes a fine doctor i can tell you that ive never really cared for him as a person i dont know why thats ungrateful i know i have no business even saying such a thing he spent hours with me after my accident and did everything he could to see that i walked again and without a limp ive told you but he wasi dont knowalways trying to impress me with all hed done for me as if he wanted me to know the full extent of the debt i owed him and i did know it but i didnt enjoy his company the way i enjoyed matthews she ended ruefully i tried not to let him see how i felt it would have been unkind and he was married theres that as well hamilton had been married but she seemed to view that differently after a moment she shook her head somehow im not ready to believe matthew is dead iit just seems so ruthless to kill a helpless man much less an innocent woman when weve learned why hamilton was attacked in the first place well be able to answer that the urgent question just now is why anyone would have wanted to take matthew hamilton away the simplest solution is that hes dead now before he can speak to the police he had told mallory that matthew had come to his senses briefly had that been an error in judgment well it wont help felicity in her predicament of course it wont help that man mallory to prove he isnt guilty of assault and even if mr mallory struck matthew down it was still far short of murder in the eyes of the law he should have given himself up hamish was pointing out that she had shown less sympathy for felicitys loss than she had for dr granvilles rutledge said what do you know about mallory could someone have killed hamilton to revenge himself on mallory to make sure he was tried for murder and hanged i dont think ive met mr mallory more than once or twice i know very little about him except for the whispers ive heard she considered for a moment how to answer him im sure inspector bennett would love nothing better than to see the man in custodythe woman who does my washing gossips about the trial hes been to his wife over that injury to his footbut you arent suggesting hed prefer to watch mallory hang thats rather farfetched rutledge smiled grimly and so were back to the beginning and why hamilton was so severely beaten miss esterley regarded him with interest you are a devious man arent you she asked if it wasnt mallory who attacked him then who found him walking that morning and quarreled with him who was disappointed in something he said who was afraid of something he might do who lashed out in such blind fury that before either of them quite realized what had happened hamilton was lying there bleeding and unconscious she shivered her gaze lifting to the windows as if she could see beyond the walls and into the past you make it sovivid personal a beating is personal miss esterley answered slowly i dont know of anyone who was afraid of matthew after all hed only just come to live here he hardly knew us and most certainly couldnt know our family skeletons as for disappointment at a dinner party not a fortnight ago i overheard miss trining tell him that she was very disappointed that he hadnt chosen to stand for parliament id never known him to express any interest in that directionin fact he seemed to be rather glad to be out of the public eye and i most certainly cant picture miss trining taking a cane to him for refusing to consider a political future but then miss trining sees duty in a different light from the rest of us and as for someone being angry with him weve come full circle again to mr mallory was miss trining ambitious for herself or for hampton regis as the home of a sitting mp i dont believe it had anything to do with ambition on her part its more an abhorrence of wasted potential hamish stirred and rutledge picked up the thought wasted potential if miss trining had discovered hamiltons penchant for dealing with grave robbers she might have felt more than disappointmentshe might have been furious with him for not being the man shed believed he was but surely even if her temper had got the best of her on the strand she would have owned up to her actions and taken full responsibility for them duty carried with it responsibility before he left rutledge put one final question to miss esterley do you happen to know mrs restons maiden name her maiden name no i dont believe i do is it important ive been told that she came from a very good family and might have known hamilton in the years before he went abroad indeed if thats true i never heard anyone bring it up and im sure it would have become known when the hamiltons arrived in hampton regis everyone was scrambling for an introduction mrs reston would have been exceedingly popular if shed had any sort of connection ive told you i was the first to make his acquaintance because of my accident i know how quickly people suddenly discovered how very much they enjoyed my company it was said wryly even with a touch of bitterness but it was possible that henrietta reston had had her own reasons to keep the past in the past and her relationship with hamilton buried there it was not likely in a village the size of hampton regis that rutledge could avoid the newcomer stratton for long if the man set out in search of him he had only to ask the desk clerk for a description of the motorcar and he would soon track it down but as rutledge left miss esterley he was pleased not to find stratton leaning against the wing waiting for him rutledge went again to the rectory to assure himself that bennett had spoken to mr putnam about the larder at casa miranda bennett had sent someone round putnam told him in a low voice and he was to be driven up to the hamiltons door in a greengrocers cart at a quarter past three dr granville is asleep finally and i hesitated to leave him alone just now but ill only be there long enough to help hand in the choices that mrs bennett is making i can only hope theyre to mrs hamiltons liking rutledge smiled in spite of himself quite thats a volatile situation you know with mr mallory i have prayed to find a way to resolve it im sure he wants to find a resolution as well but so far theres been no clear answer there will be none until we discover who tried to kill hamilton yes sadly its for the law isnt it to bring us safely through i can only do my best to keep peace where it is needed most and thats here for the moment thank you for agreeing to help not at all you will keep me informed wont you i cant be everywhere and of late i seem to have been in all the wrong places it was said ruefully but with conviction i should have foreseen something if i had known my flock as i so often pride myself i do i should have sensed the injuries that were driving people to desperate measures whatever it was that has led us to this it isnt your failure rector murder is a private matter its when a man or woman has no other resources available that he or she turns to a last act of violence would that a priest could do our work for us at the yard small comfort mr rutledge when it is one of your own who has been maimed and now murdered i lie awake with that knowledge on my soul and tell myself that somewhere i shall find that slim gleam of understanding i need to go forward alarmed rutledge said youll stay out of this mr putnam any knowledge you feel you possess you must bring to me do i have your word on that this is a coldblooded killer not a lost sheep from st lukes flock who can be brought back into the fold with a prayer for guidance putnam smiled im not as brave as that you neednt fear im no becket challenging kings or murderers but i ought to be clever enough to understand my own congregation dont you think with that he shut the door softly and left rutledge standing on the rectory steps miss trining was not pleased with rutledge and made no bones about it i summoned the chief constable she said sitting in the tallbacked chair in a parlor that was as grand as a drawing room brocade and polished wood and floors that shimmered beneath the feet of elegant furnishings older than the house itself possibly the dowry of an ancestress i felt it my duty to express my belief that events had got out of control inspector bennett is all well and good but his abilities are limited and i doubt you have the experience to guide him in the place of honor over the mantel hung a portrait of a victorian gentleman soberly dressed in black and standing in a pose reminiscent of paintings of the late prince albert designed to grace shops bearing the seal by appointment hamish had no difficulty with the family likeness the macqueens bred true as well he commented i appreciate your strong sense of duty miss trining it becomes your role in hampton regis the words rolled off rutledges tongue effortlessly he had dealt with busybodies before what is going on she demanded i particularly asked the chief constable to come here and tell me who is dead it cant be matthew hamilton i refuse to believe it but if it isnt why is the surgery shut tight and guarded by constable coxe miss weekess cousin i believe yes not the young constable who had fetched dr hester from middlebury but an older man with grim eyes rutledge had taken a hard look at him thinking to himself that if anything happened to nan weekes coxe would be difficult to manage assuming the pair were as close as she had tried to make him believe they were the truth is miss trining that mr hamilton is no longer in the surgery at some point in the night he either was helped to leave it or was carried away by whom pray her anger was apparent was it that foolish wife of his it was my clear understanding that he shouldnt be movedid even suggested that he be brought here where he could be more comfortable and dr granville was set against it it was done without dr granvilles knowledge or consent how like her then i was quite right to have brought this matter to the chief constables attention specialists should have been brought in at once for consultation indeed id pointed that out to dr granville myself i must tell you the man is arrogant about his skill at times but then he doesnt come from a refined background he was adopted by the granvilles you know a promising boy who showed an early aptitude for medicine and repaid his new family poorly for their kindness why else should he be looking after farmers and shopgirls here in hampton regis when his foster father is in harley street wasted potential unkindness he asked with just the right level of curiosity to elicit information from her rather than the sharp edge of her tongue im told there was a young woman whom he met shortly after he set up practice her father was a nabob made his money in south africa you know friend of rhodes and so on when he discovered that his daughters suitor was merely fostered and not a granville by blood he rather publicly put an end to the affair accused him of playing with her affections in fact the foster father accepting the nabobs version of the situation refused to have any more to do with our dr granville guilty or not it finished him in london society and of course he had to leave that doesnt appear to me to reflect poorly on dr granville rather on his foster father mr rutledge it is ingratitude we are speaking of she told him in her severest tone ingratitude for putting his benefactor in such an untenable social position a man of his upbringing should have risen above the class in which he was born and he failed to do that the medical profession must be seen to be above reproach that is why doctors are accepted in society he wasnt in the mood to challenge her views he said he married margaret granville after leaving london yes entirely too timid to be a doctors wife but i must say shes shown herself to be a devoted assistant her father was a country vicar no money at all but her mother came of good family and left her a comfortable inheritance she glared at rutledge you have intentionally diverted me from what mrs hamilton saw fit to do in regard to her husbands care i find it appalling but i will be charitable and put the greatest blame on the man with whom she is presently consorting mrs hamilton as far as we can determine never left her house last night and i dont think she could have removed her husband without help then the two of them are in it together just as i said mallory and matthews wife weve searched the house and grounds weve had to accept the possibility that hamilton is very likely dead she leaned forward in her chair he cant be dead the shock was real and it took her a moment to recover i refuse to believe you we cant find him miss trining the fact is someone has gone to a great deal of trouble to be sure that we dont have his body was it that man mallory finishing what hed started why did you not put a guard on mr hamilton its negligence inspector sheer blind negligence what excuse does dr granville put forward for this turn of events id like to hear it she was furiously angry beside herself with it but rutledge found himself wondering if she was afraidafraid that he was tricking her dr granville has no excuses to offer his wife was killed last night presumably as she came to the surgery in her nightdress to see why someone was there at such a late hour miss trining stared at him after a moment she demanded and where was the doctor pray he was attending a case of congestive heart failure she digested that nodding will joyner i expect his daughter is without doubt the worst cook in hampton regis what she feeds him i shudder to think but it has done him no good ive been there when dr granville gives her instructions and never fail to wonder at her stupidity i shall have to offer to bring dr granville here he cant wish to stay in that house tonight mr putnam has taken him to the rectory and quite right mr putnam has a very acute sense of whats best i shall send them their dinner at least theyll have no worries there she shook her head i find it hard to take in i spoke to margaret granville only yesterday we were planning the spring gala at the church she was to make the table decorations for us to sell and i shall have to find another volunteer for that noblesse oblige the miss trinings of this world coped it was their duty she couldnt have removed hamilton alone and rutledge couldnt quite see her as a coconspirator with anyone else in hampton regis he could safely strike her off his list of suspects rutledge took a quarter of an hour to search out the man joyner the patient with congestive heart failure and found him resting quietly in his bed watched over by an anxious woman in her thirties she looked tired eyes redrimmed from lack of sleep and from worry hes only just drifted off inspector she told him on the doorstep of the small house on the road east a mile beyond the churchyard doctor says rest is what he needs i shouldnt like to disturb him miss joyner dr granville was here in the night you say yes hes good about that i send the neighbors boy along if dad takes a turn hes pining for mother thats what it is but i dont want to lose him its his pension pays for this cottage after all practical the way the poor so often had to be curiosity got the better of her whats this about inspector mr bennett never comes to look in on us even when dad had the influenza and nearly died dr granville lost his wife in the night were trying to pin down the time of her death oh the poor man i shant tell dad for a bit it will upset him no end and i asked after her i remember i did doctor said she was in her bed and asleep as i ought to be what time was dr granville here i sent for him soon after one oclock it seems to me and he sat with dad until he was quiet five or six it must have been by that time i heard the neighbors rooster start crowing thank you miss joyner i wont keep you any longer she said youll tell doctor how sorry we are id hate to think of him being here when his wife was so ill and needed him makes me want to cry there was nothing he could have done he assured her and left before the next question was asked how mrs granville had died hamish said it wasna necessary to come here but bowles would ask for such minute attention to detail it would balance what london would see as his unnecessary venture out to the landslip even if it had produced that tantalizing bit of bandage it also established that granville had come east not west when he went out on the joyner call he wouldnt have been a witness to whatever had been done on the road to devon worst luck it would have helped to corroborate the story that young jeremy cornelius had told mr putnam leaving a note for dr granville on the hall table collected his coat and was standing in the rectory drive when the greengrocer pulled up with his cart the horse an old hand at the game stopped as soon as putnam approached waited for him to clamber up to the high seat beside mr tavers and then walked on circling the drive to the gates in the low wall tavers said im not setting foot in that house im not finding myself shut up there with a revolver at my head not good for business putnam said his voice pacific you wont be in any danger mr mallory isnt a madman hes just frightened that what happened to mr hamilton is going to be laid at his door simply because he had had a quarrel with mr hamilton well not precisely a quarrel a difference but hamiltons gone missing and mrs granville is dead what did he have to do with that nasty business i dont think mr rutledge or mr bennett has come to a conclusion about that not yet mrs bennett has an opinion and it isnt in mallorys favor i can tell you that yes well im sure shes worried for her husband he blames mr mallory for the injury to his foot my point exactly a volatile temper thats what mr mallory has and it got the better of him this time have you ever seen him lose his temper when he first came to hampton regis mrs tavers noticed how edgy he was and uncertain in his moods she said to me he was not one shed like to meet along a dark road in the middle of the night i understand mallory had a very rough time in the war and so did my son howard the youngest but hes not going about bashing in heads and keeping another mans wife against her will is he with a sigh putnam said dont worry man i shall take everything inside the house you need only set the parcels by the door changing the subject he asked have you been considering one of these new lorries for your business not as long as fred here is still pulling his weight tavers retorted it was a tense greengrocer who drew up in front of casa miranda and halted his horse to let putnam step down putnam tapped at the door and waited wondering what his reception would be but mallory casting a swift glance outside said good afternoon mr putnam is there any news about mr hamilton sadly i havent any i wish i had mallory swallowed his disappointment thank you for rescuing us from starvation if youll just bring the parcels to me ill carry them the rest of the way of course tavers stepped down turned his back on mallory and began to pull out a box of goods putnam hurried to help him and lifted the first box with a grunt he ferried it to the man waiting in the doorway and went back for the second when he had transferred the fifth box and tavers went back to his seat on the cart putnam approached mallory diffidently i shant presume on a mission of mercy he said quietly but i can offer my ser vices for what they are worth mallory said i wish you would pray for us rector were tired and dispirited and nan weekes has made the worst of this business i hadnt counted on that i thought shed do more to comfort her mistress would you like me to speak to her she may be frightened mallory gave a short bark that wasnt amusement yes and while i guard the door what then putnam said with asperity i do not represent the police mr mallory my duty is to god if you ask me to help you i would be here as his representative and no one elses mallory wiped a hand over his face im sorry rector yes if you would have a word with miss weekes i would be grateful it would make life within this house a little less he shrugged im no match for two angry women then as putnam seemed to take a step forward mallory said i havent told either of them about hamilton or about mrs granville it was unnecessarily cruel to worry mrs hamilton when theres nothing she can do youll respect that wont you i understand ill just ask mr tavers to wait in a moment he was back he passed mallory at the door and made his way into the hall wondering if he would encounter mrs hamilton on his way belowstairs but she was not waiting for him he found the room where nan weekes had been incarcerated and saw that the key was in the door turning it he stepped inside the woman standing with braced shoulders where she could face whoever came into the room raised her eyebrows as she recognized the priest youve come to tell me its over she said flatly did he kill her and then himself its what ive been expecting but ive heard no gunshots nan nothing has changed ive come because mr mallory feels you need the little comfort i can offer its been a trying few days trying she seemed to spit the word at him its not what id use not trying theyre tormenting each other and tormenting me i blame both of them her for giving him false hope and him for not seeing that he wasnt wanted here you think thats what has happened putnam asked nan weekes said a decent woman doesnt find herself pursued by a man she turned down a decent man takes his dismissal but my cousin has seen him watching this house of a night from across the way and she looks out that window toward him in the morning ive seen her when i go to bring down the ashes and if ive seen her so has mr hamilton she turned away as if she preferred not to face him for the next question no one tells me how mr hamilton is faring after that beating im not to speak of it she says its too painful she says and who else could have given it to him i ask you but that mr mallory is he dead is that why youve come to offer comfort to the widow no i dont know how mr hamilton is faring nan i havent been to see him you see for several days he wasnt allowed to have visitors he was too ill he had kept to the letter of his promise putnam thought but not the spirit of it with a sigh he said could you bring yourself to help mrs hamilton through this ordeal you may not approve of her actions but you cannot judge whats in her heart you must leave that to god for now your strength and your willingness to be a witness to her ability to steer mr mallory toward a peaceful end is your first duty to mr hamilton will you keep that in mind will you stay here make no trouble for either of them and do what you can to help us while mr rutledge is trying to bring mr mallory to his senses she said if you say so rector but it was mrs hamilton who gave him that revolver and if anything happens to me you must tell my cousin that i told you as much hes one of mr bennetts men hell see things set to rights i think you must be mistaken that im not rector i was there on the stairs wasnt i its mr hamiltons revolver from his foreign ser vice that mr mallory has and ive been praying since i was shut up in here that he would turn it on himself and be done with it it would be her punishment wouldnt it and very fitting putnam stood there rooted to the spot for an instant longer finally he said nan youre no better than they are when you say such things thats as may be will you give mrs granville a message from me if you please ive got her best sheets at my house to iron them properly theyd have been back by now if i werent shut away here if she needs them she can go and fetch them ill understand the rector replied slowly i expect to see dr granville shortly ill make a point of passing this information on she laughed without humor he wouldnt know the best sheets from the everyday ones no its mrs granville you must tell i wouldnt want her to think id mislaid them he asked her tentatively if she would like to pray with him before he left and she bowed her head stiffly while he did drawing on his training to sustain him but he saw that his hands were shaking as he locked her door again and he wondered if nan had noticed it as well rutledge was driving back into hampton regis from miss trinings house when he saw george reston and two other men walk into a row of offices just up from the mole they appeared to be in earnest conversation and the younger of the three carried a sheaf of papers in his hand he passed them without showing any interest in them but when they had gone inside he turned the next corner and drew up in front of restons home the maid informed him that mrs reston would receive him and he followed her down the passage to a small room that was warm from the fire on the hearth and bright with lamplight i was glad to see that mr reston is feeling better he said he appeared to be with business associates just now near the mole he didnt want to keep to that appointment but he had no choice she regarded him coolly it had been arranged several days ago and one of the men has to return to winchester tonight why have you come back mr rutledge first i should like to ask you if your maiden name was cole it was not my father was edward farrington we lived in london and sussex i dont see that that has anything to do with your business here in hampton regis he tried to place the name something to do with law or finance he thought certainly a firm connected with some of the best families in the country mrs reston had indeed come down in the world and it was there in her face as she watched him search his memory but he was careful not to let her see his conclusion and your second reason because i think you must know more about matthew hamilton than your husband is aware of mrs reston and i didnt feel i should say as much in his presence our parents traveled in the same circles we met a time or two but it was not an event i remember with great fondness if thats what you are asking me he was just one of many people invited to the same house parties and weekends in the country i enjoyed them one did then before the war it was a very pleasant way of life i miss that i think a good many people must it was a golden time by the time i married george matthew hamilton was abroad i dont think he recognized me when we were introduced here in hampton regis at miss trinings dinner party i didnt press the memory but your husband if im not mistaken is very certain you do remember matthew hamilton and with some warmth call it a matter of revenge inspector it didnt drive my husband to attack mr hamilton when he was out walking monday last and it hasnt driven him to do anything drastic now you cant be sure of that revenge is sometimes bloody and swift my husband bought me mr rutledge like goods in a shop or so he feels ive seen it in his eyes when he looks at me he wanted to improve his position socially and my father needed money rather badly it was an arranged marriage two years later my uncle died and my father had all the money he could ever wish for and i had george reston for my husband there was no respite for me but i have finally brought him around to my way of thinkingi have created a past i never had embroidering my relationship with matthew hamilton into something more than the brief acquaintance it actually was and george cant afford the scandal of divorce we manage together very nicely at the moment and i shall deny i told you a word of this if you meddle you believe he couldnt have beaten hamilton nearly to death but ive been informed he attacked another man in london nearly as severely i know my husband he wouldnt have touched hamilton and as mr hamilton has no way of knowing the role hes played in my life hes not likely to give george any satisfaction matthew hamilton is probably dead mrs reston and you cant be sure that your fantasy hasnt driven your husband to murder after all the last indication we have of hamiltons whereabouts was in that cottage that went over in the landslip i remind you that anyone could have found a way inside it was known to be abandoned we had no reason to lock it or board it up there was nothing inside of any value except hamish roused himself to point out a small vase painted with lilacs was the man your husband attacked in london another of your fantasy love affairs rutledges voice was harsh and he meant it to be stung she said that was a matter of business mr rutledge i knew nothing about it until george told me that he was taking a position here in hampton regis and why his partner fool that he was had been using client funds improperly and george lost his temper when he found out i never liked the man i felt he was responsible for our leaving london and i am sure that he deserved what he got after badgering my husband publicly to help him make restitution in time you seem to have a very callous disregard for human suffering mrs reston yes i was taught by masters no one ever stepped forward to protect me inspector i wonder why i should feel any driving sense of duty to protect anyone else let me tell you something about love it can be very cruel and very greedy ive had done with it and that has given me a freedom that i cherish rutledge walking through the inn doors saw someone rising from a chair set to one side of the reception desk it was stratton striding forward with his hand proffered i say inspector rutledge robert stratton foreign office is there somewhere we can talk privately rutledge led him to a sitting room beyond the stairs and closed the door behind them ive been sent down with a watching brief mr hamilton is one of ours and naturally we feel some concern for his welfare mr hamilton as i understand it has retired as indeed he has but hes suffered rather severe injuries and his wife is under duress im here to act on his behalf in any way thats useful for instance to see that he receives adequate medical attention and is moved to hospital if the local man isnt up to the task i have no doubt that dr granville is a good doctor the problem is mr stratton that we seem to have mislaid mr hamilton he was not in the surgery this morning when dr granville returned from an emergency stratton frowned i dont quite understand rutledge took off his overcoat and sat down im at a loss myself how did the foreign office learn about events in hampton regis i wasnt aware that the attack on mr hamilton had received widespread attention an ear to the ground im a policeman mr stratton im afraid that wont do rutledge waited grimly who contacted the foreign office and who sent you to hampton regis id like to clear this with the yard before i give you any more information for all i know youre the man who attacked mr hamilton while he walked by the sea four days ago if youve lost him so have we and id like to know why stratton took the chair on the other side of the small table at rutledges elbow looking up at the painting above the hearth showing the duke of monmouth standing on a battlefield banners flying and men dying at his feet he said thats an abominable work it didnt happen that way the hotel is named for him its to their advantage to show him as an heroic figure im still waiting i was a friend of matthew hamiltons at one time i hope i still am the problem is weve wondered some of us if hes writing his memoir when the chief constable dropped a word in the right ear that matthew was in serious condition and unconscious we wondered if we might find ourselves with a posthumous publication disappointed men sometimes use the pen when the sword has failed them and you are here to ferret it out if anything should happen to him im not from the foreign office that is i am but not officially i came as a friend hell do himself no good raking up things best forgotten the newspapers will make much of it then lose interest but by that time the harm will have been done he er kept diaries we do know that we dont know what was in them rutledge asked did that have anything to do with the customs inspections he endured from time to time surprised stratton recovered quickly i daresay he invited them with his rather cavalier approach to other peoples property if something was sold on the open market it was hardly appropriated by mr hamilton he simply bought the object as i understand it all very true but of course when a man has a reputation for buying without asking questions he encourages tomb and site thievery its simply not done still a handful of rare statuary is not my interest ive seen his collection and wouldnt give it house room we could never understand why hamilton chose to live in hampton regis rather than london the only answer was that he found it the perfect place to work quiet out of the way attracting no attention other than the social aspirations of his neighbors a perfect place did it occur to no one that he might like that house above the sea that he chose a quiet place for the first years of his marriage to give it time to flourish of course it occurred to us were not fools stratton retorted irritably but it was unlike him there was no connection in his past to this part of england his wife wasnt from this vicinity hampton regis is a very long way from london not so much as the crow flies you understand but in the kind of life everyone expected hamilton to lead it aroused oursuspicions it might well send them soaring to learn that matthew hamilton has vanished rutledge got to his feet and lifted his coat from the back of the chair whats more a woman was murdered at the same time and in the same place if mr hamilton has been writing an account of his career it has upset more than his friends its unleashed an enemy stratton was still standing there stunned as rutledge walked out of the room it was half past nine before rutledge again shut himself inside the telephone closet and put in his second call to the home of melinda crawford her voice was strong as it came over the line and rutledge smiled to hear it well ian what have you got to say for yourself neglecting an old woman until shes left to wonder if you are alive or deadand on the brink of not caring either way melinda crawford a child in s bloody mutiny of native troops in india had survived that and cholera to marry lost her husband when she was in middle age and set about traveling as an antidote to grief returning to england in what most would have considered their final years she set up a home in kent and soon acquired a large and interesting circle of friends if she was still waiting to die no one suspected it mea culpa he said blame the yard if you like its half their doing id asked for leave to visit you and they wouldnt hear of it it was the truth but he made it sound like a lie a likely story she waited on the other end knowing him too well its about matthew hamiltondo you remember him of course i do are you breaking bad news ian its late and i shant sleep a wink tonight the truth is im calling to ask if you knew one of his friends a miss cole ah miss cole how did you come to know about her nothing that melinda crawford said or did surprised ian rutledgehe had grown used to her ability to leap ahead of a conversation or catch at a single word or phrase and divine what the speaker wished most to avoid her question now was heavy with shadings as if by asking him pointblank she could somehow deflect his curiosity rutledge said for a start who is she and where does she live shes a young woman hamilton knew many years ago why dont you ask him about her i cant lay hands on him at the moment youll have to do i expect she lives where she always has in exeter with an aunt although the elder miss cole may have died long since in that case your guess is as good as mine exeter was not that far from hampton regisin fact along the west road to devon how did hamilton come to know her as so many people came to know each other before the war as you met jean at a weekend party there were a goodly number of young men and women therethe hosts son had just come down from university and there was tennis boating on a small lake dancing on the terrace even croquet quite tame by modern standards no doubt terribly edwardian he smiled she was deliberately trying to distract him and why did our miss cole and matthew hamilton even recall each other long after this uneventful weekend party was a memory you must ask him that i recollect a lovely girl very well mannered and quite pretty and so they became friends he urged i expect matthew thought hed fallen in love with her but nothing came of it in what sense that they were unable to make a match of it that she wasnt in love with him or it was no more than a summers romance she went back to exeter with her family and matthew found himself offered a position in the foreign ser vice and who was behind that offer was it you to get him clear of her clutches he could almost hear her snort down the line youll not put words into my mouth young man its rude she said tartly i offer my sincerest apologies melinda why should he describe her as the most completely honest person he knows im delighted to hear you at last use the present tense with hamilton i was afraid he was dead rutledge swore under his breath will you at least tell me how to reach miss cole i truly dont know we never corresponded youre a policeman ian youll find her if thats what you wish to do exeter isnt that large as i remember and with a brisk good night melinda crawford was gone the line echoing emptily behind her last words he sat there with the receiver in his hand until the operator spoke in his ear rousing him from his thoughts he gave her the number for scotland yard in fact it was time and past for him to confer with the yard indeed he found that bowles had left a message with the switchboard for any telephone call from hampton regis to be put through at once rutledge considered that as he was waiting for bowles to pick up at his end not from rutledgefrom hampton regis hamish said his voice seeming to echo hollowly in the small closet no a good sign he had been quiet for some time and rutledge jumped at the sound so close to his head that he could have sworn he felt hamishs breath on his ear but bowles was speaking now and he needed all his wits about him rutledge id expected to hear from you sooner yes sir were shorthanded and i wanted to be the one to break the news of mrs granvilles death in certain quarters good and as for shorthanded the chief constable is arranging for more men at inspector bennetts request didnt he tell you i havent been to the station since midmorning time you did these men will be called in from outlying towns and bennett is arranging accommodation for them expect them tomorrow morning no later than sixthirty bennett tells me thats time enough we should establish a watch along the coast as well anywhere a body might wash ashore yes ive heard your theory that hamilton went over with the landslip early days yet rutledge early days it could be what youre meant to think however the chief constable has spoken to his counterparts west of you and a watch is well in hand i expect you to cooperate with bennett man not run your own show i understand sir rutledge answered offering no excuses but he could feel hamish bristling at his back bloodyminded bowles it was another of the appellations attached to the chief superintendents name men in the ranks preferred old bowels we dont mislay important men rutledge find hamilton or find his body and the doctors wife for gods sakethats two murders if hamilton is dead and i dont want to be hearing of another i understand rutledge said for the second time this killer leaves very little trace of his passage hes clever and hes quiet its not easy to find his tracks he regretted it before the words were out of his mouth a fatal weakness apologizing making excuses it was how bowles would view his explanation then youll just have to be cleverer wont you ill expect a further report by noon tomorrow and i suggest for now that you and bennett decide between you how these extra men are to be deployed i shant care to hear youve wasted your resources bowles rung off before rutledge could ask him about the green park murders and the name of the man phipps had brought in he swore but it brought him no satisfaction as he opened the door to the little room hamish reminded him you havena been completely honest with yon inspector he had kept information from bennett but for very sound reasons or so he had told himself and he was not about to drag miss cole into the equation until he knew more about her honest was the way putnam had described herit was how hamilton had portrayed her to the rector but could there be bitterness as well he considered that possibility and then discarded it surely too much time had passed for that it must have been years since hamilton and miss cole had met for all rutledge knewor even hamilton for that mattershe had long since married happily borne children and was now a middleaged woman with no other interest than her family and matthew hamilton was a name she read in the newspapers from time to time and recalled over the breakfast table how shed won at tennis with him in doubles and whether or not he was a good dancer but something there was melinda crawford had done her best to discourage him from finding the woman and that had been an error in judgment on her part it had served only to fan his interest hamish said if shed made a promise shed ha kept it and no told you why she couldna speak of it rutledge listened to the voice in his head and came to the conclusion that hamish had read melinda crawford better than he had it was an unsettling thought late as it was rutledge went straight to the police station found that bennett had already gone home for his dinner and ran him to earth there mrs bennett had just set out their tea a plump woman with a round face she looked welsh and the soft rhythm of her speech confirmed it ill just see if mr bennett is available sir she told him and left rutledge waiting on the doorstep when she led him back to the sitting room there was a second cup for him on the tray by the hearth a good fire had warmed the atmosphere but his greeting from bennett was cold with an underlying wariness mrs bennett did her duty as hostess then discreetly left them alone as rutledge looked down at his cup he saw that it had been painted with a scene of a welsh castle harlech most certainly and there was beaumaris on the cake stand more of the same souvenirs took pride of place in the glassfaced cabinet between the two windows and a watercolor print of snowdon at sunset hung above the hearth if you are expecting me to leave the house tonight youve got another think coming ive just spoken to bowles im here to discuss how well use these men the chief constable is sending us tomorrow theyre at your beck and call my men are tired and they have their regular duties to perform we cant keep running them morning and night i agree any word from the constables questioning dr granvilles neighbors none of importance a dog barking but no idea what time that was a child up with the croupbetsy drews is her name and her mother did see dr granville leave he had a small boy with him and mrs drews recognized him as jimmy allen the one miss joyner sends along at time of need mrs drews was worried that betsy might take a turn for the worse while granville was out on the call but she finally got her daughter to sleep without any more trouble and that was the end of that the dairyman saw him coming home the times match what granville himself told us yes i called on miss joyner myself earlier it appears that whoever came to the surgery after granville left had a good three hours clear in which to work more than enough time bennett offered him the small plate of sandwiches and another with slices of lemon cake with poppy seeds rutledge suspected that they werent prepared for a guest and declined with thanks bennett didnt press him we have to keep in mind that hamilton could have attacked mrs granville bennett continued in his muddled state he might not have understood what he was doing and if she startled him hed leap first and think second he might have killed himself later out of shame it may be that whoever helped him didnt even know about the killing it was a change in viewpoint that caught rutledge off guard was this a result of bennetts conversations with the chief constable or had he realized that it was going to be difficult to prove that mallory had slipped into the surgery and removed hamilton it was hard to tell he didnt need hamishs soft ware to warn him to watch his step he said true enough but his wife was still under duress at casa miranda wouldnt he have felt his life better spent tackling mallory we cant be sure can we what hamilton knew or didnt know or even if he was capable of reasoning as i see it after attacking mrs granville he might have felt he served his wife better by killing himself rutledge had a sudden sharp image of himself standing beside that bandaged body discussing events with dr granville and beside them hamilton lay in a stupor apparently unable to hear or to speak and later bennett and granville between them had tried to rouse him as rutledge had done so briefly could hamilton have absorbed snippets of those conversations and twisted them into something far less acceptablethat his wife was in league with mallory if that was true hed want to take himself as far away from them as he could until he was well attacking mrs granville by mistake would have shaken him badly had he mistaken her for felicity in the dark only dr granville could tell rutledge if this was possible but hed seen men on the battlefield with head wounds one had walked in stumbling circles screaming and another had sat with his back against the trench wall talking to his mother begging her not to lock him in a dark room unaware that the blackness surrounding him had nothing to do with childhood fears he finished his tea and set the cup on the tray ive also been told that theres a watch along the coast in the event hamilton is washed ashore currents are tricky in this part of the world he may be washed out to sea then brought in again to the west of us theres rocks in cornwall that trap corpses but what hell look like by that time thats another question we may never discover the true cause of his death rutledge left thanking mrs bennett as she led him to the door walking out to the motorcar he couldnt be sure whether bennetts failure to tell him all that the chief constable was offering had to do with an interloper on his patchor a very clear recognition that this was bennetts opportunity to show himself a competent and resourceful policeman in his own right he rather thought that the complacent bennett had come to the conclusion that with the chief constable looking over his shoulder it behooved him to change his ways an awakening rutledge went next to the rectory more than a little worried about putnam after their last conversation the rector assured him that food had been delivered without incident there was the rich scent of frying ham wafting through the door and rutledge thought he smelled potatoes and cabbage as well and i spoke with nan weekes putnam was saying for her own sake i encouraged her to be less intransigent and more cooperative the stressful conditions in that house are very worrying to me and no doubt to you as well and i dont see a swift resolution rutledge admitted thank you rector would i could do more he said with a sigh and closed the door rutledge drove on to casa miranda and found the odors there less appetizing someone had burned the meat acrid smoke greeting him when mallory finally admitted him to the house i wont be alive to be hanged he said with grim gallows humor ill starve or be poisoned first what do you want now i need to look through hamiltons papers theres the possibility that something hed done abroad has come back to haunt him those confounded statues ought to haunt the man im tired of staring at them felicitymrs hamiltonmust give you permission mrs hamilton when she came to the study where hed been left to wait had a smudge of flour on her nose and an air of hurt resignation she said to rutledge i dont know that i should give you leave to go through matthews desk i dont see why we cant wait until hes awake mallory had left the two of them together withdrawing quietly rutledge wondered if he were in the kitchen trying to resurrect his dinner we have no other leads mrs hamilton half the village is convinced that mallory here attacked your husband the other half holds every opinion gossip can think up from some past deed following him here from abroad to a boatman telling me that the sea claims its own in time as if the mediterranean pursued him to england he tried to keep his voice light but she wasnt diverted from her concern well its none of anyones business is it she said with asperity london has only so much patience if they recall me the next man may not be as willing as i am to search for answers in the past oh very well the key to the desk is in the lock but i beg you to put everything back where you found it i shant care to have matthew unhappy with me she crossed to the desk and took the key holding on to it as if hoping he might still change his mind about the need for it ill be very careful he promised she sighed passing it to him inspector bennett will grow old with gout mrs bennetts menu choices would feed ditchdiggers and i was never fond of parsnips but you may thank her for her thoughtfulness im learning to be grateful for small things like warm bathwater and my clothes in order in my closet no one can make tea the way she broke off looked away from him and then said will you please tell me how matthew is feeling i dreamed last night i was burying him and i couldnt find his best suit it was frightful searching everywhere and the coffin ready and the mourners in the drive i woke myself up crying its been extraordinarily difficult for you mrs hamilton but your husband would admire your courage if he were here to see it a day or two more perhaps and we may have some relief for you it wasnt stephen who attacked him i can tell you that now he doesnt have it in him to do such a thing im sure well have the truth in time yes but you dont understand its like being married shut in here together with no one else to talk to we fight over the smallest things we storm out of the room in a nervous fury and then come back again because theres nowhere to go and nan bangs on the ceiling until im heartily sick of it i just want matthew back again and everything the way it was how does mallory feel about it she smiled her face coming to life for the first time in days he will probably be very happy to see the last of me he was annoyed with me when i burned the potatoes but that was only because id burned my finger as well and had gone to dip it in vinegar and soda and he said felicity i have money i would have provided you with everything in life that matthew has and treasured you for yourself but you had told me all those years ago when we were in love that you could cook and i was just as annoyed and i said of course i can cook its only that ive had very little practice i burst into tears and he said ill go fetch nan but i didnt want to be shown up by her shed never let me forget it and shed find a way to tell matthew as well so i told him that if he did id leave here when he slept and never come back again from her expression rutledge could see that she believed she had won the skirmish and she felt better after proving her selfreliance but it was also clear to him that whatever feelings these two people had kept hidden away for the other time and closeness had diminished them its like being married she had put it like an elopement gone wrong living in a garret on slim resources and without public acceptance and trying to pretend that love was enough he felt pity for her but there was no hope he could offer her and to tell her that matthew was very likely dead and their circumstances here at casa miranda had taken a dreadful turn would be cruel how would she cope if in the end she knew mallory would be taken away to be tried and hanged for two murders she seemed to sense his change of mood and said sharply are you keeping something from me inspector have you told stephen more than youve told me hed lost sight of the fact that women often read minds or at the very least were sensitive to shifts in emotion i was thinking he told her that matthew hamilton is a very lucky man she blushed her eyes filling with shining tears when i have him safe again ill never let him go you can tell him that for me and she was gone leaving him with the key to the desk in his hand rutledge waited almost certain felicity hamilton would have second thoughts and come back to ask him to leave when she didnt he crossed the room unlocked the top drawer and began his search there were accounts letters to a man of business receipts for payments made to firms shipping his household goods from malta and other papers relating to hamiltons affairs under them there was a photograph of a cream stone house on a narrow street its facade plain but the intricacies of the lacing around the oriel windows were very old and created by a mason with expert hands rutledge stood there looking at it and then turned it to the reverse side it said my house in malta casa miranda near a shaded square where i often take my tea the cream cakes are better than any ive tasted anywhere else it was as if he had expected to send the photograph to someone and had described it for him or her the sort of thing a friend might include in a letter to melinda crawford rutledge shut that drawer and went to the next he found more accounts for the malta house and those from another one in istanbul there were letters to and from a man of business and a name caught rutledges eye as he was setting them back in the folder hed opened i shall want george restons assurance that all is well again and afterward i shall move my business to the firm in leadenhall street london there followed the direction of a firm that rutledge recognized as old and wellestablished mcaudle harris amp sons and why should george reston have to give his assurance that all was well again rutledge went back to the correspondence and read it more thoroughly the letter was dated shortly after hamilton had returned to england george restons london partnera man by the name of thurston caldwellhad been borrowing from matthew hamiltons funds for his own purposes on a small scale at first and then with increasing assurance as his client had remained abroad if such a breach of trust had been made public it could have ruined reston as well as caldwell and probably led to prosecution hadnt mrs reston said something about misappropriated funds and the partner deserving what he got when reston lost his temper in public and attacked the man small wonder then rutledge realized suddenly that she had chosen the perfect instrument for her revenge on her husband not just someone she had known as a girl but a man who had been defrauded by restons london partner a doubleedged sword that had descended with all the force of longdreamedof vengeance behind it and had reston twisting and writhing like a puppet in a tempest turned not on his tormentor but on a man completely unaware of his role in the failure of a marriage rutledge went on searching through the drawers of the desk and then in the bookshelves that stood across from it volumes of history and travel some of them in french or german or latin had been lined up by date and subject according to a master plan he could follow it clearly as if hamilton had had time on his hands to devise a careful cataloging of his libraryor could afford to hire a scholar to do it for him and would there be room here for diaries as well he thought rather that there would be it took him half an hour to locate them a set of exquisitely bound volumes in tooled cordovan leather gold leaf on the edges of the pages and scrollwork on the binding but no titles at first hed expected the set to be a collection of verse or latin authors or even thinking of restons library biblical references when he opened the first of the slim works he discovered that each covered a year of matthew hamiltons life from the time he took up his career toso it appearedthe last entry on the night before he left malta the knights and i part company finally i have followed them from acre to rhodes to malta not with intent but because they were before me on the road but i have come to a newfound respect for men who lived and labored in the heat of the roman sea and i understand their fascination with the harsh light of noon and the soft light of dawn and the long rays of afternoon i have stood on the ramparts as they must have done waiting for moonrise and i have found a measure of peace if these walls are hauntedand it is likely that they are given the blood spilt herethese shades have been kind to another traveler passing unseen behind me or standing at a distance watchful until i go i wonder what my life would have been if i hadnt come here or to any of the other places i have lived in my exile i wonder how i share fare in england but it doesnt matter i have left a part of me wherever i have lain my head including my youth what remains will be satisfied to go home it was a poignant farewell and there were equally poetic entries over the years as the writer sat in a cafe and sipped coffee or finished a last glass of wine before going to bed the rest was a meticulous account of a busy life and a devotion to duty that spoke of loneliness as well as dedication names dates times places matters up for discussion resolution arrived at for every meeting and official function brief but incisive comments on people everywhere from donkey men on santorini to political appointees in the courts of the kaiser and the viziers of turkey cameos perceptive and devastatingly honest of visiting dignitaries and other diplomats serving their countries and amusing sketches of the englishmen he encountered or who had served with him in this or that capital during the war years there was a list of names framed in black ink of friends who had fallen rutledge closed the last volume and put it back on the top shelf where he had found it a man could reconstruct his entire professional life from such a detailed account of twentyodd years abroad as an aidememoire the diaries were priceless whether matthew hamilton had intended to use them in such a way rutledge had no idea but there was enough privy information in them to ruin more than one career or to provide a rich vein of blackmail material for an unscrupulous reader and hamilton had not spared himself on the pages either robert stratton had every reason to fear the existence of the diaries whether he had ever confronted hamilton about them on the strand here in hampton regis or in the narrow dirty streets of istanbul or bribed illpaid customs officials to find and confiscate them at port cities it was certain that the foreign office knew nothing of strattons presence in hampton regis today the door opened and rutledge looked up expecting to see mrs hamilton on the threshold but it was mallory who stepped into the room you should go ive been patient long enough i was just coming to find you what do you know about hamiltons financial dealings precious little he closed the door should i be interested in them is there something that will hurt felicity not that i can see but there was some trouble early on when hamilton returned to england does mrs hamilton know the details of how his money was managed when he was abroad ive heard her remark since ive been here that his financial advisers dont care for her she suspects there was some trouble over resuming control of his money and although its settled now the man couldnt be counted on to do her any favors she seems to think the man blames her for enticing hamilton back to england and cutting short his career in all likelihood he may believe that if hamilton hadnt married hed have gone abroad again but hamilton didnt know felicity before he came back here did he of course not it was my misfortune that he met her at a dinner party in london while i was still in hospital but that wouldnt matter to a man like caldwell caught with his hand in the tillit was easier to point the finger of blame at a new wife were there discrepancies in the accounts do you think hamiltons not one to be gulled i expect there was a swift rearrangement of funds to cover any difference in sums otherwise the police would have been brought in are you telling me that hamiltons banker has been stalking him im only saying that there may be another motive besides an affair with his wife i never rutledge cut him short im not accusing you im telling you that its very likely that a good case could be made on your behalf bringing up the issue of embezzled money versus your past relationship with mrs hamilton mallory took a deep breath all right thank you but it isnt hamiltons man of business here in casa miranda with her bennett wont give a curse in hell for him and where is hamilton come to that ive had a rough day of it keeping what i know from her is he dead rutledge damn it tell me i dont know any more now than i did this morning god help us i thought scotland yard could walk us through this maze and bring us safely out the other side scotland yard rutledge told him with an edge to his voice is only as good as the information given it and so far thats been precious little rutledge was very tired when he reached the inn hamish hammering at him was a dull ache that wouldnt leave him a reminder that he had failed mrs granville as well as matthew hamilton he stretched out on his bed in the dark and hands behind his head stared up at the ceiling there was one more thing he had to do this night and he wasnt sure where to begin would miss cole be expecting a policeman at her door not unless shed learned of events in hampton regis and that was unlikelythe newspapers still hadnt got wind of the assault on hamilton or the murder of the doctors wife it would be left to him to break bad news or would she feel only a sadness for an old acquaintance rutledge hadnt seen any mention in hamiltons diaries of miss cole or even of a married woman who might be her in later years he hadnt read them line for line of course but enough to have a very good feeling for what they contained indeed hamilton had seldom written about england except for the occasional reference to a personal letter from a friend rutledge had come across melinda crawfords name here and there most often in connection with something hamilton had seen or done or found that he knew she would enjoy hearing about in a letter whether hamilton had actually written to her rutledge didnt know hed have to ask melinda crawford that hamilton might simply not have had time to keep up a lively correspondence much as he might have wished to yet hed spoken of miss cole to the rector after twenty years on the other hand there was the photograph of the house on a quiet street in malta identified and ready to send but clearly never put in its envelope as if second thoughts had entered into the urge to keep a friendship alive and in the end hamilton had broken himself of the habit of following through on these small courtesies that would have left doors in england ajar and then he had come home and fallen desperately in love with a young woman to recapture his lost youth or because in her eyes his years abroad were merely a romantic past and she had no experience on which to judge the dangers and hardships and emptiness of a world where politics and protocol and too many secrets circumscribed everyday life rutledge closed his eyes trying to define what the relationship between miss cole and matthew hamilton had been instead he saw jeans face against his eyelids and then mallory his uniform filthy his face blistered from an earlymorning gas attack sitting with his back to the trench wall and weeping for his dead but hamish hadnt wept he had moved quietly among his remaining men touching a shoulder here saying a word there bending over a soldier who was shaking and offering him a cigarette to steady him binding up a wound that didnt merit the journey back to an aid station then he had turned away and rested the splayed fingers of one hand against the earthen wall of the trench his head coming down to touch them as he slept where he stood for a mercy the guns were silent and for a few precious minutes the peace lasted rutledge had watched from a distance there had been nothing he could do nothing he could say and so he had turned his gaze back to the wire and the last lingering feathers of color in the clouds a pink already shading to lavender and gray as night came on in a war mourning had to be done privately there was never any time for more than a snatched thought a swift prayer a curse at what fate had dealt men too young to die no ceremony no flags no fanfare or trumpets they were all too busy striving to live one more bloody day hamish was saying i do na ken why yere driving sae far she couldna ha come for him how would he summon her wi no telephone in the surgery and she canna have killed the doctors wife for his sake rutledge was driving west toward the city of exeter the road followed the sea for a time and then turned away miles sweeping under his wheels and a soft wind blowing that smelled he thought of plowed earth he responded it isnt the surgery im thinking about we cant be sure she hadnt had news of him over the years even if hed failed to write for that matter now that hes back in england she could have wanted to see him again and the meeting on the strand was not what shed expected she could have walked away and then turned back to strike him down oh aye and what of yon doctors wife rutledge frowned theres the rub solve the riddle of the attack by the harbor and that solution doesnt fit the murder at the surgery explain what might have occurred in the surgery and it doesnt clear up what happened by the sea its as if weve got two separate crimes for two entirely different reasons if hamilton isnt dead its very possible he killed mrs granville by mistake why risk removing hamilton when he could have been smothered where he lay with a pillow if hamilton had left the surgery of his own volition why didnt he go back to casa miranda and even if hamilton had inadvertently killed mrs granville he couldnt have attacked himself on the strand stephen mallory could have tried to kill hamilton the first time and succeeded the second time but george reston had nearly as strong a motive as mallory and in his eyes if no one ever discovered what had become of hamilton now it might seem a fitting torment for henrietta reston to live with they were soon on the outskirts of exeter and rutledge cut his speed it was a cloth manufacturing town from norman times and a trading center that had brought it wealth and sometimes unwelcome attention william the conqueror had laid siege to it in person it sat by the exe river and francis drake had supped with walter raleigh in mols coffee house here the cathedrals norman towers were wreathed in clouds as rutledge came through the city and the street lamps cast a watery light across its medieval west front the motorcars rainwashed windscreen gave the sculptures a flickering shadowy life of their own and rutledge glancing up at them could have sworn they moved it was a measure of how tired he was he found the police station and asked an overweight sergeant on duty where he could find a miss cole who lived with her aunt the sergeant replied irascibly that until he knew the business of the man in front of him such information wouldnt be given out rutledge introduced himself and received a long stare in return as the sergeant wondered aloud what had brought a scotland yard inspector to this part of the west country a personal matter rutledge informed him and waited indeed sir ill just call constable mercer and hell take you there though its late to be paying a social call ive had a long drive sergeant indeed sir he summoned the young constable and while they waited for him the sergeant said the house isnt far sir its a tall one set back from the road just past the turning where you came into town ah constable mr rutledge here is from london scotland yard could you show him miss mirandas house and let them know its all right to open the door to him miranda cole casa mirandathe house of miranda rutledge caught himself in time on the point of saying it aloud with constable mercer seated stiffly beside him rutledge drove back to the way hed come he soon picked out the iron gates to tall trees which mercer had told him to watch for and then three houses to the east of that saw a small georgian dwelling with pillars to its portico and a wing to one side with the constable in tow rutledge went to the door and knocked it was several minutes before an elderly maid answered his summons her gaze moving from him to the constable with some alarm good evening missus mercer began this is inspector rutledge from scotland yard to see miss miranda i was asked to bring him here so you wouldnt be worrying about strangers at the door at this hour her gaze returned to rutledge sweeping over him as if hed brought trouble with him i should hope it could wait until morning miss cole and miss miranda have retired im sure miss miranda cole will see me tell her im here about matthew hamilton the maids mouth tightened ill ask her they stood there for what seemed like five minutes finally the maid returned and said to mercer theres a cup of tea for you in the kitchen constable mr rutledge if youll come with me she ushered him into a room at the back of the house the curtains drawn against the night and lamps burning on tables by the window and by the hearth a fairhaired woman stood by a chair across the room her face showing no interest in him or his business the colors of the room were faded as if no one had given a thought to decorating for many yearsthe rose paper on the wall now more ashes of roses and the carpet in a style more french than english seemed to have lost interest in life yet the room was spotlessly clean as if to assure godliness if not beauty miss cole it was a courtesy she must be the woman he was seeking the age was right and something in her face a strength a poise seemed to match the man that matthew hamilton had become yes i understand you are here about matthew hamilton ive been told hes returned to england but he has yet to call on me im afraid hes missing miss cole weve been contacting everyone who may have information about him in the hope that well be able to find him quickly youll understand when i tell you that hes been under a doctors care for several days and there is some anxiety about his health that doesnt sound like the matthew hamilton i remember he was always a sensible and practical man nevertheless im sorry to tell you that youve wasted your trip he isnt staying with me he had the feeling she was fencing with him choosing her words to discourage him miss cole matthew hamilton is in trouble and id thought he might have turned to you for help what kind of trouble the matthew hamilton i remember was not likely to be of interest to the police when did you last see him miss cole across the room the woman stirred and then was still again im blind inspector i have been for many years the last time i met mr hamilton he was young and so was i we parted on good terms and agreed to go our separate ways hes not likely to call on me now and i would be as surprised to see him at my door as i am to see you there good day inspector dedham will see you out blind so that was what melinda crawford had not wanted to bring into their conversation he realized that there was nothing more to say nothing to do but leave a blind woman couldnt have attacked anyone not in the way that hamilton had been injured and she couldnt have come for him even if hed been able to contact her or tried to kill him in dr granvilles surgery yet she must have been a greater part of hamiltons life than even she knew or felicity but would she give him sanctuary rutledge spoke into the silence his voice reaching her across the room forcing her to listen i dont believe that the fact that youre blind entered into his friendship with you he has named two houses that i know of for youcasa miranda in malta and again here in england there may have been others it was a reminder to him that hed known you and it tells me as well that if you had turned to him for help he wouldnt have refused you we had hoped he might trust you to safeguard him he wouldnt refuse anyone coming to him in trouble its his nature to be kind and i have not needed his help through the years if you are interested in why his house should bear my name you must ask him as for our friendship you know nothing at all about that i cant ask him he was attacked and badly beaten by someone who left him to die alone in great pain im charged with finding that person i thought you said he was missing he is he left his bed in the doctors surgery sometime during the night we dont know how or why whether he had help or walked out under his own power but in the morning we found his room empty and the body of the doctors wife lying in the next room murdered she stirred again this time her attention riveted on his face murdered you say but thatsthats appalling mr rutledge are you trying to frighten me not at all ive come to warn you his voice was earnest if matthew hamilton reached you under his own power we need to know what he remembers about the attack on him and why he left the surgery and why mrs granville was killed its possible that he attacked her in the dark not knowing who she was until it was too late if thats the case you may also be in danger he wanted to add that she was defenseless and her house isolated but he thought she was clever enough to understand that for herself nonsense and it doesnt signify anyway ive told you that hes not here his wife is being held prisoner against her will if hamilton had nothing to hide why didnt he go to her and try to help her escape if he loved her why didnt he move heaven and earth to free her even at risk to himself she put up a hand to stop him you are a very pitiless man mr rutledge you have frightened me for your own ends i wont hear any more of this without appearing to be using her hands she let her fingers lightly touch pieces of furniture in her path walking toward the door from memory before he could stop her she had gone through it and called to her maid he didnt try to follow her hamish was already telling him that he had overstepped his bounds and what would frances or melinda crawford have to say about his conduct here but a policeman was charged with sifting facts and probing truths even those secrets innocent people tried to hide from him if hamilton had remembered his relationship with her for twenty years rutledge found it hard to believe that miranda cole cared so little for him unless their romance had been onesided from the start unrequited love or what might have been he turned and walked back the way he had come through the door and out to the motorcar someone slammed the heavy door behind him he thought perhaps it was the maid after a few minutes constable mercer came hurrying around the corner of the house murmuring sorry sir as he stepped into the motorcar for a moment rutledge ignored him standing there looking up at the house it was impossible for hamilton to have come this far in his condition and it would be impossible for a blind woman to go to hampton regis and bring him here neither her maid nor the elderly aunt he hadnt met would have been able to lift a man of that height and weight a wildgoose chase but he thought if it wasnt miranda cole and it wasnt miss esterley who had spirited matthew hamilton to safety who was responsible for what had happened to the man and the question brought him again to george reston or robert stratton rutledge took constable mercer back to exeter and then faced the long drive back to hampton regis circles within circles he found himself saying to hamish as they shared the darkness behind the powerful glow of the headlamps she called you a liar and a man without pity but why would a man like hamilton name his home for a woman hed not seen for many years sentiment was unlikely guilt then a reminder of what hed done when he was young and felt ashamed of in later life guilt was a strong emotion it drove people into paths that they hadnt intended to take he understood it in his own case though dr fleming had first pointed it out to him you survived the war and cant forgive yourself for surviving when others died or were maimed until you do learn to forgive yourself youll never be completely whole i dont need to be whole hed responded only to function to the best of my ability i want to return to the yard may of last year hed said those words to the man whod brought him so far and could take him no further on his journey back to sanity he still had an appallingly long way to go yes well it could be a good thing or a bad thing ian to go back only you can know which it isnt a question of good or bad its a matter of working twelve hours in a day until im too tired to think here in hospital i do nothing but think are you trying to leave here to escape me and look for your own way out fleming had asked bluntly selfslaughter i can kill myself here just as easily well not as easily as pulling a trigger but it can be done you know that yes fleming had sat there watching him all right then lets see what happens your people at the yard want you back lets give it a month and find out whether you are healed sufficiently to face whats in your head and it had been a terrifying month that june a month without mercy but hed survived that and nine more it was march of and he was still alive whether the struggle had been worth it he didnt know he couldnt stand aside and be objective not where hamish was concerned by the time rutledge reached hampton regis he was too stiff and too drained to seek his bed instead he stopped the car some distance past the mole and for an hour walked along the strand pacing back and forth listening to the roar of the waves coming in feeling the crunch of his heels on the wet shingle and remembering how hed nearly been sucked into the mud of the landslip was it only just that morning and what the bloody hell was he to do about matthew hamilton by the time he had turned for the mole he startled a fisherman coming down to the boats tied up there the man swerved then swore it was perkins whod taken him out to the landslip damned if you didnt turn my heart over in my chest mr rutledge i thought for certain the sea had given up matthew hamilton rutledge was up early waiting at the police station when the extra men came in from outlying towns arriving on their bicycles he set four of them to work on the west road knocking on the doors of farmers and householders on either side of the reston cottage two more finished canvassing the shops and businesses along the mole for anyone who had seen matthew hamilton walk down to the strand on the morning he was attacked and one of bennetts men was to finish the last of the names on a list of dr granvilles neighbors that left one man to return to guarding the house on the hill when that had been done rutledge set up a room for himself in the back of the station using what had been storage space until when it was enlarged to stockpile gear for rescuing men washed ashore in uboat attacks it was a bare room painted an ugly brown no windows and a deal table for his desk but it gave the newcomers ready access to him and it kept them out of bennetts way he was just sitting down gingerly in the chair someone had brought him testing it for a wobble on the uneven flooring when the outer door of the station was flung open and someone shouted his name rutledge came on the run and found himself facetoface with the young constable who had been at the surgery with bennett the previous morning he was out of breath and in some agitation theyre shouting for you at the house sir jordan blurted out i dont know what its all about but i could hear him that mr mallory sir yelling for me to pay attention damn itbegging your pardon sirand finally i stepped out to the gate to see what the uproar was im to bring you back with me sir my motorcar is around the corner come along bennett had peered out of his office to listen here he said reaching for his crutch wait im coming as well rutledge had the engine cranked and was behind the wheel when bennett caught them up he got in careful of his foot and had barely slammed the door when rutledge was moving it was no distance to the house but to rutledge the road seemed cluttered with marketgoers and lorries passing through to the west he threaded his way among them reached the turning up the hill and gunned the motorcar into a leap forward hamish in the back of his mind was a low familiar rumble like the guns in france they reached the front door of the house and rutledge said to the constable take up your station again ill call if i need you jordan hurried down to the gates as bennett already out pounded on the front door it was opened by mallory his face pale and so lined with worry that he seemed to have aged overnight i sent for rutledge he snapped at bennett it makes no difference whats happened did hamilton show up in the night they hadnt speculated in the short ride from the police station but it had been in all their minds rutledge waited for mallory to answer he was here theres no other explanation and hes killed nan weekes they stood there staring at him their faces blank with astonishment rutledge the first to recover said how did he get in i dont know ive only just found her if youll give me your word that im safe with you in the house ill let you both inside if not its rutledge only he moved slightly and they could see the revolver in his right hand half hidden by the doorjamb wheres mrs hamilton in her room shes going to need something ive never seen her so distraught that can wait all right then my word bennett told him and mine rutledge assured him the door opened wider and mallory let them pass by him he nodded to the door behind the staircase that led down to the kitchen passages that way they walked briskly down to the kitchen and to the small room that had been the maids prison hamish behind him seemed to be telling him something but rutledge couldnt make out the words for the thunder in his head she was in her bed one arm dangling over the edge the other flung awkwardly above her head a pillow lay on the floor suffocated bennett said bending over her well need the doctor to come and have a look rutledge at his shoulder remembered chief superintendent bowless voice on the telephone thats two murdersand i dont want to be hearing of another have you touched her he asked mallory who was waiting by the door leaving the room to them i called to her when she didnt wake up i came in and snatched up the pillow thinking she was playing at something pretending to be ill shes dead i know the dead when i see them you dont need granville to tell you was the door to this room locked yes but the keys on the outside anyone could have used it and still locked it behind him when did you last see her about eleven oclock last night i came to ask if she needed anything before i went towhere i spend the night as i always asked mind you she was not feeling well she said dinner hadnt agreed with her i told her its the best we can do but she thought the meat had gone off she said the butcher hadnt given us the best cut bennett straightening up turned to look at him my wife ordered that food shed not have sent bad beef mallory said wearily i dont know whether it was good or bad i was very tired i told her wed deal with it in the morning and in my view shed eaten enough for two it was probably nothing more than indigestion i think i may have said as much and she called me callous i told her that if shed agreed to cook it for us wed have all been better served so you were quarreling rutledge asked not quarreling it was no more than the longrunning tonguelashing we were greeted with morning and night but she surprised me then telling me that shed spoken to the rector while he was here and if id call her in the morning shed be willing to prepare breakfast i told her id have to watch her like a hawk and wasnt sure if it was worth the trouble and she answered that as long as mrs hamilton was here she wasnt leaving that was an aboutface rutledge commented yes i didnt know if it was a trick or not i didnt care i said id consider it and i made sure she had water for the night and then i shut the door and turned the key and she didnt pound on the door or scream or cause any other disruption during the night if she did i didnt hear it weve learned to shut it out actually has mrs hamilton seen her to my sorrow yes she heard me shouting for the constable out there and she came at once to ask what was wrong before i could stop her shed run down here i heard her scream and then she was up the back stairs into her room and wouldnt open her door it was there in his eyes she thinks ive done this well need to speak to her in good time rutledge told him if it was hamilton how did he get in it wasnt i and it wasnt felicity who else could it have been lets have a look at the doors and windows then bennett said if hamilton got this far and killed the maid why didnt he hunt you down as well because he couldnt find me i expect ive told you i have found a way to sleep he may know the house better than i do but i wasnt where he looked and you heard nothing in the night rutledge persisted nothing it was curt did mrs hamilton hear anything she says she didnt i asked her they moved away from the bed came to the door and passed through as mallory backed away it would have been easy then to overpower him word given or not two men against one but he still held the revolver and in the passage outside the servants hall door any shots fired would ricochet even if they missed their intended target they made the rounds of the house none of the doors had been built to keep murderers out their locks were old heavy the bolts fitting into worn wood but nothing was broken and the windows were properly latched rutledge said thoughtfully hamiltons keys went missing with him so they did bennett answered whoever had taken hamilton had freedom of the house rutledge interviewed mrs hamilton alone it took some time to convince her to unlock her door but when she finally opened it her face tearstreaked and so pale he thought perhaps shed been sick she held on to the frame as if to a lifeline will you come downstairs and be comfortable he asked her gently weve made tea it will warm you a little but she shook her head i said to himto stephenthat i hated her and wanted her dead not two days ago i never thought he would kill her her voice trailed off into tears and rutledge remembered that she hadnt been told that hamilton wasnt in the surgery under dr granvilles eye he was upset when dinner turned out so badly i didnt mean for him to take me literally i was just torn about matthew and worriedbut its no less my fault is it i should have been braver i should have borne with all the trouble and said nothing she began to cry i didnt truly want her to die but im to blame ill have to be judged along with him he wouldnt be here if it werent for me and im so frightened i think my heart is going to break it took him several minutes to calm her enough to tell her about hamilton he left out any reference to mrs granville and he said nothing about the reston cottage it was cold comfort oh my god are you telling me that it could have been matthew that he thoughtbut surely hed have realized that wasnt stephen down there that it must be nan oror me we dont know we dont know what state of mind hes in we dont know if he could have survived in the cold rain yesterday morning please you must tell me anything you can that will help us find him its urgent mrs hamiltonyou must tell me whatever you know however impossible it may sound but she was beyond thinking and in the end he brought her tea told her he would be in the house for another hour or so and prepared to shut her door is sheis nan still downstairs she shivered i shant be able to swallow a bite of food now im so frightened she must be taken away now to her family you neednt know you neednt watch i must talk to her cousin i want to tell him that it wasnt intended that we were just upset let me speak to him on your behalf i think it might be better just now would you care to have us ask for mr putnam he can offer you comfort she shook her head i cant pray im to blame i dont think mr putnam cares about any of that but she shut her door without answering she didna know hamish said as rutledge went down the stairs it wasna her doing not directly rutledge replied bennett went out to his constable and sent for dr hester he came at length but before he could reach the house nan weekess cousin arrived in a fury that was loud and uncontrolled where is she then constable coxe roared from the drive and wheres the bastard whos been hiding behind her skirts ill see him hang that i will come out you bloody coward and talk to me tell me how a poor woman died doing her duty rutledge on his way to speak to coxe had first to deal with mallory his face red with a mixture of feelings his eyes wild he was about to confront the man outside his pentup emotions badly in need of an outlet im not standing for this he has no right no dont be a fool mallory he wants to draw you out there are you ready to leave this house and face being locked up in the station little good its doing me to stay here nothing has gone as id expected i ought to step into the garden and end it but thats an admission of guilt and i wont make it i tell you whether you want to hear it or not matthew hamilton is alive and on a rampage its the only logical explanation im certain he meant to kill felicity when he killed mrs granville and when he got it wrong he came here looking for her he thinksgod knows what he thinks but he found that poor woman instead what will he do when he realizes this is his second mistake why would hamilton want to kill his wife and not you are you saying he believes she attacked him on the strand use your wits rutledge the hamiltons man of business isnt likely to be here in hampton regis after felicity if hes the one who finished hamilton he knows his client is dead and is back in london busily covering his tracks he doesnt need to muddy the waters by killing felicity hes hoping ill do it for him the shouting beyond the door was growing more abusive all right go out and shut up that fool before im tempted to shoot him they can only hang me once he moved out of rutledges way rutledge opened the door and stepped out coxe was a burly man his face lined with years in the sun and his eyes used to staring out to sea hooded under heavy lids mallory isnt coming out coxe you might as well stop making a spectacle of your grief and go home well bring your cousin to you as soon as may be shell need you then you cant protect him rutledge i didnt believe inspector bennett when he told us you were but i believe it now that man in there is a murderer give him up and let him face charges we have no proof that hes killed anyone hes locked in a house with two women and one of them is dead it doesnt take a london policeman to know what must have happened when she wouldnt let him have his way with her he killed her to shut her up she was smothered in her sleep not interfered with go home or ill have you locked in the police station and forget where i put the key coxe examined rutledge looking him up and down without insolence but with judgment im not afraid of scotland yard this is my flesh and blood lying there dead rutledge said nothing standing between coxe and the house with the authority of a man used to command it was a presence that had served him well in the trenches he had learned it over the years dealing with everything from drunken men outside pubs to riotous fans at football matches one man unarmed several stone lighter than the heavyshouldered angry constable in front of him wrapped in the certainty that he would be obeyed coxe tried to stare him down and failed in the end suddenly mindful of his own career he blustered i didnt say goodbye i sent her to work that day telling her id not eat what she spoke of making for our dinner i told her i was tired of a pasty made from what was left of sundays roast that i worked hard and didnt need to cut corners to save for my old age he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand i spoke out of turn and i never had the chance to make amends shes dead and theres an end to it but not for me he took that from me that bastard behind the door listening to me rutledge waited all right im going i owe no apology to the house save to mrs hamilton ill pray for her odds are shell be dead in another day or two and with that he turned on his heel and walked away rutledge saw him out of sight not five minutes later dr hester arrived and following instructions brought mr putnam with him the rector was shown up to mrs hamiltons room and bennett went to find the constable who had been on night duty at the house rutledge took hester to the servants hall he examined nan weekes and said very likely smothered as she slept taken by surprise she didnt have much chance to fight her murderer off a knee already on her chest a determination to see it through thats what it took he lifted the maids hands one at a time see she grazed her knuckles against the wall there but her nails are clean hed have been wearing a coat long sleeves something that protected him a man or a woman do you think it would depend on the killers state of mind i should think a timid man might fail where a resolute woman succeeded hatred breeds strength oftentimes hester looked around the room bare and yet somehow holding on to the anger and fear trapped with the woman confined here she couldnt have run even if she had been awake there was nowhere to go but he didnt give her a chance to escape he must have been very quiet coming through that door dark as it was she never saw his face even if the pillow had slipped he turned over the pillow on the floor its one of the feather pillows from an upstairs bedroom i should think servants dont often sleep that comfortably fairly new too and therefore better able to do the job im told that bedding was brought down from one of the guest rooms yes that fits well thats all i can tell you sorry mrs hamilton is in the house and in distress will you leave something to help her through this ill see her if you like as for miss weekes shall i take her back with me if you would yes im getting quite a collection of dr granvilles patients dark wit from one professional to another but i daresay he wont feel up to returning to his surgery for a few days yet not until after his wifes funeral he closed up his case whose hand is behind this do you know its not a very safe thing to have whoever it is loose on hampton regis but he failed with hamilton so im told first try at any rate i wonder what this poor woman did to make herself a target as far as we know nothing mistaken identity hester turned to look at rutledge he was quick his mind already leaping ahead really if youre telling me that first mrs granville and then miss weekes were killed because someone thought they were felicity hamilton then id see to it that that policeman spent the night outside her door not under that tree by the road bennett joined them then with word that the constable had seen no one come or go from the house during the night hester gave him an abbreviated account of his preliminary examination then he prepared to move the body looking down at the woman bennett said to rutledge my money is still on mallory hamiltons dead a scapegoat problem is how are we going to prove any of it you were saying before we have a clever bastard on our hands but even clever bastards make mistakes lets hope nobody else dies before he makes one putnam spent some time with mallory and then went back a second time to knock on felicity hamiltons door when she answered his heart went out to her my dear child he said and held her as she cried on his shoulder it seemed to ease her a little although he could see that she was frightened and feeling the onslaught of responsibility for all that had taken place since her husband had been carried into granvilles surgery he sat with her brought her tea and a sandwich hed managed to put together in the kitchen careful to avoid the room where nan weekes had died but he had gone in to the maid before her body was removed giving her the comfort of the church wishing that she had heeded his encouragement to cooperate and had died without such resentment on her conscience he tried to keep himself from dwelling on the question of which of the household would be blamed for her death mallory most likely although it was even possible that felicity might have been tempted to rid them of such an angry presence he hoped rutledge wouldnt look in that direction he himself felt none of the animosity toward mallory that others had expressed seeing only a wounded soul but he grieved for the maid in his own way after felicity hamilton had eaten putnam offered to come and chaperone her now that nan was dead but she shook her head i must see it through she told him i was the cause of so much of the trouble here i must somehow make restitution you shouldnt concern yourself with that leave it to mr rutledge my dear where is matthew mr putnam no one will talk to me about him and i know what the police must be thinking if it wasnt stephen who killed her then it was matthew trying to find stephen and stumbling on nan instead but she wouldnt have given him away you know even if hed decided to slaughter half of hampton regis is that what you believe must have happened that he managed to make his way here she rubbed her temples as if her head throbbed either im married to a murderer or locked in this house with one and i dont want to think about that stephen was as tired as i was of nans tantrums he could have killed her out of sheer despair but not in cold blood not in her sleep matthew could have decided that it was stephen who was on the strand with him and wanted revenge but why harm nan she liked matthew and he was wonderful with her keeping her jolly when i couldnt she didnt like me very much and now either way ive got her killed felicity turned to look out the window if matthew came searching for his revolver and couldnt find it because id given it to stephen nan could have told him she knew putnam didnt put what was on his mind into words that nan in that back passage would have raised the alarm if someone had crept in and it might have been all the warning stephen mallory and that revolver of his needed he was ashamed of the thought as soon as it had formed but almost at the same time that putnam was considering the possibility bennett brought it up to mallory all right lets assume for the sake of argument that this is mr hamiltons work in for a penny and all that if hes going to be hanged for mrs granville whats one more corpse and if he wanted you badly enough he might feel that the maid was a fair exchange for the opportunity only he discovered you had his revolver oh dont be a fool mallory it must have been his you werent in possession of one when you ran me down i cant see why hamilton had to hurt her mallory said rubbing his face with his hands as if to scrub away his fatigue at least if hes in his right mind if hed come to the bed and put a hand over her mouth shed have listened to him and done whatever he asked mrs hamilton tells me she thought he walked on water rutledge the devils advocate said in the dark how could he know it was nan or even that she was here besides if hed touched her shed have screamed bloody murder before he could convince her who he was her first thought would have been that you were in the room with her mallory what i want to know is if hamilton is alive if he didnt go into the sea with that cottage where was he concealed all day yesterday when we were searching everywhere for him in the granvillle house bennett asked hazarding a guess we never actually searched it only the surgery and after granville went to the rectory it stood empty or theres the church putnam is half daft he wouldnt have noticed hamilton if hed hidden himself beneath one of those wretched choir stalls besides he was occupied all the day with dr granville i doubt he set foot in the church then why did we find bandages in the ruin of the cottage rutledge reminded him you cant convince me they belonged to anyone else but hamilton if he had the strength to make it as far as the cottage i dont think he could have walked all the way back into hampton regis how do you know it was hamilton who left that bandage out there mallory interjected someone could have done it for him to throw you off his scent then the question becomes who would help him knowing hed killed mrs granville and now nan weekes hamish said only mrs reston rutledge took a deep breath it all comes down to the fact that if hamiltons dead whoever killed him is still out there which brings us to the next problem why isnt he satisfied now mallorys tiredness dropped from him i hope you arent suggesting that hes after felicity in gods name why and why kill me im the one who will hang for hamilton for mrs granville and now for nan kill me and the police will know im not guilty of any of this he looked from bennett to rutledge what worries me most is that hamilton is on the loose and half demented and if thats the case hes a very dangerous man i can tell you im not looking forward to nightfall if thats the case what about his injuries bennett said and who was it attacked him on the strand he might not have been as badly injured as dr granville thought rutledge said slowly but theres someone who might have struck hamilton down by the mole who might have come back to get rid of him after learning he wasnt dead and who could have a very good reason for wanting to get into this house he told them about stratton and the diaries but bennett shook his head i can see this stratton arguing with mr hamilton monday morning and anger getting the best of him then i dont see him killing two other people over a book thats not been written and how did he get in and out of hampton regis that day without anyone seeing him i dont think thats possible he turned back to mallory as for tonight theres the safety of the station for you mr mallory bennett offered safe as houses and as for mrs hamilton well put her up in my spare bedroom until this is finished no one will touch her there mallory shook his head ive told you from the start to turn myself in is an admission of guilt youre helping us with our inquiries bennett pointed out and hamilton if thats who is behind these killings vanishes abroad and im left holding the bag ive got the revolver i dont want to kill him but i can damned well knock him down im a decent enough shot for that here theres going to be no gunfire in this house tonight or any other time bennett corrected him yes well well see what the night brings let putnam take felicity with him ill stay in her place and together well keep watch rutledge said to stop their bickering shes no safer in that rambling warren of rooms in the rectory than she is here can you picture putnam defending her no shell remain in the house even if i have to sleep across her threshold think about it rutledge urged him youre out on your feet man and youve got my word that i wont take any steps against you but another pair of eyes and ears could be very welcome at three oclock in the morning the wind is rising out there youll be wishing by then that youd agreed im armed and hamilton isnt mallory retorted stung by rutledges suggestion yes but remember that old childrens riddle about transporting geese from one side of the river to another while making certain the fox isnt left with the flock on either bank if im here and it comes to shooting anyone ill be your witness otherwise its your word against a dead mans a man youre already accused of beating until he was unconscious it was unarguable and rutledge could see that mallory was torn in the end he went up the stairs to speak to mrs hamilton and the rector when he returned he said only she wants you to stay the rector offered but id as soon have another soldier at my back tonight now if youve finished here ill thank you to be on your way ill be here before dark rutledge told him you can search my case for a weapon but there wont be one rutledge had given his word but he made his plans with the care of a seasoned campaigner he set his men to guard the house concealing them well out of sight one stood in his room at the duke of monmouth field glasses at the ready two others watched the roads to the headlands on either side of the mole and one was in the church tower with its sweeping view of the town they went early to their positions armed with hot tea in thermoses and sandwiches put up by mrs bennett constable jordan was relieved in due course by his usual replacement and another man kept an eye on constable coxe as a precaution rutledge had also asked one of the men sent from another village to observe the reston house placing him where he could see it clearly in the cornelius family attic mrs cornelius a little anxious had not wished to have a policeman spending the night in her attic but rutledge had assured her that it was to watch the same route that her sons monster had taken two nights before not precisely the whole truth unless the headless man had been reston himself but it served to allay her suspicions he didnt want gossip flying about the town before morning but why should he come again id nearly convinced myself it was jeremys imagination mr rutledge though i was reluctant to believe it at the time your sons imagination made a monster out of an ordinary event what id like to discover is what he actually saw it will clear up any remaining questions i might have now i must say ive not really recovered from the news that mrs granville is dead and now poor nan weekes weve never had anything of this sort happen in hampton regis before and youre quite sure that you arent trying to comfort me by telling me my family is in no danger if i thought you were mrs cornelius the constable would be guarding your door not standing at an attic window later mr putnam concerned for the safety of everyone involved asked rutledge if it was wise to lay a trap with human beings as bait do you know of another way to catch this killer hes coldblooded hes clever and hes not about to offer himself up to us without a fight rutledge pointed out yes well you know where to find dr granville if theres any trouble pray that it doesnt come to that before leaving the station to pack a small case with what he needed rutledge spent an hour reading the reports of his men from the days monotonous rounds of questioning he paid particular attention to the reports from the road where the cottage had stood the only small flutter of excitement there had been a fox in the henhouse of the small farm where mallory sometimes bought eggs a waste of time bennett told him but then most police work comes to nothing it has to be done and we do it else were slack mountains of paper and ink for one small grain of truth rutledge thought of all inspector phippss preparations to guard green park in london and a man who had watched them with interest from a nearby street lamp he had reported nan weekess death to chief superintendent bowles its to stop there rutledge do you hear me ill not be greeted in the morning with more bad news and heed me on this as well if hamilton isnt right in his mind youre not to let bennett clap him up in hampton regis well bring him to london and sort it out yes ive thought about that possibility then see that its done im not best pleased with this trap youre so keen to lay on the other hand if theres no other possible way to lure a killer into the open then weve not got much choice but ill thank you not to let that fool mallory start shooting before we know what were about stratton was waiting for him by reception stepping out of the lounge with a glass of sherry in his hand well met rutledge can i offer you anything thanks but im still on duty a long day stratton agreed theres been another killing they tell me this time a maid working for hamilton and matthews still missing we hope to have someone in custody shortly which reminds me stratton where were you last night not wandering about casa miranda looking for diaries by any chance god no i understand that the man who is holding mrs hamilton a prisoner in her own house is an exofficer armed to the teeth im not that brave i can tell you what id like to know is if you found anything there how did you know i was at the house last evening opening doors in a busy inn can lead to unpleasant surprises but i found a room where the windows do look out toward the hamilton house yours in fact and i saw you go there while i was surveying my options in future id consider spending my evenings with the drapes drawn if i were you rutledge said pleasantly it would be wise strattons eyebrows rose expecting more trouble are you no just a friendly warning that people who meddle with a policeman going about his duties often come to grief you havent answered my question about the diaries do they exist do you think if they do they belong to matthew hamilton if hes dead they belong to his estate neither you nor i have any right to them do you think it fair for one man to hold the fate of many in his hands while he decides what to do with information he should have been sensible enough not to collect in the first place the peccadilloes were not his stratton they were yours whatever it is youre living to regret now you should have thought of that in good time stratton grimaced i can only plead youth then youd better pray that matthew hamilton has learned discretion as he aged or that his wife doesnt wish to memorialize himassuming hes dead nowby publishing his lifes history he turned to walk away but stratton said gaming debts are not a disgrace its just that id rather not have my fondness for playing the odds publicly acknowledged in the reference to stratton that rutledge had seen it wasnt gaming debts that had been mentioned but he didnt stop moving on toward the stairs then youve nothing to fear have you he replied over his shoulder but he found himself agreeing with hamish that stratton was a very clever man and so was the murderer he would soon be waiting for twenty minutes later rutledge went to the inns kitchen and begged a box of sandwiches from the staff with apples from a silver bowl in the dining room then he made certain that his torch was ready for use and added to the case the extra pair of field glasses that bennett had found for him finally he dressed in dark clothing that was serviceable and warm hamish was not best pleased yon mallory has told youhe killed you once before that was just a game his doctor played it has no bearing on the present situation oh aye does the lieutenant ken it was a game he wont shoot me i wouldna turn my back on him in the dark it was nearly four oclock when rutledge walked up the hill to casa miranda his motorcar stood in the yard at the inn where hed left it each night of his stay as a ruse it wasnt very successful hamish had pointed out no if stratton is watching fra a window hell find a constable in my room tonight if he ventures in there again whats more i left orders for the constable to lock himself in as an added precaution he spoke to the man on duty under the swaying limbs of the evergreen remarking on the winds force id not like to be out on the water this evening the constable replied but i should be warm enough stay in plain sight after dark yes sir ill do that rutledge went on to the door and knocked mallory answered quickly smelling of whiskey youre a fool to drink tonight he said shortly im not drinking it was one glass and i downed it with a sandwich the house is cold i built a fire in felicitys bedroom and one in the back sitting room to make it appear to be occupied whats in the case rutledge let him paw through it and youre not armed he opened his coat and gave mallory time to inspect him as he turned in front of him all right then i accept your word there are more sandwiches in the bag fruit im not sure anyone is in the mood to prepare dinner when do you think hell come if he does late when were tired and not as alert yes thats what id told myself a gust of wind shook the windows overlooking the sea damned wind and this house creaks like all the imps of hell are loose in it felicity is waiting shes not taken the powder that the doctor gave her hester i mean she wanted to see you were here first they went up the stairs and rutledge could hear their footsteps echo through the silent house felicity hamilton unlocked her door at the sound of rutledges voice he stepped into the room feeling the warmth of the fire and said not to alarm you just a precaution are you certain no one can reach your windows from the outside if not well find a more suitable room i prefer to stay here but i looked before the light went id thought about that too he showed her the sandwiches pointing out that there was a variety chicken and ham and cheese with pickles and heres enough tea to see us through the night is there anything else you require water for your powder i have water stephen saw to that im not sure i want to be asleep if theres any trouble were on the other side of the door he went out mallory was dragging comfortable chairs from other bedrooms with pillows and blankets and a pair of heavy quilts it will be drafty he said in explanation then added a decanter of whiskey to their makeshift night camp as a blind for shooting lion i think the lion has the advantage a lion can smell us before we see him a man cant what about the back stairs rutledge asked he could come from there rather than the main staircase ive got a chair braced against that door if he tries the knob well hear him if he intends to reach us hell have to use the other stairs while mallory was collecting matches and lamps rutledge doublechecked the servants door to the back stairs it was solidly braced and anyone attempting to come through would find himself making a considerable racket they settled down in the silent house listening to the wind outside and prepared to wait mallory brought out a small portable chess game but they were evenly matched and it palled after a time mallory said ill wager he doesnt come it will all be to do over again tomorrow night you have to remember hes been badly hurt he may need a nights sleep before he can make the effort a second time theres that rutledge agreed still i dont want to run the risk nor i felicity hamilton called through the door is anything wrong were just passing the time dont worry if you want to sleep at all between now and midnight might be best mallory replied yes i dont want to turn off my lamp but should i the drapes are drawn be certain theyre tightly closed it should be all right then i could set it on the floor on this side of my bed too great a risk of fire yes it was a forlorn affirmative and there was silence again from her room i pray to god she sleeps mallory said grimly he poured a little whiskey into a fresh cup of tea i cant count the times i wished for dutch comfort in the trenches if only to keep out the wet and the cold i dont want to talk about the war rutledge told him shortly we cant afford to be distracted but its there isnt it in the back of your mind mine as well will it ever go away do you think if god is kind rutledge answered and pulled a blanket across his shoulders against the cold that was inside as well as out sometime close to midnight mallory said in the darkness do you ever dreami mean dream his voice like hamishs sometimes came out of nowhere they had turned down the lamps and set them inside the nearest room to preserve their night sight rutledge finally answered him no youre lying ive told you i dont want to discuss the war i have to talk about it its the only way i stay sane not to me you dont tell me about hamish and the rest of the men i knew how they died no i need to hear it i need to forget there was a long stretch of silence then mallory asked if i didnt attack hamilton who did a good question what im wondering now is if weve got two separate problems the initial attackand what it might have set in motion yes like running over bennetts foot it wasnt intentional but i did it and im paying for it what i dont understand is why hamilton in the first place if youd asked me id have said hes the last man to find himself in trouble in hampton regis rutledges chair creaked as he tried for a more comfortable position which explains why bennett came to question you at the start theres been gossip mallory you should have considered that for her sake if not your own a sigh answered him and then yes well you havent been in love you dont know what its like to pin your hopes on someone throughout that bloody war and then discover that shes learned to love someone else but he did and it was none of mallorys business did you expect her to wait for you that was where you went wrong i had hoped she would but i left her free to make that choice and she made it you failed her by not accepting it and walking away when i was released from hospital my doctor made me swear i wouldnt come to hampton regis but then i thought what harm can it do to live near her and soon it was what harm can it do to see her i convinced myself id been extraordinarily careful that no one would guess how i felt in a village the size of hampton regis where you cant cross the road without being seen if hampton regis is a hotbed of gossip and general nosiness mallory demanded with some heat behind the words why hasnt someone come forward to give you the information you need about matthew hamiltons disappearance felicity hamiltons voice came through the door panel what is it what has happened my apologies mrs hamilton rutledge said at once mallory and i were engaged in an argument over how gossip works we didnt intend to disturb you mallory said in a lower tone you havent answered me i dont know why we havent got what we need it was late at night most decent people are in their beds the pubs are closed the milk wagon hasnt gone round the fishermen havent gone out he broke off from a room downstairs had come the sound of someone or something scratching at a window stay here dont leave mrs hamilton whatever happens and for gods sake dont shoot me as i come back up the stairs rutledge told him but when he finally located the source it was a limb blowing back and forth across the glass panes of a drawing room window as the slender trunk of an ornamental fruit tree just outside dipped and swayed in the wind he stood there looking out at the blustery night and thought hes not coming not on a night like this he needs his ears as much as we need ours hamish answered him in the darkness i wouldna go back up the stairs i dont have much choice mallory will come down here if i dont return he wondered how his watchers were faring but there was no method of communicating with them a field telephone would have been useful tonight he told himself turning away from the window he went to the hall and called up the stairs its rutledge nothing but the wind mallorys voice surprised him rolling down from the head of the steps invisible in the well of darkness there i was beginning to worry youre a perfect target you know against the panels of the door id keep that in mind if i were you rutledge took the steps two at a time thanks for the warning he said and passing mallory nearly invisible except for the sound of his breathing he felt a distinct shiver run down his spine rutledge had lost track of the time eternity he thought must be like this a world where there was no mark for day or night or for sunrise or sunset just an endless expanding infinity he wondered what the rector would make of that the crash when it came seemed to shake the foundations of the house later thinking about it more clearly he told himself it had done no such thing felicity hamilton cried out and came at once to the door fumbling with the lock no stay where you are mallory murmured in her direction rutledge where did it come from that noise i couldnt tell the back of the house i think she had the door open standing there outlined in the dim glow of her shaded lamp fully clothed and clutching a shawl around her shoulders dont leave me she begged i wont stay here by myself felicity for gods sake no if you go im going too i wont be cornered like this rutledge said weve got a choice stay and wait or go and investigate they listened holding their breath as they did but there was no other sound from below if hes in the house he could be anywhere rutledge said softly we could walk straight into him before we knew he was there he must be searching rooms one at a time it sounded as if hed knocked over something it was more like a window breakingglass falling rutledge said i think it must have been the dining room felicity whispered it was in the back at least i know how this house creaks in the wind like a ship at sea it wasnt like that which bedroom is over the dining room rutledge asked her the guest room second door beyond the stairs on your right ill go and have a look he said but mallory stopped him we shouldnt separate that was the bargain i went down alone before that was different damn it it was suspicious but not threatening they were on their feet standing together in the dim light mallory turned to felicity if you must stay here shut that door i cant see with your light in my eyes she did as he asked and the passage was dark again rutledge nearly jumped out of his skin as her hand brushed the back of his shoulder so certain it was hamish that he nearly cried out but she was just moving nearer he could smell the scent she wore as she clutched at mallorys arm the paleness of her shawl picking her out as his eyes adjusted again to the lack of light you wont shoot him promise me you wont if its matthew we dont want to hurt him she was whispering importunately shhh mallory leaned forward as if to help his ears penetrate the shadows that lay between them and the top of the stairs but nothing came up the stairs neither a figment of their imaginations nor a shambling wounded man half out of his mind rutledge thought standing there its easy to believe in monsters in the dark young jeremy was not alone and hamish whose ears had always been the sharpest said he isna coming rutledge replied silently you cant be sure the stairs are carpeted hes no coming its a game and although they stood there for another quarter of an hour pinned where they were by the tension of not knowing hamish proved to be right in the end the three of them ventured down the stairs as the first gray threads of light broke over the horizon and the head of the staircase loomed ghostly in front of them it didnt take them long to find what they had heard a long black length of tree limb had been driven through the panes of the dining room window protruding like a battered and obscene spear above the shattered bits of glass scattered on the polished floor below it rutledge went outside then but beneath the window the thick matting of leaves blown against the foundations masked any sign of footprints he could see the tree where the limb had come from three had broken off one of them driven deep into the soil another leaning crookedly against the foundations and the third thrust through the window but what he couldnt determine in spite of carefully searching for any sign that might confirm it was whether that one branch had had the help of a human agency to ram it through the glass he could have done it tall as he was and actually reached up to pull it out as mallory shoved it toward him and then went for something to patch the hole he remembered what hamish had said that someone was toying with them that someone had known the house was a trap and played with their nerves he hadnt spoken to his watchers and they might well tell him a different tale felicity insisted that she would make breakfast for him before he left the house rutledge wasnt certain whether it was because she wanted to keep him there until daylight had swept away the shadows of the night or because she was afraid to be alone with mallory any longer than was necessary and so the three of them sat in the dining room chilled as it was after a night of wind pouring through broken glass mallory had patched it with a length of wood hed found somewhere but when the wind blew from the sea it whistled incessantly a reminder of their fears she had cooked rashers of bacon and boiled eggs to go with them made toast without burning it and found a pot of jam that tasted of summer rutledge had made the tea reminded of a kitchen in westmorland the warmest room of the house and the busiest hamish retorted that rutledge had been a stranger there as well as here nan didnt make that she said setting the jam on the table between the two men it was a gift from miss esterley she thought we might enjoy it matthew was saving it for some reason i dont quite know why at least thats what nan told me when i asked what had become of it i wrote a note to thank miss esterley all the same how many days a week did your maid come here three days on tuesday she went to mrs granville and on thursday and saturday she went to the restons she told me only last month that if i could do without her one of my afternoons shed go to the rectory the elderly woman who has been housekeeper to mr putnam is considering moving away to live with her daughter miss esterley has her own maid i think yes thats true was nan much of a gossip she never gossiped with me whether she gossiped about me i dont know must we talk about her it makes me ill just thinking about her how do you work as a policeman mr rutledge i couldnt bring myself to do what you do someone must keep order he answered lightly its what makes life possible for everyone else i hadnt thought about it in that light matthew said once that he could measure a countrys future by the honesty of its police force her face clouded where is he mr rutledge and why is he doing such things to us we dont know that he is weve assumed that he is i was so frightened last night i hardly slept and its to do again tonight mallory reminded her unless hes found today i wish i knew what had happened to him when he went walking that day ive wished so many times id begged him to stay home with me but there was no way of knowing was there that it would be different that morning do you think hes ever going to bein good health again she ended trying to find the word she wanted and failing dr granville felt he would recover physically bones knit and bruises fade we can only hope that his mind will heal too rutledge answered but why would he kill nan it makes no sense felicity said mallory put in it makes as much sense as killing he broke off appalled at what hed nearly said felicity hamilton was sharp in her own way she stared at him then asked who who else is dead mallory tried to recover it makes as much sense as killing me he ended no thats not what you were going to say mr rutledge has everyone been lying to me who else is dead when he was slow to answer she said accusingly i knew you were all keeping something from me i knew there was something more to matthew vanishing like that what has he done it was mrs granville rutledge finally told her she was found in the surgery the only reasonable explanation being that she saw lights and went to investigate we dont know for a fact that hamilton touched her so thats why it was dr hester yesterday and not dr granville as the enormity of what she had just heard registered she turned on mallory with such anguish that he flinched what have we done to him stephen between us what have we done and she was gone leaving mallory sitting there like a man turned to stone rutledge went upstairs later and tapped on the door mrs hamilton but she wouldnt answer him he tried again and then said through the panels do you want to leave with me mrs hamilton ive spoken to mallory he tells me that youre free to go if you wish he listened to the silence on the other side concerned about her hamish said she willna heed you open the door rutledge hesitated unwilling to test the door if it was locked he couldnt in good conscience knock it down if it was unlocked he would be violating her only sanctuary now in this house hamish persisted and finally he put his hand to the knob she was lying on the bed as she had been once before her back to him her hair falling in a tumble across the pillow asleep or pretending to be this time there was a difference beside the bed on its side and half empty was the decanter of whiskey that mallory had kept in the passage last night rutledge was certain hed put it back where he found it this morning along with the bedding and the chairs theyd used but mrs hamilton had found it she had also emptied the box of powders dr hester had left for her taking them all at once with the whiskey rutledge shouted for mallory and then was too busy to wait for him she was breathing heavily but he thought that could be only the whiskey and the fatigue of the long night as much as the sedative starting its deadly work he picked her up in his arms and started for the stairs mallory met him halfway and said only god in heaven they got her to the kitchen and stretched her out on the worn table there covering her with one of the blankets that had been in nans room without ceremony rutledge thrust her fingers into the back of her throat and as she retched he pulled her head over the edge of the table she vomited only a little and he tried again this time more successfully strong tea as strong as you can make it he told mallory and then send the constable on duty for dr granville when nothing else worked he got hot water from their breakfast tea and salt from the worktable down her throat and the combination brought up the rest of the contents of her stomach she lay there moaning in discomfort but he held her head again and made her swallow the tea though her throat was sore and she could hardly keep it down it was roughandready treatment without medical advice but he had dealt with drunks and what mattered was ridding her as fast as possible of what shed swallowed there was no way to know if the powders would have killed her or if the whiskey mixed with them was a deadly brew he had acted first and worried later by the time the rector and dr granville had arrived she was lying on the floor wrapped in blankets with a bottle of hot water at her feet tears ran down her cheeks and her hair on the pillow was dark with vomit and water and sweat the kitchen was sour with the smell of sickness dr granville kneeling on the floor to examine her said you seem to have got most of it in time what was the sedative do you know i dont know rutledge turned to putnam whats left is lying on the floor of her bedroom will you bring them down mallory said ill see to it and was gone before rutledge could stop him granville did what he could to make felicity hamilton more comfortable speaking gently to her bathing her face and hands to cleanse them of the smell of sickness and promising to send some broth by putnam to give her a little strength she responded smiling wanly at him and clinging to his hand it was as if such small kindnesses touched her deeply he said lifting her shoulders to offer her a sip of water it will all seem like a nightmare you know when this has passed something you remember sometimes but without the power to frighten you anymore she answered it was a stupid thing to take the powders all at once but i was so tired and i didnt know who to trust what to believe i wanted it all to be over with i wanted to sleep forever without having to think about anything again if mallory will allow it ill look in on you a little later to make sure youre feeling better rutledge suddenly aware that mallory hadnt come back turned and ran out of the kitchen heading for the stairs he found the man sitting disconsolately on her bed the revolver between his hands rutledge said harshly kill yourself here and you might as well kill her the effect will be the same i know ive thought of that im just out of solutions rutledge i might as well give myself up to bennett and let it be over granville can take her back to the rectory with him and find a woman to sit with her until her mother can get here shes never liked her mother it will be the last thing she wants to happen but weve come to the end of the road rutledge bent to collect the scattered papers that had held the sedative youre a fool mallory for getting yourself into this scrape and for dragging her with you but im damned if youre going out with a whimper as you did in france get yourself cleaned up and come downstairs this isnt over and youll play the role you laid out for yourself im too tired to care then care about her for gods sake rutledge turned on his heel and left he was halfway down the staircase when he heard mallory shut mrs hamiltons bedroom door and walk heavily down the hall to the bath he gave granville the papers the sedative had been folded into and the doctor sniffed them before balling them up and tossing them away mild enough and probably not enough to kill her but you did the right thing though i doubt shell thank you for it she was frightened by the maids murder and last night was not the best time to sleep well yes there were trees down on some of the farms the joyners lost an apple tree and their neighbors had a large trunk come through their roof they told miss joyner it sounded like the crack of doom one of the roads was blocked as well you were out there the old man was having trouble breathing again i doubt hell see the spring but then hes of strong stock he may surprise me yet he stretched his back we ought to get her to bed what shape is it in its ready for her i was just up there good with putnam going before them to manage the doors they got her up the stairs and into her room rutledge saw that mallory had taken away with him the decanter and the small bedside carpet where it had rolled and spilled dr granville tucked her in with surprising gentleness and said ill have no more foolishness from you my dear youll see this through for your husbands sake thank you dr granville im so sorryafter all youve been through it was the closest she could come to apologizing for what her husband might have done she lay there eyes overly large in her pale face overcome by drowsiness after her ordeal putnam took her hand and in the other she clutched the handkerchief hed found for her tears seemed very near the surface its been very trying for all of us sleep if you can ill send along the broth and if you drink that it will strengthen you he turned to rutledge standing by the door we should have a woman come and sit with her do you think thats possible miss esterley might agree he said someone who wont gossip mr putnam looked up and said shall i go and see dr granville will see to it rector youre needed here at the moment dont leave me felicity hamilton asked not until im asleep yes by all means if its a comfort to you my dear ill gladly stay rutledge accompanied dr granville to the door thank you for coming there was no time to send for dr hester i understand its the least i could do after the debacle with her husband theres still no news of him none hes dead then in that cottage there arent that many places for a man to hide in hampton regis when everyone is on the lookout for him i still find it difficult to believe he could have walked away under his own power whats your opinion granville gave his question serious consideration anything is possible medically speaking but that means he must have killed margaret and i refuse to believe it someone took him away and that someone had already done his best once before to see hamilton into his grave you know the people here can you tell me who might have started this by attacking hamilton in the first place granville shrugged your best suspect is stephen mallory but then someone else could have decided to finish his work for him get him to confess to what happened out there by the water and clear that up then you can begin to think about margarets death and nans ive asked myself again and again why these two women needed to die theres no clear answer nan worked for a number of people over the years rutledge you cant be sure what secrets she took with her when she was killed but the house was locked granville raised his eyebrows what difference does that make hamilton isnt the only person to have lived in casa miranda you know and i doubt he thought to change the locks there must be other keys floating about for that matter you could probably collect half a hundred from other houses of the same age and find that some of them fit ask the rector to test his when granville had gone and before mallory had presented himself again rutledge tapped lightly on the door to mrs hamiltons room sorry to disturb you mr putnam i should like to borrow your keys for a little while do you mind putnam his eyes on rutledges face said ah i havent given dr granville one have i my mistake thank you inspector he brought them to the door its rather an unconventional collection im afraid i never think to take off one when i add another those to this side of the longest one are to the church the others are the rectory keys i cant tell you where one or two of them came from my predecessor very likely he passed them to rutledge you arent leaving are you inspector felicity asked anxiously not for a while he reassured her and then he set about trying the rectors keys on the locks of casa miranda the trouble he thought was that there were too many doors the main entrance facing the drive possessed a newer lock and none of putnams fit it there was a door to the back garden another down a short passage where mrs hamilton or her predecessors had cut and potted plants for the house several ways into the kitchen area and a door leading directly into the servants quarters where they could come and go without walking through the kitchen the cellar door boasted a padlock he found working methodically through the handful of keys that while several of them raised his hopes at first only two of them actually fit into a lock well enough to reach the tumblers both turned stiffly at first but after a little effort on his part he heard the tumblers fall into place he now had two keys that unlocked two house doors one that led to the servants belowstairs quarters and the other to the door where tradesmen brought their goods and supplies holding them up to the light edge to edge he could see that they were identical dr granville had been right it wasnt only matthew hamilton who could enter the house at will but anyone in hampton regis who possessed a key of the same shape rutledge returned the keys to putnam told mallory that he would be back within the hour and left the property walking quickly in the direction of the police station his watchers had left their reports on the table that served as his desk rutledge thumbed through them quickly and found that the man in the church tower had seen very little the way the trees were tossing about hed scrawled in pencil it was nearly impossible to be sure what was shadow what was dog and what was not i saw the constable on watch a time or two and that was all i could identify with any certainty there had been no trees to speak of between the man in the cornelius attic and the mole he reported no activity until two fishermen went down to look at the sea and walked back again ten minutes later mr reston was not seen leaving his house nor had constable coxe the constable in rutledges room at the inn swore hed seen someone moving about in the shadows but not clear enough to be sure who it was he didnt walk up the drive to the door i made certain of that but where he went i cant say the constable paced about a bit and he might have had a clearer look the constable declared hed seen no one hamish said it could ha been stratton poking about yes i think it very likely was no one had made an attempt to climb up from the sea and no one had gone to the other cliff where mallory had watched the lights of the hamilton house from his motorcar a nights sleep lost for verra little rutledge could feel the tiredness across his own shoulders i wonder if stratton made free with the hotel keys it doesna signify they do na look the same it was a good point the key to his own room was newer in style and shape but what about those to the kitchens and the ser vice entrance he made a mental note to look he tossed the reports aside no one had come to casa miranda after all in all likelihood the branch had driven itself through the fragile old glass of the dining room windows and his men were sleeping now after a long cold night he got up and walked to the door of the police station the wind had dropped with the dawn leaving twigs and bits of straw scraps of paper and any other debris not nailed down scattered on lawns and pavement the lid from a dustbin had been wedged tightly into a clump of barelimbed lilac and someones hat was caught on a branch of a tree by the nearest house hamish was telling him that a good officer could have put that wind to use last night infiltrating half a dozen men through enemy lines crawling on their bellies theyd no make a silhouette against the sky but hamilton wasnt in the army he said and so he didnt come or whoever it is with a fierce design on everyone around hamilton he went for a walk climbing the headland across the sea from the house it wasnt terribly high but it gave a good view of casa miranda he could see the marks left in the damp soil by a motorcars tires mallory then and his obsession with felicity hamilton out to sea rutledge could just pick out a steamer passing on the horizon black smoke marking its progress along the rim of the sky nearer in a fishing boat bobbed for the current was running fast his thoughts kept returning to the events of the night we were prepared for a frontal assault he reminded himself and too many people knew that so the killer never came the bough through the windowpane notwithstanding if i had it to do over again he told hamish unaware that he was speaking aloud id spread my forces better id see that the lure was more enticing and id watch the lamppost there willna be anither time have ye no thought it was the mans defense of the germans that unsettled someone who lost a son or brother or lover in the war ye ken the kaiser is in holland and untouchable but his advocate is here in hampton regis but two wrongly dead is a verra high price for revenge its over and yere no closer to the killer than before rutledge turned from the view feeling the damp biting through him though the sun was making a yeomans effort to warm his shoulders the killer may think it is finished he doesnt know me there was a shop near the police station and rutledge walked toward it thinking about a hot cup of tea he had drunk only half of it when one of bennetts men came to fetch him there had been a telephone call for him from exeter someone from the hotel had brought the message to the police station rutledge decided as he paid his account at the teashop to return the exeter telephone call from the duke of monmouth he could count on more privacy there constable jordan not to be put off said inspector bennett would like to know sir if this is to do with mr hamilton tell inspector bennett that ive found a woman who knew hamilton as a young man she may have remembered something useful when i spoke to her last she wasnt very encouraging but shes had a little time to think about it yes sir something in his past then inspector bennett asks you keep him informed sir bennett had been curt about felicity hamiltons attempt at suicide describing it as nervous theatrics id send mrs bennett along if it werent for putting another pawn in mallorys hands its better for that whole house of cards to come tumbling down and it will mark my words if not today by tomorrow there had been satisfaction in his certainty as if this had been his plan from the start rutledge nodded and walked briskly on halfway to the duke of monmouth he encountered dr granville coming toward him i was just coming to find you rutledge miss esterley has agreed to consider staying the night it was the best i could do but i was able to arrange a thermos of broth for mrs hamilton and im taking it up when its ready unless youre going back yourself the duke of monmouth kitchen is preparing it now ill see to it thanks if you need me ill be at the undertakers after that youll find me at the rectory no later than one or half past i should think he walked on his shoulders braced for the ordeal ahead rutledge looked after him not envying him on impulse he called after granville would you rather wait until i can spell mr putnam granville turned i dont know that his company would make it any easier but ill need to confer with him about the ser vice let him stay with mrs hamilton as long as she needs him rutledge reached the inn and shut himself into the telephone closet he put through the call to exeter and found himself speaking to an inspector cubbins im calling on behalf of a miss miranda cole cubbins told him curiosity thick in his devon voice she has asked me to tell you she regrets her stubbornness yesterday if you could find it in yourself to forgive her shell speak with you again this afternoon it was not the message rutledge had expected from her as the silence lengthened cubbins asked is this by any stretch of my imagination something to do with whats going on there in hampton regis if it is id like to hear about it im told one of my constables took you to the cole house in the evening when i was off duty ware hamish warned rutledge brought up short said i called on her yes to see if she could give me any information about matthew hamiltons early years in england she knew him then but hasnt seen or as far as i know heard from him since that time i thought a formality who brought you the message is there anything wrong should there be all was well when i left her then its well now her maid miss dedham came in not half an hour ago she refused to wait just delivered a note from her mistress and went back to the house but she seemed perfectly composed there was a pause how did you come to hear about miss cole a woman in kent told me miss cole had moved in the same circles as hamilton and his family it was a shorter drive to exeter so it is rutledge could hear fingers tapping on the mans desk youll come and fetch me if theres more than a formality involved wont you id like to think we look after our own he took a chance if youve nothing better to do meet me there we dont have murderers running about undetected but ive got a pleasing sufficiency on my plate at the moment no i leave it to your good judgment rutledge you know where to find me and he rang off rutledge went to the dining room for mrs hamiltons broth and discovered that luncheon would be served in fifteen minutes he used the time to dress for his coming meeting with miss cole and then ate his meal in his usual corner he dropped the thermos of broth at the door of casa miranda mallory accepting it said she probably wont touch it now that i have she isnt expecting you to poison her youd think she was refusing to let me come near her leave her alone mallory and set your own house in order with that he turned on his heel and strode back to the motorcar where will you be if we need you mallory called to him not far away i saw you on the headland over there did you find anything only the marks of your tires rutledge retorted as he let out the clutch so much for secrecy and discretion at the end of the drive he turned to the west soon leaving hampton regis behind it must have been market day somewhere rutledge decided driving through the second herd of cows moving placidly along the road ahead of him he caught up with another cart shortly afterward laden with chickens in wicker baskets they squawked in alarm as the motorcar passed by but he made steady time in spite of the traffic and it was only a little after afternoon tea that he found himself pulling into the drive at the house where miranda cole lived with her aunt dedham answered his knocks her face drawn as if she hadnt slept well shes expecting you dont upset her any more than you already have i never intended to upset your mistress she opened the door to the sitting room ushered him in and shut it almost on his heels with a snap that told him her opinion of him miss cole was sitting in the sunlight that poured through the window beside her he thought at first that shed been crying and then realized that her eyes were redrimmed from lack of sleep it had been a long night in this house as well as the one named for this woman in hampton regis sit down inspector i have had my tea youll find the pot is still warm if you care for a cup thank you no then please tell me from the beginning what you know about matthew hamilton and everything that happened to him in the last week rutledge began with mallorys decision after leaving hospital to live outside hampton regis and his inability to stop himself from seeing felicity one way or another is she pretty the woman matthew married felicity she seemed to taste the name as if it could present her with an image of his wife i would call her pretty she has a vivacity that must be attractive in happier circumstances and a certain vulnerability he went through the morning that matthew hamilton had walked along the water and how he had been found watching herfor she couldnt see him and he kept his gaze steady reading each expression that flitted across what she must have supposed to be a still facehe thought she wasnt blind from birth her eyes follow me when i move there must be some sense of light and dark or perhaps a range of shadows but she couldnt distinguish for instance the shabbiness of her surroundings how the colors had faded and how alive she looked among them her fair hair and the dark blue sweater and string of fine pearls setting her apart as if shed wandered here by mistake she lifted her hand to her face as he described hamiltons injuries and said he must have been in great pain the doctor took every care of him he assured her as he told her about mallorys race to speak to felicity and the subsequent decision to hold her against her will until rutledge arrived from london she said you know this man dont you from the war was it i can hear the difference in your voice as you describe him he hadnt been aware that he was betraying himself as well hamish his own voice soft in rutledges ear said she has lived wi blindness a verra long time we served in france together he conceded and left it at that the rest of the story unwound like wire from a spool tangled sometimes because she didnt know all the players and at other times she would interject a question or comment that was remarkably astute she was interested in miss esterley who had become friends with hamilton after her accident he had a way of making it seem that you had his entire attention she commented her first personal remark it isnt surprising that someone alone at such a trying time might feel comforted ive not had the good fortune to know him at his best rutledge said but yes he was kind to her and it was valued when he reached his account of hamiltons disappearance she was tense in her chair her hands tightening and her body braced but she stirred as he once more described mrs granvilles death almost as if she were hearing it for the first time the sun had gone in and darkness was coming down she said as if to gain a little time could you light the lamps please inspector rutledge and hand me my shawl it should be there on the table by the door where you came into the room he saw to the lamps and found the shawl where shed told him to look by the time hed returned to his seat she had herself under control again nan weekess death shook her to the core how did anyone get into the house surely it must have been this man mallory what has become of matthews keys have you thought to look for them his clothing was taken from the surgery the night he disappeared if hes alive he must have the keys as well another reason why its imperative to know who may have them if he doesnt but i dont understand if he was attacked then hes a victim of the assault yes i think your inspector bennett may be right that this lieutenant mallory is behind everything thats happened mrs granvilles death and the maids death she said grasping for straws to build her case and matthew has been made to look like the scapegoat im beginning to think mallory was intended to take the blame for that death and mrs granvilles well there you are then matthew had nothing to do with it then where is he why hasnt he come forward and who besides hamilton cares whether mallory is hanged or not surely there are other suspects a very short list perhaps youre willing to help me add to it or take one away by telling me hamilton is dead she shivered believe me i wish i could help you mallory may be innocent if he is hes already suffered more than enough theres that to consider as well he waited ive come because inspector cubbins tells me you have something to say to me i hope its true or ive wasted my time she sat there for a time a frown on her face her eyes downcast finally she picked up the bell at her elbow and rang it dedham came to the door clearly expecting to see rutledge off the premises instead miss cole said could you bring us fresh tea please dedham i think we rather need it she added as the door closed again you place me in a very awkward situation inspector rutledge but i can tell you frankly that matthew hamilton when i knew him was incapable of killing anyone a good man a fair man a caring man i dont want to believe that hes changed since then she looked toward the window where the light had all but faded but it was another light she searched for ive never been connected to murder before its unspeakably frightful none of us can say with certainty that we wont kill if driven to it i have killed men in the war they were no better and no worse than i was but because of the uniform they wore they had to die in my place and because of the uniform my own men wore i had to send them out to shoot strangers yes thats what happens in war people are killed it isnt personal is it like this when you watch the living force go out of a mans face as you fire your weapon into his unprotected body it is very personal he told her grimly that gave her pause i begin to see im sorry the tea came soon afterward and dedham had added sandwiches to it and cakes iced in pale green as if intended for a celebration that hadnt taken place rutledge poured so that the maid could be dismissed miss cole took her cup drank deeply as if the tea were a lifeline and then set it aside if matthew hamilton is dead youll have no answers in the end she warned him i cant help but pray that hes still alive we need to close this case it has done great damage to too many people dr granville the maids cousin mrs hamilton and even stephen mallory others have been dragged into it as well it would be unkind to let them all go on suffering but what will you do if you find him carry him off in custody like a common felon while you sort this out hardly that unless we caught him with a weapon in his hand trying to kill someone my first question would have been what happened on your last walk and my second what happened in that surgery if he cant tell you what then rutledge set his own cup aside he answered her honestly weariness infusing the words with what sounded very like despair i dont know she closed her eyes and leaned her head against the back of the chair do you believe me that he was incapable of murder when i knew him all those years ago he took a chance over hamishs fierce objections ill try once youve told me why it was you wouldnt marry him her eyes flew open her head coming up with a snap you have no right there are two people dead miss cole women who never harmed anyone to my knowledge but they died because of hamilton one way or another you owe them something i dont owe anyone anything she cried the pain in her voice so deep it sounded even to her own ears like someone elses you have lived here in shabby gentility shut away from the world punishing yourself because something happened to your sight and you believed that you had no right to inflict your suffering on someone else he called you the most honorable woman hed ever met miss cole i have it on good authority i couldnt entertain for him i couldnt recognize faces and remember them the next time we met i couldnt live in a strange world where i couldnt see my surroundings or find my way without someone there to help me it would have been a burden at the very start of his career and i couldnt bear to hear him make excuses for being overlooked for promotion or for assignments where a suitable hostess was imperative and so you released him from any duty to you were you surprised he took that release she moved as if shed suffered a physical blow it took him five years to accept my answer by that time love tends to fade a little and its harder to bring someones face back with the same clarity the sound of the voice is not the same and you cant quite recapture it five years of lying awake at night five years of getting through the next day somehow but in the end he stopped writing and i never heard from him again he knew she had described her own anguish rather than hamiltons but he said nothing preparing to bring the interview to a close she rose as if anticipating that and he stood as well thank you for taking the time to help me through what has become the most difficult day of my life im sorry that youve been brought into my inquiry miss cole brushed that aside fumbling for her cane she found it and moved easily toward him i wasnt sure what to do now i see my way more clearly come with me mr rutledge and ill take you to matthew hamilton rutledge found himself standing there gaping she smiled wryly a great sadness behind it i can imagine whats going through your mind but he wasnt here last night i didnt lie to you he was brought to my door early this morning by a very concerned lorry driver hed found matthew along the road near a farm just west of hampton regis i dont know what matthew expected to do but he was still on his feet through sheer willpower and the lorry driver told me he was hardly sensible for a quarter of an hour or more it was several miles before he could even tell the man where he wanted to go surely the driver must have been suspicious apparently matthew told him that hed been robbed and beaten and wanted to go home here to my house the driver was all for sending at once for the police but i persuaded him to let me find the doctor first and instead i telephoned you quite right she reached out her hand if i may have your arm hastily he offered it to her and she led him to the staircase as they started to climb she said promise you wont upset him im going against his express wishes to tell no one hes here he will blame me for what you do i understand but he found himself wondering if she was afraid of hamilton now afraid that two women had died at his hands and she might be placing herself in jeopardy even as she struggled to protect him hamilton was lying in bed in what appeared to be a guest room his skin gray against the stark white of bleached and pressed sheets miranda cole had opened the door quietly so as not to disturb him but it was obvious that nothing short of cataclysm would rouse him from his exhausted sleep rutledge stood there on the threshold studying him for a moment his beard had grown dark shadows across his face and his eyes seemed to have sunk deep into their sockets the bruises had faded a little but the green and yellow replacing the livid red and dark purple made him seem closer to death than he had in dr granvilles surgery when they were still bloody as if he were already a corpse and no one had thought to tell him signaling miss cole with a touch on her arm to stay where she was he crossed to the bed and called hamiltons name in a sharp clear voice it penetrated the heavy slumber an arm flung out to ward off a blow was followed by hamilton rearing up in bed his face wild prepared to defend himself rutledge said rapidly youre safe man no one will harm you here youre with friends some of the wildness fled but hamilton frowned at him i dont know you he said the words a rumble in his chest im someone miss cole sent for to help you if thats possible shes there in the doorway ask her yourself hamilton peered toward the door miranda what are you doing here its my house she told him in an ordinary voice but rutledge could see how her hands clutched the edges of her shawl matthew this is ian rutledge i cant do this alone i had to find someone i trusted please let him help us hamilton lay back on his pillows his eyes closed im sorry i dragged you into this miranda but i didnt know where else to turn rutledge said do you remember how you got here hamilton after a moment he said i remember lying down by the road cold and tired but then a vehicle was coming and i got to my feet trying to walk away from the road i think he stopped the lorry driver the next thing i remember was being warm enough to think and my leg hurting as we bounced over ruts where had you been before lying down by the road hamilton gave a short bark of laughter in someones henhouse i ate the eggs raw i was that hungry there was a cow as well and i milked her when i felt stronger but i couldnt stay there theyd gone to market and were bound to find me if i fell asleep in the hay hamish said softly the fox in the henhouse that complaint had been included in a report by one of the men talking to householders out on the west road rutledge thought he ought to be commended for thoroughness was this anywhere near the landslip my god he groaned i was in that house i dont know why i left it something a sixth sense the way the rainwater was rushing past iti dont know id seen the family across the road leave i told myself i could make it to their shed but i was hardly out the door when the ground moved the first time like an earthquake when i stopped long enough to look back there was nothing there why did you go to it in the first place god knows i cant remember i think i was afraid i couldnt understand why i was hurt and bandaged but why leave the safety of dr granvilles surgery in the middle of the night did i do that hamilton stared at him no youre wrong there i was in a dark fearful place and something was worrying me have you ever been in a turkish prison no i expect not i was once visiting a man charged with a serious crime i was never so glad to be out into the fresh air again in my life where was mrs granville hamilton do you remember seeing her she and granville came to dinner no while you were lying there being treated by her husband he put both hands to his face as if he could scrub away his confusion i dont even know how i got these injuries rutledge or where ive been i remember being afraid i was going to die if i didnt do something there were voices and sometimes i knew what they were saying and sometimes i didnt who came to help you in the midst of everything that was happening rutledge glanced toward miranda cole she was standing there a mixture of fear and pity on her face as she listened but matthew hamilton said it was felicity it must have been surprised rutledge stared at him trying to determine whether he was telling the truthor the truth as he thought he knew it but he was lying back on his pillows now his face grim as he fought pain and weakness you must stop miss cole said quietly rutledge answered her i cant i dont have all the story and its urgent that i get to the bottom of what hes been through then let him rest for a bit and eat something if he will after that well see if hes well enough to go on dedham brought food for matthew hamiltoneggs cooked in milk with a little whiskey for strength a broth rich with chicken and some rice a custard that was flavored with sherry he ate slowly stopping for stretches of time as if his arms were too heavy to lift the spoon rutledge waiting by the window fought his impatience it was already dark outside and he felt a pressing need to return to hampton regis finally satisfied hamilton pushed away the tray you were going to tell me what happened to me i must have fallen its the only way i can account for what i see here he gestured with one hand to his body you went for a walk down by the water even though a sea mist was rolling in and someone came up to speak to you i dont think anyone did i walk very early before felicity is awake you were found on the shingle just above the tideline another half an hour less even and as badly hurt as you were youd have drowned hamilton seemed to listen as if bringing back to mind the sounds of that morning someone went down to the boats i couldnt see who it was he must have turned and come toward you if he did i couldnt tell the mists muffle sound and then you were struck over the head and went down i remember mens voices he shook his head its hopeless but you left the surgery why something was going to happen was inspector bennett there i remember him telling me over and over again that felicity was calling for me and i had to wake up and help her bennett trying to rouse him as rutledge had done earlier by the bye do you have your keys with you are they in my pocket look in the wardrobe rutledge had been sitting by the fire dedham had laid in the room now he went to the wardrobe his hands busy with pockets yes theyre here he quietly slipped the ring of keys into his own pocket then said i must go its late will you stay here hamilton or come with me miranda cole opened her mouth to protestwhether his departure or hamiltons he didnt know hamilton said wheres my wife shouldnt she be here soon ive tried to think whats keeping her you asked miss cole not to tell anyone you were here she has followed your instructions did i i couldnt have meant felicity he was tiring again his shoulders slumped see if you can find out whats keeping her rutledge five minutes later miss cole was scolding rutledge all the way down the stairs i thought you would stay with us stay here at the house i thought you wanted to find matthew and help him there are promises to keep in hampton regis as well he could see her uncertainty her belief in hamilton wavering as the night drew in or was she afraid of emotions that were reawakening in herself he couldnt tell rutledge tried to find the words to reassure her but he had no assurances to give he thought about casa miranda and mallory there alone with felicity hamilton in that dark house he knew where hamilton was now but what about preventing the disintegration of two people with nowhere else to go what about a murderer still on the loose if hamilton hadnt killed anyone lock him in his room and brace a chair under the knob hes exhausted i dont think hell wake up before im here at first light i shouldnt have sent for you i shouldnt have heard what you had to tell me its only made matters worse you told me you couldnt believe hamilton was a killer she brushed her hair back with her hand i dont not the matthew i remember but i see him there the bruises the confusion the way he rambles its not like him theres something wrong im not sure i know this matthew i dont think youve anything to fear you have no connection with hampton regis and it was there that it all began then take him with you please ill provide you with blankets and cushions what if he had nothing to do with the deaths but someone else learns hes here three women alonewhat could matthew do to help us rutledge stood there reading the anguish in her face in the end he found a telephone and left a message for inspector bennett that he was delayed and prayed that hed made the right decision hamilton had nightmares in the night rutledge sleepless in the room next door heard him and went in to sit with him he watched as hamilton twisted and turned until his sheets were a tangled knot as they tightened around him he began to call out most of the words were unintelligible but there was anger mixed with fear and then rutledge held himself rigid in the shadows as hamilton reared up in his bed and called whos there a garbled onesided conversation followed and then hamilton was scrambling out of his bed struggling to rid himself of the sheets and a blanket he stopped his gaze on the re before rutledge could move hed picked up the small carpet in front of the hearth and was about to beat out the flames as if they threatened him but even as the carpet was raised above his head he froze and turned to stare directly at rutledge by the door lowering the carpet he said quite clearly stratton what the bloody hell are you doing here it took several minutes to make hamilton understand who he was but rutledge turning up the lamps watched understanding dawn hamilton looked down at the carpet he was still holding good god whats this you were about to put out the fire he blinked was i yes thats right stratton said hed burn me out if i didnt burn my diaries when was this before i left london to come to hampton regis with felicity did he mean it do you think hamilton sat down in the nearest chair i think it was bravado it was one of the reasons i chose a house backed up against the sea did you know that stephen mallory was watching the house i thought at first it was stratton i was relieved that it was mallory but i knew felicity had seen him at least once and that rankled were you afraid for your marriage hardly that but it was a snake in our eden i couldnt go round to his cottage and thrash him or ask him to move away it was a reminder if you like that felicity had loved him once id have given much not to remember that did mallory come down to the shingle and threaten you earlier in the week i was alone i told you he looked rutledge up and down who are you youve asked a good many questions rather personal ones at that ive told you my name is rutledge im also from scotland yard and a friend of mirandas he seemed to accept that i see now why she said she trusted you you couldnt have been alone on the strand hamilton you couldnt have damaged yourself like this have you seen yourself in a mirror man i didnt say no one had attacked me i said i saw no one there why did you kill margaret granville hamilton raised his head are you telling me that i did and cant remember that either shes dead and youre here no one took you out of that surgery and murdered you and left your body in the cottage by the sea to wash away when the land crumbled he studied his hands im not clear about getting out of there something was wrong and i was worried but i couldnt remember what it was that needed to be done she walked into the room and you saw her outlined against the light shed left in the passage you were coming out of sedation and muddled afraid of something but not really sure where you were or why it could have been that her shadow was thrown against the wall and you had no way of knowing it was the doctors wife i disliked granville he was there with bennett telling me about felicity and mallory i could hear them at a great distance and they wouldnt stop i wanted to shout at them but i couldnt but you were stronger when you got out of bed caught up with mrs granville in the passage and choked her to death rutledge watched his eyes as he made the suggestion for any indication that hamilton knew this to be a lie or saw a way of offering rutledge a false scent to follow but the color had drained from hamiltons face is that true was that how it happened he dropped his hands as if to hide them what am i going to do i have to get out of here i cant drag miranda into this he turned to the wardrobe and pulled out his clothing reaching for his shoes and carrying the lot to the fire where he began to dress it was difficult and in the end he had to resort to sitting in the chair to draw on his trousers rutledge watched him as he laced his shoes all right im ready he moved on to the desk drew paper and a pen out of the center drawer and tried to write a message to miranda cole he crumpled the first effort tossing it into the fire thinking for a moment he scrawled something across the page blotting it he folded the sheet and set it on the table by the bed i didnt tell her i just said we must go to hampton regis tonight and then i thanked her he tried to smile i always valued her good opinion now ive brought her trouble how do we get there dont tell me well have to wait until her groom can drive us into exeter the thought stopped him my motorcar is downstairs thank god hamilton turned and surveyed the room im too tired to think but all ive done since i got here is sleep hiding from myself at a guess now i know why rutledge said are you sure youre up to this lets get it over and done with he reached for one of the pillows and then put it back no i dont need it i dont want to take anything that ought to be brought back they made it as far as the stairs before miranda cole opened her door at the end of the passage and said whos there im going with mr rutledge back to hampton regis miranda im all right now ive slept well enough and i feel stronger it was a brave lie her gaze swung to rutledge where he stood to one side dont do this it isnt my choice miss cole he has information that we badly need just now i cant ignore it matthew its my decision not his you mustnt worry its what i have to do she stood there for a moment longer as if listening to the silence then she said i dont believe either one of you she turned went back in her room and shut the door they went down the stairs and into the night outside in the sharp air of a predawn darkness hamilton said softly i never expected to see her again i never thought how it would feel if i did but i always knew where to find her i made certain of that for more than twenty years when he reached the motorcar moving with a care that betrayed his pain he spoke again i think i understand now how felicity felt about stephen mallory theres that question in the back of your mind what might have been he let rutledge help him into the motorcar then looked up at the lighted window hed left behind but he said nothing more until they were well on the road back to hampton regis when they reached the police station in hampton regis rutledge found the door unlocked and a message waiting on his desk alls quiet what took you so long it was signed bennett are you up to this rutledge said offering the tired man beside him a chair it was a long journey and its very late in more ways than one all right what is it you want a statement yes rutledge found pen and paper took hamilton to his makeshift office and asked him to describe in his own words what he recalled about his injuries and what he believed had happened when mrs granville was killed he sat there thinking it through the scars on his face knitted with uncertainty then he wrote essentially what rutledge had suggested to him in miranda coles guest bedroom at the end of it he reread the statement and then signed his name tossing the pen aside hamilton asked am i spending the night here or whats left of it he walked to the door and looked down the passage at the dark rooms airless and bleak the furnishings old the walls in need of paint there had been no money for refurbishing such buildings during the war and none since i suppose murderers cant be fussy i think not here are you sure youre satisfied with what youve written does it matter youve told me im a murderer it could matter yes rutledge folded the statement and thrust it into his breast pocket he led hamilton back to the motorcar but the mans injured leg was so stiff now that he had difficulty stepping in swearing under his breath hamilton finally managed to get the passenger door closed rutledge drove to the duke of monmouth it was dark but he found that the door was unlocked and he took hamilton inside the room on the other side of his was still empty and he looked out the window for a moment then said theres no way down short of a fall and i have the key i might remind you as well that stratton is here in hampton regis i dont think you want to meet him in the dark what about felicity shes safe for tonight you can go to her tomorrow fair enough he hesitated do we have to bring miranda into this business does felicity have to know where i was im afraid the police must and so shell hear of it hamilton sighed good night rutledge i hope you know what youre doing so do i after a moment he said i havent told you that nan weekes is dead someone has killed her as well hamilton was not prepared for it he said blankly good god are you saying to me that i did that too i hope not good night hamilton ill see you in the morning when he was certain that hamilton was asleep rutledge left the duke of monmouth and walked as far as casa miranda calling quietly to the constable on duty when he was within hearing good evening sir it was one of the men from outside hampton regis constable gregory isnt it how is it tonight yes sir quiet enough the lady refused to come for the night sir miss esterley that was i believe the rector stayed in her place rutledge said only im sorry to hear it he stared up at the housefront wishing he could look through walls and judge the state of mind of the occupants but tomorrow would be soon enough he bade the constable good night and walked back the way hed come hamish cross with him was giving him no peace and he came close more than once to venting his own annoyance aloud the sound of the voice in his mind seemed to follow him through the silent streets an uncomfortable companionship in the darkness the church clock behind him struck the hour hed forgotten how late it was but there was no sleep for him yet he passed the turning for the duke of monmouth and walked instead to the water his steps echoing as he neared the shops and a cat a mouse dangling from her jaws trotted around the nearest corner and into the shadows there were boats drawn up on the shingle and others bobbing in the tide at the end of their tethers he walked among them poking about here and there looking at gear and breathing in the rich smells of the sea salt and fish and that almostimpossibletodescribe scent of block and tackle and nets that have long lived in the water and grown stiff with it it was not too many days ago that hed gone out with perkins to the landslip a futile effort but it had given him a key when he found the bandages hamish said the church clock struck the half hour theres naething here and youve been away a verra long time he reminded himself that hamish was a highlander from the narrow mountain passes of glencoe where eagles soared high over the pap and screamed down the slopes but he himself had been accustomed to the sea hed learned to row a boat watching his father and hed spent his holidays by the water more than once finally satisfied he went back to the first boat hed come to reached down and pulled out the best example hed seen of what he was looking for holding it close to his body he retraced his steps someone was going to be unhappy with him in the morning but he could make that right later in the day he stopped at the motorcar in the inn yard looked around him at the night making certain that there was no one in the shadows or walking along the street at the end of the drive then he reached into the back where hamish sat for the rug he kept there but hamish now was at his shoulder wrapping up his find he stowed it carefully against the back of the rear seat glanced up at the windows above him and saw only dark panes of glass this was the kitchen yard of the inn where the staff slept neither stratton nor hamilton could have seen him at work he went round to the front entrance and took the steps two at a time hed had almost no sleep the night before and it had been a wearing day quietly testing the lock on hamiltons door rutledge went into his own room and stretched himself out on the bed it would be the second night hed slept in his clothes in the highceilinged room hamish had full rein she wasna strangled she was bludgeoned i know that but does hamilton its the only way to find out damn it it was a trick it was a necessity and what will you do wi him in the morning take him with me to casa miranda and see what transpires oh aye and after that for the love of god go to sleep there was silence in the room and through the walls he could hear hamilton twisting and turning in his bed the springs creaking under his weight it was a little after first light when rutledge woke with a start he had set his mental clock for an hour before that and slept straight through rising to shave he listened for sounds from hamiltons room finishing dressing he went out to the passage he stayed there for nearly three minutes judging the faint snores coming from strattons room so far so good he went on to unlock hamiltons door he was heavily asleep a pillow under his bad leg and one arm thrown across his face rutledge woke him with some difficulty and said i want you to come with me hamilton scrubbed his face with his hands where am i i dont remember the duke of monmouth yes of course give me a few minutes but he lay there as if the willpower needed to get out of bed had slipped away in the night i dont have any shaving gear id like to clean myself up a little before felicity sees me are you going to tell her or will i leave it to me are you coming it took hamilton all of ten minutes to dress but he walked through the door finally and said quietly the leg hurts like the very devil its damp out this morning a sea mist again and there was a white blanket over the village drifting in off the sea with a softness that could be felt on the skin there was no way that hamilton could have walked up the hill though it would have been less conspicuous rutledge held the door of the motorcar for him but hamilton refused his help getting in as the engine came alive with a smooth roar rutledge said youll do exactly as i tell you i dont want to frighten them mallory is armed hes held mrs hamilton at gunpoint in that house since you were found on the strand the rector is there with her and i can tell you that mallory hasnt harmed her inspector bennett tried to arrest him and he bolted mrs hamilton came home to find him in the house mallory told bennett that he wouldnt cooperate unless i was brought in to get to the bottom of what was going on i thought you were a friend of mirandas how do you know all this im from scotland yard hamilton dont you remember my telling you last night mallory sent for me thats why i knew so much about the inquiry you tricked me into a confession did i i thought it was given of your own free will is there any part of it you want to change sadly no i wish i could how am i going to face felicity with this on my conscience ive thought about that and still have no answer for it rutledge put the motorcar in gear and drove to the road leading up to casa miranda why did you name your house here and in malta for miss cole he asked as a reminder that i owed her my career they didnt speak again until rutledge had pulled up before the front door it was several minutes before mallory answered the summons of rutledges knock he said at once damn it you werent here last night putnam and i had to hold the fort any trouble no but we couldnt know that could we it was a bloody long night there was something i had to do how is mrs hamilton feeling this morning better if putnam is to be believed ive brought someone to see her mallory craned his neck to look toward the motorcar if its miss esterley shes too he stopped his face registering a variety of emotions uppermost among them shock and then anger if youve taken him into custody shell have my head where did you find him in exeter its a long story id like to bring him into the house there are things he needs razor a change of clothing did he kill those women in gods name why more to the point he doesnt remember what happened to him and very little of the time he was under dr granvilles care i thought you said he was being kept sedated for the pain and that it had played with his mind what hed heard while he was half conscious you told us that what he does recall is tangled now will you let him in mallory said with bitterness why not its his house after all everyone else has come and gone and i shant be taken up now for killing him you may still stand trial for the attack on him i didnt touch him rutledge havent you asked him yet he took a deep breath i dont know how to feel now that its over im so tired i cant think not quite over will you go and make tea i think hes going to need it tell himtell him i never would have touched him not even for felicity mallory was gone on the words rutledge went back to the motorcar and helped hamilton alight he stood there staring up at the house then walked to the door and inside if im going to jail id rather pack my things before i see her go ahead you know the way youll find mr putnam in the passage outside her door hamilton found it difficult to climb the stairs but kept at it until hed reached the top rutledge heard a smothered exclamation as the rector recognized the man coming toward him and then putnam was greeting him anxiously his concern for hamilton overcoming his alarm rutledge followed hamilton up the steps and said as putnam turned toward him he needs to pack a valise can you help him putnam cast him a swift look then said of course are you in pain man here take my arm shouldnt we send for a doctor it might be best mallory had come back standing by the door calling quietly up the stairs the waters on the boil do you know what youre doing in another fifteen minutes the three men were downstairs once more mallory had taken the tea tray into the sitting room hamiltons valise was left outside the door hamilton and mallory faced each other in stiff silence mallory was the first to speak if ive caused you worry im sorry it was all i could think of to keep myself safe shes your wife and i have respected that she will tell you as much hamilton said thank you he found a chair and sat in it id like to see her now if i may putnam said ill bring her to you but they had finished their tea before felicity hamilton came down to the sitting room she had dressed herself carefully her hair shining in the light and her dark blue skirt nearly the same shade as miranda coles sweater matthew she said tentatively are you all right as well as can be expected ive given you a fright im sorry we thought you were dead she wailed and started toward him then she stopped not knowing quite what to do there was an awkward moment before putnam said youll want some tea my dear come and sit here by the fire she hesitated and then crossed the room to take the chair he offered her he brought her a cup like a good host and went to stand by the windows a watcher and a witness mallory his back to the wall said keep this short rutledge were none of us at our best rutledge said without preamble someone has been mischiefmaking at a guess it began when whoever it was watched mr hamilton here walk down to the mole for his morning stroll inspector bennett believed it was mallory because there appeared to be a very good reason for him to wish hamilton out of the way we neednt go into that but ive come gradually to the conclusion that bennett is wrong and thats why hes not here this morning ive got the three principals sitting in this room a witness in mr putnam i expect what is said here to stay here do you understand me hamilton im offering you a list of names tell me which one had a reason to kill you matthew hamilton surprise in his voice said ive told you stratton threatened me but i never believed hed carry it out if hed been on the strand that morning id have turned away and left him there im not a fool but i wasnt afraid of him attacking me who is stratton both mrs hamilton and mallory asked in almost the same breath a colleague hamilton answered go on rutledge george reston mr putnam moved to say something then thought better of it hes an angry man filled with bitterness long before i knew him he dislikes me and ive never quite understood why i dealt with his business partner i still do i rather believe that thurston caldwell would like to see me dead but he darent touch me too many people would point a finger in his direction thats why ive stayed with him but they havent pointed at him at least not here in hampton regis then i was wrong wasnt i mallory here no i dont see that any more than you do miss esterley in gods name why her shes been a friend then we must look at your wife felicity hamilton she smothered a little cry of disbelief thats enough man i wont listen to any more of this hamilton was angry his face flushing with it if you cant be sensible about this then its over mallory had started to his feet then sank back into his chair remembering that with her husband in the room he had no right to be felicitys champion putnam anxiously watched rutledge he waited until the protest had subsided and then said we havent found the weapon that was used to strike you down hamilton but i want you to look at what im about to bring in he went to the motorcar lifted the rug from the rear seat and carried it into the house with him when he held one end and let the rug unfurl something hard and long went clattering across the floor to the hearth nearly touching the toes of felicity hamiltons shoes before it was stopped by the wood basket she cried out and the three men already on their feet crowded forward to see it better though it was nearly five feet long and made of teak with worn brass tips hamilton swayed on his feet and putnam put out an arm to steady him mallory was as pale as his shirt a boat hook old battered very likely passed down for generations through a fishermans family lay there in the fires red glow not quite an african execution club as dr hester had suggested but near enough to kill a man with one blow rutledge said you told me last night mr hamilton that youd heard someone over by the boats its in your statement this is what he was looking for he found it and before you could hear him come up behind you he brought you down with one swing after that he was free to use it any way he liked or she a woman could wield this hook as well now tell me if you will who else among your acquaintance is a coldblooded murderer felicity asked drawing her feet under her away from the long heavy length of wood iswas this the one that was used i doubt we could prove it whose boat did this one come from putnam asked it was drawn up on the shingle much as it always seems to be we can trace the boat of course but the boat hook was borrowed dipped in seawater to wash away any blood and simply put back again ten minutes at most i should think the owner never missed it i dont see why i wasnt killed hamilton said in wonder i must have a harder head than he thought if you were dead your lungs wouldnt fill with seawater as you drowned the battering from the rocks would have masked these injuries well enough there wouldnt be any question about what happened mallory interjected and if there was a question i was the scapegoat im afraid so rutledge bent down retrieved the boat hook and rolled it in the motorcars rug again setting it outside the door someone will be wanting this back hamilton said wistfully i wish you could explain away mrs granvilles death as easily not yet but you didnt kill her you know she wasnt strangled then why damn it i confessed to it yes i owe you an apology for that its what i told you but your willingness to take the blame was honorable what are you going to do now mallory asked theres still bennett to deal with i want the four of you where i can keep an eye on you mr putnam youre needed here if youll agree to stay mallory you and mrs hamilton will go on as before if you please and in a change of plans mr hamilton no doubt would like his bed i propose that he take to it at once and stay there while i report to the world at large that hes been found hes still not fully coherent and we expect a specialist to arrive shortly from london to tell us more about the head injury he thought they were going to refuse but hamilton said i for one will do as im asked ive not got the strength to argue am i to groan when bennett comes i can tell you now that the pain in my ribs and that leg will make it authentic enough even for dr granville to believe yes im about to address that mr hamilton well do something for your pain i promise felicity said but matthew where have you been rutledge stopped him from answering on the exeter road mrs hamilton where a lorry driver took pity on him are we agreed then while putnam struggled with breakfast mallory helped rutledge put matthew hamilton to bed with pillows and bedding placed to ease his discomfort felicity hovered over him still uncertain how to behave toward him her fright had gone deep and she was finding that her relationship with both the men she had loved was on shaky ground she was relieved when rutledge sent her to eat her meal in the sitting room she was afraid in one corner of her mind that matthew hamilton was relieved as well rutledge took the teak hook back to the boat it had come from the mist had lifted inland but along the water it still swathed the mole in a heavy gray blanket that left a residue of moisture on his hat and shoulders he wasnt sure who might have seen him with the boat hook but any uproar from the owner over the loss of it would have attracted more gossip or so he tried to convince himself either way it was a gamble someone in hampton regis would know very well why he had been interested in boat gear afterward he went to the rectory to find dr granville telling him that hamilton had been found and that he was in pain ive got just the thing for him do you want me to examine him where in gods name did you find him a lorry driver discovered him along the road west god knows how he made it as far as he did and what about my wife what has he told you about her death i have a confession rutledge said for what its worth hes still rather unclear about details is he at the police station hes not well enough for that hes in the house and weve got a specialist coming down from london to have a look at him something we ought to have done in the first twentyfour hours yes hindsight is a glorious thing ive got something in my case that you can give him it wont do any harm but it should keep him quiet until your man arrives anyone i know in the field baldwin for one or hutchinson well know soon enough when hes here granville left rutledge standing in the entry and went up to his room when he came back he was holding a packet of powders very like the ones dr hester had left for felicity hamilton two days ago rutledge thanked him and went in search of bennett well done bennett told him when rutledge made a brief report ill be there in a quarter of an hour id like to let the chief constable know hes under lock and key whats become of the lorry driver with any luck hes on his way back from st ives good man well need a statement from him understand bennett early days yet to know where we are with hamilton hes said nothing of importance then i was able to learn two facts i can be reasonably sure of he didnt see anyone by the water when he was walking but he heard footsteps some distance away closer to the boats whether this was a potential witness or the killer himself we still have to determine well send people around to talk to the men who keep their boats there its as well to ask if anything in the boats was missing or misplaced fact number twohamilton overheard a garbled version of events while he was in granvilles surgery whether it was from one of us speaking too freely in his presence or whether it was a voice outside his door talking to mrs granville i cant tell you hes not very clear about it but he felt for his own safety he had to leave when was this when the sedation was wearing off and he was more awake than we knew yes well head injuries can be quite severe small wonder he couldnt make sense of anything but then he could have recognized the voice as the person whod half killed him and that put the wind up i want to speak to dr hester as soon as possible we still have no murder weapon for mrs granville heredid hamilton have his keys with him when you found him in exeter he did ive got them now with that rutledge was already walking out the door from the station he went to call on miss trining afterward he went to miss esterleys house you didnt see fit to sit up with felicity hamilton last night he said as soon as he was shown into her sitting room she said i couldnt face it im no match for anyone breaking into the house worse than useless come to that mr putnam was a better choice i think perhaps a womans company would have been more comforting but it doesnt matter now weve brought in matthew hamilton my god where was he a lorry driver found him along the road to the west of here he gave her the same account hed given miss trining and dr granville she listened with increasing anxiety youre telling me that hell live that in time hell be whole again theres some hope of that yes but what about mrs granville are you saying she was still alive when matthew walked out of the surgery hes not clear about that not yet in time with good medical care well know a little more on the other hand he may not remember anything in spite of all we can do she smiled wryly having refused to help felicity last night i shant be very welcome coming to call on matthew now but id like very much to see for myself that hes all right there wont be any visitors for a while he may even have to be taken to london for care at least hes being given it i was so annoyed with dr granville you know miss trining had suggested a specialist and i agreed with her but he told her that as long as there was swelling in the brain rest was what matthew most needed im sure it was true now that hes awake time will be on his side he rose to leave miss esterley said truly i wasnt a coward last night you have to understand i wasnt supposed to walk again ever the doctors told me how lucky i was that the damage to my knee could be repaired but even so they held out little hope i could use it properly it required all the faith i possessed to go through the long grueling weeks of treatment and exercises and manipulation theyd learned you see from wounded soldiers but they werent entirely sure it would work for me in the end it did i keep my cane as a reminder of how close id come to being dependent on the care of others for the rest of my life i didnt want to take the risk you see hamish said she doesna blame him no rutledge answered silently not openly but its there underneath if hed been less kind perhaps her true feelings would have risen to the surface aloud he said i should have thought the debt you owed hamilton would have been well repaid by helping his wifeor as we thought then his widow whatever the cost she blushed the warm color rising in her face thats cruel and that wasnt the choice was it i think you were afraid of what matthew hamilton might have become no mr rutledge i saw that two innocent women had already been murdered she told him firmly and i was afraid i might be the third mr putnam didnt face that risk what comfort would it have been to me this morning lying somewhere dead to have you admit youd been wrong to ask me at his next stop rutledge found mrs reston on her way out the door to a luncheon she was wearing a hat that framed her face and added a softness to it my husband isnt here she told him if its george youve come to see weve found matthew hamilton hes alive but his memory is still unreliable im glad to hear it whatever you may think of me i had no reason to wish him ill do you know now who it was who killed mrs granville or nan weekes we cant be sure until hamilton is well enough to tell us who it was who carried him out of the surgery and left him on a roadside to die will he recover his memory do you think in his shoes i shouldnt like to live the rest of my life knowing that i couldnt bring a murderer to justice no matter how hard i tried its sad what will you do now we are reasonably sure about certain points but we need his evidence to bring the case to trial i see and am i to tell this to george in the hope that hell rush out to wherever matthew hamilton is resting and finish what he started if i were you i wouldnt put it to the test a good barrister might see fit to ask you to testify to your role in driving him to murder i remind you that im a very good liar and hes the father of my children what sort of life will they have do you think if hes taken up and hanged you should have thought of that before you tested him he should have thought of that before he married me she put on her gloves im late mr rutledge you must forgive me she walked to the door and waited for him to hold it open for her i wont play your game for you inspector you must do it yourself rutledge ran george reston to earth at his bank i couldnt care less whether hamilton regains his memory or lives the rest of his life as a vegetable dribbling down his chin in a wheeled chair the banker informed him he went out of his way to collect those heathen gods of his let him pray to them and wait for them to answer thats a rather callous attitude dont you think is it i think not you must remember that we sow what we reap there are two murders that havent been solved reston mrs granville and nan weekes deserve to be offered the full panoply of justice i shouldnt be surprised if he killed them both in his demented state mrs granville in his clumsy effort to reach his wife and the maid in mistake for mallory then how did he manage to drag himself out on the exeter road where the lorry driver found him you must ask him that i daresay he had no idea where he was going or why i have a conference in five minutes is there anything else you wish to say to me as rutledge drove back to the duke of monmouth hamish said ye ken it wouldna sit well wi hamilton to hear what yeve heard it hasnt been a waste of time he answered he found stratton enjoying a late breakfast rutledge nodded to the woman serving tables and asked for a cup of tea then he joined stratton at the table by the dining room windows the sea mist was gone and sunlight was reflecting from the glass panes of houses across the road stratton was not interested in what charges might or might not be brought when hamilton regained his memory i dont know these people the living or the dead youre barking up the wrong tree that may well be his tea arrived and he poured himself a cup but you can look at it another way if hamilton doesnt regain his memory if hes permanently damaged by the beating he sustained then hes not likely to take an interest in writing his memoirs yes it turns out rather well for me doesnt it not that id wish that on anyone he has a very astute mind thats what made him dangerous he could cut through a mountain of chaff and find the seed of truth but he wasnt the sort you got drunk with if you know what i mean there his brain was still clicking away recording while everyone else is acting the fool i dont know that he collected information to wield it in the sense of blackmail of course he didnt but it was there written down you see and in the back of your mind its always rubbing at you if it doesnt matter why put it down in black and white why bother with it at all because it was his nature to remember and he was lonely the diaries were his companions he talked to them and confided in them and he kept them as he would a friend he told me you threatened to burn him out once would you have done it stratton was caught off guard god no i was very angry with him at the time and i wanted to make him afraid it wasnt as successful as id hoped and i was left feeling a bigger fool than ever and if youd tried again on monday to persuade him to see reason whos to say that your anger didnt get the better of you again you could very well have killed mrs granville because it wouldnt have done for you to be caught in the surgery looking for a man whod already taken himself off in the nick of time yes i can see how you might make that case but i ask you why should i go into hamiltons house and kill his maid because she stood between you and your safe exit from the house and mallory was armed you were taking a chance trying to look for the diaries hed have shot you out of hand if youd stumbled over himor she raised the alarm as you were slipping out again strattons eyes were wary youve built a very good case are you telling me that hamilton believes ive tried twice to kill him hes truly off his head if he has im just saying that youve made an error in judgment here because youve shown yourself to be obsessively worried about hamiltons intentions you might have been wiser to let sleeping dogs lie and see what developed he pushed back his chair and stood up think about it stratton youve put yourself in an untenable position if hamilton tells me youre his assailant that he left the surgery because he thought you might walk in at night to kill him then ive got no choice but to take you into custody it would do very little for your career to be tried for murder even if there is a reasonable doubt and in the end youre acquitted i trust youre a good enough policeman that that wont happen rutledge smiled if hamilton points his finger at you whether or not im a good policeman doesnt enter into it he walked away out the dining room door hamish was saying youve made a verra bad enemy stratton sat there watching him go his face closed with speculation dr hester had just returned from delivering a baby he found rutledge waiting for him in his office what brings you all the way to middlebury he sat in the chair behind his orderly desk and added medicine is an odd business bury a man one day bring a child into the world the next ive never quite got used to seeing a mothers face as i hand her a healthy child and this was a bouncing boy if ever there was one ten pounds she thinks he takes after her father who was a good six inches over six feet it makes up a little for losing him early to a cancer the husband is just delighted to have a son to carry on his farm we see only the dead on my side of the coin yes and speaking of the quick and the dead ive released mrs granville for burial and ill do the same for the maid tomorrow if you have no objections none but i think i might have discovered the weapon used to bring hamilton down he described his search among the boats hauled up for the night i didnt examine hamilton but i should think youre right heavy enough to do the job long reach no footprints close by not much blood splattered on ones coat or shirtfront but im curious why didnt someone intent on beating hamilton within an inch of his life simply finish the job while he was about it at that stage it would have taken only a few more blows surely he wanted hamilton to drown george restons brother drowned in the same place not long agoin his case too drunk to drag himself away from the waters edge i think our killer remembered that and was hoping hamilton would go into the sea before anyone discovered him by the time the body came ashore again it would be so badly battered that no one would suspect hed been beaten nearly to death first interesting point you said he you know the killer then for want of knowing he quite well i can tell you it wasnt a boat hook in the surgery not enough room to wield one where we found mrs granville hester reminded him and she hadnt been moved from where she fell but it must have been something equally practical we searched and came up emptyhanded because the killerhe or shetook it with him when he carted hamilton off and a very wise decision from his point of view then why didnt he kill hamilton once he got him out of the surgery do i have to do all your thinking for you hester asked with a crooked smile if he left a body lying about youd know there was a third person in that surgery as long as it was likely that hamilton walked out under his own power youve got a complication and sospeaking hypotheticallyour killer left him along the exeter road where a lorry driver could find him and save his life a second time if the killer had learned that hamilton was not clear on anything and would stay that way he might decide to leave him alive to take the blame for mrs granville his eyes were sharp his mind leaping ahead did someone find him on the exeter road actually a lorry driver found him there thats all im making public but the truth seems to be that hamilton walked out of the surgery and took refuge in the cottage that went over in the landslip but he had an inkling it was in danger and hid himself next in the henhouse of a farmer whod gone off to market at nightfall he tried to walk down the road and passed out my god then he killed mrs granville hes confessed to it but its possible someone came for hamilton discovered he was gone and before he could get out of there mrs granville walked into the surgery where is hamilton now for safety ive put him in his bed at the house with his wife mallory and mr putnam to guard him for safety hester frowned arent you taking a chance there i dont think mallory tried to kill him and i dont think hamilton killed mrs granville what can he tell you precious little well neither can i mrs granville died of that blow on the head delivered with some force mind you and nan weekes was smothered as she slept theres nothing new in either case hamilton is in a great deal of pain as youd expect this is the sedative dr granville prescribed for him rutledge handed the box of powders to hester are you telling me you dont trust my colleague hester demanded you think hes out for revenge for what happened to margaret im not suggesting anything hamilton is alive at the moment and i intend to see that he stays that way i dont want to discover too late that someone in the house took liberties with what dr granville prescribed are these powders likely to do a great deal of harm if swallowed all at once hester examined the contents of one of the sleeves of powder theyre stronger than the sedative i left for mrs hamilton when she was upset hamilton is dealing with injuries that hes very likely aggravated by activity hell require more help im satisfied that this medication is safe but if i were you id make sure no one else had access to it dr granville told me youd had to deal with mrs hamilton i wouldnt want her to try again and be more successful ill be certain to dole out the powders as needed personally a very wise precaution he got up and went to his medical bag how has she handled her husbands return from the dead not very well no i thought not here take these pills with you too if hamilton is still having trouble with his memory and the powders seem to leave him more confused than he ought to be or if he seems to be agitated while taking them it might be best to have a choice a little more pain perhaps but he wont be raving and if you were hardpressed one of these would calm his wife as well rutledge stood there watching him work inspector dr hester was holding out the packet of pills oh yes thank you if you come up with any suggestions for a murder weapon used for mrs granville well offer you the next opening at the yard i wouldnt walk in your shoes for any amount of money im satisfied with my own thank you very much rutledge left driving from middlebury back to hampton regis he ignored hamish who was busy with arguments of his own and concentrated on the road the glimmer of an answer that had struck him there in hesters office had nothing to support it intuition he reminded himself was a very unreliable gift a burst of brilliance that showered light on one single corner of the darkness surrounding it and left the rest impenetrable but in the hands of an experienced policeman intuition could sometimes lead to proof given a little luck rutledge made good time to hampton regis considered his options and in the end went to the telephone closet at the duke of monmouth inn and put through a call to london he had to wait more than an hour in that stuffy little room shut in with hamish and his own thoughts before the call was returned after a while rutledge put in another call to london as well this time to inspector phipps when the man came on the phone rutledge said im told youve found the green park killer phipps answered indeed yes a man named berenson and his wife she lured the victims there because they didnt know her and he strangled them revenge as it happened theyd swindled him in a financial scheme and he wanted revenge berenson he didnt recognize the name that man fields the one youd had watchedhe told us his sisters husband wasnt the only one cheated by the dead men there were four others in on it berenson being only one of them fields had been of two minds about helping us with our inquiries in the end glad as he was to see rough justice done he realized it would have been a better lesson if both men had lived to be clapped up in prison i tried to make the chief superintendent aware of your role in turning up fields but he didnt like the man and would have gladly seen him taken up instead he cleared his throat mrs berenson is quitepretty and convincing youre certain of your facts oh yes we found the garrote amongst her knitting and constable waddington he received a commendation for his part in the arrests a good man that chief superintendent bowles is impressed with him rutledge said nothing as hed thought waddington had been eager to protect himself phipps went on im to appear in court in fifteen minutes is there anything else rutledge thanked him and put up the receiver bringing his attention back to hampton regis he went over everything he knew and still there was no single motive to explain both the attack on hamilton and the two subsequent deaths murderers killed for a reasonout of fear greed jealousy love envy or even sheer hatred and none of these seemed to fit here unless he was completely wrong about stephen mallory hamish reminded him ye canna judge him on the way he was in france im not convinced hes clever enough the telephone rang at last making him jump at the loud jangle that seemed to echo around the tiny room deafening him he swore the voice on the other end of the line apologetic for taking so long to find the information he needed made rutledge sit up in the narrowseated chair and listen with concentration gibson had paid a visit to the person rutledge had named and that led to a bank in leadenhall street what he had to report was enlightening it came down to money as it so often did but not quite in the way hed expected rutledge walked up the hill to casa miranda the sun was strong now and he thought he heard a blackbird singing somewhere in the distance wishful thinking hamish told him sourly yet spring came in this part of england long before it touched the highlands and in the air today was the scent of warm earth mixed with the salty cast of the sea when he climbed the stairs to the room hamilton was using he found the man awake propped with pillows lines of pain etched his face but he said briskly on malta the heat is already building theres so much white stone you see it holds in the warmth even the soil is white in the summer limestone do you miss it in the way you miss anywhere youve put down roots no matter how temporary they may be it was a lovely house too a marquis had let it to me while he was in england there was a porch glass enclosed where i took most of my meals i could look out across the rooftops toward the cocathedral and the grandmasters palace he sighed but you havent come i think to hear me praise malta where is mrs hamilton in her bed its all been rather much for her but shes young shell recover her balance im just afraid of whats been lost an innocence that was her greatest charm and a sense of self that was absolutely absorbing to me i couldalmostrecapture my own youth watching her and mr putnam he excused himself for a quarter of an hour to return to the rectory for a change of clothes has bennett come to see you mallory brought him up while putnam was still here he wanted to know about exeter i told him that my memory remained hazy at best that i thought very likely i was continuing to run a fever it could be true it was i remember how cold the wind blew as i was walking along that road i couldnt stop the chills that racked me i wasnt sure where i was going only that somehow i had to get there he hesitated have you told felicity about miranda ill leave that to you when you feel you can miranda was afraid of me wasnt she i think rather she wasnt prepared for reminders of the past she had shut that door and its best left shut i would have married her blind or not the blindness worried her more than it did you what will you do about mallory do you really believe he wasnt my assailant i wont press charges you know it will only make for more gossip and keep the memory of these past few days alive youre a forgiving man no a realistic one deep in my core theres a molten ball of jealousy but it serves no purpose and hes suffered as much as i have he shifted his leg i hope youve brought something to ease this ache else ill be drunk as a lord by teatime rutledge found one of the pills that dr hester had given him this should help ive got stronger sedatives as well this will do i can tell you im not eager to find myself in a helpless stupor while murderers climb through the windows rutledge thought the man in the bed was more afraid of the outcome than he was willing to admit but he laughed as hamilton was expecting him to do as he offered him a glass of water then he said soberly ive found the killer i think if im right by morning youll have your house to yourself again and it will be finished im glad to hear it but we shant stay in hampton regis you know its time to turn my back on the sea and i expect miranda cole will be happy to learn im not as near to exeter as i was i expect she will he left hamilton then running into mr putnam in the doorway ive just brought a few things he said to tide us over i went to mallorys cottage and fetched fresh clothes for him well done ill need to speak to you later certainly before dinner i shall have to give dr granville a little of my time tonight were choosing the readings for margarets ser vice and the music she was very fond of the choir by all means take as long as you need ill be here to spell you you know now dont you who is behind all this the rector holding his belongings and mallorys in his arms looked into rutledges face and then away again i didnt think you did this morning in spite of the dramatic conclusion with that dreadful boat hook i was as in the dark as everyone else rutledge confessed will you at least tell me what i am to expect theres not much god can do now mr putnam its a matter for the law rutledge found mallory morose and alone in the sitting room he raised his head when rutledge came through the doorway its you he said as if hed been expecting felicity hamilton to find him and offer him anything but the silence in which shed been wrapped since early morning where will you go when this business is over back to dr beatie for a time to work my way through everything that happened here after that abroad possibly its my turn for exile you could still marry happily and put this far behind what became of the girl whose photograph you carried with you in france rutledge hesitated shes living in canada now it didnt work out for me any more than it did for you and hundreds like us i watched felicity change in just the few days we were shut in here together ive got much to answer for i understand now how she could have changed so much in three years we didnt think about that in france we believed england was there that it would always be just the same as it was when we left more fools we we were too busy staying alive mallory took a deep breath do you know yet whos behind this ive a very good idea id like to kill him with my bare hands and save the hangman his trouble do you still have hamiltons revolver i put it back in the drawer where id found it id keep it with you tonight i want you to prepare yourself a pallet on the floor the far side of hamiltons bed if anyone comes through that door and you have any reason to worry shoot first and ask questions later felicity is likely to come in there i cant risk shooting her lock her in her room shell be furious with me better furious than dead will you do as i say i dont have any choice but youd better tell hamilton why im armed hes likely to have something to say about that shortly afterward rutledge left the hamilton house and walked down the hill into hampton regis from a vantage point well out of sight he waited outside the rectory for an hour and a half at last he saw dr granville leave carrying his medical bag and walking briskly in the direction of the mole rutledge had made sure that putnam was safely ensconced at casa miranda and now with granville gone the rectory was empty he walked up the drive cast a glance over his shoulder and tried the door it was unlocked inside the rectory echoed its victorian roots a small house that had grown into a threestory collection of passages and rooms and dead ends to house a growing family the rector used only a small part of the first floor meeting his needs with a room in which to sleep and another for what appeared to be an overflow of books from his study furnishings in the rest of the bedchambers were sheathed in dust covers granville had been given the guest room newly aired rutledge putting his head around the door saw the doctors valise standing under the window and a pair of shoes set neatly by the wardrobe granvilles possessions held no interest for him and he withdrew continuing his search but putnams belongings did he scoured the rectors bedroom and the adjoining dressing room which had been converted into a bath then he went down the steps and repeated his search on the ground floor he ended in the plant room rutledge had just put his hands on what hed been searching for when he heard the hall door of the rectory open and then footsteps in the hall he put the hammer back into the wooden box with the rest of the rectory tools exactly as hed found it and got to his feet hamish warning him with a sharp word added hes away up the stairs the door to the gardens was not five feet from his elbow avoiding the clutter of rakes and shovels baskets cutting shears and aging wellingtons gathering dust on either side of him rutledge reached for the knob praying that the door wasnt locked it was not he went through it quietly and walked close to the side of the house until he reached the shrubbery it led to the low churchyard wall he followed the grassy path there and spent some time wandering among the gravestones in plain sight he hoped that he would leave the impression of a man with something on his mind seeking solace among the dead as the clock over his head in the church tower struck the quarter hour he went back to the duke of monmouth stretched himself out on his bed and slept rutledge spoke to the kitchen staff and arranged for an evening meal to be prepared for casa miranda when someone came to tell him the packages and covered dishes were ready he put them in the motorcar and took them up himself after one brief stop along the way while at the station he gave bennett instructions that included calling off his own watchers this night darkness was just falling to the west a long line of silvery clouds stretched out across the horizon and under them the fading pink of sunset left a bright afterglow fair skies at night he thought sailors delight the occupants of the house fretful after a day of their own company fell on the food with the pleasure of people grateful for distraction matthew hamilton came down sat in the armchair at the head of the table and toyed with his plate you arent hungry felicity asked surprised he smiled at her ive always liked roasted ham you know that i was just thinking about nan yes what do you say my dear to a few days in london when im stronger we might search for a new house on our way there it was an oblique acknowledgment that casa miranda was haunted by ghosts one living and one dead she smiled at him in turn id like that there was no emphasis in the words merely acceptance done then he turned back to his plate and ate with apparent gusto but rutledge could see that he was pretending he wondered if felicity could they had finished their pudding when mr putnam looked at his watch and exclaimed im late if youll excuse me i have an appointment at the rectory it shouldnt last long but i must keep it avoiding rutledges eye he rose from the table thanked everyone for the meal and went to find his coat rutledge listened to the opening and closing of the outer door then tried to concentrate on something mallory was saying to him soon afterward he went around the house and looked carefully at each of the windows and doors the fortress was secure but for how long between them rutledge and hamilton managed to persuade felicity to retire early though she was certain she wouldnt sleep for hours ill feel better knowing youre just there through the door hamilton told her it wont be long before im stronger and can manage on my own i wish you would remember everything she said suddenly it must be very uncomfortable not knowing i shant be able to walk down a street in hampton regis without wondering about everyone i pass thinking this one or that one might have tried to kill you how much worse will it be for you its worrying he told her what if i never remember all of it dont think about that she replied and there was a thread of fear in her voice that both men heard clearly she closed her door and hamilton listened for the turn of the key in its lock and then nodded to rutledge waiting at the head of the stairs around nine oclock that evening someone came to the house and left a message with the constable on duty outside it was from putnam mr joyner is ill again im going with dr granville to see him when rutledge questioned the constable he identified the messenger as the allen boy rutledge closed the door and prepared to wait for putnam to return it was almost eleven oclock when the church bells began to ring wildly mallory rushing to a window said whats that in aid of rutledge i dont like it nor do i go upstairs mallory and take up your post tell mrs hamilton theres a fire in the town and not to worry where will you be in the drive to see whats happening he watched mallory take the stairs two at a time then let himself out the door the night was quiet but he thought he smelled smoke when he reached the constable on duty the man said must be a fire i heard the pumps go out people were in the streets now shouting and running rutledge walked on far enough down the road to a point where he could see the church steeple and to this side of it the line of the rectory roof nothing he scanned other rooftops nerves taut now hamish said it doesna have anything to do wi us then in that same instant rutledge caught the first dart of flame licking up the edge of a chimney he realized that it was miss trinings house and in the back of it the pumps were set up and starting to work he called to the constable behind him not to relax his guard then raced down to the center of hampton regis the firemen were busy bennetts constables helping and the men on the pumps their faces red in the glare of the flames were grimly concentrating on keeping the water flowing he glimpsed putnam in the crowd then lost him in the shifting light dr granville was there as well and even george reston though he was standing to one side watching rutledge made his way to granville how is joyner he died over an hour ago have you seen miss trining is she out of there no i havent seen her rutledge said his gaze sweeping the milling throng working to put out the flames damn they tell me the fire began in the wood stacked by the kitchen door theres been a great deal of smoke i hope to god he broke off the bells had stopped rutledge could hear people coughing and gasping all around them but they kept working wheres putnam do you know he was looking for her as well dr granville dashed off disappearing in the direction of the pumps rutledge threaded his way across the crowded back garden helping where he could still searching for the rector he finally found miss trining clutching the portrait of her ancestor watching as others brought out pieces of furniture and carpets he reached her saying only im sorry its the kitchen thats burning now the wall where the fire wood was stacked to dry god knows what started it a spark from the chimney she was stoic her face set in a determined calm though he could see that her knuckles were white where they held the portrait the shingles by the chimney were smoking heavily now the flames doused have you seen mr putnam he asked her hes making certain all the servants are safe i told him they were rutledge made one last circuit of the property and then turned back toward casa miranda walking fast hamish all the while scolding him for leaving his post said it was verra clever yes he saved his breath for the last sprint up the hill startling the constable whose attention was riveted on the pall of smoke rising up in the night sky have you seen mr putnam he called to the man the constable turned guiltily to face him sir i believe he went up to the house not five minutes ago he saw rutledges expression in the reflection of the lights around miss trinings house you did say to let him pass at will sir damn rutledge went on to the door fishing hamiltons keys out of his pocket letting himself in as quietly as he could he stopped with his back to the door and listened the house was silent where the bloody hell was putnam overhead hamilton and mallory were lying tensely in the dark waiting and mrs hamilton god willing was in her own room oblivious he dared not call out the rector couldnt have let himself in through this doorit was the one with the newest lock but he had two keys that fit doors to the kitchen and to the servants hall still rutledge waited where he was his body tense with listening hamish said ye ken yon fire was set he couldnt have known what id found he could ha made a verra good guess were ye seen passing through yon shrubbery into the churchyard possibly too late to worry about that now its done a dialogue with hamish was so familiar in the dark that he wasnt even aware of it clever of him not to set the fire in the rectory the house seemed to creak and then settle around them as the chill of the night began to work through the brick and into the timbers behind rutledge bent to unlace his shoes and set them to one side out of the way then moving on stocking feet he walked softly through the door into the kitchen passage he listened his eyes blind his senses alert and far away down the passage a door creaked on old hinges then opened with only a whisper of sound five minutes more and hed have been too late a breath of air stirred bringing a hint of smoke with it footsteps moving quietly and without haste rutledge stood there nestling into the shadows of the wall he could follow on the plan of the house he carried in his mind just where the trespasser must be through the servants outer door now down the passage that led to the hall slowing apparently searching in the dark for the back stairs to the floors above but who was it he thought for an instant that hed caught the flash of a torch as if the intruder needed the reassurance of seeing a door was open before blundering into it after a few minutes a chance footfall informed him that someone had made a decision not to go up the back stairs rutledge took a silent breath of relief better a confrontation here than near hamilton or his wife it was what hed hoped for in another twenty feet whoever it was would be close to the room where nan weekes had been murdered he counted steps he couldnt hear half a dozen more and it would be time to show himself whoever was there paused by the door to nans prison at that instant the darkness erupted with light brilliant shocking and blinding rutledge swore with passion and swiftly moved forward through the glass in the room where nan weekes had died he saw mr putnam armed in righteousness and sincerity standing in the full glow of a pair of lamps and outside pinned like a startled insect in the brightness was dr granville what the bloody hell was the rector up to he didnt think either man could pick him out beyond the circle of light he stopped short keeping absolutely still standing there like the wolf in russian fairy tales waiting to see what the carnage would be and hamish was roaring in his mind like all the imps of hell mr putnam said doctor miss trining told me youd gone back to comfort joyners daughter once youd learned you werent needed at her house granville tried to keep the annoyance out of his voice yes i should have done what did you give him that let him die i didnt it was coming just sooner than he or i expected but you killed your wife in my workbox theres a ballpeen hammer i dont recognize i expect mr rutledge has already found it mine was my fathers with a worn blue handle its there as well rutledge felt his anger rising putnam had been ordered to let rutledge confront granville while he stood by as a witness concealed in shadows instead he was putting rutledges questions himself had the man run mad or had he been afraid that rutledge wouldnt arrive in time to ask them matthew hamilton killed her granville was saying rutledge has a confession hamilton confessed to choking her i told you earlier he was muddled last night but thats clearing up with rest and food as you knew it must once he was no longer sedated so heavily why dont we go and find the inspector the last i saw of him he was still at the fire theres the hammer putnam was firm i can swear to seeing it the name of the hospital where you trained is on the handle the hammer doesnt exist not anymore its burned up in the fire with the wood stacked outside miss trinings kitchen door do you feel nans spirit here with us she worked for your wife conscientiously as she did for everyone she even sent you a message about the sheets left at her house shed heard us quarreling it wouldnt have done if shed remembered and told the world what those arguments were about money youd already set your sights higher i expect when the granville family cut you off margaret must have appeared to be a lifeline she told me not six months ago that you were still repaying them what you owed them for your training sadly her inheritance is nearly used up a foolish pride when theres little money to support it you have no way of proving that granville retorted sharply mr rutledge put in a call to your foster father who spoke to your bankers on the other hand miss esterley is rather welltodo and much prettier than margaret the only trouble was she was fonder of matthew hamilton than she ever was of you im not surprised that you were sorely tempted to put an end to him so far rutledge thought stifling an urge to announce his presence the rectors keeping to the script wed discussed granville said in the beginning i was set on miss esterley then i heard george reston saying that mrs hamilton would be a very rich widow but hamilton refused to die of his injuries stubborn bastard that he is i was on the point of quietly helping him to that end when he disappeared when we couldnt find him that morning rutledge and i i saw my chance went back to the surgery and killed margaret rutledge thought hamiltons wounds were more grievous than they were that was clever of you a chance to keep him sedated and silent did rutledge put you up to this are there witnesses back in the shadows granville shielded his eyes with his hand and peered into the darkness rutledge are you there youre quite wrong the rector answered him ive come here because i want to help you rutledge had been on the point of showing himself just as putnam deviated from the script he cursed the man roundlyinstead of distancing himself from granville putnam was letting the doctor approach him closer than was safe already before rutledge could possibly reach either of them granville could make the decision to kill again what weapon did the man have with him a knife hamish said its what he kens best let me listen to your confession granville its the least i can do your soul is in jeopardy man and you will surely hang will you not stop now and give a thought to what is waiting for you at gods hands granville gave up searching the shadows he stood there a frown on his face then walked forward im not sure i believe in god he said slowly as if considering the matter but he cares for you mr putnam pointed out inspector rutledge will have you in custody by tomorrow morning he knows you hid the hammer in your bag until you could leave it in my house make your peace now of your own free will it will see you through the long and frightening days to come you cant stop me from leaving wherever you go you take yourself with you and the ghosts of two women will follow you to rutledges surprise but not mr putnams granville said with what sounded like sincere regret yes ive already seen them at my heels he hesitated finally giving in to putnams persuasion all right then pray for me rector he fell to his knees contrition in every line putnam went down more stiffly and reached a hand for granvilles shoulder to steady himself or to offer comfort rutledge never knew which the rector closed his eyes lowered his head and began an earnest prayer granville on his knees looked upward as if to find atonement in the air above his head or to see if his prayers like the kings in hamlet had failed to rise with putnams then without any warning he sprang again to his feet and with an arm outflung swept the two lamps off the table onto the floor spilling hot oil and sending a spray of fire racing toward the back wall before rutledge could move or putnam could even cry out in alarm granville lifted his leg and with the flat sole of his shoe shoved the unresisting man of god into the flames the harsh smell of burning oil and charring wool had enveloped the room and was fast reaching into the passage beyond rutledge came out of the darkness with a roar of rage his shoulder catching dr granville hard in the chest before he could stumble through the door and out of reach of the inferno behind him granville went backward tripped over mr putnams sprawled feet and fell heavily one arm twisted behind him as his left hand brushed the flames he cried out and rebounded like a spring rutledge didnt hesitate he did as granville himself had done drawing back his knee and then delivering a blow with his stocking foot directly into granvilles sternum pushing him backward and knocking the wind out of him gasping for air granville went down beside the struggling rector catching up the blankets from nans narrow cot rutledge dragged them over the rector smothering the fire already taking hold in the shoulder and back of his coat then he pulled the rector to his feet and with all the strength he possessed shoved him bodily still smoking and retching out into the passage putnam bit off a scream as his burning shoulder hit the far wall hard and he fought to keep his feet even as he tried to beat at the smoldering ruins of his coat then in a shambling run he went down the passage toward the dining room leaving rutledge alone with granville and the leaping bluegold tongues of a strengthening conflagration rutledge reached down for the doctor dodging a fist wildly thrown in his direction with a firm grasp on granvilles collar and shirtfront he hauled him out of the room and into the passage slamming him into the opposite wall while granville cursed him he wheeled and swung the door shut on the unbearable heat the fire would blow out the glass in a matter of minutes but just now he had granville to deal with hamish said you mustna harm him as if he recognized the fury that was driving rutledge in the distance rutledge could hear shouting somewhere and then other voices breathing hard from the smoke and his anger he turned on the doctor its over do you understand me give hamilton or mallory half an excuse and theyll kill you with their bare hands he reached for the mans belt turned him roughly and secured his wrists behind his back hamilton would like a private half hour with you make no mistake hes still capable of doing considerable damage dont tempt him it was a warning he hoped the doctor would take to heart feet were racing toward him and in the light of the blazing walls behind him he could see mallory with putnam not far behind him and hamilton struggling to keep up the constable on watch was trying to pass all three of the men and in the rear felicity stopped short eyes bright with the fires reflection and her own fury they organized a rough water brigade and did what they could to stop the flames putnam found more blankets somewhere and cloths for the table they beat at the fire beginning to make headway suddenly they heard the roar of a revolver in the confined space of the passage behind them it was deafening stopping them in their tracks with the shock of the report when they turned nearly as one man to look dr granville was cowering on the floor and felicity hamilton stood ten feet from him with her husbands revolver clenched tightly in both hands there are five more shots she told him shrilly the next one wont miss but he lay there not moving his face buried in his shoulder more people were coming now bennett leading the charge ten minutes later the fire was out though smoke still filled the kitchen quarters and sooty faces paused long enough to catch a breath several of them coughed heavily before grinning at one another in satisfaction hamilton exhausted stood with both hands on his knees head down putnam was lying against the wall his face gray with pain felicity had helped him take off what was left of his coat and the clerical shirt beneath it the flesh was raw and wet burned deeply putnam tried for a wan smile saying to rutledge ill have one of those powders you gave hamilton it will be awhile before dr hester is here bennett has sent young jordan for him bennett was busy with dr granville rutledge felt in his pockets for the packet of hesters pills and found instead the box of powders that granville had given him for hamilton he looked at them glanced up to see granville watching him with an unreadable expression on his face and then made a decision he put them away it was too great a risk he thought even if only one was taintedhow was he to know which he found the pills then and went to kneel by mr putnam as he gave him one to swallow dry he found that felicity had already fetched a glass of water from the kitchen that was a bloody stupid thing to do he told the injured man infusing wrath into his voice cant you follow orders for gods sake why didnt you wait to see if i was there why did you take it on yourself to challenge him old fools never learn i was afraid you hadnt come back from the fireno thats not true dont you see i had to try to save him i failed them all margaret and nan and even matthew if id waited for you to speak to him i might not have got the chance but i didnt fail youyou have what you want a full confession bennett was saying we lost granville as he came up the hill i see now why the constables never saw anything its bloody difficult in the dark i went back to see if hed given us the slip and returned to hampton regis pity he didnt try to burn the rectory down we werent watching miss trinings house we cant prove which boat hook it was but weve got the hammer the handles in a bad way but the head is all right youre sure of your facts then rutledge we turned the surgery upside down looking for a weapon bennett remember and all the while that hammer was in the one place we never really searchedgranvilles medical bag i was reminded when i watched dr hester digging in his bag that it could easily conceal a weapon of the right size like a hammer but granville couldnt leave it there hed have to hide it again the rectory was ideal both putnam and i saw it he could swear it wasnt his that it hadnt been there in his box of tools before granville came to stay granville should have thrown it into the sea bennett answered its possible he intended to use it again on nan weekes but she was asleep and it was easier to smother her its a hammer to work metal not something youd readily find in a surgery for all i know granville or his wife kept it there to deal with a rusty damper in the office fireplace or a stubborn latch on the garden gate but there it was the perfect weapon something mallory might have brought with him and taken away again but then mallory never came hamilton walked away under his own power granville didnt know that when he murdered his wife he thought in the end wed find hamilton dead and blame mallory for killing him he covered it over well enough clever bastard begging your pardon rector but there wont be lettering left on that scorched handle bennett said fuming we dont need it now we heard his confession tonight putnam and i and that will see him hang dr hester had finished with putnam and turned to hamilton who shook his head and pointed to the prisoner hester went over to look at granvilles hand watching them bennett confessed id never have suspected the doctor we respected him trusted him its not right after a moment he added you took a hell of a chance with putnam you know if hed forgot for an hour that hes a man of the cloth it wouldnt have turned nasty rutledge retorted and i needed him to look at the hammers he glanced around saw that mallory was just bringing a chair for hamilton who looked out on his feet one hand pressing hard against his ribs felicity hamilton was leaning against the wall by the rector forlorn tears running down her face unheeded the revolver shoved into a pocket of her robe mallory touched hamilton on the shoulder nodding toward her he roused himself tried to stand again and then decided against it but he held his hand out to his wife and after a moment she came forward to take it mallory crossed to where bennett was standing with rutledge id like to leave now he said tightly am i free to go for the present bennett agreed after a glance at rutledge well speak tomorrow mallory nodded and started to walk back down the passage alone rutledge caught him up youre not to do anything foolish ive had enough trouble for one night by god no mallory said wearily i wont put that burden on felicity she doesnt deserve it and it would fuel the gossip you neednt worry he walked on then stopped just before opening the door into the hall his back to rutledge i was the best soldier i knew how to be we werent all cut from the same cloth if youre asking my forgiveness youve come to the wrong person for my sins i have no right to judge you or anyone else every time i looked in my mirror i saw your face the man i ought to have been it was a false mirror what you were searching for was someone to blame i want no part of it i have my own nightmares i dont need yours then damn it forgive me and be done with it rutledge could hear hamishs voice roaring in his ears but he stood there for a count of ten then said his words clipped and raw i forgive you mallory nodded and stepped through the door shutting it firmly behind him rutledge closed his eyes and swore long and fluently under his breath
