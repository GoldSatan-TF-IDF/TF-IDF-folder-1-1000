production limited polmont stirlingshire printed and bound in great britain by clays ltd st ives plc hodder and stoughton a division of hodder headline euston road london nwi bh to the mistress of my heart chapter thomas kydd stood awkwardly on the deck of the frigate with his few possessions at his feet a bare hour ago he had been an ordinary seaman in the old lineofbattle ship duke william now somewhere off the enemy coast of revolutionary france he was gazing back at her from a crack frigate as an able seaman a replacement for prize crew a hand lifted in farewell in the boat pulling back to the big shipoftheline it was whaley and with a lump in his throat kydd realised that he would probably never see his broad smile again or share a grog with his other old shipmates it had started hard as a young perruquier from guildford kydd had been seized by the pressgang six months before but despite all he had suffered he had come to admire the skill and courage of the seamen and now as a sailor himself he was parting from the ship that had been his home for so long he waved in return and forced his attention back inboard men were waiting on deck a weatherbeaten older man in plain black and a much worn tricorne a hardlooking lieutenant in serviceable seagoing blues a childlike midshipman without a hat and the man at the wheel stolidly chewing tobacco next to kydd renzi gave a conspiratorial grimace they had been through much together he and his friend the others in the little party looked equally bemused stirk the tough gun captain doud the devilmaycare topman doggo a ferally ugly able seaman pinto a neat and deadly iberian and wong the inscrutable circus strongman but there would be no complaint service in a fast frigate ranging the oceans for prey and prize money was infinitely preferable to the boredom of a big ship on blockade duty brace around that foresail run away with it you damn sluggards the hard bellow from behind startled kydd away aloft you dawdling old women lay out and loose the officer was dressed in austere sea rig only faded lace indicating that here was the most powerful man aboard a post captain in the royal navy and commander of the frigate the men leaped to obey kydd saw that they moved with enthusiasm and speed quite unlike the heavy deliberate movements hed been used to in the battleship some made a race of it sprinting along the top of the swaying yard before dropping to the footrope in a daring display of skill artemis responded immediately the chuckle of water under her forefoot feathering rapidly the creaking of cordage and sheaves as more sails were sheeted home soon rewarded with an eager swoop across the broad atlantic swell kydd felt the lively response with a lifting of the heart to windward in the duke william the ponderous spars were still coming around but the frigate was already stretching over the sparkling sea impatient to be away turning to them the captain roared lay aft you men he stood abaft the wheel with no poop in a frigate the spar deck swept unbroken from the beakhead forward in a sweet curve right aft to the taffrail kydd and the others moved quickly this was black jack powlett the famous frigate captain who already had five prizes to his name safe in english ports there was no mistaking the quality of the man the hard penetrating stare and pugnacious forward lean of his body he looked at them speculatively hands clasped behind his back so youre all able seamen his eyes flicked over to the fast receding bulk of the threedecker astern goddamn it ill not believe caldwell has only prime hands to spare his voice was cool but there was a restlessness in his manner a coiled energy that seemed to radiate out to those around him his hand stroked his closeshaven blueblack jaw as he tried to make sense of the gift you sir he snapped at doud pray be so good as to touch the sheave of the flying jibboom doud gaped then turned and darted forward he was being asked to touch the very tip of the bowsprit eighty feet out over the sea powlett drew out a silver watch and you sir he rounded on renzi both stunsl boom irons of the fore tgallant yard the restless eyes settled on kydd who tensed to touch the main truck if you please the main truck the very highest point in the vessel kydd knew that his standing as seaman rested on his actions of the next few minutes he swung nimbly into the main shrouds heaving himself up the ratlines and around the futtock shrouds on and up the main topmast shrouds he swarmed conserving his strength for the last lap at the main topmast top the ratlines stopped he stepped out on to the cross trees and looked down already at a height of one hundred and thirty feet he was as far aloft as he had ever been before but still above was the royal yard and beyond that the truck he grasped the single rope topgallant mast shrouds firmly at this height the pitch and roll were fierce and he was jerked through a vertiginous seventyfoot arc his feet pinioning the tarred rope and hands pulling upwards he made his way to the light royal yard and past that to the seizings of the main royal backstay the truck was only a matter of a few feet further a round cap at the very tip of the mast but now there was nothing but the bare mast the motion was alarming a soaring through the airy firmament before a whipping stop and surge the other way the pole mast was only a few inches thick and he locked his legs around it securely before transferring his grip and hauling himself upwards not daring to look down he watched the truck come closer nearer and then it was within his reach something rattled on the far side of the mast he followed it up and saw that it was a stout chain clamped to the round of the truck a newfangled lightning conductor on a crazy impulse he transferred his hands to the chain and drew himself up to the truck itself a strong copper rod continued in the thin air beyond the truck it was the work of moments to heave himself up and past the cap and then he was standing erect on the birdslimed truck trembling with fatigue and exhilaration and holding the lightning rod in a death grip he flung up an arm to indicate his position but before starting his descent he snatched a look at the panorama every part of the vessel was now at a level below him decks masts sails not a single thing intruded to spoil the totality of his threehundredandsixtydegree view carefully lowering himself back down the mast he slid the few feet down to the royal backstay transferring his grip from mast to stay he soared hand over hand down the backstay to the deck again i do confess i am at a stand its no parcel of lubberly landmen we have here mr spershott powlett said to the lean officer next to him it took a moment or two for kydd to realise why the mess deck was so different there were the same mess tables and ships side racks for cutlery and mess traps but here there were no massive cannon regularly spaced along the sides aboard the battleship kydd was used to having his living space between a pair of massive thirtytwopounder long guns sharing his domestics with the smoke and blast of broadsides but here there was only a single function it was noon and the berth deck was alive with gossip and laughter after the issue of grog a ships boy had shown them to their new mess half the party to a starboard mess the other to larboard they stood awkwardly hear tell theys promising ter send us some real manowar hands said a thinlooking older man at the ships side kydd knew enough about unwritten mess etiquette to realise that this was the senior hand of the mess like the others he deliberately chose not to notice the newcomers a handsome wellgroomed sailor replied as long as theyre not shipoftheline jacks is all i asks them bigship ways no room fer marching up an down in this little barky the older man snorted nor all that there flags an buntin all th time an yerve gotta be slow in th wits to be big ships else yer intellects rot waitin while the ship wants ter tack about has t be a big ship came back the other all them pressed men why they has to batten em down when they makes port else theyll think to ramble off home like the older man started as though seeing the arrivals for the first time well look who it aint a parcel o royal billyssit yerselves down then grogs up selfconsciously kydd edged over and sat next to a neat slightly built sailor who held out his hand with a pleasant smile guess we have t take ye aboard we being grievous shorthanded n all he said adam nathan adam kydd tom kydd he flushed with pleasure quite unconscious of the striking figure of a seaman he now made his dark strong features were well set off by the short blue jacket white duck trousers and a red kerchief knotted carelessly over a blue striped waistcoat his ebony hair gleamed in a tight clubbed pigtail his tanned open face bore a broad white smile sliding in easily next to kydd renzi sat opposite curious looks met his from around the table for he was most definitely at variance with the usual manowars man with his careful intelligent dark eyes and a face with incised lines of character suggesting dangerous mystery renzis black hair short to the point of monasticism also hinted at an inner discipline quite unlike the carefree sailors he was next to a wellmuscled black man who turned to greet him never bin in a shipotheline meself he said guess theres plenty more room in them big ships know where id rather be kydd said the senior hand interrupted got yer traps kydd fished around in his ditty bag and drew out his tankard an old brassstrapped wooden one that had once belonged to a close shipmate now dead me apologies about the blackstrap the man said upending a bottle into the tankard capn thinks to give us thisn instead o the right sort he shrugged took a thousan off a frenchy last week renzis eyes widened he picked up the bottle eagerly and stared at the label my god he said haut brion premier cru the seventynine no less his beautifully modulated patrician tones took them aback quite as much as his words but in the ageold custom of the sea no obvious notice was taken of a character quirk hey now yer mate likes our grog then the black man said happily the senior hand banged on the table with his grog can a little of the rich dark wine spilling mature and lined with an oddly soft voice he announced we has new chums mates the others paid attention names petit elias petit n yer already knows nathan yon hulkin blackamoor we call im quashee n if yer wants ter raise a right decent seapie hes yer man kydd nodded tom kydd an nicholas renzi he said gesturing towards renzi he noticed the curiosity that renzis manner had evoked but continued and pinto er fernando da mesouta pinto your service the wallfaced iberian added smoothly pinto is a portugee kydd said and nicholas is my particular friend he concluded firmly a thatchhaired lad brought up two kids of food and thumped them on the table thank ee luke petit said the lad upended a wooden tub to sit on and looked at the newcomers with the frankness of youth petit lifted the lid of one wooden container tis poor stuff only he announced defensively and began doling out the food kydd could hardly believe his eyes real china plates instead of squares of dark wood a pewter spoon and even a fork and the food the oatmeal was not only seasoned with herbs but the meat was pigs trotters with collops of real meat this was a feast petit looked at kydd curiously so yer likes our scran too he said kydd thought of the single galley in the shipoftheline serving eight hundred men you could have anything so long as it could be boiled in the vast coppers yessir he answered we has a saying in royal billy which we hear before we begins our salt beef he assumed an air of reverence old horse old horse what brought you here youve carried me gear for many a year an now wore out with sore abuse they salt you down for sailors use they gaze on you with sad surprise they roll ye over and bugger yr eyes they eat yr meat and pick your bones and send the rest f davey jones laughing they fell upon the food kydd glanced across the width of the deck to the mess opposite doggo wong and the others were clearly enjoying their change of fortune also and a slow wink broke stirks oaken face hear tell as how yr blackjack is a tartar mumbled kydd his mouth full not as who would say petit replied the cat aint seen th daylight this five weeks or more capn he knows its us what fights the ship for im n so he treats us aright does he what about the first luff kydd asked absentmindedly tapping a piece of hardtack on the table to his surprise no blackheaded weevils squirmed out spershott dont say much keeps station on the capn always he does said petit dismissively its party yer wants ter watch second luff thinks hes goin to make his mark b comin down on rowley the third its devilbait agin harry flashers all bloody day long an neville prompted quashee an neville agreed petit kinda fourth luff but supernumery wished on us b the admiral who wants to put him in the way of a mort o prize money my guess he grunted and added but a square sort ill grant yer kydd took another pull at his tankard the wine was rich and smooth adam seemed not to relish it not to yr taste nathan kydd asked amiably the courteous expression did not change christ abstained blue light sailor said petit wiping his mouth but he dursnt top it the preacher wi us kydd nodded and looking at adam continued with a smile aye but christ made damn sure the wedding wasnt dry though didnt he adam looked at him steadily and sipped his drink where are we headed do you believe renzi asked where theres a frenchy what swims quashee chuckled he aped a prize agent reluctantly doling out the guineas so ludicrous was the sight of his bulk going through the motions that the mess fell about helpless petit clapped him on the back true enough yer black bastard that is ter say that were raidin commerce which is ter say that evrything what is under sail has ter loose topsls to us n we has first pickins at the fore hatchway the squeal of boatswains calls cut through the sociability reluctantly the sailors rose evening quarters was exercised every day at sea in artemis at four bells in the last dogwatch the entire ships company closed up for action to the stirring sound of hearts of oak on the fife and drum lieutenant rowley had the gundeck and stood impassive at the fore hatch kydd noted the puffs of white lace that emerged at each sleeve and the luxuriant hair carefully styled in the new romantic vogue his fashionable cynical mannerisms gave the impression of hauteur heightened by the faultlessly cut uniform his orders were resonant enough however exercise of the great guns gun captains in your own time stirk mustered his gun crew his previous ship experience had ensured a rate of gun captain and with kydd and renzi there were three other royal billys wong pinto and doggo that left two of the original frigate crew on this gun gully a bushy roundfaced man and colton the second gun captain a shrewish man with an uneven temper the twelvepounder was only bellyhigh where the great thirtytwopounders aboard the lower gundeck of duke william were chesthigh other than that the cannon were nearly identical and kydd saw that the only real difference was in the number of men up to twenty men were needed to serve the big guns here there were but three together with a gun captain and his second and the powder monkey stirk was equal to the challenge right different ships different long splices this barky likes it b numbers so eres how we go he considered his men doggo youre number one load wad an shot kydd number two want you to sponge n ram renzi number three get the wad an shot to number one gully is it number four on the side tackle please mate with pinto an wong as number five n six on the tackle oh yeah five an six as well works the handspike n everyone bears a fist on the tackle falls runnin out the gun an me mr stirk called the gangling boy at the hatch gratings amidships an mr luke ooll be doin the honours with the powder he added gravely he stepped back bumping into colton there was a moment of tension as stirk stared him down an the second captain overhauls th trainin tackle the routine of loading and firing was simple enough the gun was run out and fired then recoiled inboard the cannon was sponged out and a cartridge and wad rammed home a ball was slammed in the muzzle another was followed rammed firmly in place and the gun was run out again ready for firing it was teamwork that counted not only with the danger of naked powder brought close to gun blast but the whole effectiveness of the gun depended on knowing what to do and keeping out of the way of others when they did their part we does it slow time first lads ordered stirk this was kydds first time on the rammer it was confusing that the rammer and sponge were at either end of the same stout wooden stave he laid the stave down sponge inboard and joined at the side tackle the gun was run out the noise seemed more of a heavy rattle than the bass rumble of the three tons of the larger gun gun as fired stirk said laconically he looked pointedly at colton but wong and pinto thrust past and seized the training tackle at the breech end of the gun to make it recoil kydd had the sponge ready in the bucket and lifted the dripping sheepskin passing the rammer end out of the gunport to get more room he plunged it into the muzzle renzi across from kydd had an imaginary cartridge and wad ready for doggo who stuffed them into the muzzle kydd quickly had the cuplike end of the rammer stabbing down inside the muzzle doggo took the shot and another wad and slammed them into the maw kydd repeated his ramming and the gun crew hauled together on the tackles to run out stirk performed his priming and pointing and the cycle was over we does it now in quick time he growled they did it again causing stirk to groan with frustration kydd in his enthusiasm had his rammer flailing straight after doggos cartridge but before his wad could be applied and wong used to the huge inertia of larger guns tripped over at the side tackle and sent his side down in a tangle of cursing men at that moment a single squeal from a boatswains call pierced the din still cried rowley striding aft to meet the captain with his first lieutenant rowley removed his hat as powlett stepped on to the gundeck all movement ceased where are our royal billys if you please mr rowley powlett demanded this way sir rowley replied and with a graceful gesture moved forward kydd watched them approach rowley was short enough to stand upright and stepped carefully as if distrustful of where he trod powlett stooped slightly and ranged like a wary lion spershott hurried on behind duke williams sir tobias stirk gun captain kydd sensed a cold ferocity behind powletts eyes and felt his back stiffening your men up to service in a frigate stirk powlett rasped stirk hesitated very well well have the measure of you nevertheless powlett drew out his watch he swung round to the twelvepounder next along symonds aye sir the other gun captain said carefully you and the royal billys will exercise together he turned back to stirk run out on my mark stirk spat on his hands and glared at his crew powlett consulted his watch now his arm swept down and the gun crews leapt into action with wongs great strength at the training tackle the recoil was accomplished rapidly with nervous energy kydd sponged and withdrew doggos cartridge instantiy ready at the muzzle kydd returned with the stave but doggo hissed savagely fuckin rammer kydd had made a stupid mistake he had not reversed the stave and the wet sheepskin was still inboard with the rammer gaily poking out of the gunport he tried to turn the stave outside the port but he fumbled and it fell away tumbling noisily against the ships side and into the sea sinking in the wake astern symonds and his crew laughed cruelly spershott stepped over scandalised crown property this will be stopped from your pay you rascal powlett held up a hand no royal billys will carry on with their exercise and the rest of you may secure and stand down he spared just one glance for the furious stirk and returned up the ladder liberated from duty the artemis hands gathered for the entertainment and for the rest of the dogwatch the redfaced stirk drove his crew mercilessly to the jeers and laughter of the others the days that followed were not easy for the royal billys things moved faster in a frigate it needed agile feet to get out on a slender yard and back and her speed of response at the helm took even stirk by surprise it was sailoring on a different and more challenging plane but stung by the element of competition they responded nimbly it was six weeks he had been in artemis and kydd now felt he had found his feet the middle watch was going slowly as lookout kydd could not pass the time companionably with renzi and must occupy himself for an hour staring out into the night kydd drew his grego closer about him the coarse wadmerel material warm and quite up to keeping out the keen night winds the fitful moon was mostly hidden in cloud leaving an impenetrable gloom that made it difficult even to discern the nearby helmsman kydd gazed out again over the hurrying seas fighting a comfortable drowsiness something caught his eye far out into the night a blink of paleness suddenly apparent at the extremity of his vision then gone he stared hard but could not catch it again there it was once more a momentary pallid blob appearing and disappearing in one place officer o the watch sir kydd called a voice replied from the other side of the deck and a dark figure loomed next to him kydd sir larbd after lookout saw something way to looard flash o white or so where away it was parrys hard voice the pale object obliged by winking into existence in the general direction kydd indicated remaining for a brief space before it disappeared party had his night glass up instantly searching damn it yes i have it he snapped the glass down pass the wordmy duty to the captain and a sail is sighted with a captain like powlett there could only be one response they would close on the sail and take their chances in the short time before powlett hastened on deck artemis had braced around and begun bearing down on the strange sail ill trouble you to take in the topsails mr parry no point in alarming them unnecessarily the pale blob steadied and remained we keep to windward stand off and on until dawn after an hour it became clear that the stranger had sighted them and changed course towards them artemis followed suit to retain her windward position the stranger soon tired of this and eased away off the wind and the two ships spent the remaining hours of darkness running parallel under easy sail the stirring rattle of the drums died away and with every man closed up at his post they waited for the darkness to lift artemis always met a new day with guns run out and men at quarters they would never be caught out by the light of day revealing an enemy alongside ready to blow them out of the water the stranger was still there at daybreak five miles under their lee the summer dawn languorously painting in the colours of the day darkling sea to a vivid cobalt lilac sky to a perfect cerulean with vast towers of pure white clouds to the south it also revealed the sleek low black and yellow lines of a frigate quite as big as they and in the process of shortening sail artemis bore down on the vessel every glass trained on her the quarterdeck grew tense she does not throw out her private signal dammit grunted powlett if this were a royal navy ship there was a need to establish the relative seniority of their respective captains but on the other hand she might well have thought that artemis end on could be a french ship and feel reluctant to deter the approach by showing her true colours too soon the sailing master mr prewse took off his hat to scratch at his sparse hair dont know as i recognises her as a kings ship at all the boatswain took a telescope and stared at the stranger for a long time could be a swede but my moneys on her bein a frenchy powletts response was quick why so cos sir she has squaredoff hances much less of a sheer an as you can see sir the focsle rail is never carried forrard of the cathead shes frenchbuilt right enough thank you mr merrydew powlett said quietly if you please sir parry stood patiently before powlett his expression as uncompromising as ever mr parry the second lieutenant motioned forward a sailor what is it boyden sir that theres the sitoyen he said definitively the what sitoyen seen er in toulong we was alongside takin in wine we was sir last days o the peace n she takes a piece outa us comin down with the tide powlett stiffened the citoyenne you mean youre sure what is her force man thirtysix long twelves sixes on the quarterdeck dont remember else ah shes big an has a considrable crew powlett nodded unlike the worldranging british frigates french vessels could resupply at any time and as a consequence were crowded with fighting men this one was also smart and confident and presumably did not have prize crews away and sir yes her capn is a right tartar beggin yer pardon like sir our second lootenant he eard him ter say that if the new crew didnt shape up sharpish he promises ter turn em over inta the galleys an that moren six months ago lieutenant neville cleared his throat and said lightly then we can expect a warm welcome no smile broke powletts expression eyes of the world i rather fancy rowleys musing was illtimed but ignoring powletts glower he pursued the thought for the first time in this war here we have a match of equal force the only thing to tip the scales will be the character of the nation will hotblooded revolutionary zeal triumph over the lords of the sea or does right prevail it will be a tournament that i rather think will mean more to the country than a single lonely battle far out at sea parry turned on rowley are you in any doubt of the outcome sir i would be a fool were i to think other than that it will be a hardfought contest but it will go hard for us at home should fortune deny us the victory powlett broke clear of the group give em a gun and tell em who we are mr parry a gun to weather banged out overhead the battle ensign broke out its enormous size streaming brazenly in the breeze powlett bared his teeth rig the splinter nettings mr parry and well have barricades in the tops he glanced at the heavy frigate riding the waves ahead were going to have to earn our honours today leaning out of the gunport below kydd and stirk tried to make out the ship ahead hes a frog n wes invitin him to a tea party stirk said pulling back inboard an it looks to be a right roaratorious time he bein at least our weight o metal kydd looked at the enemy again there was activity at the braces as the ship began a turn her profile shortened as she fell away off the wind showing her ornamented stern and gathering way as she fled from them kydd was incredulous shes running renzis cool voice from behind answered him as she should of course dear fellow her captain knows his job is to fall upon our merchant shipping our commerce that is the greatest harm she can do our cause we are of the same force if he engages the best he can expect is a cosdy battle he will be damaged and cannot proceed to his real work he must preserve his ship stirk looked at him in contempt preserve is ship no man preserves is honour by runnin not even a frenchy renzi shrugged haaands to make sail powlett wanted royals loosed citoyenne was shaping a course that took the breeze on her quarter but artemis was not accounted a flyer for nothing taut and trim she sped along kydd joined the others on the foredeck watching the chase foamflecks spattered up from the slicing stem streaming air thrumming gaily in the rigging the weather was perfect for artemis and she drew closer citoyennewas now some small miles ahead and downwind without warning citoyenneangled over to come as close to the wind as she could lie artemis followed suit immediately to keep to her weather position and the two sped over the lifting seas powlett rapidly had bowlines fast to their bridles stretching the forward edges of the sails to their utmost in a hard straining of every stitch of canvas haaands to quarters kydd clattered down the forehatch and closed up at his gun heart thudding he pulled down the rammer stave from its beckets at the deckhead and stood clear while stirk checked gear renzi looked calm and flexed his shoulders others finished folding and tying their kerchiefs over their ears most stripped to the waist while some tested the wet sanded deck to decide whether bare feet would give the better grip stirk made a fuss of securing lukes ear pads the boy stood wideeyed on the hatch gratings and from the tone of stirks murmuring kydd guessed that he was doing his best to ease the lads fears he wondered what he could think of to say in like circumstances the gundeck settled the guns long since run out ready for the first broadside stirk waited patiently at the breech with the lanyard from the gunlock coiled in his hand kydd now perfectly competent at his task after long hours of practice was icily aware that this was not an exercise he remembered his previous brush with the enemy but that had been in a powerful shipoftheline he had seen blood and death but it had ended brutally and quickly now he wondered how he would perform in a much smaller ship at closer quarters he shuddered and looked about him doggo his station at the muzzle was leaning out of the gunport gazing steadily ahead renzi stood with his arms folded a halfsmile playing on his lips on the centreline luke waited with his cartridge box in his hands anxiously watching stirk kydd knew that he was more worried about letting down his hero than possible death or mutilation the gundeck was strangely quiet odd shipboard noises sounding overloud the cordage tension in working so closehauled producing a finely tuned high frequency in the wind suddenly dry in the mouth kydd crossed to the centre of the gundeck and scooped at the scuttled butt of vinegar and water relatively shorthanded they had crews to fight the guns on one side only but with a single opponent this was no disadvantage rowley paced at the forward end of the gundeck with a london dandys nonchalance his action clothing was plainer than usual but kydd noticed just a peep of lace at the sleeves and his buttons gleamed with the glitter of gold his sword however held an air of uncompromising martial serviceability whatn hell doggo shouted they crowded to the gunport citoyenne was shortening sail and slowing as they watched she relaxed her hard beat to windward into a more comfortable full and bye and soon lay quietly under topsails she was ready to turn on her tormentor no you will await my order powletts roar was directed at parry who had drawn his sword and was pacing about like a wild animal artemis surged on the distance rapidly closing shorten sail to topsails mr prewse lay me within pistol shot to windward of her if you please powlett ordered the big courses were brought to the yards and furled seamen working frantically as if determined not to miss the excitement to come artemis slowed to a glide the ships drew closer damn me that he doesnt risk a raking broadside muttered merrydew as artemis turned for the final run in to place herself parallel to the citoyenneshe would necessarily expose her bow to her opponent even one roundshot passing down the length of the vessel could do terrible damage smashing through the guns one after another maiming and killing in an unstoppable swathe of destruction but there was no cannon fire in silence artemis glided towards the enemy frigate her own broadside held to a hair trigger parry glanced at powlett who stood foursquare on the quarterdeck facing the citoyenneas the two ships converged on my signal snarled powlett at a walking pace citoyenneslipped forward enough way on for the rudder to answer men crowded on her decks the knot of officers on her quarterdeck clearly distinguishable from her open gunports the muzzles of cannon menaced each one ready to deliver a crushing blow but still they rested silent their captain party whispered the blue and gold figure opposite stood erect and proud his arm swept up and he removed his hat with a courtly bow my god parry blurted shut up powlett snapped he removed his own hat sweeping it down in an elegant leg then stood tall and imperious long live his majesty king george he roared huzzah for the king dumbfounded the group of officers removed their hats at the wild cheering that erupted from all parts of their vessel opposite the french captain waited patiently for the sound to die now the ships ran parallel at an easy pace some two hundred yards apart the captain turned to one of a nearby gun crew and seized his cap holding it aloft it was a phrygian cap of liberty vive la republiquethe emotion in his voice was evident even across the distance a storm of hoarse cheering broke out the captain clutched the cap once to his bosom then thrust it at a seaman followed by cheering acclamation the man swarmed up the main shrouds and at the masthead nailed the cap in place powlett straightened enough of this nonsense he snorted and clapped his hat back on his head it was the signal after the briefest of pauses artemissbroadside smashed out in a brutal thunderous roar instantly filling the space between the two ships with acrid rolling gunsmoke the first broadside was an earsplitting mindblasting slam of sound choking the gundeck with writhing masses of smoke immediately citoyennes broadside answered it arrived in a storm of violence iron roundshot beating into artemiss sides and deck smashing splintering killing load yer buggers yelled stirk the gun crew threw themselves at the task there was no time for kydd to look around to discover the source of the terrible shrieking nearby no time to ponder the origin of the heavy clattering overhead or the strange quiet of the gun next to them it was impossible to see anything of the enemy through the gunport they remained unseen under the double volume of gunsmoke he wielded his dripping spongerammer with a nervous fury plunging it into the still smoking maw of the twelvepounder deep inside with a couple of twists to the left and out again with twists to the right doggo was there in an instant with the lethal grey cartridge and then a wad into the muzzle kydd had the stave reversed and savagely stabbed the rammer down he caught stirks eyes as he looked down the gun from the breech end his thumb over the vent hole to detect when the cartridge was truly seated but there was no hint of recognition then the ball clapped in by doggo and followed by a final wad kydds movements on the rammer were fierce and positive if they could get away another broadside before the enemy it was the same as doubling their firepower run out stirk shouted hoarsely the gun bellowed and slammed in kydd leapt into action again the same motions the work the need to intermesh his movements with the others meant there was no time for fear the second broadside from citoyenne came smashing in a long roll of terrible crashes instead of the massed simultaneity of the first kydd froze as they beat in on his senses to his left next to him kydd saw gully drop to his knees with a muffled cry in the smoky darkness it was difficult to see the cause but the spreading dark stain under him was plain enough he fell to his side and scrabbled at the fat of his upper thigh kydd stared at the footlong splinter which had been driven up by a rampaging ball and transfixed him gully wept with pain and crawled away in a trail of blood stirks eyes searched wildly for a replacement kydd glanced across the gun and saw renzi his face grave and thought how easy it would have been for his friend to be a victim instead he crushed the thought and shoved the side tackle rope into the hand of the unknown seaman who was taking gullys place the enemy were pacing them there would not be any doubling of firepower it would be a fight to the death among equals powlett strolled slowly and grimly on the quarterdeck as debris rained down from above only the sails of the enemy were visible but in her fighting tops above the smoke moving figures could be seen levelling muskets at artemiss quarterdeck neville clasped his hands firmly behind him and paced slowly on the other side of the deck parry had his sword out and was gripping the mizzen shrouds as he glared across at the enemy merrydew had disappeared into the hell forward with his mates and the young midshipman attending on the captain was visibly trembling a second broadside from citoyennecrashed out into the thinning smoke between them as the awful onslaught struck powlett was enveloped for a moment by the powder smoke then a sudden shock was transmitted through the deck planking a thin scream came from out of nowhere and neville was struck violently sent sprawling by the flailing limbs of a man falling from aloft neville picked himself up the man now lay untidily dead a roundshot had nearly severed the driver gaff between the throat and peak halliards the long spar began to sag then in a slow rending it fell apart without support the big sail first crumpled then ripped from top to bottom the heavy boom and rigging crushing and entangling the larboard sixpounder crews cant hold er the helmsman shouted spinning the wheel fast to prevent the ship sagging to leeward and the enemy powlett turned to the midshipman tell em to get in the headsails he snapped artemis slowed her fine sailing qualities useless without a driver sail aft if she showed canvas forward they would pivot around in a helpless spiral they could neither manoeuvre nor run away the smoke drifted over the bright sea revealing citoyennepulling triumphantly ahead the sun caught a quick flash of glass on her quarterdeck as her officers eagerly inspected the damage to artemis it was obvious that there was no way they could effect a battle repair on the driver quickly it was a unique foreandaft sail that needed special gear to set it out from the mast and without manoeuvrability they could only take what was coming after a few hundred yards citoyennebegan her turn into the wind this would take her across the bows of artemis and would let her rake her adversary as she tacked around this nightmare of a full broadside smashing headlong into her bows and down the length of the vessel was now upon them forward the experienced focslemen saw the danger and frantically reset the headsails jib staysails anything artemis responded falling away off the wind but in so doing she kept her broadside to bear turning in time with citoyenne with all the fury of helplessness artemis thundered out her broadside again strikes on citoyenne visible now from her quarterdeck the reply was thin and ragged but this was only because most of the experienced french seamen would be at work putting the ship about citoyenne completed her tack and was now ready to pass back in the opposite direction poised to deliver her next broadside with full crews her tactics had also given her the weather gauge an upwind position which would allow her now to dictate the conditions of the battle the french frigate began her pass but there was one advantage that had been left artemis citoyennes battered side faced them once more but it was their own undamaged opposite side that awaited the clash as the two vessels passed guns crashed out as they bore no pretence at disciplined broadsides like the pot shots of a crazy drunk the cruel iron shot pounded into artemis as the ships slipped past at one point spershott emerging from below was flung across the deck like a childs discarded rag doll he did not move where he sprawled two sailors took him by the arms and legs and dragged him below powlett did not pause in his calm pacing citoyenne ceased fire as she reached beyond artemis the enemy frigate wore around so sure of her victim that she eschewed the faster tacking in going about for the more deliberate but less taxing wear in wearing ship citoyenne would now pass much closer this was the act of a supremely confident commander who wanted to finish things quickly mr neville roared powlett from the other side of the deck repel boarders he was grimed in smoke but stood stiff as a ramrod the french frigate was pressing close because she was coming in to board with her superior weight of numbers she was going to end it all with a final broadside before boarding artemis in the gunsmoke aye aye sir neville yelled back powlett cracked a grim smile go to it the gundeck was a pit of horror with the space wreathed in thick choking powder smoke shot through with screams and cries kydd knew only the unvarying cycle of load and fire the wet sheepskin of his sponge met the blistering iron each time with a mad sizzle at each pass of the enemy there was a monotonous crashing and thudding of roundshot strikes the guns fell silent it seemed on the gundeck that citoyennewas taking time wearing around instead of tacking the smoke gradually cleared and those who could peered from the gunports the enemy was returning closing with the clear intention of finishing artemis repel boarders awaaaay first division of boarders kydd hesitated off yer go cock stirk said in a hoarse voice an best o luck mate with his heart pounding with dread kydd rushed up the forehatch on deck the ship was in ruinous condition shotthrough sails ragged and unravelled rigging hanging down and swinging in the breeze and scored and splintered decks littered with blocks and debris the last act had begun he stumbled across to the foremast and yanked away a boarding pike from its stand a boatswains mate directed him aft where he joined the little group on the quarterdeck lieutenant neville was there with drawn sword he had thrown off his coat and now stood dramatically in front of them we shall meet the french like heroes and we will drive them back into the sea there was a prickling in his right leg that distracted kydd below the knee a splinter had torn his trouser and had penetrated his flesh before ripping its way out again it was the coagulated blood sticking and pulling at his leghairs that annoyed him he allowed a twisted smile to acknowledge his first wound in battle then cut away his duck trousers above the wound astern citoyennetook in sail preparatory to coming in on her focsle her boarders were massed a menacing shouting crowd pikemen at the ready neville called loudly to the bulwarks advance belay that it was powlett madness on the deck get down theyll be using grape you fool they fell to the deck behind the low bulwarks the forward guns of citoyennewere charged with grapeshot and they unleashed their hail of deadly small balls the shot battered and tore at the nettings and side but did not find flesh to tear it was a different matter for the carronades on artemis these ugly little weapons short and stubby cannon on a slide could bear aft and when they replied it was with canister a sleeting cloud of musket balls which found targets aplenty in the bodies of the boarders shouts and jeers turned instantly to shrieks and cries and to kydds horrified fascination runnels of blood began coursing down the bow of the ship as it passed by their quarterdeck silly buggers grunted the carronade gun captain the other carronade had held its fire and its captain was fiercely concentrating on the changing angle citoyenne bow swept by but still he did not fire men he will attempt to board in the smoke of his broadside neville called loudly his voice broke with the intensity of his warning kydd understood and rose with the others to the ready grounding the butt end of the boarding pike he thrust it forward and outward and tried to remember all he had been told soon there would be a final broadside and somewhere from the powder smoke would come a screaming pack of frenchmen he had to be ready to meet them the enemy boatspace passed with still no firing but citoyenne was slowing for the kill kydd held his breath suddenly the remaining carronade blasted off it caught kydd unawares but its shot a twentyfourpounder roundshot was well aimed it smashed squarely into the base of the enemys mizzen mast which slowly fell towards them bringing down the entire mass of sails spars and rigging and the hapless men in the mizzen top over the side but there was an additional and crucial injury the shot that had chewed a fatal bite from the mizzen mast had first smashed the ships wheel without helm citoyennewas out of control she surged away for a short time but then swung towards artemis the angle opened but they were so close that the result was inevitable the long bowsprit of the french ship speared across the decks of artemis between the foremast and mainmast and the frigate thumped heavily to a stop her bow hard up against the midships of her prey kydd watched appalled inertia drove at the french frigate but her locked foreend prevented her completing the move hundreds of tons forced the big bowsprit against artemiss mainmast it stopped dead then strained and creaked noisily under the pressure something had to give either artemiss mainmast or citoyennes entire bowsprit and forward gear both ships seemed to hold their breath there was a series of thunderclap cracking noises then french fir gave best to british oak and in a deafening splintering surge the bowsprit broke and the whole fore assembly of citoyennegave way her bow dissolved into a tangle of spars rigging and sails most of which lay draped on artemiss midships relieved of the frenzy of forces citoyenneswung into artemis and came to rest alongside stand to yelled neville this was now the decisive time no more manoeuvring no more waiting the battle had reached its climax seamen spread out along the bulwarks pikes resolutely outward but they were so pitifully few powlett stood stock still staring at the citoyenne sir said neville theres something wrong aboard the frenchy powlett muttered there seemed to be confusion a turmoil of directionless men a number had begun swarming up the rigging on some desperate mission but angry shouts indicated that the order had been countermanded or misunderstood some milled about the decks but nowhere were boarders massing for the attack her captain has fallen powlett said in a low voice then louder savagely he said and we have our chance mr neville he drew his sword awaaaay boarders neville looked thunderstruck then grinned aye aye sir boarders away a fullthroated cheer roared up from the men this was better than waiting tamely for the enemy pikes were thrown to the deck men raced to the arms chest and snatched their weapons a brace of pistols a cutlass some took a tomahawk kydd stuffed a pair of pistols into his wide belt and also grabbed a cutlass which he held as naked steel tensing nervously he turned back to neville the man seemed strangely serene his eyes flashed then he turned to his men boarders to the fore advance god save the king with his sword stabbing ahead he plunged forward the first division of boarders followed him men scrambled on and up to the remains of the bowsprit it lay across the battereddown bulwarks of artemis amidships a perfect bridge into the heart of the enemy with mad cheering and wild waving of cudasses they were soon on the broad top of the big spar slashing at the entangled rigging neville forced his way across to the focsle of the other ship to the rapidly gathering band of enraged french kydd stumbled and charged with the others his thoughts a mad whirl of the imperative for victory and survival the gundeck cleared of smoke revealing the wreckage of battle the occasional cannon crashed out from their foe but with the ruin of citoyerwes forerigging there was a pause in the fighting the after end of citoyenne completed its swing and the shotscarred side of the frigate filled the frame of the gunport above them on the upper deck came a roar of british cheering renzi looked at the smokebegrimed stirk who met his gaze with a tired smile looks like we got ourselves a tartar by th tail he said the slight relative motion of the vessels brought their gunports into line with men away repelling boarders the british guns could not be served they had to stand silent until the tide of battle had turned through the port renzi could see erratic movements in the other ship then he understood the thumping of feet on the deck above was towards the ships side it was they who were boarding with a breaking wave of emotion he screamed were boarding by god its us stirk glared at him realisation struck and he threw himself at the midships arms chest and brought out a cutlass move you bastards renzi hurled himself to the chest and snatched up a cutlass for himself jostled impatiently by others with a bulllike roar stirk lunged into the gaping gunport through and on to the enemy gundeck renzi followed close behind and jumped into the hostile deck fetching up next to a dismounted gun the scene was a crazy impression of bodies live and dead the low deckhead left no room for subtleties the swordsman in renzi sank to butchery the robust greased steel of the sea service cutlass cleaving and plunging their bold attack was unexpected and opposition melted as more british seamen poured through the gunports and battered a path towards the cabin spaces aft jumping to the enemy foredeck kydd nearly impaled himself on a pike shoved at him by a fearfully pale young man kydds cutlass came up and being inside the long pike he turned its length to his advantage it was easy to force the pike aside leaving the man at his mercy the face sagged in sudden realisation kydds blade slashed forward and with an inhuman shriek the frenchman crunched and gouted blood kydd drew the cutlass back the grey steel now streaked red the man was already at kydds feet a spreading pool of blood under his jerking body kydd looked up a larger seaman with a moustache threw himself towards him his cutlass ready at point kydd clumsily came to an outside halfhanger and felt a violent clash of steel the cutlass flashed back and kydds inside guard was only just in time and instinctive the assault ended in a deadly slither along his blade to the hilt it banged against his forehead and he felt the hot burn of a wound the man was overbearing thrusting slashing kydd gave ground suddenly his antagonist slipped on the spreading pool of blood and reflexively threw out his arms kydd thrust out and felt his blade jar against bone before sinking deep into softer tissue the cutlass was jerked from his hands but it was the man falling to his knees kydds blade jutting from his chest kydd looked around wildly it was impossible to make sense of the melee and he caught the flash of movement of a french officer who lunged towards him with a rapier horror seized kydd but in a frenzied split second he remembered his pistols and drew one from his belt at the full length of his arm he shoved the heavy weapon straight into the face of the officer and pulled the trigger the mans face became a mask of blood and bone and he crashed to the deck in front of kydd his first victim still lay sprawled on his side kydd stamped his foot on the body of the other seaman and heaved out his cutlass he looked around men were fleeing general confusion he heard nevilles shouted orders from ahead and hurried forward to the scrimmage by the boatspace it had broken up by the time he reached it but reformed further aft abreast the main jeer bitts a wall of the enemy had formed across the deck and was pressing the seamen from artemis hard surrounded by enemy neville was in the front his blade faster than a snakes tongue kydd fell back arms exhausted and burning with fatigue but there was no retreat he slashed and parried swaying forward and back weariness blunting his skills stubbornly he called on his last store of strength furious that things had to end in this way suddenly gloriously there was the sound of wild cheering as stirk boiled up from the after hatchway in the enemys rear he whirled his blade like a lunatic and close behind him were renzi and the others in a triumphant assault the french broke then ran screaming harshly kydd flailed after them but they bolted down the hatchway and into the rigging leaving the british in possession of the deck follow me screamed neville kydd stumbled after him a huge grin at the sight of renzi alongside him they reached the quarterdeck nevilles sword slashed at the clumsy attempt the french had made to keep the tricolore hoisted high on the stump of the wrecked mizzen mast and the enemy colours tumbled down he held them aloft in his hands an ecstatic expression on his face insane cheering broke out again and again echoed from artemis kydd stopped and lowered his stained weapon in a daze it was victory a swelling pride swept over him suddenly and he looked down the long deck of the enemy ship with its piledup ruin of rigging and bodies a battlefield of blood and desperation and knew the warriors pulsing triumph around him others had come to a stop as did the french sullen and tense first one then the rest of the enemy let their pikes tomahawks and cutlasses drop to the deck a strange silence hammered at kydds ears after the furious clash of battle then the sailors began to move again at the shouts of petty officers as they directed their men to surround the prisoners renzi appeared his smokegrimed figure and apologetic halfsmile making kydd feel guilty that he had not spared time to think of his friend as he had hewn and slashed his way along the enemy decks beside him neville staggered then steadied himself against the fallen mizzen he seemed to be working under some emotional burden well done you men i im proud of you all he said huskily sheathing his sword clumsily he looked up to where the ensign of the royal navy floated free above the french on the stump of the mast his eyes did not leave the flags he seemed to sag worried kydd then noticed the deck beneath neville bright flowers of scarlet blossomed on the planking neville slid down to a sitting position looking oddly preoccupied kydd moved to his side and steadied him but neville shrugged off his support irritably ssecure the prisoners he ordered no one in particular his eyes had a glassy look no one moved they were staring at him aand cu away thi raffle he said in a pitiable version of his usual crisp delivery the eyes focused abou yyour duty mmen he ordered in a querulous tone kydd felt at his side his hand came away steeped in blood nevilles eyes turned to him puzzled then his body seemed to collapse inwards of itself and with kydd tenderly supporting neville subsided to the deck he lay still on his back but his eyes moved seeking out the ensign which they fixed and held for long moments he did not move then gently his body relaxed and stilled kydd waited but the mantle of death was unmistakable hes gone he murmured and closed the still open eyes he felt an upwelling of emotion which threatened to overwhelm him a voice spoke next to him a cool steadying voice as of this moment there is no british officer aboard said renzi kydd looked up at him grateful for the intervention but not sure what he meant we must find the enemy captain at once renzi went on of course the capitulation could not be completed until the captain had yielded his sword renzi crossed over to one of the growing numbers of disarmed french sailors the man looked dazed as he questioned him then pointed towards a knot of bodies draped around the base of the mainmast the imperatives of war meant that the corpse must be found and deprived of its sword and kydd reluctantiy approached the charnel house where men had been dragged to die movement caught his eye propped up against the mast was a hideously wounded man with his left hip and part of his back blasted away by a roundshot the man was doggedly biting and tearing at papers his eyes rolling in unspeakable pain kydd knelt down and saw gold lace beneath the clotted blood he realised that this was the captain overcome with compassion kydd reached out to stop the manic activity he was pushed aside by parry who grabbed uselessly at the paper fragments damn him he said in disgust the frenchman smiled and passed from the world the master believes we shall descry st catherines at seven bells renzi said his tone was guarded but kydd could tell he was charged with feeling they were sitting on the forehatch busy with other seamen on endless coils of shotriven rope it was not unpleasant the morning sun was warm and beneficent their progress a crawl under the jury driver an ingenious contraption of spare topmast and leather butt lashing kydd had lain sleepless in his hammock all night trying to put the nightmarish jerking scenes of death and peril from his mind time and again the piteous pale face of the youngster he had slaughtered cringed and begged kydd questioned his own humanity until his brain staggered under the weight of his doubts wallowing astern the citoyennepumped ship every hour her hull and rigging a crazy patchwork of hasty repair but above the tricolour floated artemissbattle ensign did you notice renzi said in a low voice kydd knew that his friend would now reveal what was troubling him the french captain maillot renzi said quietly kydd remembered the gory corpse the manic biting what about him the papers he was destroying yes it was his commission but all officers carry theirs on them in battle in case theyre captured parry found it amusing renzi said drily said it was a fine time to find it a worthless jacobin scrap of paper that he must destroy it but exactly i do not believe a man in his last minutes would think to commit such an act then why renzi looked away it was an act by the bravest man i know he said softly kydd sighed with exasperation why so he said renzi opened his mouth to speak but changed his mind you will forgive me but at times my philosophies lead me down strange paths he picked up his splice and continued his work damn strange if y asks me kydd snorted renzis face lifted it was troubled would you have me take the last mortal act of a gallant man and turn it to ashes or do i honour his memory and remain silent there was no doubt in kydds mind if it is a matter touching on the safety of england then y have no choice yr logic will say you are overborne by the higher yes would you be so timid were you to make the decision under stress o battle you would not the matter is not decided till the flag is down you are in the right of it dear fellow renzi stared down for a moment come he said he went to the shrouds pretending to be passing a line kydd joined him understanding that renzi needed to be away from the ears of others his commission he would not destroy it but he would if in his final agony he believed it to be some other paper one that was of vital urgency to the security of his nation i believe that in one of his other pockets we shall find this paper whatever it might be kydd stared at him we must tell this and have parry admit his contempt was misplaced i think not we find it ourselves if indeed it is there the body of captain maillot was laid out in the orlop on the mainhatch it would be given a funeral with full honours when they reached england in one or two days but meanwhile it would rest below sword and cocked hat laid carefully upon it a single lanthorn shed a soft light on the still form and on the marine sentry loosely at attention at the foot of the shroud they approached and the sentry snapped awake gerroff this the frog captain kydd asked yeah now yerve clapped peepers on im bugger off kydd sauntered up to the sentry last chance we gets yknow seein his face an that he went on the sentry didnt reply stiffening his posture renzi glanced meaningfully at kydd who tried again it was we who got to him first you knows he said there he was all gory an all we were the ones who saw him there dyin the sentry shifted slightly and said from the corner of his mouth saw yez do yer boardin that wuz a plucky do bad luck to me if it aint then lets see his face pay our respects like kydd wheedled the man looked nervous me sergeant catches me kydd eased a black bottle from inside his waistcoat he started as though noticing the sentry for the first time why theres m bad manners youve been down here looking after his nobbs with never a drop here take a rummer while we have a quick peek the sentry offered his musket to kydd to hold and took a long pull renzi quickly undid the lacing at the head of the shroud to reveal the pale face and staring eyes of maillot a sickening odour drifted up ere yer cant do that the sentry had noticed renzi move the sword and hat and continue unlacing down the length of the corpse have another pull if ye likes kydd urged renzi found nothing in the pockets if there had been an alternative paper it was not there any more he knew that if they were found any explanation would be futile it would be assumed they were robbing the corpse a hanging offence he threw a despairing glance at kydd then clamped his kerchief to his face and burrowed deeper into the dead captains inner clothing he tried to ignore the coldness of death hey stop that yer thievin sod the sentry had come to his senses and tried to pull renzi off the body kydd held him back and at that moment renzi froze his hand withdrew in it was a single sheet of closely written paper he held it to the light and kydd could see his eyes gleam set him to rights tom we have it the paper was stuffed back and the body restored to a state of proper reverence snatching back the bottle kydd hurried after renzi to the open air again secret coast signals priceless whispered renzi but how kydd grinned back at him easy lets say you overheard the french prisoners talking among emselves thought it proper to lay it before blackjack that he might find somethin interesting should he rummage the body chapter god rot their bones for an infernal set of useless lubberly roguesexploded the admiral his face reddening at the pressure of the starched collar at his neck his wife sighed in exasperation now john you well know how i disapprove of your sea language in the house the admiral held his tongue acutely aware of how very little it would take to provoke him to indulge his rage he took some satisfaction from casting loose the fastening of his high collar hoping it would be concealed under the snowy lace cravat you would bear me some sympathy mdear were you to know the very considerable vexations i endure as a consequence of his majestys unexpected decision to visit he growled he would get the sympathy he knew but not the understanding king georges sudden decision to leave the capital to witness personally the triumphant entry of the battered victor and her prie was causing untold difficulties for the port admiral of course my love it must be a grievous trial to you lady clowes had her own views on what constituted a vexation she was personally responsible for the success of the royal entertainments and if they were a failure in any way it would be held against her but if they passedoff without drama she would be forgotten she had only that odious flag lieutenant to assist her and he a simple sea officer with no appreciation of the subtleties of court etiquette try not to think about it too much dear she added absently her thoughts were more on what to do with the ambitious lady saxton the dockyard commissioners wife was married to a mere post captain but he was a baronet if these ambitions were to be contained she faced a nice dilemma ofprecedence at the court presentations i beg pardon sir the flag lieutenant appeared at the doorway damn you sir when we are my earnest apologies sir but we have had word from brigadier crossley the lieutenant broke in carefully he desires you to know that the press of people now is such that he fears for the safe progress of the kings procession he waited his eyes averted from lady clowes ah the admiral felt his choler rising once more so much for the army nothing to do but march up and down all day and now they couldnt be trusted to clear a path through the crowds i shall attend in my office within the hour tm sure theyll hold till then he said testily sir the lieutenant acknowledged and vanished john his wife had seen the signs and moved to head off the storm yes be so good as to rehearse with me why this event is so glorious at this time she said demurely its simple my dear were at war with a mad parcel of rascals who are unstoppable on land this is the first time weve been able to try their mettle at sea as equals and now weve proved they can be stopped the country has good reason to be grateful to captain powlett i believe the admiral said no more but he found he was rather looking forward to hearing about the now famous engagement at first hand kydd slipped hand over hand down the foretopgallant backstay to the deck arriving breathless something amiss i cn see quantities of people nicholas all th way frm portsmouth point along t the old castle renzi performed a neat belay on the line as he contemplated kydds excitement if there really was any civil disturbance in portsmouth they would not be proceeding calmly into harbour with their prize there is talk that the french contemplate a landing he said kydd looked at him sideways theres something happened he retorted stubbornly they had reached a point some five miles off the nab and the brisk northeasterly was making it tricky for them to gain ground towards spithead hampered as they were by their jury rig and citoyenne under tow astern sailors gathered on the foredeck to try to make sense of the tumult ashore fleets still at anchor observed adam adding that this would not be the case were there any real threat petit paused in his work and tried to make out the anonymous multitude of humanity up and down the distant shore aint never seen a crowd like it since the last age oos that then said stirk as artemis approached st helens first one then several small craft came around the headland from their press of sail they appeared to be in some degree of commotion their foreandaft canvas straining perilously in the sea breeze artemis opened the angle into the last stretch before spithead the sailing boats pressing forward fast with several larger hulks and lighters also creeping out towards them the first of the boats reached them it was a small yawl crammed with passengers who waved energetically the boat hissed past and tacked smartly about dangerously close a second arrived with figures clinging to the shrouds shouting a frantic welcome soon there were dozens of sailing craft weaving and dodging the raucous whoops from their passengers leaving no doubt why they had come well glory be petit breathed its fer us mates on the quarterdeck captain powlett emerged from the hatchway and paced slowly with a fixed expression he wore full dress uniform with sword and decorations a resplendent figure compared to his usual spartan sea rig the faroff bark of a gun broke through the hullabaloo the smoke eddying away from the bow of a naval cutter trying to break through the scrimmage it fussed its way alongside the group of seamen forward watched as an officer clambered aboard and a polite exchange followed on the quarterdeck then things moved swiftly the tow was cast off and lighters and hulks gathered about to take the prize in hand leaving the battlepitted artemis to proceed on alone under easy sail their salute to the admiral at spithead banged out regularly but they passed the great fleet at anchor without stopping they would enter the harbour itself artemis shortened to topsails for the last mile into the narrow entrance the line of passage taking her parallel with the shore a bare couple of hundred yards to starboard past the furiously cheering crowds that swarmed over every imaginable viewpoint grateful that his station in the foretop allowed him to witness these marvellous events kydd looked out on a scene that he knew would stay with him all his life a gun went off below him it startled him they had no reason to salute then a seaman pointed out the colourful standard hoisted on the dockyard signal tower is nibs he said laconically the salute banged on the full twentyone for the king of england they were now passing through the close entrance they glided past the rickety old buildings of portsmouth point close in to starboard every window full of cheering figures on the opposite side of the entrance was the darkened brick solidity of fort blockhouse and beyond it haslar naval hospital as many wounded and sick sailors that were able to had hobbled down to the waters edge and a military band thumped out hearts of oak on they sailed past the low white medieval turrets of the gun wharf then where the harbour inside widened again to portsmouth hard with its taverns and hostelries alive with crowds two menowar moored midstream had manned ship hundreds of men lined along bare masts and yards gave fullthroated cheers to the now famous frigate abruptly they were upon the long dockyard buildings there was a flurry of activity as artemis swung about into the wind and slowed her sails were brailed up and lines were relayed ashore by waiting boats and they were warped in alongside the dock aware of the official welcoming party on the quay kydd felt uneasy and selfconscious on the one hand wishing that the assembly of pomp and finery could be somewhere else and on the other seized with a thrill of expectation with her sails in a harbour stow and the running rigging secured and flemished down a special gangway was positioned from the quarterdeck to the dock it had white canvascovered rope handlines and on each supporting post there was a small royal crest into line kydd the harsh whisper from the masteratarms caught him by surprise sideboy the man snapped seeing that kydd did not react immediately he was pushed into a double line of men at the head of the gangway after the boatswains mates at the inner end of the line the captain and officers waited their tension evident on the wharf a similar line of redcoats formed facing each other with muskets rigidly at the present stand by snapped rowley the officerofthewatch the boatswains mates whipped up their silver calls to the ready there was silence throughout the ship the noises of celebration outside the dockyard gates sounded even rowdier pipe rowley rapped the calls blasted out together and kydds eyes slid to the small group who slowly mounted the gangway in the lead was king george and behind him the queen when the monarch reached the deck the piping ceased no one moved a muscle genially king george looked about him not more than a few feet from kydd he paced forward a step or two glancing around with interest then turned to his aidedecamp soon took the gloss off the sides of the frenchy showed him the way into portsmouth harbour hey hey his large rubicund face lit up indeed so sire the kindly eyes turned to kydd a voice from behind murmured thomas kydd foretopman sir the king nodded where are ye from kydds heart stopped guildford town er yr majesty he said touching his forehead automatically in a naval salute too late he realised that kings would probably expect something more in the way of a bow the broad white eyebrows rose fine place for turnips very fine an sheep too prime sheep yr surrey cross he looked at kydd somewhat bemused as if finding it hard to reconcile farming talk with the strong young sailor before him before kydds frozen brain could think of a reply his sovereign had moved on to address others but kydd was content simply to stare ahead suffused with happiness nobody at all in his acquaintance high and low had ever claimed an introduction to the king himself there was a murmuring of the most elegant politeness as powletts officers were introduced and the party moved down the main hatchway to view the scars of battle kydd heaved a sigh of relief but by this time others had mounted the gangway and the quarterdeck was getting crowded with a rustle of material a vision in light rose and cream paused in front of him the girl pouted and fingered the sturdy black anchor buttons on his jacket you lif on the schip all zer time she uttered in thick germanaccented english kydd could only nod while he thought frantically how he should address a foreign princess his brain could only come up with halfremembered stories of princesses in fairy tales she was a good head shorter than him and her clear pale eyes looked up at him through extraordinary long eyelashes her hairstyle was markedly plainer than the other womens and was not caked in powder pliss to show me your brafe schip she begged and smiled winningly she would only be about seventeen what remained of his objective mind observed reddening to the roots of his hair kydd mumbled something and pushed through the gawping crowd forward to larboard of the mainmast was a stubborn darkening of the deck planking where our first lieutenant er fell her hand flew to her mouth as she took in the implications of the stain then she turned back to him he lives yet kydd stuttered he is below at this um time he tried a bow but his body was not the willowy type and it turned out an awkward jerk her long gloved hand touched his arm as she pealed with laughter after a moment kydd joined in ah sophia there you are a tall hussar in dark green uniform gold frogging and ornate hat slipped neady between the two of them his back to kydd allow me to escort you around the boat he said offering his arm she pulled free and defiantly dropped kydd a magnificent curtsy she held it her eyes locked on his the moment passed then she laughed delightedly and took the soldiers arm she moved away throwing a single glance back at kydd who stared after them afraid to break the spell all the haaaandsl all hands on deck lay aft kydd at the foreroyals had caught a glimpse of his princess as the party went ashore she was looking up as if searching among the hundreds of cheering men the ships company had only just come down from manning the yards for a three times three for his majesty the king had paused on his way back through the lines of redcoats and turned clearly affected he bowed this way and that while the huzzahs echoed from the buildings the sailors redoubling their efforts at his unfeigned pleasure they assembled now on the main deck below the boatspace and on the gangways each side some hanging in the rigging to get a better view powlett stood forward of the wheel his face working under evident emotion kydd waited impatiently for renzi it was with the utmost pleasure that he told him of his meeting with a princess his friend stared in frank amazement and then rubbed his chin that would probably have been princess sophia of mecklenburg i believe his face held every indication of envy causing great satisfaction to kydd then renzi chuckled you should keep an eye to windward my dear fellow for after the unfortunate passing of the duke of buccleuchs eldest she is now an unattached maiden kydds smile broadened boatswains calls piped the still and the men quickly fell into silence his majesty is pleased powlett said seeming to have difficulty with the words and he has will be doing me the deepest honour in conferring on me a knighthood he paused and looked down at his spotless court shoes the ship erupted into cheers upon cheers he looked up the hard face mobile he has also been so kind as to present me with a purse in it is a golden guinea for every man his majesty commands that with this his honest tars shall drink his health in a bumper the cheers were genuine and long powletts voice strengthened in the matter of prize money he grinned knowing the interest his words were creating i have to tell you that i have been led to understand that subject to survey the frenchman will be bought into the service a wave of muttering passed among the assembly prize money was a subject for intense satisfaction not cheers and as a result and in view of our previous successes it is my intention to make a preliminary award now while your liberty tickets are being prepared there was no stopping it three cheers an a tiger fer capn powlett came a roar from the throng the hoarse cheering went on and on emotion from the battle finally released in a flood of affection for the tough captain carry on powlett said and abruptly turned on his heel and went below the golden orbs above the old dockyard gate seemed to draw the people like a magnet all of them eager to catch a sight of their famed hearts of oak beside the marine sentry were soldiers shoving back at the crowd kydd was astonished at the press of people the riot of heaving jostling humanity what ship what ship the cries were insistent an elderly seaman from another vessel answered nervously indistinct in the clamour with shouts of derision he was shouldered aside in their turn kydd and renzi were challenged artemis they replied and were instantly swept off by the adoring crowd faces on all sides babbling and shouting alive with joy and drink it seemed that their escort meant them to go no further than the admiral benbow close by the hard there was a deafening uproar inside the taproom red faces and blue smoke sweating men and flashingeyed femininity along with the sickly sweet smell of beer and wet sawdust artemis the shout was relayed around the room and without delay a barmaid arrived to press tankards of foaming dark beer on the pair to the sons o neptune oo are old englands right true glory a generous roar followed and tankards tilted kydd flushed with pleasure and raised his own renzi noticed a calculating gleam in several female faces like birds of prey they detached from their perches and sidled across the two sailors found themselves with a brace apiece one on each arm renzi skilfully disengaged but kydd did not seem to be in any hurry to part gave em a right quiltin did yer not darlin one said her face flushed and hair peeping out from under her mob cap she looked up at kydds face and said huskily wager you didnt hang back me lovely when the call ter duty went out the other fingered his jacket defying the venomous looks of the first she said why doesnt you an me take a short cruise i cn show yez a time asll keep yer warm for a year the first raised her leg gently and caressed kydds thigh he coloured and pretended to enjoy his beer while she teased him towards her the tugofwar continued until a thinfaced man in drab shore clothes appeared and plucked at kydds sleeves ben watkins mizzen topsailman o the duchess as was he said against the din heard tell it was a nearrun thing mates the pulling and tugging subsided a little yes said kydd shortly but with a smile know somethin about it me bein aboard when we took the the majeste that time watkins said kydd looked at him the mans voice lowered see mates has ter bear up for poverty bay like see and i needs an outfit afore i ships out agen and kydd felt inside his waistcoat and came out with a crown piece renzi grabbed his hand but kydd pressed it on the man he looked at renzi i know he said but im feelin flush renzi realised that kydd knew the man to be a fraud there was no such thing as a mizzen topsailman and he had never heard of a duchess or of a majeste it was kydds simple generosity and renzi felt mean lets cruise shipmate he said and disengaged kydd from the harpies embraces they shouldered through the noisy crush seeing petit being borne in laughing and shouting outside they paused in the bright sunlight the water was alive with small craft and a light frigate was making her way slowly past in the summer breeze outward bound the street was a kaleidoscope of colour as a pressed man in the old battleship duke william kydd had never before had the opportunity to enjoy shoreside pleasures and he looked keenly about him the hucksters gentlemen and their ladies sailors ashore and the vivid splash of red of an officer of a foot regiment a cart trundled past piled high with barrels the sweat of the two horses was sharp in his nostrils there was something about the purity of the sea air on a long voyage that made the scents of the shore so much more pungent without a word they turned to the left away from the dockyard and made their way down the street sailors were shouting to each other and rolling down the way in fine style impecunious lieutenants heading for the dockyard from their cheap lodgings in southsea crossed to the other side to avoid confrontation but most passersby grinned conspiratorially at their antics at the first corner kydd and renzi headed down the maze of smaller lanes to wander among the shops and hostelries the aroma of mutton and onions hit them my dear fellow began renzi but kydd with a quick grin was already on his way into the chop house they slid into place in a highbacked alcove and loudly demanded service a brace of yr shilling mutton pies an not so damn near with yr trimmings kydd began with pork chops on the side if you please agreed renzi an onions all over with a jug o yr best stingo to be sure and if your vittles isnt of the first quality then we shall tack about and make another board an hour later replete they eased out into the street again the day was cheerful in every particular the noises in the thoroughfare busy and jolly and the two friends wandered along mellow and happy a tattoo parlour attracted kydd who suggested that a bright blue anchor on the back of each hand might be the very thing leave it till later renzi advised quickly and pulled him across to an agreeably decorated bow window where sailors knickknacks were on display the corpulent shopman sized them up artemis if my eyes do not deceive he burbled fussing at his stock just the wery thing for a gentleman mariner he declared sweeping forward a deep blue seamans jacket it was ornately finished in white piping and boasted a splendid superfluity of white buttons yes then you will without doubt need a waistcoat of the true sort and ere i ave the harticle in question i see you have already noticed the genuine pearl buttons and extra fine stitching a short time later the pair emerged from the shop in fine attire complete with the latest style of round hat with a dashing curled brim wiggling his toes in his smart longquartered shoes kydd laughed with the sheer delight of being rigged out like a trueborn son of the sea their steps took them past the anachronistic yet charming white stone walls and turrets of the gun wharf they turned right towards broad street kydds rolling walk just a little exaggerated in old portsmouth a sailor was a natural denizen among the crazy rickety buildings of the narrow spit of portsmouth point at the lowering ramparts of king henrys fortifications they turned right past the sally port where boat crews came and went from the great fleet at anchor at spithead the massive dark stone arch they passed was the last part of england that would be seen by the wretches condemned to transportation to botany bay kydd shuddered the last time he had seen these old stones was from seaward as a newpressed landman on the foredeck of a lineofbattie ship in the narrowing confines it seemed as if the whole sea world had converged on the place there were seamen in every rig imaginable and from every maritime nation all brought together by the need to know something other than their harsh sea life avast there yer scrovy swabs stirks familiar bellow broke in on kydds musings he came striding across his face creasing in delight behind him was doggo who pointedly lifted a bottle stirk stopped and looked askance at kydd well bugger me days flash as a rat with a gold tooth he said still grinning he nodded politely to renzi who had chosen more plainly we gotta blow out our gaff then shall we lay course to board the lamb n flag me hearties the four passed along the street companionably with the old houses and taverns pressing in on both sides to the end of the spit there a shingle beach offered a view into the harbour with artemis alongside at the dockyard kydd caught the powerful odour of seaweed wet ropes and tar but he hadnt long to reflect as they swung through the dark oak doors of the tavern hey now toby stirk warp yerself alongside mate the roar came from a knot of men at a table to the left a vast redfaced seaman laughed and beckoned them over yair well stirk strode across and took the mans hand and pumped it for a long time remembering himself he gestured at kydd and renzi s me shipmates ralf in artemis frigate we is see kydd had never seen stirk so touched and wondered what poignant tale was behind it the saloon was dusky but comfortable in the light of the candlesticks kydds gaze took in the exotic mix of characters from half a hundred menowar dusty artefacts from the seven seas adorned the walls wicked lances from the south seas faded coconut monkeys from the coast of africa and the mysterious gold on red lettering of the orient the beer was good very good kydd decided and he sank another he was happy to let the wizened sailmaker opposite make the running in the conversation out of the corner of his eye he noticed renzi puffing contentedly on his clay pipe also allowing the talk to flow over him stirk leant back sportsmans hall in business he asked millers is all he was told thatll do mates the group moved to the brightly lit back room where snarling terriers restrained by thick leather straps bayed loudly when the rat cages were brought in the hubbub rose to a crescendo as bets were laid stirk and doggo to the fore kydd held back he had no real taste for the sport with his head aswim with ale he watched the terriers furiously flailing about biting and worrying at the darting black rats renzi caught kydds eye his slow regular puffing adding to the blue haze in the room shall we withdraw do you think outside the fresh air discommoded kydd the excitement of the day had its inevitable effect and he staggered over to the low seawall and heaved on to the rocks below renzi stood back until it was all over as kydd recovered he went into the tavern and reappeared with a pan of water kydd accepted it gratefully dusting off his new rig which had miraculously escaped being soiled he stretched then looked at renzi for no logical reason he felt resentment not at renzi but at the world at things it grew and burned and gradually took focus i need a woman he said thickly glaring into space renzis expression did not change do you not feel a slatterns lues a hard price for the joy of the moment kydds feelings erupted dye think to preach at me i do as i will looking at him dispassionately renzi knew there was no dissuading him kydd would have his way and some raddled trull would know his youth and innocence and pray what shall i tell princess sophia as soon as it was uttered renzi regretted the unworthy spite that made him say it but it was too late kydd turned abruptly and disappeared into the crowds renzi stood still and watched him go the coolness of his logic was slipping he needed to rationalise recent events to process them into tidy portions fit for inspection by a rational mind he needed to get away he trudged north away from town with no clear purpose in mind before reaching landport gate the landward entrance to portsmouth he heard the grinding of an oxcart behind it was a farm worker in embroidered smock and shapeless hat driving two hand of oxen returning after delivering his produce renzi stopped him id be obliged were you to offer me passage oi has no truck wi deserters tha knows the man said doubtfully do i sound like one my friend renzi said offering silver the man bit the halfcrown piece and grinned widely patting the bench beside him at the landport arch they were stopped by a sentry renzi pulled out his ticketofleave and waved it at the soldier the sergeant ambled over and took a look ah this ere is a jack tar orf the artemis lad come t raise the dust after their orrible great battle it was pleasant in the hot afternoon sun the farmhand was not given to idle chat but had a steady grin of amusement on his homely face they left portsea island and approached the foothills joining the highway to petersfield for a short while before taking the steep southwick road to the summit of portsdown hill bidding the man a courteous farewell renzi alighted there and stretched out on the chalky grass it was a superb view high above the coastal plain looking out over the town and dockyard for miles the sunlit sea stretched out the fleet at spithead dark models against the sparkling flat sea he plucked idly at the grass and let his thoughts run free he had been taken by surprise at the ferocity of his feelings as they boarded citoyenne equally as blood mad as any of his shipmates the hopeless bravery of the french captain had impressed him greatly and he had been touched to hear that powlett had taken steps to remit a competence to his widow in recognition of this the value of the coast signals lay in the secret of their recovery and the world would never know of maillots gallant failure now he also realised that for all his carefully erected barriers there was a personal vulnerability an unguarded breach for which his own weakness was to blame kydd and he had endured and laughed together too many times for the friendship to be cast aside and therefore he had to face the fact that through kydd he was vulnerable the thought of kydds clumsy attempts at a woman made him wince as much at the memory of his own past concupiscence and wilfulness as anything for in his own case there had been no excuse the sun beat down and he lay back letting the tension seep from his bones he tipped his hat over his eyes an occasional insect buzz reached him over the gentle sough of the breeze he lay there drowsy and tranquil faint shouts wafted up on the lateafternoon breeze difficult to decipher behind closed eyes he tried to make sense of them then he heard the vexatious whinny of a horse and the unmistakable gritty progress of carriage wheels renzi sat up bursting into view came a coach the horses snorting and nodding after the long haul up but this was no ordinary conveyance it was fitted out for a cruise by a crew of enterprising sailors with a flag hoisted at the main a cargo of a stout keg aft and the innsign of the lamb and flag forward for a figurehead she was manned by a cheering drunken crew of seamen from artemis bent on a roaratorious frolic the coach pulled up and painted doxies fanned out decorously to sink relieved to the grass renzi stood up in amazement the keg was tapped again and again and pots waved assertively in the air as bets were laid on the race down the long hill and back into town the browbeaten driver nervously checked the traces why damn me eyes if it aint gennelman jack hisself a quartermasters mate of renzis slight acquaintance pointed at him in astonishment others joined to peer in his direction renzi gave a diffident wave and approached then from the other side buttoning the flap on his trousers came kydd he stopped dead for a moment renzi stood nonplussed then clapping his new hat over his breast he loudly declaimed while up the shrouds the sailor goes or ventures to the yard the landman who no better knows believes his lot is hard but jack with smiles each danger meets and drinks his can of grog inwardly flinching at the populist doggerel he was nevertheless met with a storm of cheers welcome aboard th barky shipmate a dusty wellused tankard was thrust at him and he joined the riotous crew winking at kydd as he passed to climb inside the coach jerked off down the road drunken sailors aloft and alow whoay mateys said one left astern as he scrambled to reach his post aft on the postillions seat the coach rattled and shook in a cloud of dust as it plunged madly down the road a fiddler scraping a jig alongside the terrified driver renzi smiled at the apprehensive women opposite dust streaked over their caked rouge their mob caps askew your acquaintance ladies he bowed their eyes flashed white as they strove to make sense of it all the rattling coach now violently swaying the most worldly wise looked at him in suspicion his manner so utterly at odds with the open hilarity of the sailors outside eventually she appeared to make up her mind and lifting her chin stared out determinedly cheers and whoops came from outside as they plunged past a startled populace and an upsidedown face suddenly popped into frame at the window me pot jack it said not understanding renzi hesitated the lady seized a tankard from the apparition and fumbled under the seat for a bottle which she skilfully upended with only the minimum of slop she handed it up and glared at renzi these ere sailor boys y all ut stands tween us an the frogs matey youd begrudge em their spree hesitant smiles appeared on other faces jack tar ashore was popular in this part of the world indeed no madam he said sincerely he glanced out again and saw the town ramparts flash past sentries scattering past houses and cheering taverns they flew the sailors above kicked up a deafening hullabaloo as they neared their goal the coach careering dangerously around every corner an excited roar arose the wheels juddered under locked brakes and they teetered to a stop horses atremble and the driver with his head in his hands the crew piled out arguing loudly but without a timepiece between them judgement as to records was academic the keg was unlashed and the driver mollified with silver rare time said renzi lightly to kydd who had jumped from the roof of the vehicle kydd brushed himself down delaying a response renzi saw that his eyes were bloodshot and he moved carefully yes kydd said neutrally should you desire a roborant it would be my pleasure to find you one renzi said thank ye that will not be necessary kydd replied he made no move to walk away and when renzi began to walk across the common kydd fell into step next to him mrs jordan is in town i understand renzi tried there was no response then renzi saw that it held no particular meaning for kydd she is playing maltravers in the fair dealer of york apparently he continued kydd grunted but renzi detected a thaw of mood at thorntons he added on gosport side a quick glance and he continued it could prove a most satisfactory ending to the day were we to experience her talents at the first hand he said kydd cleared his throat is she accounted good the very first of the age their pennies were refused by the boatman who stretched at his oars with a will golden lights sparkled over the harbour and along the lines of ships at spithead occasional bursts of fireworks exploded the shore still seething with excited crowds crossing to gosport the slop and hurry of waves against the wherry sides was hypnotic and kydd felt a lifting of spirit he would never tell renzi however that his gibe about the princess had struck hard and true he had felt the sweet pain of frustration but he had not surrendered his will to a whore the theatre was packed and restless the heat of the chandeliers and burning lime nearly suffocating they were not the only sailors in the audience most in the gallery with them were from artemis and another frigate happily chaffing while waiting for the curtain a thin orchestra in the pit struck up the stridulations of the strings setting renzis teeth on edge then one by one the chandeliers were lowered and snuffed the audience stirred expectantly the curtain swept aside to reveal an impossibly baroque drawing room white in the glare of the lime light patrons quelled the rowdier elements of the audience and a quiet spread out the silence lengthened vague scuffles sounded offstage and eventually a dishevelled reprobate figure shot on to stand swaying resentfully before the crowd he staggered over to the highbacked chair and collapsed in it to the vast delight of the sailors hastily a flourish from the orchestra cut across the jeers and laughter and on to the stage swept a voluptuous mannish figure clad in silk breeches with an exaggerated wig and fashionable cane the figure acknowledged the storm of applause with dignified bows when the noise had died away the figure advanced to the front of the stage absolute silence prithee sir art anguished at maltravers summons was demanded of the recumbent form the voice was female husky and powerful the form continued to stare art thou not the imperious tone had a venomous edge there was no response suggestive catcalls broke the silence sir the voice continued silkily i see thou art in liquor the cane flashed out and caught the form in the midriff doubling him over but stay this do i well comprehend the shouting died away with dramatic intensity maltravers strode to the edge of the stage what man a drop of english blood in his veins can stand unmoved at the news the thrice welcomd news that the dastardly french have been bested at sea by artemis frigate in a duel at arms at which there could be but one victor blessd albion it was the rest of the extempore speech was drowned in an avalanche of cheering wild unashamed exultation bowing left and right maltravers held up his hands for silence come cheer up me lads tis to glory we steer the whole theatre stood and broke into the garrick favourite feverishly accompanied by the orchestra kydds face flushed as he sang along with insatiable pride the play moved on in a wordy stream renzi looked to see its effect on kydd to his amused dismay he saw that his friend was no longer concerning himself he was slumped in his seat fast asleep chapter next day the men moved slowly and stoically stripping artemis of her guns and stores preparatory to her docking her grievous wounds were laid bare and her injured spars sent down to a dismayed clucking from boatswain merrydew noon came but few could stomach the cold rations supplied by the receiving hulk lashed alongside after an allnightin kydd was feeling better and when the day was done and liberty was piped again he felt ready to step ashore with the larbowlines once more he sat quietiy as renzi plaited his glossy pigtail he had cleaned his new rig carefully for who knew what adventures lay ashore and with prize money still to spend they would take their pick of the pleasures of the land hoay tom the hail from the hatchway was doud looking for him what cheer mate kydd called back doud had an expression of marked curiosity officer o the day passes the word for tom kydd he paused for effect its a visitor at the brow askin after you my frien a lady visitor a rumble of ribald interest from around kydd made him ask should y call her might we say taut rigged as saucy and trim a barky as ever graced the seas an a fine figurehead with it doud acknowledged this did not at all sound like a common drab should one be bold enough to seek him out spread more sail mate an yerll soon board her in rollicking style urged petit with a huge grin hurriedly checking his rig kydd leapt up the hatchway ladder closely followed by half the mess deck striding up to the masters mate he demanded where away mr shipton with a grin the man indicated a dark young lady standing diminutive and lonely on the dockside it took a few moments for it had been another place another lifetime but he recognised his only sister cecilia impetuously he clattered down the gangway to the stones of the dock and crushed her to him oh thomas my dear my very dear she wept and clung to him her femininity utterly disarming she pushed him away and dabbed at her eyes thomas look at you i would never you are a man kydd blushed and she giggled at his discomfiture but did not let go his arms her eyes flashed in that familiar way she swung him round to face the ship again her arm through his do you introduce me to your ship thomas in earlier years this imperious behaviour would have resulted in an instant squabble but now kydd could think of no easy rejoinder he looked up and saw the line of men at the deck edge gazing down slowly they mounted the gangway her arm primly on his her manner decidedly possessive the men looked on with interest they reached the bulwarks the men fell back into a semicircle and she accepted his awkward assistance to the deck with a dainty thank you thomas the sight of his shipmates seahardened and battleproved to a man so transparently agog was too much for kydd a smile pulled at his mouth now please behave yrself sis he whispered renzi stood back impassive kydd took off his hat and held it across his chest gentlemen i have th honour to introduce miss cecilia kydd my worthy an only sister a sigh went through the group renzi performed an elegant leg but in the main hats flew off and there was a gawky shuffling from men quite unused to ladies of cecilias evident quality kydd watched his sisters gratification in amusement she was perhaps too strongfeatured on her smaller frame but her dark looks were appealing in their directness and she was undeniably handsome she curtsied to renzi and gave him a dazzling smile she nodded to the others instinctively giving best to petit who fawned on her ridiculously kydd had the sense to move her forward to shipton who exchanged bows and polite courtesies of course it was in order for kydd to show her the ship a veiled reference to the cockpit was a warning that the midshipmen would perhaps be entertaining women of quite another sort and the boatswain would by now be indisposed there was little to see in a frigate stripped of most of her guns and fitments but enough remained to give an idea of life aboard accompanied by the enraptured men kydd escorted cecilia forward that theres where we keep the boats he said pointing to the skid beams straddling the open space of the spar deck amidships where th seaboat is kept ift please yer miss petit added an the longboat in course adam said eagerly when it aint a launch growled stirk who had heard of the visitation and had hurried up on deck how interesting cecilia murmured gazing blankly at the empty space they moved on to the forward end of the boatspace what a dear little bell she exclaimed catching sight of the ships bell in its ornate belfry its how we tells the time said gully eagerly cecilia looked closely but could find no sign of clock hands or any such the men crowded around like we strikes it every glass see so we always knows when ter go on watch explained stirk his tone a peculiar mix of tender attention and awkwardness cecilia replied faintly that she was sure but felt that the glass might suffer overmuch in the striking ah our gun captain tobias stirk kydd said trying to regain centre stage he led the way down the forehatch resolutely keeping the men clear while she felt her way down to the main deck at the sight of the remaining twelvepounders cecilia paused the heat of battle had boiled away the gun blacking to a patchy metallic graininess and they looked what they were lethal engines of war that had so recently taken an enemy warship and the life of her captain scars of the desperate conflict were easy to find long splintered furrows in the pristine clean deck daylight through smashedin side timbers and suggestive dark stains in more than one spot an insistent rank odour of stale gunsmoke still pervaded the air along with the vinegarsulphur mixture used to remove dried body parts and tom pray where she tailed off her hand over her mouth eyes opened wide kydd showed her not speaking she looked around wildly the alien grimness of the scene visibly crowding in thomas i i if you please might we concerned kydd led her up to the open air again another colourful sunset promised and he remembered renzis plans for a splendid meal he addressed the adoring throng avast there y codeyed lubbers we have business ashore now beckoning to renzi he announced we dine as planned nicholas and with company cecilia hesitated then whispered up at him kydd smiled we shall make a rendezvous for eight but it seems my little sister wishes time with me first he turned and they went ashore arm in arm her lodgings were a tiny room in southsea she put down her hat and began to comb her hair before the hinged mirror kydd watched the familiar ritual fondly the brush going switswit in regular strokes to her waist he caught her eyes in the mirror and smiled quickly she averted hers and stared woodenly ahead the brush continuing its monotonous rhythm taken aback kydd wondered what he had said then he saw her eyes glisten stubbornly she stared into the mirror the brush smoothing her hair in long strokes and then the tears came he held her as emotion shook her small frame frightening him with its sudden onset it wasnt so bad cec he mouthed softly it was over in an hour or two i swear she didnt answer and he held her away from him searching her face its not that is it he said a cold dread beginning its mother isnt it no she choked papa he said no tom all are well she said her voice muffled she dried her eyes and turned on the stool to face him i am a silly billy she croaked please forgive me thomas she tried a smile and kydd laughed quietly the twins have breeched you know she said in a stronger voice and mrs mulder is to wed again in the autumn she hesitated its only been half a year does it seem long to you thomas kydd thought of the incredible events and changes that he had endured er yes i suppose it does she surveyed him at length it was nothing short of magical the change in him the pale earnest perruquier had metamorphosed into this strong oakenvisaged sailor with the ready smile and lean body fitting his colourful seamans dress as though born to it we didnt get your letter until march she said omitting the details about the frantic worry that had preceded it and that short one came in may kydd remembered the scrap of letter he had dashed off to his mother at sea in a battleship forty miles off the french coast on the day before he was due to go ashore with the doomed landing party apparently another two letters were still on their way but at least they had had word of his transfer we didnt understand the bit about a frigate but lady onslow was so sweet about it she said sir richard was himself at sea at that very time rear admiral of the white so they would have known about his transfer to artemis and therefore would have been horrified when news of her dreadful battle had become known cecilia flopped on to the bed like the child she so recently had been and looked up at him with shining eyes tell me whats it like to be a sailor really tom no gammon kydd felt a wave of affection break over him her childish glee touching his heart he told her of the sea his lofty world of perils and adventure skill and honour the first sight of a seatossed dawn the deep experience of feeling a deck heave a comber bursting against the bow in a sheet of rainbow spray he spoke of his friends his shipmates and their rough simple gendeness she listened speechless carried by his words but never gulled into underestimation by their simplicity oh tom who would have thought it kydd had never experienced heroworship from his sister and reddened when i spoke with the king he remembered guildford cec the king she squealed never you never did and with a beautiful princess a real one mind you her speechless admiration made him feel a poltroon guiltily he glanced around what oclock is it sis we mustnt be adrift for nicholas the dancing light faded from her eyes she looked away her body sagging kydd felt the cold dread returning what is it cec he said softly oh tom i i feel so dreadful he put his arms around her shoulder tell me she looked deeply into his eyes as if to spare him what she could its father she said carefully his eyes are failing he sat back confused brokenly she murmured tom how can you her hands twisted together when i looked up at that great big ship and saw you there my heart nearly broke you looked so right as a sailor so handsome my big brother her eyes filled and now we are asking you to give it all up tom he is making mistakes the customers are complaining if the shop fails they were asking him to return home to resume his place behind the counter of the old shop talking wigs with customers he gulped and looked sightlessly out into the night and past the celebrations his sister gripped his hands in hers until it hurt renzi and he would part he would no longer know his dear friend who would go on to better things in another world tom it was not her fault it must have taken real courage to make the journey alone to this notorious naval town but only now was she understanding the true cost of her appeal he got heavily to his feet and balled his fists in silent agony there was no decision to make without him the family would slide into destitution the debtors prison and worse this war tom its ruinous for the business everyone is asking for bob wigs only and some are even refusing to wear any its a new fashion kydd remembered his fathers endless but nearsighted primping and sewing of horsehair at the carcass of fullbottomed wigs and his retort died before it was uttered he took a deep breath i have prize money he said but cecilia cut him off quickly tom its not just for now she said firmly you must face it we need you to provide for us in the future we need you tom yes he muttered yes i know know i know i know damn you he choked out in his pain she said nothing and waited he looked up miserably well go to nicholas now the darkness outside was split with bonfires fireworks and excited people hurrying this way and that with blazing link torches candles in coloured glass and all manner of festive flame they trudged silently along the seafront the dark offshore shapes of the fleet had needlepoints of light on deck which kydd knew were lanthorns strung over the focsle and quarterdeck a regular deep thump of minute guns from somewhere out there struck him viscerally kydd didnt notice the gang of rowdies until they had surrounded them both he stopped cecilia gripping his arm apprehensively dursnt show a light then one swaggered up to him demanding he show illuminations in patriotic celebration they closed in menacingly tip im a stoter jem n then capsize im in th sea dont you dare you ruffians shouted cecilia hes from artemis and hes been in a terrible battle you scoundrels they fell back under her anger and changing tack began shouting artemisan artemis hoisting kydd up they carried him shoulder high cheering and whooping not noticing the anguish in his face renzi waited outside the queen concerned at kydds lateness when he saw the two come into sight he hailed briskly kydd did not respond at first then he said quietly nicholas come walk with me a spell i have some news chapter kydd slumped back in the coach as it bucketed northward along the london road next to him cecilia held a small book as though reading wise enough to leave him to his thoughts the initial sharp pain had dulled he knew that renzi with his fine logic and learning would have a philosophy to suit but in the last few minutes they had spent together dividing the contents of the seachest they shared it did not seem to be the thing to talk about it had seemed so casual the farewell so matteroffact they had stood in the tween decks there had been a reluctant shaking of hands a banal comment or two and then he had turned his back on the only true deep friend he had ever had there would be no problem about his departure a famous frigate captain like black jack powlett would find a score of volunteers eager to step into his place he had left without delay unable to face the leavetaking letting renzi tell the others he hoped he would be missed as much as he missed them the lump in his throat tightened they drew into guildford in light drizzle as he stared moodily from the coach window he saw that the country town had not changed in his absence beyond an imagined wartime unkemptness they clattered into the old timbered passage of the angel posting house and finally came to a halt he handed cecilia down ignoring the gaping ostler who had never seen a proper sailor before he knew the way of course up the high street and under the great clock to the family shop with his seabag comfortably over his shoulder and cecilias luggage under his arm he swung into the accustomed gloom of the shop the smell of musty horsehair and pomatum took him back but the room seemed smaller than he remembered there was a scream of delight as his mother appeared she clung to him as though he would vanish again before her eyes his father stood at the door but held back welcome home son his mother said tearfully her eyes running over his lean figure get your sailor costume off dear and ill have such a dish ready for you as will warm the cockles her hands went to his jacket working at the buttons something in cecilias manner communicated itself to her and the fussing turned to flustered prattle his father remained still staring at him kydd took a deep breath and strode over to him i hope i find ye well father he said a smile broke the deep lines of his fathers face and his hand came out hesitantly kydds generous nature surged to the fore it was not the mans fault that mortal weakness was laying its hands on him the room burst into excited babble kydd was back in the bosom of his family and they all wanted to hear of his awful adventures once again the rightful inhabitant of the tiny room above the shop he peeled off his seamans rig for the last time he laid it down tenderly smoothing the folds then pulled on his knee breeches and snuffcoloured ruffled waistcoat it felt flimsy constricting after his stout sailors wear he felt contempt hatred for it building there was a tiny knock at the door cecilia stood there small and vulnerable struggling she spoke in an unnatural voice tom thank you wrestling his thoughts he crossed to her and hugged her tight need t get used to it again is all he mumbled the days passed with leaden steps one by one reminders of his sea life faded into the past the softness of his bed had been suffocating and he slept on the floor for the first few nights his mother had quietly got rid of his seamans knife which had been at his side every waking moment before and his wooden ditty box containing his personal treasures was replaced by a sensible porcelain dish his pigtail did not last either cecilia chopped and scissored at its gleaming length and it fell forlornly to the floor as a perruquier it just would not do not to wear a wig himself what was left of the prize money was gratefully accepted but by unspoken consent after that first night his time at sea was never again mentioned kydd took to walking alone it was possible to make the journey from pewley downs to shere along the crest of the north downs and in the summer warmth it was a bright and pretty sight his thoughts were free to roam wherever he wanted the north downs had a dual view with a certain meaning for kydd on one hand to the northeast there was the flat plain that led to london its presence betrayed by a distant pall of duncoloured smoke the fleet anchorage of the nore where as a pressed man he had spent his first days in the navy was not so very far beyond over in the other direction was the road south to the many seaports of the coast where as many as two hundred sail at a time could be seen from the white cliffs unlike any of the others he met on his walks he knew full well what lay beyond the grey waves breaking ashore in the shop business was not good cecilia had been right the fashion sweeping in from revolutionary europe for unrestrained hair had a strong hold now and the future for wigmaking looked bleak there was still a small but reliable demand from physicians the richer merchants and the like but the kydds had to compete against a larger establishment in godalming that could deliver faster kydds days were now circumscribed by long hours in the workshop punctuated by periods of souldestroying inactivity behind the counter waiting for custom the days turned to weeks and he felt his soul shrivel after listlessly serving ribbons to the voluble mrs coombs he looked up from the counter at the person who had just entered dusty and travelworn carrying a ragged bag and in a worn blue sailors jacket it was renzi he held out his hand kydd couldnt respond at first it was like seeing a ghost he was caught utterly offbalance wwell met sir he stuttered not knowing how to deal with a man he knew to be wellborn but in quite different circumstances his particular friend renzi reached out took kydds hand and shook it warmly he was shocked at the changes he saw the slow responses the downcast look it was also a grievously sad travesty seeing kydds broad shoulders and lithe foretopmans body draped in wig and breeches and the tight faded brocade waistcoat were i to beg shelter for the night i fear i would sadly inconvenience he said and watched anguish chase delight on his friends features nicholas but o course but i have a story to tell but it must wait if you would be so good as to conduct me to a tailors i will do my best not to shame you to your family and then we will dine renzi became another being in long clothes in anonymous black a severe and unadorned black his natural patrician authority readily asserted itself other clients in the saloon respectfully made way for them both and they sat down to a dish of salmagundi youll be stayin long in town kydd asked fearful of the reply no plans at the moment my friend then you shall stay at home my room is yours a bed could be made on the floor of the shop for himself the cured fish went down rapidly as did the jug of porter you wonder at my visitation renzi said finally kydd smiled so he went on artemis is still in dock we are sent away on leave he said playing with a fork i thought it proper to visit my family i posted to the village and walked to the estate renzi seemed to have some difficulty with the tale kydd recalled that after a particularly harsh act of enclosure by renzis father a tenant farmers son had committed suicide out of the highest sensibility and purest logic renzi had taken this personally as a moral crime by his family and in expiation had sentenced himself to five years exile at sea an extraordinary act of selfdenial renzi leaned back with a twisted smile at the boundary of the last field i remembered saw again the body hanging in the barn he looked intensely at his fork i could not go on i tried but could not his voice was thick the first time kydd had heard it so overborne by emotion the nights i slept under a hedge it was nonsensical and so here i am his eyes glimmered he signalled to the potboy well met indeed it is he smiled and saw kydds fumbling in the article of prize money he said gently except for a slight indulgence in poetry i have not had the opportunity to get rid of it before now allow me to the claret was passable and under its influence renzi heard kydds story his heart went out to his friend for there was little that he could do himself cut off from his own family and wealth it needed a longterm solution but in the time before he must repair back aboard his ship there was little chance that one would be found kydds mother was surprised at her sons general rally and therefore looked at his visitor with some interest cecilias hand flew to her mouth when she recognised him renzis impeccable manners and kind attentions quickly charmed the house and he was warmly welcomed on occasion renzi caught some thoughtful looks from kydds father but on the whole it was accounted that kydds guest was a fine friend to the family cecilia was beside herself with curiosity but was always courteously deflected to her considerable chagrin renzi however sensed kydds desperation the strong likelihood was that when they parted the next cruise could span years and by then he forced down the thought and bent to the task of making the days as agreeable as he could for his friend do you wait for me a moment dear fellow renzi said outside the bookshop at the top of the high street sated with depressing news from the antijacobin review he longed for a new volume from the young iconoclast wordsworth kydd entered too and watched as renzi took down volume after volume in their fine tooled leather bindings an odd clunking sound intruded from behind but it was only a shopman approaching he had a wooden leg kydd did not know him he must be a new assistant cn i help ye the man said his voice was strong in fact it was hard and had a strength kydd recognised instantly do i fin myself addressing a gentleman o the sea the man stopped and stared suspiciously are ye lookin for somethin special he said im sorry i thought then y thought right so a corpulent worriedlooking man bustled up and said loudly is there any problem are the gennelmen being attended to mr er whatsyrname they left without the book outside the summer afternoon bustle of the high street eddied around renzi as he and kydd walked back the few steps to the wig shop its crabbed windows and general seediness clutched at renzis heart kydd clapped him on the shoulder and disappeared inside leaving renzi alone renzi could feel a grey depression settling he could not interfere it was kydds decision a good and noble decision for the sake of his family but it did not alter the fact that the price was ruinous it was costing kydd his spirit and therefore his soul in twenty years he would be an old man renzi sighed heavily a careless grocer carrying a basket of greens on his head cannoned into him interrupting his train of thought he shot the man a glance of such venom that he recoiled in fright and dropped his load reason was not enough in this situation soon kydd and he would part he himself would be back at sea in his selfimposed exile but without his friend a true and understanding companion in a perilous and exciting following he passed by the open door of the red lion at the top of the high street the dark interior was warm odoriferous and in a convivial hubbub on impulse he entered and found an empty highbacked cubicle perhaps he could loosen his mind with ale and think of something he could do for kydd before he left the potboy arrived looking curiously at his featureless black long clothes it was seldom that the quality patronised this pothouse renzi ordered a friary ale the local dark bitter brewed here since the middle ages he sipped slowly staring into space as once more he went over the available alternatives they were pitifully few his own means were slender returning to his family to claim his own was out of the question and his recent acquaintances did not in any wise include men of substance but this was not a matter of a few guineas loan this was an entire familys future reluctantly he conceded that kydds act was the only one that had any practical consequence for his family and it was probably kinder to take his leave quietly and for ever knowing that their lives had now irrevocably diverged renzi became aware that someone was standing next to him he looked up at first he could not place the man then remembered the assistant with the wooden leg in the bookshop the mans hard face rearranged itself into an ingratiating smile his worn but serviceable tricorne hat was in his hands i begs yer pardon sir he said kydd had been right renzi thought this was a seaman by his bearing probably a petty officer a quartergunner quartermasters mate or any one of the band of men rightly termed the backbone of the navy perrott jabez perrott ifn yer pleases if i cn have a few words like renzi felt a surge of irritation he had no coins to spare kydd would get all he had when he left he did not invite the man to sit and stared back perrott stood resolute and pressed on yer in the sea service it was a bald statement and surprised renzi he knew he did not have the borntoit strength and character of a seaman that kydd so obviously had but for some reason he motioned perrott to sit opposite what can i do for you the mans hat appeared on the table the strong hands twisting it an unaccountably poignant sight for renzi what encounter far out at sea had ended for him with his leg under the surgeons blade screaming pain and a severed limb tossed bloodily into the tub if yer could see yer way clear sir perrott was clearly unused to pleading renzi waited like if yez has need of a seacook sir aboard yer barky well im asayin as how im yer man perrott evidently thought he was an officer a captain irony twisted at renzis lips or mebbe cooks mate even perrott added seeing the expression an get an actin warrant like it was certainly the practice to employ maimed seamen as cooks but this required an admiralty warrant of appointment no captain certainly no officer could simply take on a man without this necessary document you mistake me i am no naval officer renzi said his pained amusement not shared by perrott since swallerin the anchor sir its been hard cruel hard had t bear up fer poverty bay like renzi could only guess the difficulties to be faced by a proud selfsufficient seaman cast ashore in a cold and indifferent world the man was either too proud or without the interest to secure a place at greenwich hospital the home for crippled seamen without family i say again i am not a naval officer and even if i were without an admiralty warrant you may never ship aboard as seacook renzi told him perrott allowed a glimmer of a smile to surface at renzis unwitting use of navy terms aye sir if you sez youse aint a naval officer he allowed a moments pause and continued but if yer could have a word with the pusser an tell im that id divvy on th slush perrott was clutching at straws if he imagined that a promise to the purser to share in his perquisites as cook would get him a berth what are you doing in guildford renzi asked the quiet rural town was far from the sea in deep farming country memries said perrott immediately his face blank renzi felt a pang of sympathy perrott obviously meant memories of the sea and ships where he had been a prime seaman a whole man with pride and confidence not a hobbling cripple with a bleak future dependent on charity there would be no reminders in guildford despising himself renzi got to his feet to bring the conversation to an end perrott rose also his wooden limb clattering against the bench cn i call on yer for yr decision his eyes were opaque the body tense i cannot give you any hope in the matter mr perrott renzi snapped angry at himself for allowing sentiment to cloud his reason he left perrott at the door of the alehouse staring after him and his anger turned to selfcontempt the very least he should have done was leave him with a pot of beer by degrees his depression turned black the beauty of the summer evening was in sharp contrast to his mood and he felt a need to allow its languorous warmth to enter him without the distraction of others the high street ran steeply down to the river wey along its pleasant banks was a path overhung with willows he walked slowly there thinking of nothing letting his soul empty of its gross humours insects circled in clouds in the stillness individually gilded by the setting sun a flock of ducks paddled lazily along he had his solitude by the first bend of the river he was feeling better and around the curve with something approaching equanimity he was able to smile at the sight of a woman on a footbridge upbraiding two children the two small boys were quite out of hand shouting across at each other from either bank the mothers voice shrilled in vexation renzi had it in mind to cross the footbridge and return by the other bank and mounted the bridge the woman saw him and grew flustered oh i do declare these infants are impossible renzi did not reply but bowed civilly encouraged the woman continued i am truly at a stand sir these these monsters are trying my patience sorely the bigger of the two boys looked at him speculatively then quickly returned to his baiting of the smaller young people today are so dreadfully illmannered the woman continued and since my dear husband requires to spend so much of his time in london in his absence they are quite unbiddable i am vexed to know just what to do in the matter of discipline nodding pleasantly renzi let the woman pass and began his return by the other bank he would not allow kydd to discover his mood and deliberately put aside thoughts of his friends fate he had not gone more than a few yards when an idea formed grew and burst into expression it was merely an idle thought but it developed swiftly and with what possibilities his depression lifted instantly and he found it difficult to sleep that night early in the morning renzi mysteriously excused himself and vanished into town on undisclosed business he was back at noon and lost no time in finding kydd id be obliged to you should you spare me the odd hour tom he said with peculiar intensity they passed to the left of holy trinity church up past the glebe cottages to the open fields beyond here at renzis urging they turned down the dusty lane to the slatecovered buildings at the end take a look tom cautiously picking their way over the rubbish in the small courtyard they entered the main structure it was sturdily built of stone but decay had allowed the roof timbers to give way and they lay in ruins inside nettles populated the rubble kydd looked doubtfully at renzis wild expression but held his tongue there you see in front of you the fruit of an enlightened intellect mystified kydd tried to make sense of renzis ramblings renzi continued two disparate thoughts leading inescapably to a fine conclusion to a practical conclusion such as you will bless me for fearing for his friends sanity kydd took renzis arm no you dont understand renzi said pulling away his eyes shone here we have it a solution i have the school building i have the schoolmaster we want but resolve the chance meeting with the woman and her children had given renzi an idea he had returned to the bookshop and approached the onelegged assistant and determined he was essentially free for other employment adding the other side of the equation renzi explained your revered father need fear no loss of visual precision as a schoolmaster it is not needed but the worthy citizens of guildford need a school for their infants that accentuates discipline in these tumultuous times he smiled happily so we establish a school on naval lines a captain assisted by a strict bosun and capable quartermaster you see your father will be the principal your dear self as his assistant and your mother to provide for the infants and we have a bosun with a wooden leg who shall rule all aboard with silver call and cane showing neither fear nor favour to any touched by his friends thoughtfulness and privately reserving judgement as to his suitability as a schoolmaster kydd suppressed a stab of excitement at the stability and hope that the plan promised affecting reluctance he growled an the money what kind o plan is it without a pot o money at the back of it renzi had plans for this too you will tell me that guildford is a strange town a wicked place that does not give a fair price for a desirable shop in the high street and places wild value on a pile of stones high and dry away from passing trade he feigned dejection and said so i am undone my plan is worthless lets return to the red lion and console ourselves in drink kydd felt a bursting elation but determined not to show it instead he said grumpily we had best first tell them where we have been wastin our evening then you will know that ive been in the trade since before i was breeched thomas as was my father before me kydds father was obdurate a kydd does not abandon all this for the sake of some wild adventure my son renzi interjected gently then what thomas told me of his uncle in canada your brother is a nonsense then mr kydd it served to bring some sense of proportion to the discussion and they went to bed on the promise of a serious look at the plan in the morning the boatswain attended at the inaugural meeting in the front room of the closed shop the next day despite his wooden leg it was the glint in his eye and his ironbound manner that inspired the group as nothing else did and the day was carried within the week kydd and renzi were standing in the grounds of the kydd schoolhouse cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war exclaimed renzi and fell upon the ruin tugging masonry and wizened baulks of timber clear it was hard work and sweat streamed from them under the summer sun cecilia kept up a running supply of lemon shrub kydds father remaining in the shop to complete outstanding orders first the interior was cleared and the walls set to rights the next stage brought out the boatswain with his tackle he took charge immediately and with hard seamanlike orders perfectly understandable to a brace of foretopmen had them swaying up the yards and tailing onto the topping lift until the roof beams were all safely in place the boatswain pressed some hands for the roof tiling and before kydds amazed eyes a trim little classroom appeared a schoolmasters study and other necessaries were next and soon a central plinth in the tiny quadrangle was seen stepping a mast complete with topmast and all the standing rigging proper to such an edifice the day came when the mayor was prevailed upon to open the schoolhouse three soldiers and a fife arrived from the royal surreys and to the grave glee of the children of the town they marched about then stood to attention in strict line in front of the mast fine and earnest words were said and then in this country town far from the sea the good folk were treated to the exotic spectacle of the boatswain in his best seagoing gear solemnly piping a salute to the union flag of old england as it was hauled slowly and impressively up the mizzen halliards there was something suspiciously like a tear in mrs kydds eye as the guests and prospective parents inspected the neat buildings and there was more than a little of the manowar about the scrupulously clean rooms the squaredoff desks and spartan appointments the boatswain stumped about fierce and strict his silver call around his neck and mr kydd in the unaccustomed black breeches of a schoolmaster did his best to look severe cecilia went up to renzi and enveloped him in a hug which went on and on until she released him eyes sparkling kydd frowned it was not so much having to spend such a fine day inside here alone in the new classroom it was the impenetrable obtuseness of the book he was trying to get his head round it was a standard grammar lowth and it would be the one he would have to teach but he had only the sketchiest dameschool education to meet it with without thinking he had sat not at the high severe teachers desk at the front of the room but at a childs desk facing it his head was aswim with words an adverb what the devil was that again wasnt it something that ended with mg but surely that was an adjective he sighed in despair and what if one of the pupils asked him the question he dreaded more than any other if you please sir what use is an adverb he ground his teeth with frustration the adverb lat adverbium as the attribute of an attribute doth occur in divers forms cf adverbiation the phraseological adverb what possible value could that be to anyone in real life to a sailor for instance out there on a topsail yardarm in a blow fisting the madly flogging canvas to a reef while the ship rolled wildly he leant back in vivid recollection and what would stirk say if at quarters the gun loaded and run out he reminded him it is of the first importance to apprehend the singular difference between the two distinct families of nouns the nomen substantium the first the nomen adjectivum the second on no account should these be confused he smiled at the thought then you do not find your lot uncongenial he had not noticed renzi entering the littie classroom be damned how this mumping rogue cn cackle his grease like this im beggared t know renzis eyes softened a utile article will always prove perdurant to the mind he said enigmatically kydd threw him a frosty glance and bent again to his book i proceed to town this afternoon there are some articles i must have when when i return aboard do you wish anything for the school kydd looked up renzi was saddened at the bleakness in his expression kydds family future was now secure but the familys only son most surely was not intended to be a crabby pedagogue thank ye no kydd replied and quickly bent to his work renzi left noiselessly there were now only days left on his ticketofleave at which point he must go and in accordance with his resolve for good the bookshop still had not the new wordsworth in stock and he turned to leave why mr renzi what a pleasure renzi faced a wellproportioned woman in the latest highwaisted fashion and fussily ornate reticule her face just a little too ruddy for the elegance of her attire it crossed his mind that this was one of the mothers who entrusted her child to the kydd school her name eluded him and he politely inclined his head her eyes roamed over his austere black and an impish smile appeared you are a man of mystery i do declare mr renzi she said eyes atwinkle you appear suddenly from nowhere and not a soul knows aught of you pray where are you spending your leisure daryton that was her name and with a daughter to provide for he remembered with sudden caution do not i beg concern yourself on my account mrs daryton said renzi coolly i have reasons enough to visit this charming town but when these are concluded i must return there was a brief hesitation but then she continued brightly yet even the man of business must seek diversion or the spirit must wither her eyes remained watchfully on his he allowed a brief smile to show then bowed and made to leave oh mr renzi she called it has just this moment crossed my mind silly me it seems i may have omitted to let you know that we are holding an assembly next tuesday mr budsoe will perform on the flute and miss eccles has promised her new poem for me on that very night can you find it in your heart to forgive my lapse and accept my invitation i know letitia is beside herself to meet you no doubt thought renzi wryly he opened his mouth to refuse then found himself saying indeed may i inquire who will be attending why his worship of course she began the mayor must have been a coup for her renzi mused and major summers of the militia mr beddle the one that owns the mill not the other one and quite so said renzi smoothly and of course mr and mrs kydd he added without change of tone mrs daryton stopped shocked a tradesman mr renzi you who now owns the new town school a man of business a professional gentleman he continued but he was and who is considering extending his holdings to a godalming establishment of the same nature in the future i understand renzi continued inspecting his cuffs disdainfully my reputation who some would consider it folly to disregard mrs daryton stared at renzi with barely concealed frustration then began with finality mr renzi i cannot renzi drew himself upright mrs daryton i thank you for your kind invitation i will consult my engagements and hope they will allow me to accept he fixed her eye with an uncompromising determination very well mr renzi she stuttered renzi relaxed his expression i do recall however that in the event tuesday will be available to me mrs daryton she returned his gaze with puzzlement even a small country town had its delicate social snobberies of which pedagogy came perilously low on the social scale and just where did renzi fit in the scheme of things with his effortiess sophistication it would of course be expected that a daughter of marriageable age attend and therefore it would be impossible to refuse the son renzi felt a twinge of amusement at the thought of kydd in a social situation but this was his future and it was the least he could do to set him up in this way the darytons were some sort of merchants he couldnt quite recall and therefore the occasion would not be high but it would serve to set the kydds one step up on the social scale they have a son and daughter i believe renzi said but of course said mrs daryton faintly but was he not at one time a common sailor she added more strongly he was most untimely taken up by the press if that is your understanding renzi admonished and now he has been able to establish his credentials and return to the bosom of his family how dreadful she replied eyes wide until tuesday eve renzi prompted unctuously tuesday then mr renzi the hired carriage ground on briskly towards merrow downs the four passengers in a companionable crush inside mr kydd had a slightly bemused air cecilia was serene and mrs kydd fidgeted with the fan in her lap do remember cecilia that it is not seemly to be seen to accept a dance with a gennelman too quick when he says do you want a dance you make him wait said mrs kydd cecilia flashed a guarded look of amusement at renzi sitting opposite and murmured i will remember mama renzi returned a faint smile knowing the impossibility of conveying the byzantine subtleties of social interplay to someone without the breeding to have absorbed it from birth he felt sure however that cecilia could be relied upon to give a spirited account of herself i rather fancy that the formalities in this instance will not necessarily be observed to the full renzi said that would certainly be the case discreet enquiries had revealed that the darytons had done well only recently in the coach trade to brighton and had since set up in a fine house out of town i just know i should have worn the mauve crepe fretted mrs kydd cambric will not answer but it is the fashion what will mrs daryton think now mama please dont fuss think of the hours we spent at the needle and goffering iron we are now in the first rank of the fancy set your cares at rest and enjoy yourself tonight dear mama the carriage swayed at a corner tell the driver to have a care walter mrs kydd instructed shrilly mr kydd obediently banged at the roof an upsidedown face suddenly appeared at the window grinning devilishly the ladies screamed ttake care if you please driver mr kydd said to the apparition aye aye sir said the boatswain and winked at cecilia but remained inverted grinning inanely mr perrott you are in drink said mrs kydd frostily all the haaaaands to dance and skylark the boatswain roared happily you are quite betwaddled mr perrott and my god whos driving the carriage she suddenly screamed in terror the boatswain winked again why mr thomas es ad the ribbons this last mile n a half he seemed to recollect something and disappeared abruptly shaken mrs kydd turned to her husband i knew we shouldnt have let thomas ride outside she muttered the carriage turned abruptly and swung in through a wroughtiron gate rolling grittily up the driveway were here walter she exclaimed in consternation they drew up at twin sconces that flamed each side of an impressive doorway even before the carriage had come to a stop kydd dropped lightly to the ground and was at the door lowering the step muffled sounds of gaiety and music from within raised the pitch of excitement to an exquisite expectation milady he grinned at cecilia who accepted his hand daintily in much the same way as she had boarded the frigate at his side in portsmouth a special soft look was kydds token that she had not forgotten either the party stood outside uncertain the carriage stood also mrs kydd dug her elbow discreetly into mr kydds side until he blinked and spoke up to the figure at the reins er please to await our pleasure er you may proceed mr perrott the boatswain leant down puzzled then looked mystified at kydd oh he means lay off to looard but stay within hail kydd explained the boatswain grinned and jerked the carriage forward at the door a harassed footman appeared renzi guessed that the household did not run to overmany servants but approached with good grace he was in his plain black his only concession to the evening a borrowed silvergrey waistcoat the footman expecting something by way of a cloak stood confused mr and mrs kydd miss cecilia kydd mr thomas kydd and mr renzi renzi said quietly kydds own raiment was of an altogether more flamboyant nature growling that he wanted nothing of coats and breeches he had finally succumbed and at the last minute wore a brave show of bottlegreen coat blue breeches and tasselled yellow waistcoat renzi had shuddered at the sight but loudly approved kydds snowy white lace cravat the footman led them into the house to what would serve as the assembly room for the night it was ablaze with candlelight mirrors at each end placed cunningly to make the room seem even larger and filled with people chattering delightedly beyond were large french windows open to the warm darkness of the garden beyond packed into the corner a string trio sawed away and a shy maid bore around a tray of sweetmeats oh mr renzi said mrs daryton warmly advancing on renzi i am so glad you were able to come her gown gave ample prominence to her bosom and her exuberant display of jewellery glittered in the candlelight you must meet letitia she has been talking about you and mr bedsoe says as how he is sure you are in the diplomatic line she added renzi stood his ground and with a perfect bow stepped aside to reveal cecilia eyes wide and looking striking in the ivory dress with her strong features and dark looks may i present miss cecilia kydd he said signalling discreetly to the motionless cecilia to step forward renzi caught faces turning appreciatively in her direction as the men took her measure my dear i hope you will enjoy this little evening im sure mrs daryton murmured renzi hung back discreetly and she moved on to mrs kydd i dont think ive had the pleasure she said in a silvercool voice mrs kydd flushed but mr kydd stepped up manfully mrs daryton may er might i present my wife fanny to mrs darytons infinite satisfaction mrs kydd bobbed her a quick curtsy and my son thomas raising her eyebrows at kydds interesting appearance she nevertheless took in thoughtfully his manly strength and direct gaze renzi watched the proceedings and when honours had been duly done assumed a polite smile and moved forward into the noisy throng i say you renzi a short man with a flushed face and sharp flinty eyes confronted him dye think we dont know what yr about i am afraid you have the advantage of me sir said renzi the man flashed glances around the room bedsoe sir and its a guinea to a shillin youre in goverment business an diplomacy at that right renzi gave a short bow i am desolated to contradict you mr bedsoe but i am far from being a diplomat another two men one with an interested lady on his arm joined the conversation ah but still on government business ill be bound one said his lady looked at renzi boldly you will forgive us quizzing you sir but you do present as a man of some mystery she said her eyes on his i vow i am not on government business renzi deflected urbanely he is a man of business the other man said to the lady i heard mrs daryton say oh then it must be let me see in banking foreign money secret arrangements the ladys eyes sparkled no no renzi laughed then what pray er all that i am permitted to say is that as of this moment i am on the kings service renzi said ah the king and i am not at liberty to say anything further madam the group fell into a silence looking respectfully at renzi these are fearful times my dear the first man told her uncommon dreadful things happenin everywhere in the world im sure mr renzi is involved in these at some peril to himself in our interest is that not so renzi kydd felt more awkward than ever he had felt before he hung back from the crowd watching the backs of men as they chatted amiably with the women some of whom threw him curious glances he was left alone in his misery he knew no one and could think of no easy conversational entree what have we here charles to his right two men strolled towards him their gold quizzing glasses and tight buckskin breeches proclaiming them dandies a quizzing glass went up and the taller man swept kydd up and down such a fopling charles but i do believe it is our new wordgrinder at this navy school the other dandys eyebrows went up in astonishment by jessamy an i think you may be right dear fellow kydd glowered but could not think of what to do in the situation i say mr schoolman do you realise youll be learnin young brenton his gerunds from his gerundives the two dissolved into elegant fits of the giggles for some reason if yr brenton needs his jerruns hell learn his jerruns right enough kydd said stiffly the two broke into howls of laughter and sauntered off kydds face burned and he yearned with all his heart to be back in the clear salt air of the sea where men about him were honest and direct the hum of conversations rose and fell and he watched cecilia playing complex games of coquetry with her fan to a circle of admirers renzi was backed into a corner by a group of what seemed to be local businessmen and his mother sat in animated conversation with other mothers of an age in the chairs along one wall a silvery tinkle sounded above the hubbub it persisted and the noise died it was mrs daryton in the centre of the room looking about her primly the gentlemen may now find their partners for the quadrille she announced a happy burst of chatter erupted and kydd was shouldered unceremoniously aside by excited couples he flattened himself against the wall and saw renzi stride through the crowd to cecilia shall you dance with me miss kydd he said raising her hand to his lips cecilia dropped her eyes and said modestly my mama tells me never to accept a mans invitation too precipitately then the eyes flicked up and filled with laughter of course dear nicholas renzi led her out to the centre of the room and they assumed one side of the square of four couples he smiled he had prudently enquired about daryton evenings and had found that mrs daryton favoured the formality of a quadrille to open the entertainments cecilia had proved an apt pupil and he would now claim his reward the string trio handled the rondo with aplomb neither too quick nor too tiresome and cecilia clearly revelled in the gay rush and stately retreat a balote followed by the pas de basque a fetching blush rising to her cheeks renzi warmed to her vivacity the sparkling eyes unaffected by pose or affect and he felt oddly moved by his remembrance of her visit to the frigate to claim her brother a twinge of guilt had him looking about the room for kydd he finally caught sight of him behind the crush bent down in trying to make a deaf old lady understand something he realised what was happening but shrugged mentally kydd would have to make his own way in this world now if he could the dance ended cecilia laughed with pleasure that was the most enormous fun she said but i am quite out of breath she swayed dramatically against him clutching at his arms and seeming quite unaware of the electric effect on him of her breasts against his chest may we cool off in the garden for a spell renzi had been propositioned as brazenly before but sensed that this was a far more innocent invitation again he warmed to her but of course my dear he said offering his arm the garden was not large but dark and scattered with welltended shrubs and rockeries they strolled together cecilias arm on his renzis thoughts swelled and deepened but this was no time to be interested in a girl no matter how high the sap had risen you danced divinely cecilia he said quite truthfully why thank you nicholas she replied happily squeezing his arm it is my first essay she said shyly but thanks to you cecilia he began but cold reason came unbidden to destroy the thought nicholas she said sensing something and stopping to meet his eyes renzi could not let even kydd know of his thoughts in any case they were too complex the return to polite company after so long the impossibility of explaining the effect of experiencing war at the first hand to this innocent country society the presence of a handsome beauty of such touching ingenuousness it was too much he swung her round to face him her other hand went up to meet his and she searched his face cecilia he began again thickly her expression tautened then softened to an exquisite longing nicholas she said her voice low and throaty her hands gripped his nicholas its thomas isnt it renzi froze its thomas youre worried for thomas you think hell be unhappy dont you she breathed her eyes glistened that is so sweet of you nicholas so like you she disengaged and dabbed at her eyes but dont worry i pray we are going to take good care of him for you at renzis stricken look she hurried on i know he would probably be a wonderful sailor to sail the seas and see strange lands and fight in dreadful battles but she broke off and hugged renzi with all her might i do pray you will come back to us and tell of your adventures on the high seas you will wont you nicholas promise me renzi nodded i promise he said softly she sighed linking her arm in his and they walked on back to the house suddenly the string trio stopped playing and the happy confusion of chattering and laughter died away then a general roar of approval met the musicians getting to their feet and taking position for country dancing cecilia gave a squeal of delight shepherds hey she exclaimed in dismay renzi saw the couples forming up too late the reel was quickly taken by three couples and the dancing began again much more boisterously than before with flushed faces happy calls whispered asides i do apologise cecilia i fear i am not accustomed to these particular steps renzi said quietly a slight shadow passed over his features then we shall sit sir she said on no account be so good as to rescue poor thomas she left but kydd had already cheered up at the rustic dancing and was striking the hey with the best of them at last enjoying himself a sudden commotion at the end of the line of men resolved itself into a loud clunking renzi knew what it must be the boatswain had been drawn to the joyous sound of the dance and had joined in with his red face split by a huge smile first one leg then his wooden peg rose and fell with a clunk as the line advanced and bowed advanced and reared the assembly roared with goodhumoured laughter and the violinist redoubled his efforts the evening wore on mr bedsoe performed most creditably on the flute and miss eccles was greeted with much polite applause on presenting her new poem then after more dancing it was clear that the evening was drawing to a close renzi sought cecilia again and found her in conversation with her brother i find this is the final dance should you stand up for me i would be obliged he said oh stuff and nonsense nicholas of course i shall she laid her hand in his and they moved out on to the floor again she looked up at him fondly he thought the dance began the couples swirled and exchanged his new partner prattled on clearly flattered at partnering renzi the arches formed the girl went through with a giggle and another presented herself to be exchanged grinning vapidly up at him his eyes strayed about looking for cecilia on the opposite side he saw her twirling around a serious young man he had seen her with before and who obviously knew her the music skirled on heedless and it was time to exchange again but cecilia did not the young man had whispered something to her and she had stopped dead staring at him renzi missed his step in his concentration and had to apologise to his partner when he looked again it was to see the pair disappearing into the garden with rising feeling he endured the wait mechanically stepping out the measures eventually they returned hand in hand cecilias face a study in happiness impulsively she pulled down the young mans shy face and kissed him looking up at him intensely renzi stopped dancing letting his hands fall to his sides a welling bitterness rose not at cecilia but at life existence itself astonished his partner stared at him in dismay he mumbled his excuses and left the floor enduring the stares and muttered comments of the other dancers he took a glass of shrub and downed it quickly kydd was over in the corner reclaimed by the deaf old woman who was maundering on at him renzi strode over and interrupted brother i crave fresh air the evening is over do you wish a walk home or kydd looked at him in surprise but quickly recovered o course m friend renzi noted with relief that he needed no explanations courteous but firm renzi paid his devoirs to mrs daryton explained their intent to a puzzled mrs kydd and they were soon afoot on the threemile stretch back to guildford silent they tramped back in the warm darkness past fields of sleeping oxen and sheep hayricks looming rickety and large kydd was aware that something untoward had occurred to trouble his friend is anythin amiss nicholas he asked in a low voice renzi did not answer at first then said harshly know that i must depart for portsmouth these three days i know said kydd softly he had often wondered over the last few weeks how he would take the actuality of renzis departure the blankness in his life where his friend had been then i shall not allude to it further renzi said in an affected voice kydd felt a lump rising in his own throat but knew that any display of emotion on his part would alienate renzi o course he said they preserved silence the whole way back finally reaching the schoolhouse it was in darkness the carriage must have long since passed them on the other road and everyone would now be abed there is a light in the kitchen kydd said quietly they climbed over the low garden fence and made their way to the back a single candle lay on the kitchen table and they entered the door squeaking noisily they tiptoed in but they had been heard and cecilia appeared in a nightgown with a candle her face alight with excitement thomas nicholas she whispered as loudly as she could youll never guess what happened tonight renzis face set like stone kydd frowned in bafflement what is it sis he asked no really the most wonderful news she squealed kydd snorted impatiently what is it then if we cn ask she pouted prettily then i wont tell you you horrid man there was a stirring next to kydd do i take it that we must offer our felicitations renzi said woodenly cecilia stared at him i i dont know what you mean nicholas she said uncertainly the young man he and you roger partington and youd never conceive tonight he confessed to me that it would make him the happiest man in the world if i could grant his dearest wish she turned to kydd oblivious of the look on renzis face thomas he wishes so much to be a teacher a scholar and wanted me to intercede with father in this but then i thought why should he not take your place dear brother and then you can go back to sea she watched delighted as her words rendered the two men equally thunderstruck well thomas can you bear after all not to be a teacher shall you pine after the grammar yearn for your figuring again kydd and renzi stood frozen i shall return presently cecilia whispered and swept up the stairs in a few minutes she was back at the stupid look on kydds face she threw her arms about his neck you darling boy you wonderful silly brother can you not see handing him a brown paper parcel she said i have saved your precious sailor rig for you i hid it from mother as i knew you would need it some day you are a sailor tom youre different from we land folks she lowered her eyes go with nicholas tom you must and may god bless you and keep you and bring you safely back to us god damn it kydd exploded he was sitting on the grass verge of the road shaking out yet another stone from his shoe it was wonderful to be back in his looseswinging sailors rig but his feet were sore they had not brought drink and the sun beat down on them renzi looked up resentfully if we had kept back just one he began in an uncharacteristically morose tone and if we had thought t ask the other kydd snapped back it was the fault of both and neither in their plan to avoid the wounded looks of his mother they had with cecilias reluctant connivance sneaked out before dawn for the journey south independently they had emptied their pockets of their remaining money leaving it as a peaceoffering on the mantelpiece of the drawing room the driver of the mail coach at the angel had adequate experience of sailors and their prodigal habits ashore and was scornful of their entreaties the coach lurched off without them down the high street and away with a splendid cracking of whips and deafening clatter of wheels on cobblestones there was no way they could return home not after cecilias generous but stricken farewell kydd felt warm at the memory of her shyly producing his seaclothes sweetsmelling and neatly folded he had stowed them in his seabag together with the meaningful gift of an ingenious portable writing set quills inkblock and penknife in a polished wooden box renzi softened too there had been a kiss for them both for him the moist warmth had been placed rather closer to his mouth than was customary and her head had not been averted sufficiently to avoid his chaste return peck landing perilously close to her own parted lips goethes prometheus in the hallstadt edition was her gift to him its restless subjectivity was not altogether to his taste but he would persevere for the sake of her kindness a bishops carriage prepared to leave and they gratefully accepted his patriotic offer the kindly gentleman had taken them as far as petworth provided they rode outside and promised to behave themselves with sobriety and decorum they were now on foot six miles beyond on duncton hill and halfway to their goal of chichester and the coast there they hoped the busy coastwise roads would provide transport renzi was only too aware that he was not as inured to walking as the country folk who would quickly starve if they insisted on coaches wherever they went on the road they met several who waved curiously at the exotic pair he muttered under his breath and humped his seabag once more but a distant movement and dust haze on the winding road caught his eye some sort of empty hay wagon there was a blotch of red in the front seat unusual where faded fustian was more the rule seeing renzi pause kydd glanced back you think he said in our direction and without a load renzi replied without discussion they dropped their bundles and waited for the wagon to approach the horses toiled listlessly up the hill and it became clear that there were objects in the body of the wagon thats a lobsterback kydd burst out as the wagon approached they saw that the marine was a guard for the pressgang the objects in the wagon his luckless catch kydd laughed if we dont leg it smartly we could fin ourselves pressed renzi smiled wryly they were in no danger real deserters would be in disguise and heading away from the seaports they waved down the wagon the marine was dusty and bored and saw no reason why they should not share a ride to portsmouth they clambered gratefully into the wagon with their bundles and found themselves a place among the dozen or so victims of the press who were handcuffed to the outside rail there were two sailors also members of the gang comfortably wedged at the forward end enjoying a bottle they looked up in surprise as kydd and renzi boarded yo ho shipmates what cheer the older one said artemis kydd said briefly swelling with pride the sailors sat up no flam then yell need to clap on more sail mates should yer wanna be aboard afore she sails what shes sailin mate another of yer vyges with a bag o gold fer yez all at the end the younger said enviously so her battle damage had been made good already there must have been some ruffled feathers in the staid world of the dockyards but would they make it in time she out o dock yet kydd asked dunno were diadems at spithead mate how would we know the older man was short with them diadem was an oldfashioned and slow sixtyfourgun third rate which could neither catch a frigate nor really keep the line of battle the bottle was passed over as the wagon ground off and as kydd took a pull at the liquor he noticed one or two resentful looks from the prisoners who lolled pitifully their hands clinking the iron cuffs that held them there was one young man of an age with himself sitting miserably with his head back he stared up into the summer sky with an expression that spoke of homesickness fear and helplessness kydds own dolorous journey as a pressed man was only a little more than six months before and so much had happened since adventures that would have seemed terrifying if he had known of them beforehand he flashed a comradely grin at the lad who turned away in his misery not wishing to talk kydd shrugged there was an unbridgeable distance between them he raised his bottle the raw gin was heady but did nothing for his thirst he wiped his mouth and passed it to renzi it was a serious matter if they missed artemis they would have no option but to ship out in another unknown vessel which as volunteers they would have the privilege of choosing but kydd had been much looking forward to meeting his old shipmates again and the frigate was of the first order as a fighting ship lucky too the wagon swayed on the wheels grinding monotonously as the hours passed the heat tedious to bear without any shade finally they passed on to portsea island and began the final stretch to portsmouth town the gaiety and feverish celebrations of before were now well over replaced by a purposeful wartime hurry the downcast pressed men stirred when they realised their journey was concluding and at the sight of the grim lines of ships at anchor a youngster began to whimper and the older ones turned grave kydds heart leapt however as his gaze took in the scene his nostrils caught the fresh sea air breezing in and he eagerly observed the ships at anchor the bulk of queen charlotte admiral howes flagship the royal sovereign of equal ifize and he thought he recognised old duke william further down the line the wagon stopped at the sally port the prisoners would wait shackled until the boats came for them but they were free to bid farewell and tramp up the wellremembered road across to the dockyard the dock and the berth alongside were empty there was no sign of artemis and kydds heart sank they were too late depressed they hunkered down on the cobblestones as they thought about what to do it was a keen loss which kydd perceived came from a sense of homelessness when hearth and home now sheltered someone else renzi first spotted her end on she was over at the other side of the harbour at weevil lake off the royal clarence victualling yard taking in casks of salt beef and ships biscuit but how were they to get out to her almost immediately they saw distantly a boat put off from the stern of artemis it slowly crossed the bright water towards their dockyard jetty resolving into the captains barge no way jack the coxswain of the barge replied to their entreaties capns orders he said impatiently we as a full crew n dont need no more volunteers he unshipped the rudder and heaved it into the boat and came up to where they were standing yer knows shes goin foreign he said looking at them knowingly the information would deter some at the expression on their faces the man softened look mates tell yez now barky closed books on er ships company sennight since aint taken a soul after sorry they didnt speak so the coxswain shrugged and left them to it lifting his seabag kydd muttered well need t find a ship nicholas or were like t starve renzi nodded agreement and got slowly to his feet oars bellowed the coxswain in the boat the men tossed their oars to the vertical and assumed a reverential dignity bugger off he whispered harshly with his head bowed in concentration captain powlett strode forcefully down to the jetty a greyhaired lieutenant talked to him urgently until they reached the boat the coxswain saluted and took the captains plain leather despatch case powlett began to descend the stone steps to the boat when kydd pushed forward sir he called powlett looked up irritably without pausing in his motions sir you remember me the captain stopped and glanced up in surprise ah yes one of the royal billys his eyebrows contracted in an effort of remembrance and one of the first boarders he added in satisfaction sir we want t ship with you there was a hiss of indrawn breath from the captains coxswain the moment hung the pairs travelworn appearance and something about kydds intensity moved powlett very well get forrard then the scandalised coxswain glared the bowman grinned and shifted over but kydd obstinately remained standing we both sir powlett glanced at renzi the odd one but quick with a blade through the gunport was it not he asked sir then we can find a place for them both mr fairfax powlett said to the lieutenant with an unmistakable edge aye aye sir the man said so yez had enough o them long shore ways petit rasped couldnt stomach the shoreside scran grumbled kydd fighting down a grin a bag o guineas says yer did jus manage to get outside a dark ale or three this was billy cundall he had moved into their mess in place of adam who had decided for no special reason to move across to another mess kydds smile was broad and open his white teeth showing in the dim gold light of the lanthorn above the table he raised his grog can in salute and swallowed while in port the small beer was quite acceptable brewed specially in the dockyard for the fleet it was only after weeks at sea that the sourness and metallic aftertaste became apparent luke came with a mess kid of steaming pottage he still had the hollow eyes and withdrawn air that hed had since the battle quashee broke off his conversation with petit what ho luke is it to me exactin standard or shall we have ter send it back there was no answer from the boy and quashee glanced at petit leave im be mate petit muttered renzi made a characteristic deprecating gesture and the mess knew that he had something to say and waited expectantiy we shall within this week be outward bound to the far side of the world he drew himself up and intoned on burning coasts or frozen seas alike in each extreme the gallant sailors ere at ease but floats with fortunes stream clap a stopper on it avast th jabber shipmate the goodnatured chorus drowned renzis attempts and in mock disgust he drank noisily from his pot whats yr meaning nicholas kydd prodded well if you will allow me he said and leant back get on with it damn you for a shab kydds eyebrows contracted at cundalls illjudged words to his friend renzi seemed not to have heard it will not have escaped your notice that the officers are laying in stores a good deal this voyage will not be a simple one the table exchanged looks it was widely believed that renzi had second sight such had been the accuracy of his predictions in the past what do ye mean petit said carefully that mayhap we should follow suit in our little way of course we can you conceive a span of six months at sea nothing new always the same food the same company we will rue it i believe were we not to take a precaution the thought had clearly not entered their heads only one kinda stores we better ave an if the kegs run out then itll have ter be bottles cundall had a handsome face he took care to flare his sidewhiskers to frame it aye but ye knows that in th indies its like to be arrack made outa rice itll bowse up yer jib in a brace o shakes right enough billy boy eyes turned to petit who leant back innocently come on mate youve bin out there afore aint yer quashee said yair but i wanta hear what renzi is asayin petit said renzi continued only little things i grant but i have the feeling they will be deeply appreciated in the future i say that we empower quashee to step ashore to make purchases for the mess in general as he sees fit some condiments some some oo cundall said conweniences said quashee happily he means conweniences a rub o ginger dried erbs a jar o molasses thats the ticket just so renzi said but we also need amusements i have made my preparations but could i suggest it be taken under general consideration the concept of preparing for recreation was a novel matter it caused the table to go quiet pinto spoke up for the first time padrino he said to petit what you do when you sail to the indee petit toyed with his pot renzis right o course three four year back it was if yer recollects we went ter batavia to pick up bligh n his crew oo stayed with im in the bounty launch took em back to portsmouth kydd remembered reading about it in the news it had a different meaning now petit had their attention and carried on with his yarn illtempered sod was bligh noo his rights as a grunter did he n him only a jumpedup masters mate useta strut up n down the quarterdeck never goin forrard ever there was a stirring around the table opinions in the navy were divided between admiration for blighs undoubted feat of seamanship four thousand miles in an open boat without losing a man and contempt for his equally undoubted senseless brutality to his men long vyage yair but dont recollect we ad troubles findin things to do he ruminated well what did y do in th dogwatches each night prompted kydd usual kinda things yarns dice fancy work with th rope oh yeah makin things he fumbled and pulled out his seamans knife like this i done the handle was beautifully carved the handfilling curve of a leaping dolphin in ebony n others they like ter scrimshander carvin whales teeth an that kydd thought of wong and the intricate nude oriental females he always fashioned yeah i seen that petit scratched his head bout all i cn say you makes yer own amusements mates it made kydd thoughtful and he broached the subject with renzi later food for the intellect dear fellow turn time to account he who kills time is a murderer renzi had no doubt about it kydd guessed that soon a significant amount of space in their shared seachest would be taken up with books there was no way of avoiding it the ship was under sailing orders and could sail imminently kydd had to write a final letter to cecilia reluctantly he found his portable writing kit and set it up he tested the sharpness of the quill nib with his thumb and settled his paper and ink once again the noise of the mess deck around him was unsettling the building excitement making it difficult to concentrate and of course he was no taut hand with words it was quite outside his character artemis at anchor spithead he began he sucked at the tip of the quill until it began to look bedraggled and sorry and he glanced around despairingly the lanthorn set on the table next to him guttered and radiated a hot candle smell the day of august weather cool westerlies slight chop this was better it was beginning to flow dear sister or should that be cecilia he had never written to her before in his life i trust i leave you as our mother and father in good health clever one that women always set great store by such things we sail for india now nicholas says it will be miles we have been taking in stores it is hard work and you would stare at the strange kinds his mind reviewed the last sentence some were passing strange a mysterious canvas mailbag with a heavy padlock through the cringles at its mouth and guarded by sourfaced redcoats the heavy rectangular bundles requiring special dry storage that turned out to be scores of newspapers the chickens and goats that would be looked after at sea by the peculiar jemmy ducks and slaughtered in turn she obviously wouldnt be interested in these arid details we will be at sea for many months or a year or more than a year today is dry and cool elias petit says that around the cape will set us at hazard this time of the year daemon frigate was there lost with all hands in the year it was difficult to think of anything else that might interest her and when renzi arrived he looked up with relief nicholas what should i write to my sister here is my paper and its not yet half written renzi looked over his shoulder then sat opposite quite blankfaced do you understand thomas that the ladies are on quite another tack to us in the matter of communications he explained they are illogical flighty and strangely interested in the merest details you know kydd had never considered the matter before renzi waited and thought of cecilia the intelligent darting dark eyes the sturdy practicality giving backbone to the appealing childish warmth of her femininity unaccountably he felt a pang would you be offended were i to offer my suggestions he found himself saying o course not nicholas give us a broadside of em i beg very well cecilia was practical but she would want to know personal details are you ready it is the eve of great adventures to the fabled court of the great moghul the sacred groves of calicut yet must i look to the needs of the voyage therefore dear sister i have those eyes softening under his gaze she would want to know of feelings fears hopes at the signal on the morrow we spread our sails and disappear from mortal ken into the great unknown the vasty deep i cannot but feel a quickening of the spirit as i contemplate the asininity of mans claims to dominion when he but rides above the wait this pen is scratchy do ye think shell suspect that its not me i mean writin like this of course she will not brother if you give thought to me dear cecilia be certain that my image is foremost in your mind when it would be months before there would be chance of a mail passage back to england in one of the stately east indiamans this letter would have to last haaaands to unmoor ship the anchorage was the same the view of the low dark green coast and white slashed downs was the same but the feeling was definitely different kydd waited in the foretop to go up to lay out and loose the foretopsail he had possibly the best view in the ship impulsively he reached for one of the brand new lines from aloft and took a long sniff the deep heady odour of the tar was a clean sea smell and it seemed to kydd to symbolise his break with the land his heart beat with excitement at the thought of the epic voyage ahead to lands strange and far what singular sights would he see what adventures would he undergo before he would be back here again he gulped but his eyes shone deepsea voyaging was never anything but a hard chancy affair death from a dozen causes lay in wait a helpless fall from aloft into the vastness of the sea malice of the enemy shipwreck disease his eyes might at this moment be making their last mortal sighting of the land that had given him birth on deck below officers paced impatiently as the cable slowly came in at the hawse and kydd blessed his fortune once again at being a topman and therefore spared cruel labour at the capstan lay out and loose the voice blared up from parrys speaking trumpet it was common knowledge that he had been mortified when fairfax had been brought in as first lieutenant against his expectations it was usual for wholesale promotions to follow a successful bloody action some officers might take their disappointment out on the men time would tell the frigate cast effortlessly to starboard quickly gathering way the focsle guns banged out the salute eddying puffs of a reduced charge from the sixpounders reaching him with its memory of battle on deck again kydd heaved a deep sigh gripping a shroud and looking back on the still detailed shoreline he thought of the small schoolhouse that perhaps he would never see again a tremor passed over him a premonition perhaps had this all been a mistake the yards trimmed the anchor at last catted and fished artemis settled down for the run out to sea kydd busied himself at the forebitts anxious for some reason to keep the land in sight for as long as possible details of the shore diminished and blurred into insignificance as it slipped away astern and the land began to take on an anonymous uniformity as they passed beyond the seamark of worsleys obelisk artemis duly performed her curtsy to neptune the first deep sea swell raising her bow majestically and passing down her length until at midpoint she fell again in a smash of spray the motion made him stagger at first but the live deck once more under his feet was glorious glancing aloft he drank in the curving of the leeches of the sails one above the other in exactly the right blend of curves and graces the bartaut new rigging in its familiar complexity as an elegant counterpoint with no raised poop the deck edge was a sweet line from where he stood right aft and he marvelled anew at the natural beauty of a ship no straight lines no blocky walls she was much closer to a sculpture than a building he looked back to the land within the span of a deck watch it had transformed from the solid earth from where before he had his being to the greying band now about to leave his sight and consciousness in a short time they would be alone quite alone in the trackless immensity of the ocean chapter staring at the empty horizon where england had been he didnt hear the footsteps behind a hand clapped on kydds shoulder snapping him out of his reverie no vitties fer you then lad he followed petit to the forehatch and joined the others with mixed emotions at dinner the lines beside renzis mouth seemed deeper his expression more set than kydd could remember having seen it before he realised that renzi must feel the same way as he but with the added force of an intelligence that had no control over its destiny no chance to affect its onward rush into whatever lay ahead it was a sombre thought so its farewell t old england kydd tried to be breezy but it fell flat the table lapsed into silence no one wished to catch an eye it might be years before they saw home again and with the certainty that some would not make the happy return cundall slammed down his pot an not too soon mates me dear ole uncle just got scragged at newgate fer twitchin a bit o silver me aunt needin the rhino n all there was murmuring justice shoreside was far worse than at sea kydd sat for a while letting the conversation ebb and flow about him listening to the regular shipboard creaks and swishes of a ship in a seaway and felt better why we goin to india mr petit lukes treble voice sounded above the talk petit shoved away his plate and thought for a while why cant say as ow i has an answer fer that luke we threw out the frogs fer good not so long ago nicholas kydd prompted staring at the timbers of the ships side renzi didnt speak at first kydd thought he had not heard then he said quietly i cannot say true the french have been ejected but there are native rajahs who see their best interest in stirring discord among the europeans and are probably in communication with the french but this is small stuff he settled back and continued i cant think what there is in calcutta that would justify our presence especially a crack frigate of our reputation that was the sticking point artemis was not just any frigate but at the moment the most famous in the navy loosed like a wolf on the french sea lanes she was a proven predator and if a frigate was wanted in those seas then others could be spared coulda got wind of a frog ship come ter ruffle feathers like those parts doud had drawn up a tub to join the group he always respected renzis pronouncements for their profundity renzi shook his head no wouldnt be that ned bombay marine will settle their account seems we have a mystery shipmates artemis made a fast passage south through biscay and on into sunnier seas at one point they were reined in by an irascible captain of a passing seventyfourgun shipoftheline but under admiralty orders they could not be touched and once more spread canvas for their far destination kydd was surprised at how the immediacy and movement of his life on land froze so quickly was packaged into a series of static images then slipped away into the past to become a collection of memory fossils his immediacy was now the rhythm of sea life the regular watch on deck an occasional fluster of an all hands to take in sail for a squall and the continual ebb and flow of daily events each as predictable as the rising sun but in sum a comforting background against which kydd grew and matured as a seaman his oaken complexion was renewed in the sun and work aloft restored his upper body strength to the point at which he could have swarmed up a rope hand over hand without using his feet to grip renzi envied kydds easy development his agility aloft his natural gifts as a sailor kydds splicing and pointing was meticulous while his own was adequate but lacked the regularity even technical beauty of kydds work his own body tended to the spare whipcord wiriness that went with his austere temperament and where kydd gloried in the dangers lurking aloft renzi was careful and sure in his movements never taking uncalculated risks or making an unconsidered move kydd soon caught up and overtook him in these skills but as renzi reminded himself his own objective was to serve a sentence not to make a lifes calling he recalled what had passed when they were tasked off to bowse down the gammoning around the bowsprit suspended on opposite sides under the gratings and walkways above they were as close to the exact point at which the stem cleaved the water as they could be it was mesmerising seeing at such close quarters the cutwater dip slowly and deeply into the ocean scattering rainbow jewels of water pausing then making an unhurried rise as regular and comforting as the breathing at a mothers breast it took an effort of will for them to finish the job and return and at night the startlingly bright moonpath of countless gleaming shards which continually fractured and joined danced and glittered in a spirited restlessness the reliable winds at this latitude left little for the watch on deck to do and they would stare at it for long periods under its influence they considered the mysteries of life which the normal course of existence on land with its everpresent distractions would never have allowed time at sea had a different quality it required that men move to its own rhythms conforming to its own pace nights as black as ol nick hisself said doud finishing hanking the fall of the weather forebrace the usual trimming of sails at the beginning of the watch was complete now and they would probably be stood down only voices in the dark and passing shadows on the glimmering paleness of the decks were evidence of the existence of other beings a low cry came from aft watch on deck stand down they would remain on deck ready but they could make themselves as comfortable as the conditions would allow soft talk washed around kydd old times old loves drowsily he looked up at the sky it was easy to be hypnotised by the regular shifting occlusion of sails and rigging across the starfield as the vessel rolled to the swell whats down there he found himself sayings the talk trailed off yer what said one voice kydd levered himself up while the thought took shape i mean at the bottom o the sea were only on th top must be all kindsa things down there his mind swam with images of sunken ships skeletons of whales and the recollection of a diorama he had once seen of davy joness locker it seemed reasonable to expect the muddy seabed that their anchor gripped to extend indefinitely in all directions coming up only for land how deep does it get he asked a deeper voice answered dunno that is ter say no one knows yer deepsea lead is eighty hunnerd fathom an it gives no bottom only a few leagues off scilly after that who knows its as deep as it is six hundred maybe a thousand feet and straight down kydd remembered the purity and crystal clarity of deep seawater in the daytime with the suns rays reaching down in moving shafts of light and even then he had never seen the bottom nighttime thats when yer thinks about it whats there movin about under our keel mates a rousin good question the voice declared a buzz of animated conversation started ship goes down with all hands in a blow stands ter reason theyre down there still naah sharksll be at their bones quickern silver what flam jeb wheres yer sharks in th north theres other things mate what likes ter eat a sailors bones things down there awaitin their chance what things kydd asked apprehensive of the reply monsters mate huge n bloody monsters this provoked a restless stirring but the voice was not contradicted the cheerful slapping of ropes against the mast and the unseen plash of the wake shifted imperceptibly to a manic fretfulness a new voice started from further away hes right there has ter be said some as say there aint no monsters but yerve got ter agree a sea this big cn hide moren a whole tribe of em sure theres monsters an older voice cut in an i seen one two summers ago only we wuz at anchor off funchal n that aint so far from here had fishin lines over the side hopin fer albacore so twas stout gear we had out he cleared his throat and continued nearly sundown n we was about to haul th lines in when comes such a tug on one it nearly took me with it inter the oggin me frien who was alongside me saw the line smokin out like it had a stone weight on it plungin down an he takes a turn on a cleat slows it down a bit then th line slackens an he hauls in there was total quiet suddenlike theres a shout i goes ter the side an so help me god i sees there somethin i don never want ter see again kydd held his breath red eyes n fangs workin away theres this great long darkgreen serpent an i mean long me frien worked it aft by tyin off on the pins one be one an im here ter tell yez mates it stretched out from abreast the foremast all the way aft ter the quarterdeck squirmin and thrashin right knaggy it was thumpin the side until officer o the deck told us to cut him loose ter save the ship a younger voice interjected yer cn be sure thats nowt but a tiddler lofty bigger ones down there yer just dont know an they aint the worst of em its them what the norskeys call the kraken theyre the worst what y they its yer giant octopus mate big as yer like loomin up outa the sea at night eyes as big as a church clock astarin up at yer an thats when you knows its all up cos it feeds on sailors what it sweeps up orf of the deck with its slimy great arms forty fathom long with these ere suckers all over em apprehension spread over kydd as they spoke there might be one directly in their path lying in silent anticipation of its meal just at this moment noiselessly rising up from the depths he shivered and hunkered down in the blackness as low as he could renzi was out of reach now at his trick on the wheel but in the forenoon they would certainly talk together the prevailing westerlies died and from the other direction the northeast trade winds began pleasantly warm vigorous and exhilarating the best possible impetus for their southward voyaging the sea turned ultramarine under the azure sky and with hurrying white horses below and towering cumulus rising above their sea world was a contrasting study in blue and white on the sundappled main deck petit paused in his seaming yez knows what this means kydd looked up and waited these are the trade winds n that means we now got africa ter larbd it was a thought to conjure with the fabled dark continent its interior unknown to mankind jungle and swamp the whole mystery lying just over there from where the winds were blowing kydd was seized with a yearning to glimpse it just once the weather grew from warm to hot pitch between the deck planking became sticky to the touch where the sun beat down on it and kydd had to cover his torso with an open shirt his bare feet had long ago become strong and toughened below decks it was too hot to sleep kydd and renzi sat on the focsle off watch renzi with his clay pipe drawing contentedly and kydd staring up dreamily the stars were out and of such brilliance they appeared low enough to touch along the eastern horizon however was a dark line curious they watched it take shape as the hours wore on it extended gradually on both sides and fattened to a bank of darkness lightning played within it a continuous flickering that illuminated tiny details of the cloud mass in tawny gold the heat of the day was still with them the air breathy heavy they looked towards the bank idly fascinated by the primeval sight it was now moving towards them from the beam as it drew nearer the distant flashes of lightning became more separated and distinct and after a long interval an answering sullen rumbling of thunder could be heard floating towards them over the water all the hands all hands on deck haaaaands to shorten sail there was no apparent change in the immediate weather the wind was the same streaming easterly but for the first time kydd could detect a scent a heavy humid rankness of rotten vegetation and stagnant pools the heady fragrance of africa they took in courses then topsails powlett it seemed would not be satisfied until the yards were at the cap and all they showed were staysails foreandaft their speed fell off and the roll of the ship changed in character the atlantic swell passed them by to leave the ship wallowing in long jerky movements an unsettling sensation for a fast frigate drawing closer the dense cloud bank increased in height and width its dark pall gradually snuffing out the stars until it loomed high over them men did not return below they lined the side and watched the lightning became more spectacular the thunder a spiteful crack and pealing roar then came a darkness more intense than ever kydd felt something elemental stealing over him the towers of blackness glowered moody and threatening fat with menace the wind died in the calm the flashing and banging of the lightning filled the senses there was a breathless pause as the last stars flickered out overhead in the ominous calm it seemed that the fluky winds were in dispute for the right to turn on their prey a gust then others the wind picked up in violent shifting squalls sending kydd staggering the wall of blackness raced across towards them and they were hit in an instant it seemed as if the heavens were afire the lightning coalesced into one blinding earsplitting blast of thunder which ripped the air apart the squalls tore at kydds grip in a nightmare buffeting and all he could do was stand rigid stupefied the ship reared and shied like a frightened horse deafening volleys of thunder entering the fabric of the vessel transmitting through to his feet worse by far than any broadside the sound smashed at his senses he fumbled for halfremembered prayers they josded in his mind but focus was impossible under the assault and the rain came down walls of warm gusting tropical rain in quantities so huge that it forced kydd down as though he were caught in a waterfall breathing was almost impossible and he lowered his head to avoid the worst of the water tumbling down on him hair streaming clothes plastered to his body his mind went numb it went on and on the ship trembling and directionless heading for who knew what inevitable destruction kydd felt a grip on his arm through blurred vision he saw renzi and to his astonishment realised that the man was laughing he felt anger welling up an indignant resentment that renzi was enjoying the experience no doubt adding it to his store of philosophic curiosities he tore away his arm and resumed his posture of endurance but it was no good the spell had been broken reluctantly he had to concede that if modern learning could proof a man against natures bluster then perhaps it had some merit he looked up again and grinned slowly the heavens rattled and roared but in some way the storms sting had been drawn and within the hour its fury had moderated the rain petered out and the blackness began to dissolve the lightning spending itself in vicious flickers that whipcracked right across the sky the last of the darkness was passing overhead rueful soaked figures fumbled about on the streaming decks haaaands to make sail kydd moved to the larboard foreshrouds and swung himself up for the climb into the foretop but before he had risen a dozen feet there was a single dazzling flash and a clap of thunder so tremendous that it shook the ship with its concussion deafened he clung to the shrouds shaking his head to clear it as his eyes tried to adjust to the dark and his ears stopped buzzing he became aware of a commotion on the opposite side the shrouds there gave off wisps of steam along their length still muzzy from the shock of the discharge kydd couldnt understand then he realised there had been one last spiteful play of lightning and it had struck the foremast but by chance had passed down the opposite shrouds to the iron of an anchor and into the sea trembling at the thought of his near escape from an unspeakably violent death kydd dropped to the deck and went over to see the results of the strike the lines of rigging were randomly patterned with steaming black above still clinging to the shrouds were the silhouettes of three men ominously still others climbed up beside them there were shouts highstrung and chilling kydd knew with a sinking inevitability what they had found by the light of a lanthorn they crowded round the stiff discoloured corpses as they were lowered down even the eyeballs had burst in the white heat and the bodies had swollen to grotesque proportions there was the sound of retching before canvas was brought to cover the indecency dying rumbles followed the black mass as it fell away to leeward as rapidly as it had approached leaving the stars to resume their calm display no me boy we sank africa astern three five days ago said merrydew for him the heat was a trial his corpulent figure sweaty his movements slow and reluctant kydd found it confusing from his barely remembered geography lessons he recalled that africa was a fat pear shape running north and south if they were to round its southern tip to reach india why were they heading away because were makin a westing thats why the boatswain explained to kydd it seemed as nonsensical as ever patiently merrydew carried on these latitudes why much further the wind gives up altogether none to be had bad we calls it the doldrums we wants to avoid em so we makes a slant over to t other side o the ocean afore it gets too bad we then crosses the line into the south half o the world and slants back with an opposite wind see it was wearisome life in the tropics aboard a frigate the hardest thing was the intense humidity below decks only partly relieved by wind scoops at the hatches the next most difficult thing to bear was the food their molasses ran out and the morning burgoo tasted of what it was oatmeal months in the sack malodorous and lacking flavour but for the insect droppings quashee did his best with the little store of conveniences occasionally reaching heights of excellence in the flyingfish belt he produced a legendary gazy pie the little fish heads peeping up through the crust all around and flavoured with hoarded garnishings the wind had been light and erratic for days now a trying time when the hauling on lines had to be done under a near vertical sun beating down which blasted back at them from the water one morning the wind died away entirely the sea disturbed only by a long but slight swell the heat was close to intolerable despite the awnings and the boatswains red face swelled the sails hung in folds from the yards barely moving the ship with a sluggish roll was without any kind of steerage way artemis drifted aimlessly in the mirrorlike sea nobody spoke it cost too much effort at three in the afternoon a flaw of wind darkened the water on the quarterdeck powlett in his thin threadbare shirt looked meaningfully at the figure of the master it was what they had been waiting for a wind but from the southeast they had already reached the winds of the south the change in spirits aboard artemis was remarkable although they had to wait until evening for the winds to reach a point where the sails began to fill and the rudder to bite all talk was on the future got our slant gonna be shakin hands with them kidderpore fillies in a month hassiiming that we get in afore the monsoon shifts about happy chatter swelled but petit remained serious as he cradled his pot anythin amiss elias mate stirk asked his powerful body was as usual naked from the waist up an expanse of damp mahogany muscle yes mate petit replied quietly the talking stopped and the group on the focsle looked over at him in the lanthorn light how so cuffin stirk said softly you knows toby youse a manowars man an unnerstands stirk didnt reply but a frown lined his face recollect shipmate were in th south now and we aint never had a visit from is majesty stirks face eased fractionally but o course he murmured when kydd looked again he had disappeared it looked as though the wind would hold the morning breeze had stayed and strengthened just a little and with the lightest possible canvas spread abroad they were making progress powlett stood with his arms folded squinting up at the undulating sails as they played with the breeze the master was next to him willing on the winds kydd was tricing up the after end of the quarterdeck awning and could hear the pleased conversations whatever was in those secret orders he guessed they must include every stricture for speed the boatswain came aft and touched his hat sir he said with m duty just found this paper near the quarterdeck nettings thought youd want t sight it taking the paper powletts face hardened the ploy was often used to allow crew members to convey discontents anonymously aft he read on his expression grim king neptune its a nonsense mr merrydew he roared the boatswain stiffened and a damnable impertinence powlett snapped and ripped the paper in two the pieces fluttered to the deck the boatswains chin jutted belligerently the customs of the sea service were not so easily to be put aside turning to the master powlett said loudly mr prewse pray tell us our position rubbing his chin prewse looked up at the sky well sir near enough our position sir our longitude was thirtytwo degree an seventeen minutes west noon yesterday latitude mr prewse an nought degrees an fiftyfour minutes north powlett whirled back on the boatswain there you are north do you propose sir that we enter king neptunes realm early that is to say precipitate like a damnfool set o canting lubbers who cant work a sea position to save their skins the boatswains face eased into a smile aye sir wed best not set his majesty at defiance kydd could hardly wait to relay the conversation to the mess who were taking their victuals in the shade of the main deck yair well its no small thing mate to enter hupon his realm petit said portentously cundall leered evilly at kydd an its bad days fer them oo avent been welcomed inta it yet realising that he would be made sport of whatever he did kydd just smiled douds grin was devilish his gaze slid to quashee who winked at him and he affected a kind considerate manner could be the best fer any who dont know the rules to steer a mite clear of the ceremonies he told kydd is majesty dont stand fer no contempt ter his person kydd resolved to be conveniently absent when king neptune came aboard should be hearin from im soon stirk said his black eyes glittering at kydd oo is it that aint been admitted to is kingdom then that night at seven bells of the first watch artemis was boarded by a messenger from king neptune himself or at least a man looking just like a ragged sea sprite and dripping seawater suddenly appeared before the starboard focsle lookout from outboard clambering rudely over the fife rail what ship was demanded and when the hapless lookout stuttered an answer he was pelted with a rotten fish down yer scurvy shab make yer respects to one o king neptunes crew the officerofthewatch was summoned it was rowley he doffed his hat and courteously enquired of the stranger is majesty requires of yer a list of all oo have not yet bin truly welcomed inter his realm the officer was told in lordly tones by this time curious sightseers had gathered around including some from the wardroom of course said rowley but i beg you be so good as to take a glass while you wait a rummer of brandy will i believe keep the damp from your bones well satisfied but grumbling mightily the sprite later eased himself over the rail and disappeared on the following forenoon the masthead lookout hailed the deck sail ho strange sail right ahead standin fer the ship what ship more like a boat wi a lugsail telescopes flashed on the quarterdeck the boatswain turned importantly to the captain and said its very like king neptune sir very well said powlett make ready his carriage heave to and prepare a welcome mr parry the boat was secured to the forechains and king neptune was swayed aboard in a chair suspended from a whip rove at the foreyardarm followed shortly by his wife his courtiers scrambled up the side and quickly took possession of the foredeck they were a motley crew rigged in a wild assortment of regalia coloured rags and old sailcloth decorated with seaweed seagull feathers and wigs of oakum the kings conveyance turned out to be a twelvepounder gun carriage with a suitably comfortable leatherbound chair lashed to it neptune assumed his rightful position acknowledging the murmurs of awe in regal fashion with his trident captain powlett hurried to greet his august visitors making a fine leg with his goldlaced hat sweeping down well pleased are we your majesty that you have deigned to welcome us pray accept a glass of western ocean punch neptune was certainly an imperious sight a mighty beard of tarred oakum long flowing wig striped toga a trident and flaring golden crown the glass was immediately to hand and after draining it in one the king addressed the party in a deep rich voice what ship artemis frigate s please your majesty replied powlett in his usual worn shirt but with his goldlaced cocked hat in honour of the occasion whither bound demanded king neptune an expectant hush fell to the far indee the land of the peacock and elephant rubies and gold answered powlett what do ye there neptune would answer to his shipmates later were he to pass up his chance powletts eyes glinted nothing that would interest the puissant sovereign of all the seas he growled neptunes wife adjusted her breasts now dear we mustnt be late for the mermaids dance she said in a beautiful falsetto that only a singers voice like douds could produce in her long flowing hair of teasedout manila cheeks thick with red ochre and petticoat of yellow bunting she drew admiring looks which she played upon shamelessly coquettishly she fingered the kings chain of office a string of seashells and the crowd roared badger bag neptune thundered his chamberlain stepped forward an unmistakable hard figure with glittering black eyes under the fish scales and sacking sire yon land toggies have no respec for my royal person neptune gestured angrily at the grinning officers badger bag reached into his large sack but there was no need the officers hurried to render elaborate obeisance to his oceanic majesty is my court prepared neptune demanded of course your majesty said powlett then forward flogged on by badger bag with a ropes end of stout sargasso seaweed and with the maximum of horseplay his courtiers trundled the haughty neptune aft to the main jeer bitts where his grand throne of a cunningly sawn large cask took pride of place wheres is sea badger bag demanded outraged quickly a kid filled with seawater was brought and neptune sat on his throne with a theatrical sigh able to keep his feet at the very least in his natural element western ocean punch flowed freely it would be a sad thing indeed if artemis could not right royally entertain their regal guests neptune wiped his mouth after his third glass dislodging his beard somewhat and revealing that his black complexion owed more to nature than artifice king neptune is black an amused rowley said to badger bag o course was the reply is majesty is in mournin fer his first wife caught a mortal chill off the newfie banks sucklin their child es minded ter blockade the shetlands an force the mermaids ter suckle the next one for his temerity rowley was struck roundly on the ear with a large fish drawn from the sack avast bellowed neptune bring forth the pollywogs badger bag fumbled in his sack and extracted a parchment midshipman titmuss he thundered the youth in question a dreamy boy with golden curls was set upon by his assistants the bears who hauled him forward is this scrawny mortal worthy of entry to my realm neptune demanded stands accused of leavin his mama aweepin on land while he sails orf over the briny deep badger bag said an seen ter take soft tommy when e couldve supped on hardtack he continued remorselessly the bears began capering immediately guilty guilty they crowed scampering about the deck hold neptune said in m mercy he shall be admitted but not in them there awful whiskers shave im the golden down could hardly be termed whiskers but nevertheless a blindfold was clapped on and the youth frogmarched to the after end of the quarterdeck where a huge canvas tub of seawater waited he was guided to a chair on the edge of the tub a bucket of water was dashed into his face and the bears set to work with large wooden razors and carpenters paste mixed with rancid butter the youth struggled and yelled in desperation but it only resulted in his mouth being choked with more of the foaming paste at the height of his struggles the chair was tipped over and the victim tumbled into the water others were summoned and given summary justice varying in their reactions from resignation to fighting like tigers but all ending the same way water flying everywhere and not least upon the bystanders neptune sat back enjoying his judgements but suddenly he stood up and nourished his trident that man there he said pointing at lieutenant parry he smiled knowing looks were exchanged the dour parry was tight and grim in his dealings humourless to a degree but contempt of court could not be lightly dismissed this would be interesting therefore he must be sick the court fell about in laughter summon my doctor an elderly bear slightly the worse for wear and western ocean punch swayed forward what have you ter cure is mullygrubs neptune ordered the bear blinked and then leered pulling out a dark green bottle thisll cure anythin sire the bears closed in party drew himself up his jaw hard enough hold your nonsense you swabs to the bears who had seen him enjoy the torments of others this was an invitation parry looked despairingly at powlett who seemed suddenly interested in the condition of the mizzen staysail downhaul sir he called but it ended in a yelp as he was borne to the deck by weight of numbers and to the cheers and delight of the court was helped to liberal doses of saline the jollity increased buckets of water strategically placed in the rigging and operated by a twine tripline ensured that those looking to escape by keeping clear of the scrimmage received attention as well from his hiding place in the forepeak kydd thought the world had gone mad sitting cramped on smelly sea stores in the stifling heat he heard the roars and unknown thuds and rushes overhead at least he felt safe where he was a place kindly suggested by doud the only entrance was through a small hatch when a thump of feet sounded above he waited for them to pass but the hatch was thrown open and four bears with evil grins looked down on him what kydd hadnt reckoned on was the jigger tackle they had brought which made easy meat of hauling out their victim he flailed wildly as they hoisted him out but his struggles were ineffective he was blindfolded and manhandled on deck to the riotous applause of the court seated in the chair of justice the dread tones of badger bag sonorously announced his misdeeds did fail to wind up the middle watch in course o which his shipmates did double tides guilty guilty slurred the gleeful bears how dare he appear before me li that the punch was having its effect on neptune also his wife now had baby amphitrite to comfort which she did vigorously then dangled the odd creature from her harpoon needing no prompting the barbers crew went into action the shock of the seawater thrown in his face made kydd open his mouth in protest this was all they needed and kydd found himself choking on a revolting paste hold called neptune barely heard by the helpless kydd case dismissd on account es a iggerant pollywog he ordered relieved kydd tried to remove his blindfold but was stopped no cully this way he was guided to a plank spanning the water tub and ordered to cross after some perilous swaying kydd found himself inevitably plunging in a generous tankard of punch was thrust at him as he surfaced and the merriment transferred to the next victim leaving kydd rueful but relieved he drank deeply and noticed renzi also soaked and dishevelled they roared with laughter together the rampageous saturnalia cleared the air and it was a happy ship that caught the next mornings breeze when they resumed their southward plunge through deep blue seas and cloudless skies the frigate made magnificent sailing the southeasterly trade winds strong and sure an exhilarating sail day after sunlit day tight to the wind with bowlines on courses and topsails with six months sea endurance and a good amount of water from rainstorms artemis had no need to touch at the cape the only indication they had of reaching the southern tip of africa was when within a few days of each other the southeasterlies had diminished the chill benguela current had turned the sea from blue to green and the globeencircling westerlies had taken them in hand they entered the great southern ocean and for nearly a week they foamed along before the wind marvelling at the massive undulating swells and the albatross that followed in their wake barely moving staying aloft day after day when at last they altered course northward the masters face cracked into a smile and he and powlett were seen to shake hands they were in time to catch the last of the summer monsoon to speed them on to their destination as they passed deeper into the indian ocean it seemed an anticlimax sighting madagascar a faint bluegrey smudge far away to larboard they crossed the line to the north once more but this time under a full press of sail it couldnt last however some days from their destination after a particularly unpleasant tropical storm they emerged into different airs the heavy humidity and sultry heat had been replaced by a definite coolness and the sky was a pearly cast of uniform dull lightness the wind had changed from the urging southwesterly to a light breathy breeze in their teeth from the northeast artemis braced up sharp but it would not answer she had a foul wind for calcutta and must tack against the wind in long boards alternately their rate of advance now cut by more than half it was becoming a souldeadening tedium as they worked closer to their goal they glimpsed tantalising promises of their fabled destination the floating remains of palm trees a pair of vultures soaring out from the deccan the bloated body of a water buffalo all were exotica to marvel over nearer still ships were sighted daily stately indiamen the first of the winter monsoon trading season putting to sea with precious darjeeling tea humbler traders with jute and warlike vessels crammed with opium on their way to the far orient there were also arab dhows their sweeping diagonal sail and rickety hull looking curious to an atlantic seaman and there were other even stranger coastal craft it was enthralling kydd was excited by the sights and couldnt wait to see his first truly foreign shore heard th master say we should raise land in a coupla days doud said idly the cool damp even reached down into the berth deck and where it was allowed to remain mould grew and made objects slimy and rank an not before time kydd said it felt a lifetime since they had left england under sail the entire time watch by watch the days passing in regular progression days weeks months at sea until he knew every part of the ship with an intimacy he had never thought possible be good t know how things are at home he mused cundall laughed sharply don be stoopid only way they gonna have word here is with the noospapers we took aboard in spithead kydd resented cundalls tone but he was the only one of the mess who had been to india before and kydd had questions for him renzi stirred fascinating in the months weve been at sea anything could have happened the war might even now be over king louis avenged and yet like ripples on a pond we are our own news so yerve been this way before cundall petit said it was curious kydd thought that nobody called him anything else yair bin here once or twice he replied smugly yer like it petit persisted cundalls pot went forward meaningfully petit filled it and listened aye its a rare enough place ter step ashore more o them injuns yerll ever dream ter see thousands of em an all dirt poor n poxy yer falls over em in the street yer hears em yak away in this eathen talk place is jus swarming with em kydd took it in but his mind was on the wonders of calicut thought it had these golden temples an elephants n heathen idols an things he said yeah well they has them as well o course but this i tell yer now here the cuntkins are yours fer a coupla annas fer a short time an they knows all about it mates nuthin they dont know he winked an best o it is theyre all young bantlings all no moren ten twelve years tight as yerll get an all tricked out in this fancy long red n gold he licked his lips unconsciously causing a wave of revulsion in kydd cundall mistook the look and continued dont worry they knows all th tricks jus like th old uns the talk petered out most simply wanting to get ashore and see for themselves vaguely unsatisfied kydd got up and left he reached the upper deck just as dusk settled in somewhere over the horizon was india and very soon he would be the only one of his family to know an exotic shore chapter two mornings later the foredeck was crowded with men when they raised land kydd watched as it took form over the horizon this land rimming the northern reaches was lowlying in fact so low that not a single mountain or even hill disturbed its monotonous green flatness as they drew nearer kydds eyes searched in vain for some evidence of the fabled east but all that was in prospect was the vast estuary of the khakicoloured river up which they were headed and the green of endless vegetation the great river was several miles across but as its banks approached on either side kydd had a closer view its promise still failed to materialise the river was swarming with small craft strange but decrepit and the lush green just went on and on at a wide bend in the river the order to moor ship was passed and when they made it around they saw lines of vessels at anchor along the outer bank this was as far as oceangoing vessels could venture artemis glided to a stop and the anchor splashed into the turbid water almost immediately she drifted downstream in the tumbling muddy current and when she came to her anchor the frigate snubbed to the cable sharply and swung to face unwaveringly upstream after nearly two months of sea and more than ten thousand sea miles artemis was finally at rest kydd joined the others aloft furling the sails to his exasperation there was no sign whatsoever of anything that could remotely be termed fabulous from this height he could see the tops of palm trees stretching unendingly away the odd clearing here and there while nearby the duncoloured tops of huts peeped above the sea of green he could make out no elephants or palaces still less any exotic girls on deck a damp heat had descended on the stationary vessel now so quiet that the restless whispering of the rivers passage past and the harsh crying of a bird was all that intruded as if by magic river trading craft garish colours on their canopies and peeling sides appeared from nowhere making for the newmoored ship the boarding nettings were quickly rigged and hung below the line of gunports opened to the sullen airs the craft lay off waiting it out wiping his forehead kydd watched renzi staring out is this your east nicholas he asked ruefully renzi grinned apparently the city lies more than a hundred miles beyond up the hooghly to its confluence with another river that trip would set your gosport boatman at a stand i believe scratching at his itching body renzi felt similarly cheated privately he was excited he would see the native peacock the golden domes of the hindoo and the naked holy man but here kydds mind ran on more practical lines so we are to warp upstream a hundred miles i think not then what are we here for renzi said perplexed we have arrived and not arrived this is vexatious in the extreme on the quarterdeck the captain and a midshipman stood next to a small amount of baggage a sudden flurry from the waiting craft followed the boatswains signal and one was permitted to come alongside to pick up the officers now theres a thing renzi said looking intensely at the boat shoving off its odd sail rising up the mast in rapid jerks a sudden pealing of boatswains calls broke out all haaaandsall the hands hands to store ship hatches to open right down to the hold yardarm stay tackles parbuckles all the preparations for storing ship what was going on why the hurry kydd could see no point in it ships usually took the opportunity after a long voyage to refit and repair and of course sailors relaxed ashore yet here they were preparing to lay in stores as though their lives depended on it what did the captains rapid departure mean parrys scowling face on the quarterdeck gave no sign and by the time the first storeships arrived kydd was none the wiser these were flat barges fitted with long sweeps creeping around the bend like waterbeetles kydd watched as they approached not at all looking forward to labouring work in the clammy closeness the barges secured alongside several abreast and gangplanks were placed over them to the ships side hey you kydd it was gant the tall boatswains mate didnt ya hear stand fast topmen he grinned you swabs are gonna fettle the barky ready for sea agen relieved kydd joined renzi at the splicing pointing and rereeving of lines which were jobs requiring real seamanship skills and left the rest of artemisscrew to the storing it seemed that rumour had substance they would put to sea before long but it stood to reason that they would be given time ashore first long lines of greybrown lascar stevedores patiently padded over the gangplanks bringing their heavy loads aboard kydd looked at them curiously lean impossibly stringy there was not the slightest bit of fat on them their eyes showed no interest no recognisable humanity he could relate to they simply plodded on in regular economic movements renzi went below to find some rope yarn and kydd lost interest in the stream of brown figures and pressed on with his work if yerd help us friend oid be roight grateful a hoarse voice said kydd looked up sharply but there was no one only the stream of lascars under the watchful eye of their serang he looked around warily if that was a joke it was a pitiful attempt he shrugged and continued at his marline spike and splice loike weem desperate the hoarse voice was close very close kydd stood up angrily the boatswain arrived from below puffing like a grampus he stood at the rail gathering his breath and watched the line of native labourers that slivey dog he said to kydd no tother one mark his motions lazy fellow thinks to take it easy an he so well fed the lascar indicated was indeed better nourished than the others instead of the sculpted angular ridges of hardness there was a definite rounding of flesh possibly the man was of superior caste hey you the serang the boatswain shouted across at the overseer jowla jowla him he ordered pointing at the offending individual the serang looked at him doubtfully and raising his rattan gently rapped the man over his naked shoulders good christ the boatswain said in astonishment that wouldnt wake a sleepin dog he snorted in disgust and stumped off below again curiously kydd watched the lascar trudge to the barge lift a bale of dry goods awkwardly to his shoulders and turn to trace his steps over the gangplank and back aboard as the man came over the bulwark he saw kydd and stumbled on a ringbolt the bale came down bouncing along the deck fetching up against the hatch coaming their eyes met and kydd saw real fear kydd got to his feet you savvy no one hurtee you this ship he said loudly the man looked at him then seized the bale and dragged it over thank chroist the lascar said oim bleedin well at tend of me senses snatching up a ropes end kydd slashed him over the shoulders wha the lascar cried piteously shut up n move kydd hissed driving the man down the forecompanion to the gundeck he pushed him past the canvas screening that concealed the sick quarters in the bow he knew the three sick had been landed and the space was clear he spun the man round savagely ive heard o men doin things t run but this is the first i heard someone wantin so bad to get emselves aboard a kings ship crumpling to his knees the mans voice caught in a sob s help me frien oi don know how t thank ye his brimming eyes looked up at kydd taking a gulp he continued fort william tis a hellhole loike yer worst dreams oi joined t foller the colours an a shillin a day not sweat in this black stinkpit his face worked in a sudden paroxysm this nows the cool o the seasons while yer wait fer the monsoon t break whoi its hotter n a griddle in hell an full uniform on parade or sarnt askinsll ave yer his head dropped and he stared hopelessly at the deck kydd thought quickly we sails soon need t get ye out o sight his eyes strayed over the mans dark skin how would it be possible to conceal such a colour no idea where were bound but y can get ashore easy enough we got no pressed men aboard the man caught kydds look ah me dark skin walnut juice kydd smiled wait here look oi know this looks bad but yeve got t unnerstan what its loike clapping him on the arm kydd stepped outside he cannoned into a lascar waiting there who had obviously followed them down he gestured at the fore ladder up you gettee up there eard what yer said ter ralf began the lascar kydd groaned not you as well he should have known by the pale eyes incongruous in the dark brown face well yeah but only the pair o us mate ralf bunce and me scrufty weems the man said get in there with y chuckleheaded frien kydd told him and shoved him forward to his credit renzi only hesitated a moment when kydd told him aiding a deserter was a botany bay offence in england here it might be worse there was no way the soldiers could mix in with the two hundred odd of the ships company for every face was familiar after the long voyage they would have to be found a hideyhole until they made port the orlop renzi suggested no mate o the hold checks every forenoon bound t find anything askew kydd remembered his hiding place from king neptunes bears the forepeak in this heat have mercy tom however even for this the soldiers proved pathetically grateful and dropped down the tiny hatch into the malodorous darkness without a word storing complete the ships company looked forward to liberty ashore but instead they were set to scraping and scrubbing painting and prettying in a senseless round of work that sorely tried their patience tales of shoreside in india grew in the telling but parry gave not an inch the ship was to gleam and that was that kydd and renzi knew it was impossible to keep their secret from their shipmates the others found it amusing that deserters from the army thought they could find sanctuary in a manowar but in the generous way of sailors they made their guests welcome immured in the forepeak during the day they could creep up to the focsle under cover of dark and join the sailors in a grog or two they talked about the boredom and heat the dust and disease of a cantonment on the plains of india they told also of their struggle to the coast and their final bribing of the serang and his confusion when told to beat a white man the sailors heard of the other side of life in india the bazaars and what could be bought there the heartless cruelty of the suttee funeral pyre and the deadly thuggees their desire for shore leave diminished bunce heard kydd recall his experience on their first morning at anchor sent down as part of the duty watch to clear the hawse he had looked over the side of the beakhead forward and seen an untidy bundle wrapped around the anchor cable he had slid down to clear it away but closer to it took form a grossly misshapen corpse bleached a chalky white barely recognisable as a young woman it belched pungent death smells when he tried to pry it away the sickly gases catching kydd in the back of the throat and there were ragged holes in the face where the kites had been tearing at it when he prodded with a boat hook parts of it detached floating away in the muddy river every day there were always one or two to clear like it bunce had just nodded when y dies in india proper drill is t burn th body on a pile o wood but theres some uz are so dirt poor they has t wait until dark an then they heaves their loved un in th river the seamen no stranger themselves to hardships shuddered and vowed to see their guests safely ashore in some haven far away rather than return them to such horrors two days later when the captain returned he immediately disappeared below with fairfax within the hour boatswains mates were piping at the hatchways clear lower deck all the hands haaaands t lay aft the rush to hear the news caused pandemonium but powletts appearance on deck brought an immediate expectant hush he turned meaningfully to the sergeant in charge of marines sergeant sah a sentry at the boats another on the focsle no one to leave or board the ship without my express permission sah unbelieving looks and an exasperated grumbling spread over the assembly silence powlett roared the muttering died down he stood near the deserted wheel with a forbidding expression i am now able to tell you of our mission and why we have been at such pains with our ship he paused and let his words sink into the silence artemis has been honoured to be chosen as the vessel to convey a special envoy from his majesty king george to the emperor of china in peking chapter that evening lord elmhurst and his retinue arrived plunging the manowar into a state of confusion eighteen souls was more than it seemed possible to cram into the spaces aft all officers lost their cabins but even so with lady elmhurst her daughter and maids to find privacy for it was a near insurmountable task fairfax hurried about late into the night pursued by the shrill demanding voice of lady elmhurst the seamen retired to the forward end of the ship and let the upheaval spend itself there would be no interference in their way of life although in deference to the quality aboard they would have to don shirts and for the time being forswear curses the frigate would sail in the morning at first light ready or not for there was no time to lose there would be no touching at land en route their first port of call would be canton in south china the only touching point allowed for vessels trading with china it hardly seemed credible a voyage to china there was no more distant or exotic land there were few aboard who had ever been as far east as this at dawn the anchor was won from the sticky mud what followed was a particularly difficult and perilous piece of seamanship the problem was the rapid current the hooghly was wide enough but with so many other vessels at anchor it was necessary to get control on the ship as fast as possible after she was freed of the ground but she had a leeward tide the northerly monsoon wind was in the same direction that the current was drifting the ship this meant that although they were moving smartly relative to the river bottom they were not actually moving through the water the rudder therefore could not bite and the ship had no steerage way she would drift away out of control in the crowded fairway the solution was not obvious and powletts seamanship caused dismay to some but a growing respect from others with topgallants and courses hanging in the brails the frigate set topsails jib and driver with the main topsail backed trimmed this way artemis drifted broadside to the current apparently helpless but at every obstruction an anchored vessel or a creeping line of barges either the foretopmast staysail forward would be hoisted or the driver aft would be hauled out this would send artemis slowly across the breadth of the river and the hazard would be cleared for those spectators on deck it was a tense time but where the estuary widened as it met the sea the current slowed and it was then possible to cast to the right tack and shape their course at last outward bound passing the sandheads and with the mangroves and lush jungle slipping away astern the deck began to crowd with strangers and parasols chattering and promenading an amazing thing in a warship once again the harried fairfax made the rounds and the sightseers were given to understand that their territory would be aft around the wheel and the neat expanse of the quarterdeck abaft the tall figure of the dour and abstemious lord elmhurst was easy to spot pacing slowly in conversation with powlett obstinately in full breeches and frock coat in defiance of sea conventions lady elmhurst a somewhat mannish figure with a fan constantly at work always seemed to be the centre of attention a formidable woman who looked quite as capable as her husband once in the open sea artemis hove to drifting quietly as she waited for the stately east indiaman that would accompany them with the rest of the envoys entourage the walmer castle emerged from the hooghly and stiffly acknowledged their presence as she fell in astern the two vessels foamed ahead at the end of the afternoon watch kydd went to go below but renzi caught his sleeve you will scarcely credit what i have been able to borrow kydd had not seen him the whole afternoon but guessed where he had been what have you got then shipmate a treatment of the metaphysick of china in four volumes he said triumphantly it had cost him dear an hour of sympathetic weaselling of a crabbed old savant but it was a thousand times worth it there are learned men and counsellors in the entourage sadly overlooked he sighed happily now i shall know the truth of the soulstealers of the kao hsuang and the greatness of the saindy confucius kydd couldnt help smiling he had never seen renzi so animated and was happy for him no doubt in the fullness of time there would be a watch on deck in the tropical dusk and he would hear renzi exploring these philosophies he would use kydd as a foil to worry happily over some arcane point and then with dawning comprehension kydd would see it slowly unfold into an important point and then a great truth and they would both end up deeply satisfied they clattered down the fore hatchway for their evening meal pleased to be away from the deck with its highborn passengers and awkward atmosphere hey wong how dye say in chinee come under mlee me lovely an ill steer ye fer a safe port wong mate is there a reglarbuilt tavern be chance in peking tell us do yer chinee fillies like it you know wong sat rigid a dogged frown on his glistening face suddenly he slammed his fist on the table and shouted hoarsely da choh lei kau tikthe mess table subsided woulda thought hed be happier the sad dog doud said in puzzlement goin to visit his folks like wong rose knocking over the other seamen of the mess on his way back on deck heathen prick cundall snorted kydd saw that wong had more than paying a call on his family on his mind normally impervious to lowerdeck banter he was now touchy and morose we got other things t consider right now mates kydd said seriously they looked at him yon lobsterback friends o ours he said in the tropics the men could not survive for long in the stifling heat of the forepeak and strangers aboard would be spotted as soon as they set foot on deck hell ave ter set em ashore first port o call o course cundall said dismissively yeah which is china aint it doud retorted nah he strings em up as army deserters o course what wi women aboard ter see dont give me that hell ave t put em in bilboes an send em back fust ship he sees said petit steerage as all the women in anyways dye like ter ave them trippin over the condemned men every time they goes topside condemned yair in course they gets topped soon as they gets sent back ter the barracks kydd leaned forward not if black jack dont know look we finds em in the forepeak theyre stowaways see wants to ship in artemis cos theyve heard were famous an wants a piece o the prize money what prize money grunted cundall we rigs em in sailors gear teaches em the lingo and ill wager black jackll snap em up doud laughed yeah he could at that we landed sick moren a brace at calcutta petit looked doubtful aye but yknows that a sojer is always a sojer how then are yer goin ter make sailors outa them the breeze freshened on the open ocean and the blue sea with its hurrying white horses seemed to sense the urgency of the mission the frigates movements became more lively a barrelling roll in the following wind and sea and the deck gradually cleared of passengers returning to its usual seamanlike expanse revelling in the crispness of the air after the heavy humidity kydd went forward they loped along under easy sail down the long swells of the ocean the indiaman trying its best two miles astern kydd went to the ornate voluted beakhead and leaned on the rail below him the bowwave foamed and roared a broad swash of white spreading out each side from the stem the figurehead the chaste white figure of artemis thrust out a hunting bow as if to urge the rest of the ship to follow a splendid icon for a prime predator of the seas the sea was much closer than in his previous ship the big threedecker and the sensation of speed was thrilling everything about the frigate suggested speed her sails were perfectly cut to the yards and sheeted in so taut they hardly bellied her clean lines resulted in a finedrawn wake and the jib and fore staysails flying down to the bowspritseemed to arrow the ship forward reluctantly kydd made his way back this was his favourite place he stepped behind the canvas screen of the sickbay and groaned at the sight of the two soldiers now y please to pay attention they looked eagerly up at him from their crosslegged position y didnt do so well on th last sea word i gave ye heres a new one see if y can do a bit better show th captain how you know y ropes their guileless expressions made kydd sigh but he persevered th word start we uses it with care fr it has moren one meaning if we use it about a cask o water this means t empty it see but if we talks about our anchor then o course it means to move it a piece an to start bread has the meaning fr us to turn it out of its bags and casks an stow it together in bulk but when we talks about t start a buttend of a plank why thats serious it means that the seas have sprung it an were takin in water fast kydd tried to ignore their glassy stares on deck if we starts the tack or sheet it means t loosen it like raise tacks an sheets when we goes about an the carpenter when he wants t move a contrary bolt he starts it with a starting bolt scrufty weems muttered if this is yer start then god elp us at the finish an if youre slack in yr ways on deck you cn be sure theres a bosuns matell start ye with his ropes end sure enough kydd knew they had to get the two soldiers before the captain very shortly for any real stowaways would have shown themselves as soon as the ship reached the open sea now cn ye tell me what are the sea watches in order startin with the middle watch with the northerly monsoon driving boisterously at them from astern and the positive effect of the clockwise ocean vortex of the bay of bengal they made excellent time south aiming for the malacca strait the narrowing passage between malaya and sumatra down y scurvy dogs kydd thrust the two soldiers at the feet of captain powlett who had just begun his morning pace of the quarterdeck what the devil bunce and weems had on old sailors gear but their walnut juice disguise had faded to a scrofulous blotchy streaking stowaways found em in the forepeak sir powlett stared the men got to their feet staggered slightly at a playful heave of the deck but touched their foreheads smartly enough aye sir weem from the old mary jane brig n we want t be part of the crew o the famous artemis powlett glowered so you thought to desert your shipmates and join the kings service when it suited you whoy no sir bunce replied the boat is in er ballst waitin this two month fer a cargo an were rare flummoxed as t how to get out ter sea agen what rate are you sir kydd said quickly claims theyre able seamen sir oh yez thats what we are then said bunce then be so kind as to climb the larbd mizzen shrouds and touch the crojick tye block said powlett lazily bunce caught kydds hurried hand signal ah we would er do that ifn we wornt so bad in th back see we had to aul up on this mast thing an it did fer me back it did be roight in a coupla days i guess powletts smile thinned and you he asked weems who started with apprehension me too yer honour i wuz with im when we both did in our backs fairfax pushed forward wharf rats thats what they are he spluttered theyre no seamen we must put em ashore sir before no recollect sir we are on a mission of some delicacy powlett said no one goes ashore he paced around the pair jaw clamped we landed three sick at calcutta i must allow as the appearance of this pair is not unwelcome he stopped and a thin smile appeared mr fairfax rate these two landman but as mr kydd found them he can be responsible to see they measure up the two soldiers snapped to attention saluted smartly army fashion and doubled away forward jaw dropping powlett stared after them kydd quickly touched his hat and mumbled ill see they measure up sir and hurried after them a bare week later they had passed the new settlement of penang to larboard keeping close in with the land to catch the useful southward current and entered a different more airy kind of tropical regime the sailing master had not passed this way since his youth but his memory was sure and they sailed on confidently past malacca at almost the line of the equator they approached the southern tip of malaya artemis ghosted along in the sultry stillness preceding the usual regular dogwatch deluge under the awning aft muslin clung damply to female limbs as the women chattered excitedly exclaiming at the riot of jungle greenery and coconut palms over the still water came the clatter of wings as a covey of parrots rose into the air their squawks ignored by the troop of monkeys swinging through the dense foliage underneath enchanting said lady elmhurst i say mr prewse she said to the master have we time do you think to take a small picnic on the land over there my lady i don think it so advisable if you takes me meaning prewse said removing his old tricorne to mop his forehead no i do not at all take your meaning lady elmhurst snapped her fan increased its tempo as she turned to powlett captain powlett surely an hour or two on the land will not discommode you we have after all been cooped up in this little ship for weeks now powlett removed his cocked hat with a pleasant smile but thwacked it at his side mr prewse do you think it advisable for the ladies to step ashore in this particular place prewse rubbed his chin its a lovely part o the world that ill grant but theres a mort o bother ashore first we have the tigers the tigers this seems the tigers milady over there they runs free an you cant see em in these woods until theys on you all roarin and big teeth then theres yr snakes he paused the fan stopped biggest in th whole world they is here long as yr main yard he said quietly pointing out the largest spar in the ship hides near a brook hangin down from the tree quiet like eats a whole goat at one gulp when it comes down t drink he scratched his head then youve got yr dyaks bad joss is they nasty cannibals they are saves the head fr to decorate their homes but eats the rest on a slow fire comes down the coast fast in their threepiece canoes on y quick cos you cant see em in this spose i could land a party of marines armed seamen with ye youd have a good chance then thank you there will be no need i now recollect that my husband has impressed upon me the need for despatch we need to press on i believe once around the peninsula they were in the south china sea imperceptibly the seascape changed the glaring equatorial seas gave way to a hard cobalt blue and then by degrees as they progressed northward against the winter monsoon to a particular shade of jadegreen the fishing boats they encountered as they tacked towards the china coast were of an unknown appearance their keelless hull form more like a banana than a seaboat had a baleful multicoloured eye painted on the bow kydds seamans eye however saw that the violent bobbing and rolling was an effective method of keeping the craft dry there was not an inch of water shipped despite the considerable seas and the tiny fisherchildren were entirely at home in the tumultuous motion closer to the mountainous greygreen seaboard there were more of the strange threemasted craft their ribbed sails distinctive against the coastline the winter monsoon was cold off the sea and had the seamen rummaging in their chests for channel warmers artemis closed with the anonymous shoreline bound for the pearl river and canton their landfall in china what does it all mean nicholas kydd asked over his grog pointing at renzis book there was a real need for rum to warm the cockles the streaming northwesterly monsoon being so stern he had seen hardly anything of his friend since calcutta renzis interest in the orient was insatiable and he had spent every spare minute with his volumes and in discussion with the savants to understand this my friend you must know that the chinese have now the most mighty civilisation on this earth kydd opened his eyes wide others were not so sure and looks were exchanged youre saying as yes they can trace their history in a straight line from before the ancients of our race right up to the present emperor chien lung you may believe that in that time they have learnt something of the arts of civilisation and its size a hundred or more times ours stretches from the frozen north to the tropics and from the pacific half across all asia its amazing the people why there are so many that it is thought that one out of every three or four souls on earth is chinese the mess members paused in their meal to stare at him blankly or with troubled expressions this was not a subject that was often brought up at messtable in a manowar then tell me this mate said cundall waving his grog can in renzis face why aint they conquerd the world then if its like you said renzi recoiled from the can with faint distaste i said a mighty civilisation and that is what it is their government under the celestial emperor is a just one for it requires every officer to compete for his post by written examination every one from beadle and magistrate to general and governor this makes certain that only the very best can reach the high offices of the land and true and just governance is the sure result cundall has a point kydd pressed therefore they have disdain for lesser attempts at civilised conduct and have withdrawn from the world they have no need for its paltry achievements and so they keep the world at a distance and that is why we are quarantined in canton to keep their civilisation pure the table broke into indignant rumbling kydd snorted be damnd to the scrovy crew they got no right they have every right its beholden on us to step quietly in their land if nothing else i would not like to be the one to tread on the dragons tail sounds jus like youre one o their yeller stripe mr chinaman cundall spat the grog thickening his voice renzi looked at him speculatively the mess fell silent for renzi as an aggrieved party was still an unknown nicholas kydd began no fair question renzi looked down at the table and when his face looked up again it was with a smile touched with a degree of serious introspection a look kydd recognised immediately i do confess to a liking no a respect and honour for their metaphysick they approach matters of logic in a curious and obscure way and i am determined to learn of it at origin and i am not too proud to say that it may reveal truths that might in fact reflect ill on our own polity he drained his pot and left the final approach of the two vessels as they stood towards the coast saw a strengthening of the wind and a steepening of the waves which obliged them to shorten sail on deck foulweather gear made its appearance in the thickening spray and the few sightseers disappeared below next to the master was the stumpy figure of the justboarded china seas pilot who looked more confident than the near proximity of a rocky coast would have seemed to justify in sight there were only islands dark green with bamboo clumps interspersed with grey rocky outcrops against which the seas surged in soundless white explosions the brisk gale whipped the wavetops to an angry white leaving tiger claws in their wake and the vessels lurched awkwardly even the doughty fishing junks were retiring towards the land and the two foreign ships found themselves converging with them on an obscure passage opening up to leeward helm over artemis bore away downwind and slipped down the narrow channel between the steep sides of a large island on one side and the mainland on the other a cluster of hovels a small jetty and bobbing sampans of a tiny fishing village and they were through the seas moderated and the ship settled for the run into a fine harbour of at least five miles of roadstead sheltered on three sides apart from one or two more of the stilted fishervillages there was nothing to break the barren appearance of the steep rocky island but ahead there was a flat peninsula pointing directly at the centre of the island pray what is this place said the envoy the pilot started then gave a jerky halfbow they calls it heung kong mlord means place of the fragrant waters on account o the good waterin to be had after a long sea vyage there were masts and yards visible beyond the peninsula and lord elmhurst gestured at them it would seem that we are not the only mariners to appreciate its qualities he said well now mlord thats cos we have here a port o refuge thats good enough even fr a tai fung what they calls a regular goin hurricane hereabouts the pilot noticed the envoys eyebrows rise and hastened to add not as were likely to get one this late in th season they passed the tip of the peninsula and its scattering of huts the harbour opened up spectacularly steep islands and sea passages in a maze on all sides sampans and fishing junks passed them by with not even a curious look at the trim and deadly frigate haaaands to moor ship with best bower anchor cleared away artemis took in sail and glided to a standstill her anchor tumbling down into the jadegreen waters and leaving the manowar to her longedfor rest mr merrydew sir the boatswain touched his hat unwillingly there was much to do in a ship that had travelled so far lord elmhurst will proceed upriver to see the chinese viceroy in canton as you know the navigation is hazardous for great ships sandbars and shoals so he will instead take passage in a john company cutter we will provide the crew find five men you know are reliable and tell them to muster in the waist at six bells in their best rig powletts head thrust forward and his eyes narrowed and should they be taken by barrel fever and bring dishonour to this ship i will personally see their liver at the gangway do i make myself clear the east india company cutter leila leant to the keen wind slashing through the waves like a knife it was kydds first experience of true foreandaft rig the tiny square topsail did not really count and it was a revelation there was no way the craft could take to the open ocean but inshore its speed and ability to lie close to the wind made it ideal now on their way up the pearl river kydd saw ahead where the two sides of the bay rapidly swept together into twin high bluffs the river constricted to less than a mile high above frowning down from the eminence of the craggy rock face were two facing forts exceptionally well placed to command the approaches chuen pi the pilot said to lord elmhurst who sat in an ornate canvas chair on the after deck or as the portuguese have it boca tigris the tigers mouth kydd tending the main sheets with adam was able to take in every word he would try to remember the details for renzi had not been selected for this duty like a pussers shirt on a marline spike was the boatswains unkind comment the tropics had indeed left renzi thin and rangy with a twinge kydd remembered the forlorn devastation on renzis face as he had left to go on to witness the marvels of the orient at first hand without him a puff of smoke jetted from one fort followed a little later by a hollow boom the sound reverberated between the high sides of the passage and kydd thought he could detect the almost tuneful resonance of bronze cannon minutes later the gaudy ribbed sails of a warjunk appeared from behind a prominence the three lateenrigged sails worked against each other to achieve remarkable manoeuvrability back yer topsail an brail up growled quinlan the masters mate at the tiller the cutter slowed to a stop as the sails were dowsed and she wallowed uncomfortably shouldnt have any trouble the pilot said we does the run every week an theres no squeeze unless yr carryin cargo the warjunk dipped and plunged towards them pennants and streamers in the wind a big painted eye on each bow it passed down one side kydd saw weed and seagrowth hanging long and unkempt the sailors in their curious conical hats lounging bored going about the vessel came up the other side of them on the turn there was the same wild rocking to the waves as the fishingboats he had seen earlier and the same astonishingly dry decks it passed close by and kydd could see guns on deck greenstreaked bronze cannon with muzzles in the form of rudimentary dragon mouths it passed ahead and from its leeward guns came a perfunctory threegun salute let go an sheet in snapped quinlan and shaped course to follow they passed between the bluffs and into the land beyond the cliffs gradually subsided and the river widened to a quite different prospect hummocks and the flatness of paddyfields stretching away to the greyblue of distant mountains the river slowed and dissipated into a maze of sandbanks and waterways two merchant ships lay at anchor in a tidepool their sails carelessly draped in a loose furl men hanging listlessly over the rail cn only get over at the top o the tide deep sea vessels the pilot said with three sandbars means ye cant make it up in under two days they pressed on the pilot standing close to quinlan and muttering instructions it was physically strenuous negotiating the tortuous bends with the sudden tacking and gybing kydd worked hard at the mainsheets as he hauled he couldnt take his eyes off the land it was outside his experience subtly foreign vegetation an exotic cooking smell on the air and the uniquely oriental sights stilt houses a blindfolded water buffalo driven by a small boy in an endless circle a monstrous sized waterwheel and dotting the paddyfields inland several manystoreyed pagodas lord elmhurst remained on deck choosing not to join his equerry in the comfortable half cabin with his face set in a frown he scanned the unfamiliar panorama how far is it to canton the pilot swung round in large its fortythree miles from boca tigris mlord but we notes that deepwater packets can only reach to whampoa jus a dozen miles short he smiled and added an well be takin our vittles there within the hour the river narrowed again and as they surged past a stilted village kydd heard for the first time the garrulous noisy chatter of the chinese against the lowing of water buffalo and squealing of pigs around the bend the river widened considerably a large island occupied the middle of the river and anchored all along its shoreline were merchant ships loading bales from the shore rickety jetties ran out to the ships whampoa mlord the pilot said unnecessarily neatly leila ran alongside an indiaman stirk expertly dowsed the headsails and turning quickly grappled the boathook to her mainchains it became apparent that lord elmhurst would not be swarming up the rope ladder to get aboard the merchant ship but would be dining aboard leila two hours to find scran warned quinlan who lost no time getting himself over the bulwark the indiamans hatches were off and a continuous line of coolies brought cedarwood teachests for loading others were in the hold stowing tomming down the cargo securely for the stormy trip home a man in breeches and shirtsleeves glanced at them curiously his eyes following every move of the coolies quinlan nodded to him and crossed the deck to the precarious planks of the brow down to the jetty kydds mind whirled at the impact on his senses an unmistakable sickly stench from the vegetable plots the charcoal smell of cooking fires and the sheer rich stink of land after months at sea the flank of the central spine of the island was one long alley with shanty shops on both sides each with its blankfaced proprietor in white gown shaved head and slender pigtail to the waist there was every kind of knickknack and curio keep together quinlan muttered he seemed to have directions and strode forward purposefully there were occasional european sailors but they were of another world the merchant marine and were in loose serviceable seaclothes that were as different from their own smart manowars rig as they were from the chinese some even wore the baggy petticoat breeches of a previous age at the natural boundary of a stream they turned right and soon were in much more congenial surroundings notwithstanding the bamboo walls and roof it was unmistakably a tavern in fact there were several and more they wasted no time and crowded into the first the cantonese potboy seemed to understand their needs and scurried away before they had chosen their rattan table and settled into the odd straightbacked chairs he was back whisking foaming tankards before them well stap me stirk marvelled died n gone t heaven the potboy remained standing quietly his eyes were fathomless black buttons er yair anyone got some loot quinlan held up a spanish silver dollar this makee two rounds you sawy john he said making a twirling motion with his finger the man glanced back with considerable dignity thought kydd apparently the answer was an affirmative for he nodded and left soundlessly it was nectar the first beer ashore the taste was more watery than their english palates would have preferred but it was fresh and went down very rapidly hey john next round chop chop as swifdy as the first another round was before them and they raised their tankards t the poor bastards back aboard an workin their hearts out kydd raised his tankard thinking of renzi he didnt notice the men looming behind until one spoke an what are kings men doin here cn i ask the speaker was bulky unshaven and there were several others with him yes yer might ask mate stirk said mildly well well cully were not the pressgang but we could make an exception in your case he said with a chuckle don you chouse us matey we tips the hoppo an hell settle yer soon enough he folded his arms whampoas fer merchantmen only whatre yez doing here the mans hectoring tone annoyed kydd who got to his feet stirk interrupted him were here on a mishun he told the merchant sailor softly a wot he replied mockingly kydd stiffened the mans lips curled in a derisive sneer we don hold with no pretty boys in sailor suits here its men only kydds fist slammed out the man fell back roaring instantly everyone was on their feet defensively grouped behind kydd the man felt his bloody nose snarling he drew his knife kydds heart thudded but he was elbowed aside by stirk whose own blade was across his palm held loosely forward seen is kind afore mate cant take a joke stirk glanced behind quickly about time we werent here mates lets head back pitching his voice towards kydd as they withdrew from the tavern the large man shouted you watch yer back ashore mate you n me got somethint settle stirk slid his knife back and chuckled grimly merchant jacks got me sympathy always shorthanded an that but pickin a manowars man theyd ave t be pixyled kydd winked at stirk insultin the kings uniform couldnt help mself the last stage to canton was through perfectly flat ricefields that seemed to stretch away for ever into the immense unknown of asia an alien vastness that made kydd shiver abruptly the last bend straightened and within sight of the city walls the northern bank opened up with wide buildings fronting the river in front of each was a flagpole with a national flag firmly in place the largest and most central had the union flag of great britain and they headed towards it respectfully kydd handed the envoy up the wooden steps to the small group at the top the sailors waited in the cutter until the formalities were complete the envoys small party moved off and a figure appeared at the edge of the wharf hey you lot up here chop chop the seamen looked at each other shrugged and clambered up the young man at the top was in white silk breeches and loose shirt and was coatless he surveyed the group in surprise their trim appearance apparently a novelty so lord elmhurst has given instructions that you shall be the er guests of john company while he is in canton there was a noticeable hesitation and it seems i shall be answerable for your conduct while he is here the young face had a patrician stamp and an easy confidence but it was clear that its owner was unsure of a situation that placed him with the responsibility for a crew of hardlooking naval seamen stirk folded his arms and stared at him while quinlan stepped forward to the front and tugged his tarpaulin hat to an aggressive tilt the young man seemed to come to a decision im jamesen supercargo in john company for my sins the tone of his voice suggested that he had decided to take them into his confidence rather than attempt to lord it over them now canton is different from any place youve ever been to and theres rules here which are stupid childish and cruel but this is china and we have no choice theres a hundred million chinese over there he said waving towards the endless paddyfields and we are a few hundred do you get my drift the interior of the mess was airy and cool the furniture spare with the seamen incongruously clutching an eggshelllike teacup of transparent green tea jamesen explained further trade is everything we buy tea they buy not much they think theyre the centre of the world and everyone else is a barbarian and needs to be kept at a distance so all trade with the biggest country in the world is through the one place canton now i warn you in all sincerity if you cause an incident we can do nothing to save you all dealings are through the hoppo a greasy fat and entirely corrupt chief of the cohong which are a scurvy crew appointed by the viceroy to deal with the barbarians and save him getting his hands dirty as long as he gets his cut he finished his tea and refilled his cup the season finishes soon and we all have to fall back to our families in macao until march he paused and grinned your envoy will find that he will get his audience and his presents will be graciously accepted but he will have to wait for his reply at macao like the rest so i doubt youll be here long theres shops and things around here were pretty selfcontained wouldnt advise going off on your own be in the mess by sundown dont get fuddled with drink beware of everything and everybody they nodded they were not about to go on the rantan ashore hereabouts jamesen softened a little if theres any wants a stroll its my practice to take a turn around the city walls before dark anyone want to come stirk and kydd were the only takers they stepped it out down the narrow alleys and along the sandy northern banks of the pearl river much closer to the city the bustle increased flooding the pathways were chinese of every description carrying trussed chickens yokes suspending large dark jars and huge clusters of unrecognisable vegetables their constant chattering was deafening you know its instant execution for any chinese teaching the language to a foreign devil said jamesen tui m syuhe added politely stepping around an old lady struggling with a bound piglet a palanquin with oiledpaper windows swayed towards them preceded by a lackey in an embroidered gown banging a gong to clear a path there was no sign of the occupant kydd noticed a ragged bundle floating in the river ah that youll find is a female baby upcountry they want strong sons not useless girls easiest way to solve the problem jamesen explained just before the dilapidated walls was a small sandy beach and a crowd gathered around some officials a large drum pounded monotonously you may be interested in this jamesen said languidly they hovered on the edge of the crowd and watched two men being brought forward they had signs in chinese characters around their necks and their heads hung in listless dejection theyre pirates probably peached on by their friends the men were thrust to their knees facing the water reading from a scroll an official chanted loudly then suddenly whipped it down and stepped back from the crowd came a man bared to the waist carrying a highly polished oriental sword he swaggered up to the first pirate and stood ready the noise from the crowd buzzed on without change at a screamed order from the official the executioner made ready slowly and deliberately kydd went cold the sword went up the crowds chatter continued to wash around unabated the victim had nothing but a blank look on his face but tensed slightly the sword blurred down and connected with a meaty crunch the head bounced twice on the sand while the torso toppled slowly gouting blood from the neck doesnt seem to deter them jamesen commented the pirates i mean there was no variation in the cheerful hum of conversations in the crowd the seamen watched as the second pirate lost his head stirk looked at kydd but didnt speak the city walls were decrepit and crumbled at the edges never really needed these since the ming dynasty was overthrown jamesen said kicking away a halfeaten gourd of some sort of fruit they paced along slowly deliberately ignoring the small barefoot boys who tagged on behind chanting faan kwai hung motik faan kwai lo at kydds look jamesen explained seems youre the usual sort of a hairy foreign devil on the way back they wended through a market a riotous mix of women bargaining shrilly and vociferous stallkeepers edging around them kydd had never in his life felt so conspicuous and was not helped by the many darting looks some curious most sullen and venomous ere rum dos stirk had seen a movement in a large wicker basket and was standing over it pointing kydd crossed to see and was shocked to see that it contained a human being tied in a foetal position its not jamesen cocked an eye then grabbed his arm leave now his voice was urgent the talking had died away around them and there was hostility in the air they hurried off pursued by derisive shouts what not your fault said jamesen breathlessly theyre on display he paused to recover don tell me stirk growled yes if theyre found guilty theyre on display at the scene of the crime until sunset then theyre taken out and strangled on the spot silk rope of course o course stirk said hoarsely jamesen sniffed into a handkerchief and went on they dont like the foreign devils to get involved ill be glad to get back to the compound a few years ago they got hold of a gunner of a bristol packet caught in an accident he looked back furtively and went on they tortured him publicly in front of the family concerned before strangling him in the factory jamesen found some wine has to be drunk anyway before we retire to macao china is old and ancient he mused decaying on the inside and out if some country knocked on the door hard enough it would come crashing down and let some fresh air in and trade he drained the glass expertly as near eighty per centum of trade goes in english bottoms i guess itll be us doing the deed some day and i hope soon hearing curt voices outside jamesen got to his feet stay here he commanded he was back quickly as i thought youll be going downriver tomorrow to await the viceroys reply ill see to your sleeping arrangements renzi said nothing simply puffed quietly on his long clay pipe and sat back on the foredeck of artemis kydd tried to provoke him but could not break his composure only a slight smile betraying anything of his feelings the others had left the deck when the chill of evening crept in leaving the two alone an you are telling me this is th mark of civilisation kydd continued with heat renzi stirred and knocked out his pipe on the planksheer red sparks of dottle cascaded prettily into the gloaming my dear fellow how can i say i was not there i was never a witness to these untoward events inwardly he was hot with indignation that he had not been able to see for himself he was sure that the savant would not lie and that the precepts of confucius did indeed inform the actions of the ruling class but this kydd snorted if you had seen fr yourself only or better still smelt fr yourself its a a beast of a country he longed for the words to put into stark unmistakable perspective for renzi what he had experienced the stink the cacophonous noise the unconcern for life if we remain for long here ive no doubt i shall but i hear tomorrow we shift berth to macao he looked sideways at kydd which as you will know is a portuguese territory and therefore an ally of ours in this war and i have no doubt will give us a warm welcome kydd grunted itll still be the same as the rest of china chapter the opposite side of the pearl river was nowhere near as spectacular in place of the deep clear green were the muddy shallows of the estuary and around them craggy islands lay subdued and sleepy however where their great anchorage was nearly bereft of human habitation macao offered a compact pleasing prospect of familiar buildings from the home continent as their anchor splashed down it was possible to make out dark stone forts the facade of a cathedral state buildings in a comfortable pink wash and all the appurtenances of a sane world kydds heart lifted it would be good to step ashore here do we get liberty soon dye suppose as they spoke a nineteengun salute puffed out in distant thuds from the fort commanding the town below to be returned with the sharper report of the frigates bow deck guns as she glided to a stop boats were quickly in the water and the envoy in plumed cocked hat and sword went down the side to his waiting barge for the steady pull over to the quay and the guard of welcome the boat secured to the landing stage and in dignified silence the envoy of his britannic majesty mounted the steps harsh shouts from the waiting portuguese guard commander brought his men to attention lord elmhurst and his equerry turned and stopped the formed up ceremonial guard that stared back at them was of every possible tint of mestizo undersized and with threadbare regimentals their european officers wore ornate uniform that however drooped sadly but there was no mistaking the warmth of the welcome with earnest cries of welcome the desembargador advanced on them the envoy deciding that there was no deeper meaning to the astonishing sight moved forward to the almost perceptible relief of the portuguese so its leave t both watches doud said with relish an were gonna be here fer ever if its ter be believed he added contentedly aye but without s much as a single cobb in me bung whats th use said cundall ungraciously petit had a long face whats amiss elias kydd asked stirring in his seat petit said dourly it aint good fer a manowar ter stay too long in port seen it appen in foreign parts y gets all the sickness n pox goin from off of the land sea its clean n good land yeah well no harm in a frolic ashore laughed doud a cruise with a right little piece sets a man up fer his next vyage kydd was stitching carefully at the fluting of the smart blue jacket renzi had last worn in celebration in portsmouth on the other side of the world seems regular enough buildings and such he said biting off the thread and picking up his own jacket theyve been here since before the age of old queen bess plenty of time to make themselves comfortable i think renzi replied and put on his jacket what dye think to find there nicholas id be content to see where camoens wrote the immortal luisiadas at the dry looks this received he persevered grievously shipwrecked then manages to get himself banished to here the poem is about one of the greatest of sailors vasco da gama there were no sudden cries of understanding although petit nodded wisely but mark you kydds right thiss still china n toby as told me a piece about what he saw in canton id steer small were i ashore if i wuz you with the walmer castle on her slow way upriver to whampoa to discharge and load and the rest of the envoys party safely conveyed to their lodgings the ship prepared for the wait even with the busy china trade vulnerable for some reason the french had not reached this far across the globe perhaps distracted by the work of the guillotine and the frenzied mob at home it was considered therefore that the threat was low and that the frigate could remain quietly at rest artemis lay in harbour to two anchors her sails were thoroughly dried naked topmasts sent down communication was set up with the shore for a daily supply of victuals and soft tack was on the table for the first time since england with the frigate as trim and shipshape as could be found in any top naval port it was time to step ashore the leafy sweep of the praia grande gave the appearance of some comfortable iberian town but for the fact that the majority of the population was not european besides the ubiquitous chinese there was the black of negro slaves the varying shades of brown of halfcastes and only occasionally the short dark compact figure of a portuguese the gaudily coloured buildings were portugal transplanted and pintos eyes glistened with emotion he stopped a portuguese striding past and babbled to him a curious thing for his shipmates to witness the man looked at him contemptuously and gestured eastwards into the crowded city he say all sailor go to solmar to get hickey pinto said happily so we claps on all sail n shapes course for th solmar stirk said to general approval perhaps we will join you later toby said renzi diplomatically catching kydds arm and they plunged into the unknown inner city the streets were steep and impossibly crowded it was as if every square inch was valuable and they were soon lost in the maze of ancient shops and anonymous structures seething with humanity they emerged suddenly from the press towards the top of a rise at the stone face of a cathedral glowering down the hill at them it seemed to their protestant sensibilities from the dark interior a priest emerged a neat goatee beard flecked with grey on his sensitive lined face he paced down the hill towards them clearly in deep thought sil vous plait aidez nous mon pererenzi tried his portuguese nonexistent the mans head jerked up in astonishment and his hands fluttered in noncomprehension non er nonhe said his voice highpitched and agitated renzi tried again bitte helfen sie uns hochwurden the language of goethe would be an unlikely acquisition for a portuguese but renzi felt that his latin would not be equal to the strain and he was now at a loss do you have any englis the priest asked hopefully his eyes darting between the two of them ah sir then you are a scholar renzi said politely the priest flashed a quick look at him and smiled where there is trade you find the englis and there is much trade here then sir if you could assist me in a small way we seek camoens the soldierpoet of the last age is there trace of him still the priests face turned from astonishment to bewilderment and then satisfaction you sir are then the scholar he shot a speculative glance at renzi and ventured carefully aristotle prophecy in sleep sir i am no friend to his position but i will gladly debate the matter at he could go no further the priest grasped his arms and held him at length meu deusyou are sent to me on this day of days pray walk with me to my residencia and we will sup together the lunch recollecting himself he turned to kydd you gentlemen are mos welcome and you shall see the casa of our luis de camoes presently kydd sighed neither the prospect of a discussion on aristotle nor the inspection of this revered casa article was maintaining his spirits which had looked forward to tasting the more direct pleasures of these foreign shores still it was kind of the old fellow and they did need something now at noon in any event he had an hour or two to think of a ploy to raise the state of play to a more satisfactory level the priests modest cell was close by and they entered the cool room tastefully set off by the handpainted blue and white tiles covering one entire wall the furniture was commodious in the chinese style the chairs were tall and squarebacked in dark wood with a carved central panel across one corner of the room was a beautiful black and gilt screen fully six feet high with an iridescent shell inlay of butterflies and bamboo seated at the round table sipping their green tea they waited respectfully the room smelt of the layered odours of untold centuries and was redolent of peace the priest smiled at them my name is nunez my flock call me honrar it has been my good fortune to follow in the shadow of matteo ricci and adam schall here in the college of sao paolo for thirtyeight years you are sailors no from the british frigate artemissaid renzi macao is very old very set in her ways he said seriously we portuguese it must be faced have now passed the time of our greatness for us history has ceased renzi made a gesture but the priest was looking at kydd but you the british are a race that has found itself in these troubling times and greatness lies waiting before you his face was difficult to read thus you will pardon me if i make myself clear do not expect us to like you your manners are turbulent and thrusting you are impatient with the old ways you are confident very sure and we are afraid of you renzi stirred but surely you can see that as a nation we trade we do not conquer trade always brings a domination in its wake nunez did not smile and the two sailors sat uncomfortably we do not allow any of your trading hongs to own land or dwellings in macao only to rent this is because as you will surely see you british are rich and powerful and we are not you are growing restless at your lack of a trading port and may seize our own hesitating kydd spoke awkwardly sir im only a seaman but i cn see that macao is too small for yr deepsea vessels we saw a rattlin good place for a port over the other side heung kong its name the priests eyes glimmered a bare rock on which you will have to build houses docks roads i dont think even the british would do that if there is another for the taking unexpectedly he got to his feet but i am ungracious perhaps it has been so long since excuse me he swiftly left the room his dark gown swishing kydd turned to renzi but at his look did not speak the priest returned with a bottle and three glasses i hope you will join me at wine cavalheiros it was a musky sercial mellow and gentle from somewhere inside the house floated a tantalising odour of food but even in its richness there was nothing they could identify we eat in the chinese style it is cheaper and more convenient nunez said apologetically the odour took form and strength of a potent but mouthwatering character oh yes i hope you do not mind but it is my regular practice in this season to offer hospitality to another at noon she will join us soon renzi seemed not to have heard his face grew in intensity and leaning forward he asked the soulstealers of the kao hsuang can it be that they have overthrown the sacred precepts of confucius or do they bend him to their philosophy ah you know of these nunez asked in amazement your answer is that in their deviltry they have their own philosophy and it is based on the janusfaced sayings of hsuntzu who teaches that the door opened and a figure appeared limned in the sunlight from outside and therefore difficult to see oh honraryou have guests i it was a young womans voice no no child you are welcome please come in and take your place the door closed and kydd watched a young lady unlace her bonnet to let her auburn hair tumble down in lazy waves she stood uncertain a petite but selfassured girl of less than twenty years with an elfin face and large eyes she looked directly at kydd she was pretty rather than beautiful but the strength in her features and the sharp sculpted curving of her face had its effect on kydd a sharp and uncomfortable sensual shock gracefully she sat down at the table next to kydd managing to do so without looking at him again minha cara these are my guests nunez said they are sailors from the british warship nicholas renzi and thomas kydd horn artemis frigate renzi offered kydd caught his look of interest in the girl miss sarah bullivant she said sitting straightbacked her hands firmly in her lap i trust your visit will be a pleasant one she added her eyes falling carefully between the two of them it could prove a lengthy one by all events said renzi kydd thought that his manner was unnecessarily unctuous she looked up pray why will that be why i stand amazed the world does not know of it his britannic majestys envoy lord elmhurst awaits a reply from the viceroy of canton touching on his mission to the emperor in peking then be assured sir the wait could well be a protracted one the coy flutter of her eyelashes as she engaged renzi in conversation did not escape kydd it suggests that the british are attempting a separate agreement as to trade nunez agreed just inches from her body kydd felt his own respond and a betraying dull heat crept up his neck at sea with not the slightest femininity to trigger sexuality desire subsided a quiescence not troubled by ribaldry or images but the first woman encountered ashore by her sensual proximity provoked an immediate awakening kydd could detect miss bullivants faint scent and sensed her body outline beneath her dress not the odious opium trade i do sincerely pray she dabbed at her generously curved lips there kydd exulted her face was still turned towards renzi but her eyes had flicked sideways t am in full accord with you miss bullivant renzi said elegantly to kydds savage delight his slight pause was not rewarded by a bidding to continue yet there are some who point out that we english regularly consume opium without ill effects laudanum your godfreys cordial could it possibly be that the chinese character is weaker less in control as the food arrived nunez grunted it is well known saving your presence that the english have long sought a species of trade that can balance the books for all the tea they must have and they care not for its origin there was an uncomfortable silence the clatter of crockery sounding overly loud nunez handled the chopsticks like a native sarah was capable but without elegance and renzi fumbled kydd surveyed the cluster of little dishes and resolutely abstracted the flatbottomed spoon from a dark sauce dish which he then proceeded to wield on everything ah yes my friend nunez turned to renzi the casa camoes he laid down his chopsticks on their little rest it lies within the grounds of a residencia which is let to mr drummond of your east india company he smiled i do believe that were a young lady to desire entrance then you would more readily gain admittance sarah would you sarahs face tightened sir it is not my practice to be observed in public with sailors kydd flushed but there was no avoiding it a woman with jack tar ashore had only one purpose nunezs face creased in amusement in that case let me be of assistance i have what do you say the walkingout clothes they are perhaps unfashionable in these days and are in the older style but they would fit you sir he said looking at renzi they did indeed renzi in doublebreasted waistcoat and manybuttoned buffcoloured coat together with cream breeches elegantly flexed his rather skinny legs this set off peals of laughter from sarah kydd sat morose and overlooked in the corner mlady renzi said sweeping the tall royal blue tricorne hat down in an elegant bow it was too small but that only seemed to amuse sarah the more he offered his arm which sarah took with a gracious nod kydd got to his feet sarah looked at renzi uncertainly miss bullivant said renzi softly it would oblige me greatly if mr kydd were to accompany us she glanced back at kydd her eyes dropped to his lower body and kydds pulse quickened very well she said coolly looking directiy at him providing he follows on behind at a distance kydd boiled over be damnd to you he thrust towards the door outside he took several deep breaths and set off for the waterfront the gloomy berthdeck of artemis was almost deserted its clear sweep foreandaft interrupted only by a few hammocks kydd sat under one of the few lanthorns hung this late in the evening he had gone to the solmar which was packed with artemis sailors but they were all far gone in drink and no proper solace for wounded pride and unslaked lust briefly he had toyed with the idea of finding a woman to spend the night with among the throng but something in his methodist upbringing and a personal aversion to giving his body to a harlot stopped him thus in the way of sailors he had returned to the bosom of his ship for some reason he had pulled out the seachest he and renzi shared here it was mellowing with age and seause and carved with a mermaid cartouche that renzi had contrived in the long days in the indian ocean before calcutta with an unformed wish for repudiation of their friendship kydd rummaged through its contents each piece evoking lengthening memories neatly stacked along a good quarter of the chest were renzis books at random he picked one up these were the real source of renzis success his readiness with words his effortless authority on all things kydd felt a stab of fury at the ease with which he had charmed sarah it was now past evening and well into the night what was he doing to her now rage made him choke but with a force of will he crushed the thoughts if renzi had succeeded with sarah then that was his good luck he would have done the same the matter at hand was to get himself to the same level if it were possible and he would damned well make it so here in his hands was the key he opened the book the type was tiny and difficult to read in the guttering lanthorn light the tide page was flowery and embellished with intertwined pictures of animals d diderot on the interpretation of natureit read together with a flurry of cursive french kydd leafed slowly through it it seemed to deal in unbelievable wordiness with reason and observation but if this was what gave renzi the ability to speak he would ingest it too he settled down at the beginning and read haltingly disturbed neither by the noisy arrival back on board of drunken and querulous seamen nor the raucous teasing of his shipmates his eyes grew heavy the words more difficult and when renzi finally returned on board all he could do was remove the book gently from kydds slumped figure and shake his head wonderingly almost alone at their breakfast burgoo kydd and renzi ate silently avoiding each others eyes when they finished neither rose from the mess table wish y joy of im to tell you breaking off in embarrassment their eyes met a tentative smile spread over kydds features which was quickly returned by renzi the portugee priest wishes to see me again said renzi with a sigh a disputatious wretch yet i will indulge him a little further i believe and does miss bullivant the young lady unaccountably wishes to be remembered to you renzi replied neutrally kydds voice thickened last night last night i had the felicity of debating the nature of the chinee the solemn imperatives of their beliefs and the impervious nature of their society with as erudite a colleague as ever i could wish but miss bullivant was obliging enough to conduct me to the casa garden of camoens where i looked on the rocks of his inspiration she on conclusion she bade me farewell and returned with her maid who accompanied us throughout renzi said flady kydd fiddled with a piece of bread but refused to give renzi further satisfaction a twisted grin surfaced on renzis face i am desired to inform you that she has been able to procure some suitable long clothes she hopes you will find these satisfactory enough to be able to accompany us this afternoon on a visit to sao tiago a leaping exultation transformed kydds spirits so he had not been mistaken about those glances something of his feelings must have been visible for renzi continued in a lazy teasing voice of course i did inform her that you were desolated that your watch on deck in this instance takes precedence he broke off at the dangerous flare in kydds eyes then continued of course they are the clothes of a dead man for all kydd cared he would strip the body himself but he waited who died of the bloody flux before he could accept them from the tailors renzi finished lamely eight bells at noon could not come fast enough liberty was granted from then until daybreak the next day in this relaxed river discipline kydd and renzi hurried off and soon were welcomed into the old residence the feel of silk stockings against his legs after the freedom of a sailors trousers was odd the nankeen breeches and the soft royalblue coat added to the strangeness and to kydd it was a reminder of the flabbiness of shore life nevertheless he rotated proudly before the mirror the strong muscular definition of his body did peculiar things to the hang of the garments but with his black hair in a neat club he made a striking figure he sniffed as though bored and turning made an awkward bow to sarah it brought no amusement as renzis had but the sudden lift of her chin and averted eyes told him that he had her attention milady he said with satisfaction ah lee is curious sarah said they were sitting in the outdoor garden of the sol dourado waiting for their tea she now has a quantity of gossip for her friends i think the little black and white chinese amah with the twinkling eyes and long queue said little but kydd had felt the darting glances during the walk when she had followed respectfully behind sarah sat opposite kydd at the small round table leaving renzi to the side for the first time he was able to take his fill of her prettiness her characterful retrousse nose was complemented by the high sculpted cheekbones and the eyes large and hypnotic he would need determined selfcontrol to avoid making a fool of himself dye not find the chinese a strange crew kydd asked he cursed inwardly as he remembered that she was governess to the progeny of a rich chinese trader who was now in canton for the winter not when you make their further acquaintance she said her eyes had a powerful effect on kydd which he tried to hide a tiny smile curving her wideset lips showed perhaps that he was not as successful as he hoped renzi leaned forward one might argue that their very precepts make it impossible of a closer acquaintance he said sarahs eyes lingered for a heartbeat on kydd then transferred their attention to renzi sir i am not in the philosophic line my dealings are more of a practical nature she said daintily the eyes returned to kydd and dropped modestly they were underneath a hibiscus tree which in season would have been a picture the dull pearlescence of the winter monsoon swirled about them in the form of a fine mist of tiny dewdrops which caught in sarahs hair like a halo kydd could not think of anything to say and looked at renzi his friend lolled back but was not at ease he returned the look and kydd was startled at the stony hostility in his expression i think nicholas meant th chinese have er things in their civilisation which we find difficult t take to i saw sights in canton that would make y stare he said renzi lurched upright i most certainly did not i say that by their contempt for our civilisation they have withdrawn themselves from our society and thus from all possibility of fellowship oh sarah said her hand flying to her mouth and without a glance at renzi you have been to canton i would die to go just the once but ladies are not permitted her eyes grew yet larger and she leant forward towards kydd flustered he knew what was happening but was out of his depth in guildford he was vaguely aware that females were one of two types the earnest but dowdy ones you married and the exciting ones who always turned out to be shameless doxies sarah looked neither or both and she was driving a wedge between him and renzi why er yes he said do tell me she cupped her face in her hands her eyes were enormous there was movement to the side renzi got to his feet pray excuse me miss bullivant it is not often i get the opportunity honrar nunez is expecting me do not trouble i beg his voice seemed distant and preoccupied your servant he said with a bow and left without a glance at kydd hes sometimes a difficult fellow to understand mumbled kydd but he is your particular friend sarah said immediately i can tell you have no idea how jealous that makes a woman the closeness i mean she said dropping her eyes we have done much tgether kydd said defiantly yet you are so different somehow her candour made things much easier than the delicacies of conversation before what do you talk about she asked no thats unfair you would not be friends unless you shared something deep she said she sat back and stared at kydd appraisingly you look every part a sailor mr kydd and i do confess that before today i would rather be seen dead than talk to a sailor i understand kydd said stiffly no i dont mean that she said her gloved hand coming out to squeeze his please forgive what i said about sailors before but he forced her to feel her shame then smiled its the most wonderful thing that ever happened t me he said in simple sincerity she looked at him steadily there are things in this life she began my father is a schoolmaster also kydd put in thinking of her duty as a governess but being a little hazy as to what that implied in pedagogy is he she said looking puzzled well not really kydd said and explained the saga of the naval school she sat still her eyes unblinking at the end she sighed youre a very nice man mr kydd he was not sure if this meant his duty to his family or something more so he compromised with an inaudible mutter and a very interesting one i demand you will tell me of your voyages across the bounding main what marvellous things have you seen do tell kydd was no raconteur his masculine directness only hinting at the loneliness and terror the consuming bloodlust and exultation the deeply affecting love of the sea but it held sarah spellbound in quite the same way as it had cecilia the afternoon passed tea had come round at least three times the fine mist insinuating cool and damp but still she would not let him go for kydd it was a dream unreal not of this existence less than a year ago he had been a perruquier in a small surrey town glad to be noticed by ordinary girls here sitting in front of him was a handsome woman of the world in far china who was fascinated by him sarah stood smiling down at him he snapped out of his daze and scrambled to his feet would you see me home if you please mr kydd ah of course er miss bullivant he said she waited he waited take my arm if you please she said primly it is unseemly to be seen walking at a distance he settled his tricorne on firmly and held out his arm hers entwined and lay gently on his and the electric soft touch of the side of her breast turned his arm into a rigid claw they moved off in sedate promenade magically ah lee appeared to follow at a respectful distance her face blank but watchful the touch of sarahs arm on his was all fire and flowers kydd felt twenty feet tall he carefully matched his pace to hers across the praca and into the streaming hubbub of the bazaars as they walked sarah pressed closer to him turning to speak with a flashing smile he could manage only monosyllables in reply but something of his happiness must have communicated itself for she was plainly flattered he wondered what sort of picture he made in the fine clothing he wore with such a woman on his arm and lifted his chin in defiance he might be a common sailor but at the moment he was king of the world the road widened to a leafy avenue and in the gathering dusk she stopped before an imposing mansion rearing up behind the building was a pagoda smaller than the ones kydd had seen in canton but more richly appointed lanterns gleamed discreetly at the entrance to the mansion the whole smacked of careless wealth ah lee scurried forward to open the door and waited inside kydds heart sank it was selfevident that sarah was of a different social order but had been amused for the length of the afternoon it had been kind of her but he had to be realistic thank you mr kydd i did enjoy our tea this afternoon you are wonderful company you know her eyes caught the soft lantern light they seemed to steal into his soul she held out her hand it was bare the glove had been removed er the same fr me miss bullivant he blurted and shook her hand warmly a brief shadow flickered across her face he caught the expression then realised that probably what was wanted was a more formal exchange he bowed deeply but forgot to put a leg forward the gesture ended awkwardly and he blushed he looked up again fearing ridicule but her face was set albeit with the tiniest trace of vexation she brightened do you know we never did get to see the sao tiago do you think it would be very wicked of me to suggest that we met again tomorrow to remedy the omission kydd was thunderstruck that is if your duties on board your boat do allow she said after noon we are free t step ashore kydd stammered splendid sarah exclaimed clasping her hands if we meet at two at honrar nunezs perhaps i can prevail on ah lee to provide a picnic basket her mood was infectious and kydd found himself grinning inanely his hat passing from hand to hand very well until two then mr kydd she said decisively a final radiant smile came that stabbed right through him then she swept up the steps and into the mansion the door closed soundlessly for a moment he stared after her then slowly turned to make his way back the short distance to the priests residencia there was no way kydd could think of returning on board so early but equally he had no desire to join his friends at their roystering in the solmar he paced slowly along the seafront conscious but uncaring that a lone sailor strolling past at this hour was an unusual sight sarah wanted to see more of him the simple fact kept repeating itself raising his hopes to levels of fantasy he knew to be foolish at the same time he was uncomfortably aware that her proximity and physical contacts however slight had awakened powerful urges that in no sense could be termed honourable one thing was certain next to renzi he was nothing but an oaf he cringed at the memory of his awkwardness and lack of conversation suddenly resolved he set out for the quay where the ships boats secured he would return aboard and resume his acquaintance with the literature on the berth deck there was only one occupant still and silent at the table under a lanthorn glow it was renzi reading kydd slid into the seat opposite renzi did not acknowledge his presence continuing to read his slim volume with great concentration at yr books still i find kydd said lightly renzi looked up balefully then resumed his concentration the priest has tired of yr company kydd said with more emphasis he does have other duties renzi said kydd bit off a hot rejoinder and remembered his intention then id be obliged were you to suggest t me one of our books he said that would improve th mind renzi laid down his wordsworth so miss bullivant might be agreeably impressed with your undoubted erudition so i might have th chance of knowing somethin more of this ragabash world with a theatrical sigh renzi leant back then his expression softened you are not yet a friend to logic the rational course but should you so desire then i have in our seachest an old and very dear piece by john locke an essay concerning human understanding which may yet persuade you sarah was wearing light blue with many tiny bows sewn into the skirt of her frock and a gay lace bonnet that was very fetching mlady kydd smiled rising to greet her nunez was silent watchful as a bird kind sir sarah replied bobbing a curtsy with a radiant smile just for him kydd felt a rush of feeling that left him in confusion he collected himself and said casually i rejoice t see you in looks miss bullivant if th validity of th inference may be allowed as experientially rooted the bit about empiricism could come out later nunezs eyebrows shot up sarah hesitated in puzzlement then her expression cleared you have been disputing with nicholas she said in an accusing tone and now you mean to quiz me kydd couldnt keep it up and a wide grin spread she was caught by his infectious glee and returned the smile they stepped out into the street as prim a couple as any to be seen there was little smalltalk as they walked companionably together at sao tiago they stood on the ancient battlements and looked out to sea to the islands and scattered ships at anchor the bobbing sampans and serene junks sarah stood in front of kydd her bonnet held in her hands and looking outward in silence kydd stood close behind the scent of her hair came up to him the lines of her body inches from him as if it were some other he watched as his hands came up to take her shoulders his head bent and he kissed the top of her hair very gently her female scent briefly enclosing him she froze her hands came up slowly to touch his still facing away still silent suddenly she turned round but said in a quite practical tone as if nothing had passed i believe you would like to see a chinese pagoda thomas her eyes held his but moved past over his shoulder kydd knew that something was happening but was unsure painfully aware of a thudding heart come she commanded her grip on his arm a fierce imperative in a trance kydd conveyed her back along the narrow streets the way they had come feeling his masculinity uncomfortably and longing with a fierce dread for what he knew must lie ahead ah lee opened the door to the mansion for them and they entered arm in arm mr tsoi journeys to canton in the winter season sarah said with a peculiar air of defiance the house is deserted kydd glanced at ah lee whose expression was even more blank than usual the house was easily the richest and most spacious that he had ever entered but had an alien look and smell with a compelling exoticism we will have our picnic in the pagoda sarah said and in halting cantonese told ah lee who looked shocked but bowed once and withdrew sarah steered kydd through the vast house and out into the garden her arm still in his she chatted on remarking on this oriental bloom and that until they reached the door at the base of the pagoda kydd wondered what lay in the dark interior fiddling with the dark bronze latch sarah eased open the tiny door and held up her lantern kydd started uncomfortably in the flickering gleam he saw her face turn to him and in his heightened state it seemed distorted devilish leading him on into an unknown perdition come on silly she giggled at his hesitation and ducking down entered the pagoda quite used to the low deckhead of a manowar kydd followed the golden light of the lantern steadied and strengthened away from the evening breezes revealing mysterious forms and carvings on all sides he stared uneasily the odour of cedarwood and the dust of ages acrid and strong these are mr tsois ancestors sarah said then girlishly tripped around a spiral passageway at the periphery they circled madly in a dizzying whirl that left kydd breathless at the very top they finally stopped laughing the curved roof above provided a small room which was barely furnished with a small table and some red straightbacked chinese chairs on a dark carpet many richly ornamented hangings with elaborate writing characters decorated the walls taking his hand sarah pulled him over to a window opening and looked at him in triumph there thomas is it not worth the climb to see this in the clear dusk the twinkling lights of macao spread away over the hills fairylike from this height the dense wafting fragrance of the orient enveloped him and kydd knew he would never forget that night the moment hung mysteriously enigmatically ah lee will not be long sarah said in her matteroffact way she will not stay though she dislikes being here she drew him back inside and they sat in the hard chairs the lantern hooked to a beam overhead where do you come from thomas she said politely by degrees his hot desire subsided he had misread the situation and if he were to press his attentions now he would suffer a stinging rebuff yet she had already compromised her reputation by being alone with him he wondered why she trusted him then remembered that she had called him a nice man he didnt know if he should take this as a compliment or resent it the tapping of footsteps on wood began far below ah lee said sarah unnecessarily the conversation tailed off until finally ah lee appeared with a big tray kydd jumped to his feet to take the tray but was stopped by a warning cough and meaningful frown from sarah he sat down again in an awkward silence while ah lee patiently laid out the table her eyes surreptitiously flicking from one to the other it was a chinese meal many small dishes holding hidden pleasures and in the middle what looked like a flower vase fa tiusarah said pouring an opaque liquid the colour of varnish into delicate porcelain cups a chinese wine best served hot she smiled at him over her cup and he raised his own to her and sipped it was dense and cloying to his taste but he felt the glow begin to spread ah lee left quietly they heard her steps rapidly diminishing until once more they were alone together sarahs eyes fixed on his face and she spoke levelly do you know thomas that with half a thousand bachelors out here there isnt one id call a man not a real one whos big and strong daring handsome kydd stirred in his chair did this mean she really damn you thomas do you make me beg the tone was shrill and had an edge of hysteria sarah he began hoarsely but she was the opposite side of the table and he hesitated she breathed deeply then got abruptly to her feet in the process sending the table and its contents to one side in an appalling crash of china kydd stood up in horror at first he could not respond to the passionate assault the kiss was deep and hungry her mouth taking his violently her body pressed into him without restraint they swayed clamped together thomas she whispered drawing away slightly my darling sweet thomas my dear sailor man do you not know were meant to be one my love her eyes were huge and lambent in the lanterns glow kydd held her in an intoxicated trance not daring to move her leg interposed slowly caressing between his thighs in an excruciating sensual invasion his hands in response moved down her back thomas ive never been with a man she blurted her hands slid down his body and discovered his arousal she gasped her breath came fast and ragged he lowered her gently to the floor as with a strangers eyes he saw her tear off her shoes and with a flood of sexual feeling he saw her pull up her dress to the white of knees and upper thighs she lay on the carpet writhing and vulnerable please thomas my love my love her words were nearly incoherent but kydd was not listening he knelt between her legs his head roaring at the sight of her under him and he tore at his breeches his hard manhood got in the way and in a rage of frustration he ripped the cloth they came together hard savagely their bodies moving together in tidal surges of sexuality the climax was explosive and uncontrollable she clung to him while the spasms spent themselves my darling my dearest she murmured over and over clasping his body in hers with an immovable grip at last she released him he drew apart and lay next to her wonderingly he gazed across at her her body still racked by dying shudders his own knowing only a beautiful deep satisfaction they lay there unmoving kydd reached out for her his arm across her bodice there was something infinitely endearing in the sight of the trusting pale nakedness of her lower body but he was becoming aware of the nights chill cooling the hot wetness and he clutched at his breeches sarah stirred my god she said brokenly what have we done puzzled kydd propped himself on his elbows and tried to make out her expression what have we done this time it was a harsh tearing sound sending cold shafts of fear into him sarah he asked gently she sat up suddenly plucking feverishly at her dress her eyes showed their whites like a frightened horse and his unease grew she lurched over to one of the straightbacked red chairs and sat with her head in her hands kydd got to his feet and covered himself but his breech flap hung down torn and useless it seemed futile to pretend a dignity he no longer possessed but he softly crossed over to her then the sobs began quiet and endless clumsily he tried to put his arms around her but she shrugged them off the sobs turned to weeping a hopeless racking female sorrow in all the helplessness of a man he sat motionless waiting the evening turned to night the lantern guttered low he found his coat put it around her and resumed his vigil long after the night noises of macao outside had settled in slumber he held her while the fitful weeping continued the silent intervals between lengthened until at last it ceased thomas she said in a low voice yes itll be all right if we love each other wont it she said kydd paused his thoughts sped ahead he had not even considered this but then he realised that he could answer truthfully yes sarah if we loved each other of course it would be all right she sighed and reached for him her face in the dimness was a wet smear on his but he kissed her dutifully then gently disengaged to trim the lantern the renewed light revealed wild disorder sarah stood the table on its legs again and began mechanically to pick up broken pieces of crockery and congealed food from the carpet kydd tried to help her the coolness of the night was now a hostile cold sarah shivered and moved to a corner of the room kydd found a tasselled covering and he brought it across to where she sat hugging her knees in a touching gesture she held it open for him also he snuggled up to her and found her feminine warmth roused him again he dared not reveal it to her i we must plan she said in a small voice kydd made no move taking refuge in silence macao is a small place people will know she said only if ah lee tells em kydd said stoutly he saw no reason to panic she thought she is discreet she likes me but honrar nunez he would never lie and how would he know kydd retorted i i could not lie to him thomas there was no answer to that they huddled stiffly together there is a way to save my reputation sarah said carefully kydd waited thomas you shall marry me she announced thunderstruck he stared at her she was not looking at him but staring away dreamily into the distance her voice strengthened i will leave mr tsois employ and you shall leave the sea and we will set up house together here in macao leave the sea kydd couldnt keep the incredulity from his voice of course thomas dear you wouldnt want me married to a common sailor now would you he was shocked as much by the prim possessiveness in her tone as the content of what she was saying but you will get used to being on the land again soon dear there was now a hint of asperity tomorrow you shall see the captain and tell him you are leaving the ship to settle down sarah we are at war my duty fiddlesticks young men go to war to protect those on the land and now you are on the land leave it to the others to be heroes she said crossly there could be no reply to that at this time he urgently needed to get away to think it through to weigh the consequences of his act yes sarah he uttered unable to muster a term of endearment she looked at him doubtfully but snuggled closer her fingers twitching at his waistcoat in a dreamlike state he made his way back to the boats half of his being exulted sang with joy the other half recoiled when he had gone to the residencia to reclaim his seaclothes nunez had come to the door in a dressingrobe and had seen his state had an accident fell down he had mumbled the honrar had not said a word but the atmosphere had been grim and reproving the sky in the east was just lightening when the last boat pulled listlessly for the artemis he was lucky any later and he would have been put down as a straggler his leave stopped he went to his seachest to shift into his working clothes heedless of the lewd comments from the others they had spent their small means quickly had little chance of further frolics and were curious about kydd he didnt enlighten them pulling his striped shirt down over his head he emerged to see renzi the other side of the chest his face was savage but he said nothing that forenoon they were paired on the painting stage hanging over the ships side they were to scrape back the broad yellow stripe that ran along the line of the gunports kydd wanted badly to talk with his friend to let him work his logic on the situation to resolve the skeins of worry and to come to a sound conclusion renzi worked next to him his triangular iron rasping at the paintwork in vicious strokes i saw sarah last night he tried and so renzi replied acidly we we came to an understanding renzis strokes ceased well that is to say she er he mumbled so you didnt have an understanding renzi said sarcastically kydd flushed but persevered its not yet settled he said lamely and you want it settled am i to understand you wish me to advise you how best to entrap miss bullivant a dull resentment rose in kydd this was his particular friend with whom he had shared so much and who when needed was proving an obstinate enemy last night sarah and i coupled she wants t marry me renzis scraper tinkled once on the ships side and splashed daintily into the muddy water below his face went white and he stared at kydd you careless lubbers shouted an angry figure at the deckline above show a bit o life an get a move on kydd resumed his scrapes halfheartedly unwilling to look at renzi i can only tender my felicitations renzis voice was distant controlled kydd said nothing but scraped on after a while he heard renzi catch a replacement scraper before he too resumed the work thing is im not sure o the tightness of it all kydd continued the strokes ceased again surely its simple enough renzi replied his voice was tightly controlled but no longer venomous no nicholas she wants me to swallow th anchor and go ashore for good n all kydd said warmly well why not pray kydd thought and could not come up with other than the truth ive found mself since ive been t sea and dont hanker after the longshore life renzi bit his lip the nub of it i believe he began with a slight tremor to his words is whether you love her enough for long moments kydd hesitated i dont know you must know kydd faced his friend that is th point dye see his earnest expression made renzi drop his eyes i lay with the woman i must own but i cannot in all truth say before you that i love her the stage swung with a small movement of the ship renzi sat motionless so where does m duty lie kydd asked for a long time renzi mechanically picked at the seafaded paintwork the problem was not of a class that could yield readily to logic and without the confidence and comfort of solid reasoning at his back he felt diminished duty he admitted finally is a stern mistress he was uncomfortably aware that he had been overborne by emotion in the last few days and now he was failing his friend there was such an entanglement of ramifications in this problem rooted in society personal feelings obligation and his own reactions he pulled himself together my dear friend in this matter alas i cannot help it distresses me but i would rather not betray your trust with glib emollients or superficial observations i am sorry but kydd nodded once and turned back to his work instead of hurrying ashore at noon kydd slowly climbed to the bare foretop he could be sure of being undisturbed there and the clean seamanlike expanse spoke to him of other things he sat with his back against the foremast and gazed unseeingly across the anchorage he had lain with sarah that was the solid fact at issue the question was did he therefore owe her a moral obligation she was a warm passionate woman who in marriage would see to his needs and more that was clear but marriage he intuitively realised might involve more than that a woman needed security and stability his mind shied at the images of domesticity that this idea generated the dreary round of politeness social calls suffocating conformity and love for some reason she had been attracted to him but he sensed the emotional power that ruled her actions and was instinctively repelled he himself could never relinquish control like that he sighed deeply in all this he knew that he must do what was right for sarah not himself his sense of personal honour and moral duty ran deep and true he would not be able to live with it for the rest of his life should he make a selfish choice on deck cundall stared upwards trying to make out what kydd was doing foretop ahoy he shouted there was no reply cundall took another pull at his bottle kydd yer sad lobcock you mopin after some syebuck biddy you from the other side of the bitts renzi appeared his eyes murderous stow it he snapped rowley emerged aft on to the quarterdeck the drunken shouts had been audible over the whole deck cundall squared up to renzi an whats it ter you renzis fist took cundall in the stomach doubling him up the second a moment later hammered the chin straightening cundall before he crumpled to the deck renzi stood over him his chest heaving then moved back to the forebitts and resumed his vigil rowley deliberately turned and gazed out over the stern in the foretop kydd pondered on oblivious so what was his duty to sarah that was now obvious so he should marry her and give up the sea if that was what she wanted but was this decision the best one for her what if he could not give her love security stability he knew too from his previous experience of exile from the sea that he could never counterfeit happiness in a landbased existence and he would end up the poorest of companions for her no this was impossible she deserved better than that she deserved a lover who would be able to provide her with the solid respectable marriage she needed he felt a strange pang at the thought of another kissing her possessing her but the conclusion was inescapable he felt the lifting of a dreadful cloud in her best interests he must be strong for both of them and refuse her it would be hard but any day the frigate could be released to take up her mission of war and they would part kydd tested the decision every way he could suspicious that it was based on hidden motives but it held firm therefore he would implement it see it through without flinching renzi saw kydd rise look once at the shore then descend the shrouds briskly he busied himself at the bitts until kydd reached the deck do i take it that you are in possession of a decision renzi enquired i am kydd said his chin lifting slightly may i know i am to refuse her i believe renzi looked at the deck doubting his ability to control his emotions his own recent reflections had led him to place their friendship out of reach of baser human urges and he would have suffered much pain were he now to lose it kydd approached the residencia with heavy but resolute steps he was unsure what he would say to sarah but he was certain of his decision and was prepared to bear any consequences arising from it nunez frowned and smoothed his robe my child he began where is sarah she has a message for you she is at present indisposed but begs leave of a visit from you at her home then i shall go t her the priest stood silently watching but kydd did not change into shore breeches and buckled shoes wearing the familiar short blue jacket and white trousers of a naval seaman he made his way to the mansion ah lee answered his knock and looked in astonishment at his appearance behind her sarah appeared and seemed taken aback also thank you ah lee i will receive mr kydd in the drawing room she had dark rings around her eyes and was dressed simply the drawing room was large and forbidding its dusty stillness at odds with kydds lively sea rig thomas why do you not dress with more circumspection she asked kydd said nothing holding his sailors hat before him and gazing at her seriously she seemed to pick up something of the gravity of his visit and straightened in her chair nevertheless it was kind in you to visit sarah i dont believe it would be a good thing were we t marry kydd said looking at her directly only the slightest tremble of her hand betrayed her feelings stuff and nonsense thomas dear you will soon get used to the land youll see she said in a feminine way going straight to the heart of the matter ive tried the longshore life sarah and it dont agree with me doesnt agree with you then consider me do you propose to take me out on the sea to live her voice had an edge to it kydd looked dogged i would be a poor shab of a husband were i t give up the sea and take up land ways her eyes grew hard this is all a nonsense thomas other men can find it in them to settle down properly why cant you he didnt reply at first wishing he had renzis powers to render with precision thoughts into words it wouldnt be fair to you sarah you deserve better n me her eyes filled you simpleton thomas its you i want need youre a man a strong and wonderful man the only real man ive ever known she hurried across and knelt by his chair imploring with her eyes my love we could be so happy together you and i think of it kydd felt his own eyes pricking with tears but he sat rigid no sarah it wouldnt be right not fair for you leaping to her feet she screamed down at him not fair not fair for me what about me why dont you ask me what i think is fair she stood over him the urgency of her passion beating at him he looked at her sadly her emotion broke and she sank to the floor in a paroxysm of tears kydd made no move to go to her letting waves of sorrow course through him choking him with their burden of grief he stood up there was no point in prolonging the moment the sooner it was past the better she heard the movement stopped weeping and glared at him youve ruined me do you hear that ruined me kydd looked at her wordlessly tenderly the tears burned and stung she glowered he hesitated then turned for the door if you go through that door i i shall never see you again he paused but did not look back never he stumbled forward thomas she screamed he opened the door and floundered out on to the street he could still hear her despairing cries inside as he lurched away lost in the most acute desolation it was possible to bear his shipmates left him well alone renzi squeezed his shoulder once then dropped his hand unable to find a word to say about what was in his heart the first messages came pleading begging pitiful kydd read each one with a set face and steadfastly remained aboard renzi did what he could he went ashore but nunez was indisposed and the door of the residencia would not open for him later a small figure could be seen at the boat landing but the captain had strong views about women aboard the figure remained staring out and was still there when the cold night drew in for kydd time hung heavy and bleak but he had resolved to take the consequences of his decision without complaint the story of his time of trial spread and in their warm generous manner the sailors found little services they could do for him rough expressions of sympathy and comradeship next morning the captain arrived aboard in a tearing hurry and almost instantiy a focsle gun banged out and the blue peter broke at the fore topmast head smiles were to be seen everywhere they were under sailing orders kydd couldnt take his eyes off the lonely figure still on the quay what agonies of mind would she endure when she learnt that the ship and he would soon be a memory in an empty anchorage at least it was now over haaaaands to unmoor ship haaands to make sail the pealing of boatswains calls cut into the cool morning air and the ship burst into life all the wellremembered duties of a ship outward bound the tang of sea air the blessed imperatives of good seamanship at the larboard cathead kydd found the strop and ranged the fish tackle ready for the big bower anchor when he looked again at the landing place the figure was no longer there the anchor was won from the pale mud of the pearl river and stirk clapped on to the tackle with him far above renzi and others cast loose the gaskets of the topsails tom whats this mate doud from his position astride the cathead pointed aft a sampan with two passengers in it was overhauling them from their quarter there was no mistaking the occupants sarah and ah lee kydd didnt know whether to cry or urge them on every so often one of the figures stood swaying dangerously in the little craft and waving furiously they were coming up fast but the topsails on the ship tumbled down from their yards and were sheeted home with a will the frigate bowed slightly under the bellying sails and immediately the ripple of a bow wave started for a time the sampan kept with them but as the trim frigate caught the wind the ripple in the bows turned to a chuckle and the little boat fell frantically astern the ship now set courses the big driving sails flapped and banged as they dropped but when they were set artemis showed her true breeding she lay to the winds and foamed ahead kydd took one last look at the tiny figure in the sampan and sank into dumb misery the lump in his throat was choking him and he could hardly see artemis gathered speed for the open sea chapter i allow that it was my decision but it was th right one and im man enough i can stand the consequences kydd said firmly his eyes were darkrimmed but there was an air of tenacious resolve about him with the coast of china a diminishing grey blur astern renzi noted that kydd had his eyes set ahead to seaward he deeply admired his friends strength of mind but he knew there would remain a sorrow that would take a long time to pass but i beg you will not talk any more of it kydd added renzi nodded and looked out ahead also it seems that we are on our way home shipmate he said regretfully yes back to the war yes kydd said again some would say that this means prize money once more and liberty ashore in england to spend it kydd turned to renzi who saw with relief a very small smile aye nicholas and you will not see yr peking renzi laughed true enough i had my heart set on meeting at least one si fu at the ching court but he had learnt there was no chance at all of that barbarians would always be held at arms length by the narrow suspicious chinese were to touch at manila on our way back i believe it would appear to be a motion to take advantage of our presence in these waters to show the spanish that we have the means to defend our interests if need be but were not at war with them not so far as i know and the opportunity is too good to miss sending a firstclass fighting ship to remind them his words were cut off by the urgent rattling of a drum at the main hatch aft quarters renzi exclaimed however it could only be an exercise it was typical of powlett to put the ship back in martial order before they had even sunk the land astern stirk looked up as kydd clattered down the fore hatchway and hastened to his gun you kydd he growled capn wants th gun captain to choose another second ter be trained up at each gun i choose you kydds stare relaxed to a surprised smile stirk did no one favours where his gun was concerned he obviously thought kydd the best man for the job kydd fell back to the rear of the gun next to stirk but to one side no mate yer captain fer now stirk said unslinging his gunners pouch and giving it to kydd he stepped aside kydd took position immediately behind the fat breech of the gun it felt very different to know that the whole elaborate ballet of the gun crew would now take its time from him the gun crew returned his gaze with differing expressions boredom seriousness interest but never contempt or distrust renzi regarded him gravely with the tiniest ghost of a smile kydds nervousness settled he glanced sideways at stirk go on cully take charge then stirk snapped cast loose kydd ordered after stirks tough growl his own voice seemed weak and thin but the muzzle was obediently cut free and the crew took up their positions kydd looked again at stirk but the man stood impassive his arms folded kydd turned back to the gun ah yes test the gunlock he inspected the big lock on the top of the breech the gunflint did not move in its clamp and the hammer eased back to full cock on its greased steel with a heavy firmness he yanked at the lanyard secured to the gunlock it gave positively and with a lethalsounding steely click a suitably fat spark jumped across his confidence increased as his orders had the gun crew sweating at their tasks rammer and sponge flailing as they hauled the heavy iron beast in and out in simulated battle at stand easy his crew sat wearily on deck their backs to the carriage gossiping just as he had done not so very long ago thatll do tom stirk said a glimmer of approval just discernible now listen ter me there followed a stream of advice given in gruff monosyllables ranging from using a thumb on the venthole to tell from the air when the cartridge was fully rammed to firing just as the deck began dipping on the downward part of a roll to ensure that the ball would smash home directly into the enemy hull kydd wiped his hands on his trousers now they would try three rounds at a mark his own gun pointed and served by him load with cartridge it was his first live order the powder monkey already had his box containing the cartridge and renzi helped himself to the grey flannel cylinder he placed it carefully in the muzzle and the doubleended rammer was twirled to send it down the bore there was a definite jet of air up the cold iron of the venthole which kydd felt with his thumb as the cartridge approached the breech end when this stopped he held up an arm renzi and the others bent to their wad and shot but kydd had no time to watch he had his pricking wire into the priming hole stabbing down until he was quite sure he had pierced the cartridge then out with a quill priming tube and into its passageway to the main charge a little priming powder in the pan of the gunlock to catch the spark and now the piece was loaded and primed a silent mass of black iron waiting only for his personal tug on the lanyard to bellow death into the outside world his palms felt moist the eyes of the others were on him as he bent to squint along the muzzle of the gun there were no sights these shipsmashers were designed for closein work but black jack powlett was merciless with those who threw away their shot by not placing their fire precisely where it would do the most good the sea hissed past the waves seemed higher and more lively viewed through the gunport they were closehauled on the starboard tack under easy sail which had their side of the gundeck to weather and therefore higher kydd searched about the grey sea wilderness for the mark a beef cask and flag nothing he thrust past his crew to peer through the port still nothing but a vast extent of sea and swell out to the horizon he sensed stirk next to him almost immediately stirk pointed kydd followed the line of his arm and far far away he caught a red flicker no he gasped the red flicker came and went hidden and then revealed again by the lively swell no moren a mile grunted stirk kydds experience of battle had been of the order of a few hundred yards at the most powlett was not going to make it easy point your guns rowley drawled they would track the target until given the order to open fire kydd took one last look at the mark and resumed his place behind the breech looking down the long muzzle at the bearing where he knew it to be he pointed to the lefthand side of the gun wong levered the handspike his body glistening with sweat he heaved at the truck skidding the gun round so that the muzzle bore more towards the mark kydd squinted down the gun it was impossible the gentle heaving of the frigate was enough to send the gun pointing skyward at one instant and then blankly at the sea the next and the distant mark shot past the questing muzzle this way and that as out of reach as a buzzing fly he swore in exasperation stirk eased him aside and sighted down the gun not bad be half he grunted but yerve forgotten yer has a quoin muscles bunching he worked at the wedge under the breech which moved the muzzle up or down satisfied he stepped back has a look now mate kydd found the mark and noted that the muzzle now swept above and below the mark by equal amounts but the ship was moving and the mark was already off line boldly kydd pointed to wong again gesturing with small downward movements as he had seen stirk do to indicate minor changes the gun came on target by jerks and he could see that if he could time it well he had a chance the ship sailed on steadily and he tracked carefully kydd took the opportunity of estimating when he would fire that brief hesitation between triggering the gunlock the priming catching and the powder charge going off would translate to an astonishing sweep of movement at the muzzle there was a distant shout then rowley snapped number one gun fire seconds ticked by and then the peace was split by an aggressive bang from forward followed by gunsmoke rolling out a hundred yards or more it was immediately blown back by the stiff wind and the gundeck was darkened by the acrid cloud it cleared quickly and the distant plume of the fall of shot duly showed but way to one side the smell of fresh powder smoke was pleasing to kydds senses it was manly keen and spoke of duty he kept the brutish gun muzzle squarely on the tiny red flag and waited resolutely for his turn the next vicious blang and rolling gunsmoke came from the gun next to him he tensed the smoke cleared and a splash appeared behind the mark and seventy feet to one side a good shot at this range number five gun fire at the full extent of the lanyard kydd sighted down the muzzle it rose slowly to a wave so he waited it began to fall and he was teetering on the point of firing when some seamans fine instinct made him hesitate sure enough a smaller playful wave countered the first and the muzzle lifted slightly before resuming its downward sweep he gave the lanyard a firm pull and after a brief hesitation his piece obediently thundered forth kydd arched his body and the maddened beast crashed to the rear in recoil sending towering masses of gunsmoke downrange stop yer vent he heard stirks shout dimly through ringing ears and remembered that he had to stop the flow of eroding gases through the venthole it was easily enough done but he wanted to know where his shot had gone staring at the jauntily bobbing flag he willed his ball on magically a plume rose up almost dead in line but sadly short blast me eyes but that was well done mate stirk said in admiration kydd looked at him in disbelief his shot so far was the furthest away never mind th range yer ball will take im on the ricochet not easy ter lay er true like that with a swelling pride kydd stepped back and rasped well lets see some heavy in it then y pawky lubbers yair cant come soon enough fer me ol england cundall smoothed his shining black hair and stared morosely back at the tiny mirror the only one the mess possessed kydd was sitting on his seachest to allow renzi to finish tying off the end of his pigtail now a quite respectable length again at sea he wore it clubbed the gun practice had broken the spell of his morbidity and he had managed to surround his sorrow with limits that enabled him to function on a daily basis youre quiet ned kydd said noticing douds unusual reserve doud looked up whats ter say all th time were swannin around out this godforsaken side o the world some other frigate is asnappin up the prizes sooner were back n doing what comes natural better fer all busily at work on a square wooden plate chopping herbs quashee unexpectedly spoke up yer may get yer wish earlier than you thinks ned how so

galleon finished petit loudly all looked at him in astonishment hes in the right of it mates he said his face animated fat an fair sails once a year from acapulkee in mexico fer manila stuffed to the gunnels with all the gold n silver they rips frm their colonies on all sides around the mess table eyes grew big petit continued with great satisfaction an here she comes sailin in all unsuspectin that theres a state o war which we o course are obliged to tell em happy babbling broke out but it was interrupted by a shout at the hatchway pass the word fer thomas kydd able seaman kydd ahoy kydd rose aye capn powlett passes the word fer thomas kydd the mess fell silent and stared at kydd it was unusual to the point of incredible that the captain would directly notice any of so lowly a station kydds mind raced as far as he was aware he had done nothing wrong and anyway daily discipline was the business of others he hurried to the quarterdeck the captain will see you in his cabin party said sharply sliding down the hatchway ladder kydd went aft to the broad cabin outside was a marine sentry kydd knocked carefully and heard an indistinct reply which he took to be enter powlett was at his desk as usual without a wig he never wore one at sea his closecropped hair lent intensity to his demeanour the cabin was neat and spartan the only concession to humanity a miniature of a woman on the bulkhead and below it another of an angelic child the rest of the room was dominated by the squat bulk of a pair of sixpounders and a deeply polished chart table kydd stood before his captain hat in hand and waited thank you kydd powlett said finishing writing he jabbed the quill back into the inkpot and leant back i have a problem he said in a tone that suggested problems didnt annoy him for long sir you may know we lost eleven men at macao seven by sickness kydd did not know he had had problems of his own at the time we cant replace men so easily in this part of the world he looked directly at kydd ive a mind to rate you quartermasters mate what do ye think of that nothing had been further from his mind and now it was undreamt of he would be a petty officer admittedly one of the most junior aboard but he had achieved a precious step up he had well id like it fine sir he stammered then you are so rated the first lieutenant will attend to your watch and station powlett fixed kydd with flinty eyes you are a fine seaman i can see this which is why i gave you your step you have a future but you can be disrated just as easily see that you are zealous in your work and stay away from the bottle and you may have no fear of that aye aye sir kydd said quartermasters mate petty officer kydd he left the first lieutenants cabin in a haze of joy it was only a matter of stepping into a sick mans shoes he rationalised but his inner self smugly replied who cares then sarahs image flashed before him dampening his mood he felt for her pain perhaps one day they could meet again in some other way slowly his thoughts refocused whatever the reason he was now rated a petty officer his main duty would be on the quarterdeck as mate to the quartermaster who had the conn under the officer in command responsibility for the helm and helmsmen a quartermaster owed his loyalty to the sailing master who was probably the most sea professional of all aboard kydd wondered if it had been his skill at the wheel that had won him the post he enjoyed his trick at the helm feeling the waves trying playfully to slap the vessel off course and the live vibration of the sea transmitted up through the tillerropes seeing the length of deck curving in at the bow far ahead of the helm then gently rising and falling under his urging the whole a connected symphony of motion he sighed and rejoined his mess quartermasters mate that makes you a petty officer said petit seriously yes it does then youll be shiftin your mess tonight petit asked although newrated his status entitled him to join one of the senior messes which were right aft and screened off by canvas there were only three quartermasters mates aboard so together they wouldnt make a mess but he could join the quartergunners the carpenters crew or even the elite captains of the tops no mate i think ill stay he said uneasily yer a petty officer kydd cundall repeated the others remained silent looking at him gravely slowly it dawned on him as a petty officer he had authority over every one of them including petit he couldnt stay as a friend and at the same time do his duty by the ship and it was asking too much to expect them to treat him as an equal when he wasnt yair have to move i guess renzi was nowhere to be seen and kydd felt a chill of loneliness he nodded to petit and said be on m way by th last dogwatch luck cuffin said doud softly aft next to the boatswains cabin was the screenedoff mystery of the quartergunners mess he scratched on the hanging flap a face irritated and querulous poked out what it said kydd blurted out his situation not n here yer dont the face disappeared the carpenters crew had their mess snugly fashioned for themselves and did not want another intruding an idlers mess the cooper sailmakers mates and the like offered doubtfully but they were not watchkeepers and their perspectives of life aboard were quite different kydd felt he must decline he felt rootless an outcast much as he had felt when he had been thrust aboard his first ship as a pressed man whatre you about mate stirks voice behind made him jump bin lookin fer you half the dogwatch he said looking at kydd curiously gotta get yer gear shifted afore pipe down hammocks or he pulled aside the canvas screen to a nearby mess and motioned kydd in this heres tom kydd friens quartermasters mate just rated kydd caught his breath around the mess table were petty officers men he had learnt to fear and respect they were the backbone of the navy hard men in charge of fighting tops afterguard topmen the elite captains of partofship they stared up at him some with narrowed eyes others with a shrewd wariness good t know ye kydd said in as neutral a voice as he could manage he had no idea how to address these men his claim to be a petty officer one of them now seeming a flimsy pretence they did not answer stirk went on an this kydd is the juggins oo sees a merchant hooker in a blow on er way ter davy jones gets imself streamed off in a raft from a shipotheline jus cos he thinks ter save er there was an interested stirring did yer yair but got nothing outve it later the shysters kydd said carefully a tall dark man whom kydd recognised as captain of the maintop grunted and said well get yer dunnage then kydd seems yer movin in ere with us he felt a jet of exultation then turned to stirk you quartergunner jus rated up he thrust the canvas flap aside and called back over his shoulder an we got one other royal billy in with us capn of the mizzentop kydd wondered who it could be but time was short and he had his gear to shift when he got to his old mess there were few left at the table but with a pang he saw renzi standing over their shared seachest nicholas i well renzi looked at him for a long moment then he spoke bear a fist y poxy lubber he snapped in a very good approximation of a petty officers impatient growl kydd could hardly believe his ears he glowed with pleasure you it seems i have been raised to the felicity of captain of the mizzentop renzi continued in a more normal tone and thus might aspire to more congenial quarters the mess was more snug than kydd thought possible instead of being lost in the gloom of the open mess deck the lanthorn light now shone cosily on the inside of the canvas partitions revealing on the forward one a painted scene of a furious battle at sea in which artemis was easily recognisable and on the after one several mermaids combing each others hair the racks of messtraps were more elaborate and kydd guessed that in other things there would be similar improvements he slung his ditty bag with the others along the ships side and took his seat quartermasters mate which watch are youse then kydd the tall dark man asked starbowlines and its tom he said warily crow isaac crow the man said capn of the maintop so thatd be hallison then joshua hallison whos yer quartermaster he chuckled yerve picked a right taut hand o th watch there cully another petty officer kydd knew was mullion larboard captain of the foretop he had reason to mullion was never without his colt a braided ropes end which he used impartially on his men in the belief that it was the undoubted origin of their markedly faster times he looked at kydd steadily then nodded and grunted jeb the canvas flap was thrown aside and a short but sharpfaced man entered and crashed down the grog kid on the table taking his place on one side kydd knew him only from afar as one whose temper was best avoided parry god rot his bones he said in a grating voice and noticed kydd whore you there was a visceral challenge in the tone kydd tom kydd quartermasters mate o the starbd watch he said and felt colour rising an who are you then he said boldly the man paused fixing him with colourless eyes haynes yer glass kydd reminded crow holding out his hand over the grog monkey kydd had his old pot ready then remembered that petty officers had the privilege of taking their rum neat not diluted to grog a glass was returned full of the dark mahogany liquid the powerful odour of rum heavy on the air kydd raised it in a general salute and swallowed the liquor was pungent and strong as they drank kydd began to feel the pattern of comradely warmth of his new mess crow asked him more about his time in a lineofbattle ship and others put in their contribution the lanthorn was trimmed up and mealtime conviviality set in just as the food arrived renzi appeared silent and watchful renzi said stirk briefly tiemate o kydds he added referring to the service close friends did for each other in turn plait and tie off the pigtail yeah heard of im toby grated haynes with yer when you boarded the cttqyong through the gunports he gave the smallest of nods to renzi but impaled him with his eyes renzi sat but remained quiet got a headpiece on im e as stirk added we listens ter what e as to say like the table held its reserve a sealawyer was not a popular character to be mullion broke the quiet so its manila whats this then the question was plainly directed at renzi and the others kept their silence renzis halfsmile appeared we show the dons we have the force to protect our interests in the event a good plan while we have a prime frigate in the area he flicked a glance at haynes the spanish are a proud race but they have let this part of their empire decline we will have no difficulty in impressing them here but if we are already at war the manila galleon we knows about that crow said but in a not unfriendly tone he opened the door across the racks at the ships side and drew out crockery and pewter spoons then as we have no strategic interest in the place we will quietly withdraw hayness eyes narrowed yer sayin if we take the town then garrison defend it to what purpose what have we won what are we defending there is no sense in this crow looked over at haynes with a smirk hes right an all kydd was happy that no one had commented on renzis cultured accent but he had his misgivings how would renzi fare shouting orders to his men in the mizzentop and for that matter he himself hallison was a dour man whom kydd remembered as having a short way with helmsmen who failed to measure up he looked at kydd doubtfully now lad your main dooty is the helm but theres a mort more t being a quartermaster he automatically looked up to the weather leech of the mainsail just beginning to catch the first of the weak dawn sun steer small damn you he growled at the helmsman and turned back to kydd all kind o things frm stowing the ballast to leadin the boarders who are cuttin out an enemy cos were the ones who always know how see he stared directly at kydd aye mr hallison at that moment sailors began to appear on deck some blearyeyed others surly kydd knew very well what this meant but never again would he be expected to join them in scrubbing the deck after end o the quarterdeck hallison told him kydd started then recollected himself and strode to the taffrail he glared about him but inwardly he was flinching get a move on you heavyarsed dogs he snarled at the resentful looks of the sailors he realised that perhaps this was going too far the men stood in front of him shuffling their feet resigned you he snapped picking one at random washdeck hose the man didnt say anything but went forward obediently sand he said to another the holystones were issued and he set the line of men abreast the helm to work their way aft to the stern get those men going th maudling old women parry stomped on deck he was in a bad mood and wanted to take it out on the men kydd had seen it before he called parry in a low voice to the men who took his signal and feigned fear at kydd as they worked hard with their holystones parry glowered at the group of men who knelt amid the cold gushing water and gritty sand at kydds questioning gaze he turned away to stamp forward kydd knew he was under eye from hallison and conscientiously applied his men knowing the little tricks they could be up to so well himself when they had reached the full extent of the deck hallison nodded and waited while the swabbers did their work drying the deck before calling kydd over good i dont hold with startin mself youll do kydd couldnt conceive of wielding a ropes end on good men either he beamed but hallison went on capn will be after yer skin lad he wants all his petty officers in blue jackets n buttons when theyre on deck he looked meaningfully at kydds striped shirt and knotted kerchief kydd nodded hallison glanced again at the weather leech and said go n have some breakfast be sure an relieve me at one bell it was greatly satisfying the way that seamen gave way to him at the sight of his blue jacket and twinkling brass buttons his confidence soared as he bounded up the ladder to relieve hallison he had skipped his burgoo and hardtack quickly stitching the buttons with their stout anchor to his best and only blue jacket he would not be found wanting in any particular hallison raised his eyebrows in surprise at kydds transformation but did not comment he crossed to the binnacle and reached below for the logboard opening it out he referred to the chalked entries he looked at the hanging traverse board to check that it agreed and turned to kydd course soueast b east good breeze frm the norwest mr party as the deck evans on the wheel you has the conn i have the conn kydd repeated with beating heart petty officer kydd has the conn sir hallison called to parry who looked around at the hail but only grunted and turned back are ye ready lad hallison said gravely if anything went wrong there would be no time for kydd to rush below and call him and the blame would be entirely his yes kydd said right ill have me breakfast an be up here after he disappeared down the after hatchway leaving kydd with direct responsibility for ensuring the ship actually sailed where it was supposed to nervously kydd looked over the helmsmans shoulder at the binnacle the due course lazily swam under the lubbers line see she stays that way he growled and stepped back the whites of the helmsmans eyes showed briefly as they followed kydd a hard quartermaster could make a trick at the helm a misery unable to prevent a grin of sheer elation kydd paced over to leeward and looked down the ships side at the wake bubbling and hissing its way aft he followed it as it slid away past the stern to merge in a rulerstraight line that stretched away in the distance he drew a deep breath strolled back to the helm and stood arms akimbo the picture of a taut petty officer hallison returned and took the conn again there was no comment the traverse board had been properly kept up the pegs in their holes stepping out from the centre telling of the ships progress every bell of the watch in the swelling warmth of the sun it was proving to be a fine morning the sea was in the process of changing from the greygreen of temperate latitudes to a deep tropic blue hands for exercise was piped for the forenoon and while kydd watched idly from the quarterdeck topsails were loosed and furled at a great rate he would still be required to haul on ropes but only at times when skilled seamanship was needed such as when tacking ship hallison touched his hat and kydd saw that mr prewse the sailing master had come on deck this is thomas kydd been rated quartermasters mate said hallison kydd doffed his hat and stood respectfully just so said the master looking at kydd keenly have you your letters aye sir it would probably not be to kydds advantage to mention that he had acquired an intimacy of the works of both mr diderot and mr locke recently then this afternoon i desire you should assist the mate of the hold when he opens it you shall take the reckoning he paused watching kydd pensively have you an acquaintance of the sea chart no perhaps you shall do so presentiy attend me in my cabin at four bells this forenoon mr prewse had his cabin opening on the wardroom along with all the officers except the captain this was the first time kydd had entered the area the master had personal custody of the ships charts with the responsibility of entering unusual observations such as uncharted islands or breakers betraying a reef do you take the pen and make a fair copy beneath prewse said sliding across a hatched representation in minute detail of a section of coastline from the seaward his extensive notes and sketches revealed the painstaking care he brought to his responsibility kydd took the chair in the cramped cabin and pulled the lamp closer it was charged with spermaceti oil and gave a pure clean flame well suited to the close work he lifted the pen and inspected it it was the smallest quill he had ever seen the carefully shaped nib ending in a tiny hairs breadth he dipped it into the stone well and set to work i shall return in one bell prewse said with keen eyes and hands unaffected by grogtremor kydd executed a neat and clean drawing as near as he could judge to the original well before the masters return he sat quietly waiting but his eyes were drawn to the chart underlying his sketch the great china sea it said in large curlicued words in the tide cartouche and in smaller print was from lye moon to the philippine islands modestly beneath in plain letters was by james boyde a master in the royal navy mdcclviii there was a scale at the edge and it was covered with tiny numbers but the expanse of china and a spill of islands were clear enough complex star concentrations of lines were scattered randomly across the chart lines that to kydd made not the slightest sense at the bottom were several views of coastlines similar to the one kydd had just done and he bent with interest to look at them the great captain cook never sailed these seas yon is a poor enough thing to compare kydd had not heard prewse return and scrambled awkwardly to his feet no lad sit yself down he picked up kydds work hmm a fair hand ye have i think we can make use of you kydd is it not sir kydds eyes strayed back to the chart the masters eyes softened i lost a good man in macao t the bloody flux you show willing and you cn take his place by yr leave sir i need t get m learning as quartermaster first kydd said respectfully he didnt want to be tied to sedentary work below while the action was on deck you shall prewse said sharply there was no need for the raucous thunder of the drum at the main hatch everyone knew they would approach the spanish possession of the yslas philipinas in this cool dawn at quarters guns run out and battle ensign swirling defiantly if war had already been declared there was every chance that spain would send out a squadron to their territory that would make it a risky business to approach the deeply enclosing manila bay when far inside if there were powerful enemy menowar within a rapid escape could prove problematical artemis raised land at three bells the northern tip of the enclosing arm of the great bay the opposing southern tip was visible a bare ten miles away but ahead it was as if they were passing into open sea closer to the passage first one then many small fishingcraft appeared with their double outriggers and nipa sails they skimmed like pond insects in the calmer seas keeping the occupants brown skins wet with spray they kept effortlessly with the frigate which was under easy sail some waving but all clearly curious at the big warship arriving there was a scattering of small lowlying islands in their path a number with isolated white buildings glistening in the strengthening sun and an indeterminate flag flying on one lookouts were posted at each masthead and two at each top even so the highest could not detect the inner limits of the bay within the far horizon they passed into the wider expanse tension mounting they might well be fighting for their lives within the hour sail hooooothe fore masthead lookout yelled his outstretched arm was flung out to fine on the leeward bow parry hastened to clamber up the foreshrouds his telescope awkwardly under his arm in the foretop he had it up instantly trained on the bearing for a space nothing then deck hoooan avisoa fast government despatch boat she would have had no warning of their approach as her single sail grew in definition they saw it angle towards them artemis held her course and the aviso closed to within clear visual distance then pirouetted about and foamed back the way she had come the die was now cast they approached the far side of the bay where the city of manila was clearly distinguishable every spyglass was up and trained straining for the sight of menowar the minutes dragged at last it became clear there was no danger the long anchorage off the sleepy tropical city was dotted with a scattering of merchant ships and native craft scudding about but not even a minor warship was to be seen powlett swept his glass up and down the coast then back to the squat sprawling fort that was becoming prominent on the flat land they do not appear to be concerned mr fairfax he grunted no sir fairfax said not easing his habitual worried expression then we take it they have no news of a war keep the men at the guns but prepare a salute on the focsle powlett ordered it would be a folly to trust the dons i believe the frigate by far the biggest vessel in the anchorage slowed in its approach it would be their folly to take us for fools growled parry we can take the whole lot o these should we please powletts sardonic smile was hedged with exasperation have a care mr parry you will remark the flags of these ships i see but one with spanish colours ah there we have an english our proof there is no war he snapped his glass closed a heavy thud drew attention to the fort smoke drifted from the embrasures another gun fired prepare our salute mr fairfax dont look up t much doud said doubtfully looking shorewards at the low somnolent landscape with its fringing palms muddy river oozing into the bay and the maze of rickety huts on the outer fringes of the small city above all was the smell of the warm heavy odour of pigs and tropical vegetation around the ship hovered a dozen or more of the distinctive twinoutrigger boats hawking strange fruits fish and vegetables they were kept at a respectful distance by a vigilant watchondeck don ye worry mate itd have ter be the first sailors port ever without its got its cunny burrows cundall had his back to kydd deliberately excluding him from the conversation on the focsle this would be the last port of call before they reentered the indian ocean on their way back to england that could in any way be classed as civilisation and powlett would be sure to grant shoreleave yere missin a fuckle are ye cundall said doud contemptuously he winked openly at kydd past cundall kydd felt awkward unsure of how he should relate to his old friends in his new rating he winked back and gave an uneasy smile doud sauntered past cundall and stood companionably next to kydd at the fore shrouds whats his grandevity think o this tom gratefully kydd took up the lead nicholas thinks were wastin time if it was war this time o year wed have no chance t catch the manila galleon and the prizes wed take wouldnt be worth sailin all the way back grimacing doud nodded thought as much sooner we head back better it is fer all kydd felt grateful to doud not so much for the friendliness but for how he had shown kydd that he could still be sociable with old friends and wear a different face when on duty the bell sounded sharp behind them a double strike kydd made a brief goodbye and went aft to his partofship station we has visitors then murmured one of his men waiting at the base of the mizzen he nodded to a merchant ships longboat approaching artemis from astern it was pulled by four sailors who were making heavy weather of it in the sternsheets was a single figure from his cocked hat and breeches obviously no seaman boat ahoooybawled the mate of the watch quinlan the boat did not lie off and hail but made to come alongside immediately stand off the boat roared quinlan the officer of the deck rowley stepped over to the ships side give him a cold shot if he tries it again he said a grinning seaman helped himself to a twelvepounder carronade roundshot and held it above his head at the threat the boat ceased rowing and the men lay on their oars one of the men in the sternsheets scrambled to his feet swaying wildly he called out but his thin fretful voice was impossible to catch in the slop and hurry of waves against the ships side when this produced no response from the frigate the man threw down his hat in exasperation and shook his fist perhaps we should allow that untutored boor to approach drawled rowley easing his cuffs only one to come aboard hallison when the man finally appeared over the bulwarks he had worked himself into a state you sir he stormed at rowley you are the master of this vessel this this rowley waited allowing the splutters to subside no sir i am not lieutenant rowley third of his majestys frigate artemis he said with a slight bow that would not have been out of place at introductions in carlton house the man stared then resumed tetchily kindly fetch him then if you please captain powlett is not at liberty to see you sir rowley said sharply he is ashore paying his respects to the governor then sir i shall wait his plain dark grey and black garb suggested he was perhaps a member of the clergy i should be obliged if you would state your business sir said rowley stiffly no business of yours i assure you sir it is your captain i wish to see and the matter is i might allow of a degree of urgency rowley hesitated he may well be some time might i suggest i shall wait however long it takes he folded his arms and glared at rowley who pursed his lips get a chair from the wardroom he ordered when it arrived he thumped it to the deck and gestured mutely powlett returned over an hour later his face tight the boatswains calls twittered and he hauled himself rapidly up the side god in heaven whats this he roared at the sight of the figure sitting obstinately in a chair in the middle of the deck you are the captain the man said icily who the devil powlett threw at rowley sir this man hobbes edward hobbes you may be acquainted with the name the high hectoring voice could not have been more calculated to inflame powlett on his own quarterdeck but his hesitation more at the effrontery than at an effort of memory gave hobbes more time or perhaps not it is of no consequence he fumbled inside his coat and brought out an envelope but i rather fancy this is he handed it to powlett with a drooping wrist the fouled anchor cypher of the board of admiralty prominent on the envelope powlett accepted it with bad grace and took out the contents to read you will note the provision of all possible assistance from any kings ship hobbes said with an irritating level of assurance i see from this that you are a man of science sir who is at present engaged in a voyage of discovery i do not possibly see how this can be allowed to affect the affairs of a shipofwar then sir i will tell you hobbes looked around the anchorage and pointed that is my ship a brig of some species it has split its front mast in a storm and until it gets a piece of the right kind of wood from somewhere or other it seems it cannot venture further on the high seas his nostrils pinched in exasperation my purpose sir is astronomical it is essential for me to be at a point on the meridian diametrically in opposition to that of greenwich on a date not far hence for a crucial observation the nature of which need not concern you thus you will see that i am at a stand sir in need of conveyance to that point to the great south sea i have no need to remind you powlett stared in amazement sir am i to understand that you are asking me to divert the course of my vessel some two thousand miles for your sole convenience hobbes stiffened my convenience is not the point at issue but that of science is this observation adds materially to the sum of knowledge of the earths precession which i would have thought would interest even the meanest practitioner of navigation he finished in tones laced with sarcasm powlett straightened not possible this frigate is a manowar not a damned hobbes leant forward and spoke in a flat hard voice i have no need to remind you captain that the letter is signed by sir philip stephens himself who is also acquainted to me personally should you be the cause of my inability to discharge my duty to the admiralty then i have no doubt that you may very well so be it your letter is authority enough but there will be an accounting of this sir mark my word hobbes eased back in satisfaction mr prewse we shall return home eastabout by cape horn be so good as to attend me in my cabin at six bells with charts then i may instruct my assistant to convey aboard my instruments hobbes said it was a statement not a question assistant powlett snapped mr evelyn a most able young man and our servants of course powletts eyes glittered dangerously and your cook and washerwoman no doubt hobbes sniffed there is no need to be facetious captain i might remind you that time is of the essence no liberty ashore the slivey bastards what right d they have t tell black jack what time o day it is haynes was pale and dangerous kydd kept his silence renzi replied quietly every right theyre on an admiralty mission and were a kings ship but i dont believe that is the reason why we cant step off recollect that this is spanish territory and they will not take kindly to our presence there is every possibility of a fracas if we are allowed ashore therell be a frackarse if we aint allowed mate crow said without humour the moody silence was broken by mullion whose heavy jaw and brass earrings squared with his big tough hands to give an impression of indomitable strength yer could be overlookin somethin gents he said a smile lurking an whats that haynes snapped wes headed t the great south sea an while that aint a prime place fer prizes yer recollects that fer quimstickin it cant be beat kydds knowledge of native island people was limited to popular lurid tales ranging all the way from cannibalism to an idyllic eden the rest of the mess reanimated and talk quickened there was a scratching at the canvas flap haynes being nearest stuck out his head with a baleful yeah mr fairfax wants you ter vittle in them scientifical gents mr haynes rumbled an unknown voice not ere e doesnt cully haynes said abruptly an he did say youse are the smallest mess n can take two easylike haynes cursed the wardroom takes two n their servants come ere the voice continued remorselessly what shall i tell im the pair could not have made more of a contrast thank ye gennelmen said one brightly ben doody an i takes care o mr evelyn yer wont need ter see me offen he added his large threecornered hat awkwardly in his big hands probably more because of the low deckbeams than out of respect his bucolic figure beamed down on them the other was a pinched crabbed man whose drab black resembled that of a downatheel clerk his first comment was a sour we expec to take our vittles in private yunderstands haynes rose slowly and advanced on him the man backed away but tripped on a ringbolt and fell to his knees kydd helped him up and asked an who r you rance jeremiah rance he looked viciously at haynes and added servant o mr hobbes yerve got yer dunnage crow said mildly looking from one to the other doody looked perplexed but rance thumbed towards the deck outside yeah we have outside he stood aside to allow someone to move past to carry the baggage inside nobody moved crow looked at haynes seriously but haynes returned the look with cruel glee gonna be a long vyage home they tells me sir its quite impossible our charts are old of th last age it is madness even to consider the matter the sailing master was uncharacteristically blunt and powlett glowered but subsided and by this you are saying that we cannot reach their meridian in time we must take risks sir the table was overflowing with charts and kydd carried still others under his arm risks the word is too soft sir these islands are so numerous no man has counted them and they are of the coral kind whose fangs can tear the heart out of the stoutest vessel even capn cook was near to founderin after takin the ground on a coral islet powletts baffled fury was barely held in check the main philippine islands ran a thousand miles north and south a barrier to any ship from the china sea that wanted to enter into the limitless expanses of the pacific ocean the spaniards pass through safely enough i have heard the name san bernardino mentioned aye sir but they have the charts an the pilots both o which they would rather fry in hell than let us have sir it is my duty t say its mortal danger to our vessel should we flog about in unknown seas looking for a passage we have no choice but to sail endelong around three four hundred miles north same distance back the other side it sticks in m craw mr prewse and we fail the mission powlett tossed down the chart and stared in frustration through the broad stern windows kydd stirred sir he found himself saying we have doody one o th gentlemans servants he hold yr peace prewse muttered gathering up the charts this is not business fr you but powlett turned round what is it kydd well sir he says as how they got a visit frm the shore some spanish lord mayor or somethin who was greatly anxious t get south to the central part he offered em gold dollars if theyd take him there kydd noticed prewses tight expression but continued respectfully o course they had t refuse him but beggin yr pardon sir seems t me that you could offer him a passage an in return he sees y safely through to the further side y cant trust the dons sir powletts hand rasped on his chin as he mused its a long way from manila to the central parts id wager the details of any arrangement would not necessarily need to be of concern to this mayors superiors he straightened in decision lets get him aboard promise of passage for money and well discuss the alternative afterwards rowleys minimal spanish was barely adequate but the minor grandee affected not to notice a darkcomplexioned man with glittering black eyes he was extraordinarily controlled in his expression and gestures each movement considered and graceful but watchful withal not knowing the naval salutes due a spanish corregidor powlett had lined the entry point with as many boatswains mates as he could find the ceremonial calls sounded strident and clear clearly gratifying to the proud spaniard he bowed and scraped with the utmost courtesy but was reluctant to go below with the first lieutenant there had been few firstclass fighting frigates seen before in these waters stirk watched the proceedings with interest from the focsle where they gonna get their swedes down hobbes as the cabins at that moment crow arrived aft on the gundeck yerve not heard its out o bounds ter us worried therell be a frackarse the term was going around the ship fast a hesitant doody emerged by the afterhatch looking around he spotted kydd and waved kydd grinned and beckoned him forward mr obbes is in a rare op takin doody chuckled wont speak ter the spanish gennelman says as how well never get t his meridian in time cos of his delay why the orlmighty rush somethin ter do with his instryments has t take readins an such on the far side o the world at exactly at the same time as they does in greenwich but why your evelyn e seems a sharp sorta hand crow said he is lives fer is science seen him up past midnight areadin his books n papers but he takes care an dismisses me fer the night bless is heart kydd smiled so this cruise could be t your liking oh aye i engaged ter mr evelyn t see the world an i have his broad country face beamed ill have such a grand lot o tales ter tell em back in the village why ill not need t buy me an ale fer months the sailors roared with laughter and doody looked about him delighted heres yer mate crow said seeing rance tramp up the fore hatchway sighting doody he approached obbes wants is stores stowed away he ordered an hes sayin now doody winked at the seamen and left with rance artemis stretched south at speed the northwest monsoon perfect for the cruise through an inland sea past tropical islands some hundreds of miles long like the mountainous mindoro some no more than tiny sandy islets a hundred yards long all were densely verdant with jungle down to the waters edge and little sign of human presence the corregidor and his small party kept to themselves and were seldom seen this was an agreeable thing for the seamen for hobbes had the habit of striding the decks at dawn impeding the sailors at their cleaning duties and he was always followed by a cloud of muttered curses by the following afternoon artemis was slipping down the coast of panay the blue mountains of the interior plain to see as the first dogwatch was struck on the bell she hauled her wind to shape course to an easterly around the southern tip of the island and as dusk began to draw in they reached their destination the small provincial town of yloylo in the lateafternoon sun a cluster of buildings could be seen lying low and level at the waters edge their whiteness contrasting against the inky blue of the sea the deep green of the thick tropical vegetation and a gathering red sunset man the side the corregidor wasted no time in disembarking artemissbarge was specially called away for the task as the boats crew pulled lustily for the shore hobbes watched them go then turned to powlett may i know why we are not immediately proceeding on our way lose not a moment sir we damn and blast we cannot stir but we have a pilot powlett snarled if the don keeps his part o the bargain a tropical dusk fell and lights began to glimmer in the violet gloom ashore the barge crew long since returned a long bulking shadow in the sea nearby was the high brown island that sheltered yloylo and the peculiar odours of a foreign shore could be occasionally made out but for want of a pilot the ship lay unmoving in the night the next day was only an hour old when activity was seen ashore which resolved into a twin outrigger boat skimming its way directly towards artemis two men were aboard a spaniard and a filipino the boat with its single brightly coloured lateen sail smartly came about in a rainbow shower of spray and drifted up to the side the boatboy flung a painter of coarse coir rope aboard the frigate and the spaniard climbed the side piloto he stated loudly as though not expecting to be understood by the english officers his eyebrows lifted at rowleys fractured welcome to which he replied in loud but simple words our pilot sir said rowley mr er salcedo i think he begs that the bangkha be towed astern as they will use it later in their return very well powlett answered his keen look at the man seemed to discommode him or it could have been the sheer intimidating size of the frigate much bigger than the usual trading vessels of the region salcedo was short and stumpy with an iberian intensity but his attempt at swagger did not convince he went to the side and shouted angrily at the boatboy who doused and stowed the sail paying out more of the painter and doubling it around the mast he scrambled awkwardly up the side and as he came over the bulwark stumbled and sprawled headlong salcedos eyes flickered to the quarterdeck gathering and back to the helpless boatboy he snorted angrily from inside his shirt he drew out a peculiar short coil of a black flexible substance chased in leather at one end the other terminating in a knobby excrescence he lashed at the boatboy who waited motionless on hands and knees but when the blows ceased he looked up with a deadly hatred powletts face hardened take that man forward and see hes messed comfortably prewse motioned to kydd who led away the boatboy it seemed the logical thing pinto was a portuguese which was nearly spain and in the event grudgingly admitted to the language kydd handed the man over his brown face and black eyes clearing at the rough sympathy his treatment had earned from the sailors pinto it became clear knew more than a little spanish for he was able to explain salcedos curious instrument he was beat wi the pizzle o the horse he said blankfaced ver painful but hurt th honour more whats his name he say his name goryo this is the ylongos name he come from guimaras tell im well see him right mate petit said by the time kydd had reached his post at the helm the ship was at stations to unmoor ship the anchor was broken easily enough from the sandy seabed and sail dropped from every yard with a graceful sway artemis reached out over the sparkling seas towards the eastern horizon almost exactly halfway along the barrier of the philippines the pilot stood impassive next to the wheel but all the officers of artemis and the sailing master were on the quarterdeck as well it was hard to take trusting the safety of the ship to one man and there was an aura of apprehension among them panay was left astern but other islands large and small were scattered about on all sides by early afternoon one in particular loomed across their path and in the background the greyblue of a continous mountainous coast in the further distance stretched as far as they could see in both directions a complete block on their further progress powlett was taking no chances in the forechains kydd was heaving the lead a skilled and wet job held by a canvas belt to the shrouds he stood alone on the narrow platform at their base leaning out over the sea hissing past below he began each cast with a swing which would get bigger and bigger until he could whirl the long lead weight in a neat circle over his head before sending it plummeting into the sea well ahead the line would rush out while the vessel overran the position and when the line was vertical kydd interpreted the depth from the nearest mark to the water red bunting black leather a blue serge or if it lay between marks it would be estimated as a deep it was not a job for the fainthearted a hesitant fist on the line could bring the sevenpound lead down on an unprotected skull no bottom with this line bawled kydd as cast after cast brought no sudden slackening of the line he continued his work steadily with the same result the wet line rapidly soaking him ahead lay the island the officers faces tightened as the frigate sailed closer this is the island of masbate apparently rowley said in response to salcedos grunting artemis kept her course anxious eyes staring forward all along her deck sir were standing into danger blurted parry fixing his eyes balefully on salcedo who continued to look ahead sullenly powlett glanced at salcedo the passage through will be narrow and difficult mr parry we will follow this fellows course kydd cast the lead once more it plunged into the sea but this time the line slackened he hauled it taut quickly and when the ship overtook it his hail changed by the deep twelve the deadly coral now lay seventyodd feet below the sea on the quarterdeck the group of men looked at each other steady on course said rowley the tension grew and on deck seamen off watch looked at each other uneasily by the mark ten kydd pulled in the line quickly hand over hand and as he did so he caught a subliminal flicker of a paler shape passing swiftly below followed by an indeterminate darker shape before the sea resumed its usual deep bluegreen it was always disturbing for a sailor to sense that things other than an infinite depth lay beneath the keel and a coral seabed was quite outside kydds experience sixty feet and artemis drew about eighteen feet at her deepest the stern salcedo seemed edgy his gaze was clamped as though fixing a mark although there was nothing that remotely resembled a seamark on the lush slopes of the island ahead kydd watched carefully the red bunting hung wetly from the leadline a few inches above the water by the deep eight he bawled only thirty feet separated the vulnerable bottom of artemis from the cruel coral now the alternating pale and dark was common he shivered and brought in the line for another cast this time it was the master who spoke sir i should bring it to yr attention unless we bear away soon we will not weather the point he hesitated then continued this is hard sir to stay quiet while we enter into hazard at the word of a spaniard powlett snapped back this will be a channel we are following it makes no sense for the fellow to wreck us ashore by the mark five kydds hail carried clear to the quarterdeck ten feet below the keel an instant stirring among the officers but salcedo continued to gaze doggedly ahead this is too much sir we will be cast ashore the master confronted powlett who thrust him aside stand fast he roared at that moment there was a scuffle on the foredeck and pinto raced aft followed by a shambling goryo clearly enjoying the effects of generous offerings of grog sir panted pinto to the captain knuckling his forehead this ylongos he tell me we are condemn in his urgency the english wilted salcedo looked sharply at him and then at the filipino what powlett bellowed salcedo jabbered tensely at the filipino who shouted back pintos eyes stared wildly sir they mean to run us on the reef and leave us as plunder fer the natives chapter for a split second there was a shocked silence broken only by kydds anxious yell by the deep four then came a burst of simultaneous action salcedo dived for the bulwarks and was brought to the deck with a crash by hallison powlett bellowed orders that had the frigate sheering into the wind to check her ongoing surge and all hands rushed to the side to look down into the ginclear waters the coral bottom was clearly visible twentyfive feet below a riot of colourful rocks interspersed with bright patches of sandy bottom with just enough depth to shade all with an ominous hue the frigate drifted forward slowly despite her backed sails the trap had been well sprung heading for the sloping reef with the wind constant from astern there was no way the squarerigged vessel could simply turn into the wind and claw off there was little time as artemis lay hove to powlett turned to parry into the boat find a passage ahead out he wheeled on salcedo and get this villainous dog out of my sight in irons parry lost no time in shedding his cocked hat and other encumbrances he signalled to doud who went over the bulwarks and into the mizzenchains pulling the bangkha up to allow parry to board it before following himself the boatboy headed over the side and emerged spluttering he heaved himself up into the narrow craft and doud surrendered the little steering oar to him stopping only to claim kydds hand lead the bangkha skimmed off at an angle kydd took another leadline and resumed his duty watching the reef garden pass beneath them at a slow walking pace as the frigate drifted he saw occasional heads of coral rising above the exotic undersea plain their details horrifyingly clear twenty feet all eyes were on the bangkha which was half a mile off and seemed preoccupied with a particular area it was a fearful thing to face the impending destruction of their magnificent fighting machine but when it was also their home their refuge their everything kydd felt a cold uncertainty creeping into him he gathered the line for another cast but before he could begin the swing he felt the frigate tremble through his feet almost immediately another subliminal rumble came and then the ships drifting was checked and the vessel seemed to pivot around slightly he heard a grumbling scrape at the hull aft the sea grew rapidly cloudy with pale particles sudden fear showed in every face then the ship swung free and continued its slow drift kydd looked around for the bangkha it was a mile away at the point off the end of the large island but it was returning with parry standing erect at peril of being taken by the long boom the bangkha whirled to a stop a few hundred yards off the bow parry ducked the sail and stood at his signal the vessels fore topsail loosed and with steerage way on artemis altered towards her the bangkha waited then skimmed ahead to another point they were still heading towards the island but angling towards its tip and kydd felt instinctively that they were following a slightly deeper channel implied by a tidescour around the point certainly the soundings had steadied they passed close to the island almost within earshot of the small group of villagers gathering on the seashore who watched in awe as the big ship passed so near a few waved shyly but the ships rate of progress was so quick that they were the other side of the island and stretching away beyond in minutes the coral fell away rapidly to an anonymous cobalt blue the carpenter clumped up from below to report a dry hold and parry was cordially slapped on the back as he returned on deck pinto touched his forehead and spoke to powlett th ylongos say he know where we go an it is distant nine leagues there he visit his brother he said more sail was made and to lifting hearts artemis foamed away over the glittering sea a splendid sight captain hobbes had finished his breakfast below unaware of the drama of the morning and was now ready to take a stroll about the decks he looked at powlett curiously i see your spanish friend has incurred your wrath he certainly appears unhappy at his fate raging below that he is to be sacrificed when the ship strikes the rocks his expression was politely enquiring but powlett didnt enlighten him ahead the impassable barrier loomed but it soon became clear that the northern part overlapped the south and before the noonday meal was piped they had taken on substance and reality and a steep channel had opened between them it widened and there was a slight swell the southern point drew back to reveal a small but definite slot of daylight between the two land masses the channel broadened more and they began breasting the swell that could only come from a great ocean long languorous and effortlessly driving into the shore god be praised muttered hobbes powlett came to a decision ask this fellow indicating goryo where there is water we take the opportunity to wood n water while we can it was a scene of tropic splendour kydd felt an uncouth intruder in his rough seaclothes as he stepped out of the boat and into the sandy shallows of a sheltered bay on the inward side of the point this is enchantment incarnate renzi breathed treading softly on the sandy beach as they headed for the shade of the fringing palm trees there was a guilty thrill in stepping on to the soil of a spanish colony but a very real apprehension too for if a spanish manowar suddenly rounded the point to dispute with artemis the small shore party would necessarily be abandoned and apart from goryos assurances there might be a spanish fort over the jungletopped cliffs further inland at this very moment a party of soldiers could well be slashing their way towards them through the undergrowth armed marines hastened to secure each end of the beach kydd was uneasily aware that in the event of trouble the most they could achieve would be a small delay but that might be enough to enable them to return to the cutter which now lay safely bobbing to a small anchor a dozen yards out bows to sea the vivid island jungle with its colour and noise distracted kydd he keenly felt his new responsibility for his small party spread some canvas then you scowbunkin lubbers he shouted as much at renzi as his own men who stood about gaping at the profusions of nature renzis party would fill the huge leaguer casks at the spring among the rocks after kydds party emptied them of old water remaining and rolled them up the beach but at the moment renzi was wasting time standing in admiration at the scene reluctantly the men began the task stagnant water bubbling out into the golden sand then the cask was bullied up the beach under the enormous palms and to the rocks a little further along the leaguer would be a crushing half a ton in weight when filled and therefore would need to be parbuckled on spars down the soft sand there would be no laborious loading into the boat however fresh water was lighter than salt and the huge casks would be gently floated out to the ship kydd put his shoulder to the barrels with the rest and the work proceeded he couldnt help darting uneasy glances at the dense foliage at the edge of the jungle thinking of what might lie behind the thick verdancy this land was exotic and subdy alien it would be good to make it back to the familiar safety of the ship a preternatural disquiet seized him something round about him had changed and he was not sure what the hair on the back of his neck rose the big barrel came to a stop but the illnatured mumbling trailed off when the men saw kydds face he froze trying to let his senses tell him then he had it it was the quiet the raucous racket of parakeets had subsided their quarrels retreating into the distance and letting an ominous silence descend kydds eyes searched the thick undergrowth was that the glint of an eye an unnatural shaking of leaves they were unarmed if there was a sudden rush it would all be over in moments his palms sweated as he considered what to do delay would only allow the hidden numbers to swell until they were ready to attack he yelled hoarsely at the nearest sentry and picking up a coopers iron stumbled towards the jungle path barely visible in the fringing growth if he and the sentries could buy the others time terrified squeals broke out and into the open burst at least a dozen nutbrown children they clutched at each other in fear staring at kydd with big black eyes fr gods sake he blazed lowering the coopers iron and letting his hearts thudding die down his expression might have been suitable for crowding on to an enemy deck but now he forced a smile yr nothin but a bunch of rascals dye hear he called they stood fearfully and kydds eyes were caught by the spasmodic tug of a small boy at his older sisters ragged dress come here y little weasels he said holding his hands out and clicking his fingers nobody reacted until the small boy stepped forward half a pace and called out boldly pinipigbefore swiftly assuming the safety of his sisters skirt the cry was repeated by others and more until a regular chant began pirnpig pinipig pinipig the other sailors had come up with kydd at the sight of the children but now they growled in exasperation oo are they callin a pig then a tough able seaman snapped take a strap to em i will said an older seaman kydd advanced on them but they kept up their chant baiting the sailors suddenly pinto appeared followed by goryo kydd had not heard their noiseless approach in the bangkha tell em theyre in fr a hidin if they keep it up said kydd but already goryo was shouting at them in a curious tongue more like the babble of rivergravel in a stream it had little effect goryo turned to pinto and spoke to him sheepishly he say el ninos very rude to foreigner pinto relayed on an he want t apologise for them the sailors glared he say that when island traders come they always give pinipig children think you are big you have many pinipig pinto prodded further to discover that pintpig was the basis of a much prized delicacy of visayan children dispensed in the form of a bamboo tube stuffed with pounded toasted young rice flavoured with coconut milk and palm sugar laughing kydd unknotted his red kerchief no pinipigs he said softly but this is fr you he held it out to the older sister who advanced shyly and accepted it with a bob delightedly trying it on in different styles goryos face softened and he murmured a few more words to pinto who looked at him sharply he say plis excuse they are all excite because tomorrow christmas you will of course be aware that this spanish colony must be papist renzi said no heathens these as if in confirmation the little ones eyes sparkled and the chant changed to chreestmaaas chreestmaaas kydd stared at the happy bunch their careless joy was identical to what must be happening on the other side of the world in england time had passed unmarked for kydd but at home there would now be the frosting of december cold stark leafless trees and bitter winds here there was brilliant sun and exotic colour outlandish feastfoods and an unknown tongue when he turned to renzi his eyes had misted so much had happened in the year since he had been torn away from his own family by the pressgang and he knew he could now never return to that innocent existence he had changed too much he cleared his throat and bawled at his men stap me y sluggards ill sweat some salt out o yr bones its monstrous spluttered hobbes there is no time to lose sir powlett rubbed his chin it is clear sir you have no knowledge of the sea service before we may begin our venture upon the great south sea we must rattle down the foreshrouds and er sway up the mizzen topmast he turned to the boatswain that is so is it not mr merrydew aye sir he confirmed bewildered and this will take us until near sunset tomorrow powlett went on ifn you says sir and therefore i see no reason not to grant liberty ashore to those hands not required he looked squarely at hobbes you may go ashore if you wish to sir hobbes snorted and stalked off pass the word for the purser we will see if fresh fish and greenstuff can be got while we have the chance sir mr fairfax sir the spaniard will you hang him the scurvy rogue do you think i should it was a nice problem without question he had been instructed in the deed so who was the more guilty well sir i he has failed he did not succeed in his purpose we leave him to return and explain himself punishment enough but sir he will implicate the savage not if it is explained to him that in such an event we will have no other recourse than subsequently to express our deepest gratitude to his superiors for his safe pilotage through the strait for the merest pittance in gold the next day most of the ships company of artemis padded down the jungle path captain powlett and the first lieutenant leading with goryo and pinto the rest following respectfully behind all in their best shoregoing rig stirk shouldered a seachest and was flanked by kydd and crow who also carried small bundles there would be no danger from the indolent spaniards on this holy day and so far from the provincial centres powlett could rest easy with his men ashore for a few hours a cannon fired from the ship would have them back in minutes as they walked the familiar sounds of the sea fell behind replaced by the curious cries of geckoes the swooping mellow call of the oriole the screech of parrots sudden rustles in the undergrowth were perhaps wild pigs or other unknown species they halted at the edge of the village and were met by the wizened cabeza his formal speech was rendered in spanish by goryo and in turn to english by pinto the words may have suffered on their journey but the sentiments were plain powlett bowed and they moved on into the village the inhabitants stood in awe grouped in the open clearing before the nipa palm thatched huts to one side a glowing pit was tended by the old men of the village whose job it was to slowly turn the lechon an enormous spitted roast pig gracefully shown to one side the captain sat with the cabeza at the only table with a covering goryo and pinto standing behind the rest of the men sat crosslegged on the bare earth keenly aware of the tables on the opposite side of the clearing waiting to be loaded with food stirk placed the seachest strategically behind powlett it contained unused remnants of finery left over from lord elmhursts entourage at the right time it would be brought forth but not now chivvied by one of the adults a file of children approached and shyly presented to each man a little package wrapped in a charred banana leaf unsure the men looked to their captain powlett gingerly unwrapped the parcel inside was a discoloured rice cake bibtngka said goryo with satisfaction kydd did likewise and bit into it the taste was a chaotic mix of flavours that made him gag powlett recovered his composure first and politely enquired of the cabeza it transpired they were eating gelatinous rice with fermented coconut milk and salted eggs pressed into line the children sang it was a remarkably unselfconscious performance full melodious and clear but no tune that kydd could recognise renzi sat next to him delicately picking at his bibingka he didnt respond to kydds comment wearing a faraway look that discouraged talk a hush descended powlett got to his feet bosuns mate he growled pipe hands to carols hesitating only for an instant the mans silver whistle whipped up and the call pealed out harsh and unnatural in the jungle clearing haaaands to carols he roared the men stood up and shuffled their feet away in a manger said powlett awaaaay in a manger bellowed the boatswains mate douds voice sounded out first pure and clear a bass picked up and others followed and soon the ships company was singing in unison kydd stole a glance at haynes the hard petty officer was singing his voice low and heartfelt he wouldnt meet kydds eye and kydd felt his own eyes pricking at the buried memories being brought to remembrance the children watched wideeyed wondering at the volume of sound the seamen produced but when two or three more carols had been sung they stepped forward and drew the men over to the tables where the feast had been laid no matter that the comestibles were as different from their normal fare as the exotic jungle chaos from the warlike neatness of a frigate language difficulties happily drew a veil over the true identities of the delicious fruitbat broth the antegg caviar and the dogmeat in nipa and garlic the men ate heartily the children squealed in joy as they were carried on the shoulders of a fierce sailor then thrown in the air and caught by those who in another world could reach effortlessly in darkness for invisible mizzen shrouds then swarm aloft a redfaced doody had them screaming in delight as he became a village pig and snorted and oinked at them from all fours others were chased shrieking about the compound by a burly boatswains mate and a tough gun captain but the act that stole the show and had powletts eyebrows raising was bunce and weems doing an excellent imitation of an indignant sergeant drilling a private soldier up and down carrying a musket of bamboo the afternoon raced by the drink on offer was lambunog specially fermented for the occasion the previous evening from palmtree sap this was served in half coconut shells but its pale pink viscid appearance and stomachturning strength gave pause to even the stoutest friend of the bottle evening approached the probable nearby presence of a volcano added violence to the red of the promising sunset and captain powlett reluctantly got to his feet pipe all the hands he ordered the shriek of the boatswains calls pierced the din with a bow powlett presented the contents of the seachest and bundles and in the enthralled stillness the sailors left quietly artemis put to sea immediately subdued and replete with lastminute mangoes and bananas men looked astern as the ship heaved to the long pacific swells privately contrasting the spreading gaudy sunset behind them with the anonymous dark blue vastness ahead as days unbroken by any events turned into endless weeks of sameness the sheer scale of the seas crept into the meanest soul the winds were constant from the northeast to the point of boredom an onrushing stream of ocean air that drove them on still on the same larboard tack the motion always an easy heave and fall repeating the same rhythm surging over the great billows in a gentle but insistent advance onward ever onward they angled southeastward towards their vital intercept with the diametric meridian the furthest they could possibly be from the land that gave them birth and indeed further from any demesne that could be termed civilised renzi watched kydd staring out over the great wilderness of whitedashed azure and the immensity of the deep blue bowl of sky overhead dark heaving boundless endless and sublime the image of eternity he intoned softly watching for reaction kydd picked up his faded blue striped shirt his favourite one and resumed his stitching the cotton had softened under the ceaseless exposure to sun and sea spray and now caressed the skin gently but it would not take too many more patches aye but prewse had me at th charts again last forenoon youd not be enjoyin yourself quite s much were i t tell you that he brought down the workin chart frm the quarterdeck and no flam he quick sketches in that little island we saw earlier so kydd sighed nicholas we have our seachart we navigate from an most of it is white nothin there an the master is fillin in the details as we go along does this give you yr assurance they know where we are renzi hid a grin dear fellow pray bring to remembrance the fact that we bear two natural philosophers eminent gentlemen i am in no doubt whose study is the earths form we are embarked in the foremost manowar of the age and a captain who is an ornament to his profession what else would you have kydds serious expression did not ease he looked away over the vast waste of tumbling waters and replied an ill bring jou to remembrance of what we say at church god save us and keep us the sea is so big and our ship is so small renzi kept silent and let kydd resume work moodily with his needle he gazed up the mastheads gyrated against the sky in wide irregular circles describing never an identical path but always a rough circle the bowsprit rose and fell each side of the far horizon the hull thrust and pulled at the body in its continual sinuous forward movement everything was in motion all different all the same grogs up soon im going below he said offhandedly kydd nodded but did not look up the gloom and odour of the berth deck bore on renzis spirit the wearisome constancy of their lives was not congenial to his nature he had found it necessary to ration his reading which made the books infinitely the more precious he had taken up goethes prometheus cecilias parting gift to him and again found the restless subjectivity not to his liking but on occasions he had seen her face emerge ghostlike from the pages troubled concerned he persevered with the volume er yer pardon mr renzi it was the petty officers messboy will caught offguard in his scrubbing of the mess table by renzis early return no matter said renzi rummaging in his seachest for the rousseau he would spark an interest in his friend for the radical precepts of the philosopher the supremacy of nature as the measure of all things which would lead him to an acceptance of the noble savage as the superior form of man he brightened at the thought of how he would present these jewels of intellect to kydd one night watch in the comfort of the lee of the weather bulwark he found the discours surles sciences et les arts and stuffed it into his readyuse ditty bag for later get yer arse outa here skinker hayness grating voice preceded his wiry figure as he flung aside the canvas screen before the noon grog issue was not a good time to be about where haynes was concerned mullion arrived and sat opposite his blueblack hair was compressed by the red bandanna he still wore after the hours gun practice the larbowlines had just finished he sat sullenly but quiet crow entered and immediately undid the catches of their neat side locker and passed down glasses no one spoke until kydd arrived with the pannikin of rum which he gave to crow the copper measure filled and filled again as the tots were prepared under the gaze of the whole mess half a pint of best west indian rum to each petty officer dark and rich the last of the rum did not fill the measure crow paused and looked up in the silence hayness voice held whispered menace kydd hes bin bleedin the monkey it was nonsense of course but kydd knew he would have to confront the challenge face haynes or back down he didnt hesitate his open face broke into a broad smile almost immediately mullion took it up and snorted in mock derision kydd hes green enough hed let em gull im on the measures ill ave that crows eyes flicked over to haynes but he passed the glasses round the rum was grateful to the stomach even if it was suffused by the taste of half an ounce per man of lemon juice insisted upon by powlett as the most reliable method of forcing the consumption of the antiscorbutic the mood lightened fair makes me qualmish seein that devilfish trailin in our wake all day mullion rumbled the shark had been following them for days seldom more than thirty yards astern its great pale bulk shimmering a few feet below the waves renzi spoke for the first time its interested in our gash only he said referring to the mush of bones and organic refuse that was pitched overside after every meal no it aint haynes spat its waitin theres some soul aboard its waitin for it knows who that is an its awaitin fer the time thats written fer im so what dye want to do about it sharks not easy ter kill crow responded mildly we rigs a tackle aft streams a line an hook with a lump o pork and when it strikes all the watch on deck tails on an heaves it aboard holus bolus his eyes gleamed an then we kills it mullion grunted seen one caught that way in amphion frigate in antigua we was at anchor an had one o them big white monsters fair n square b the throat couldnt land it on deck till we had a purchase around its tail an a full luff tackle on that what a mauler near an hour it took mates afore we had it on the foredeck an thats but half the story threshin around right mad it was near a ton o weight smashin an snappin with its great mouth open yer could see right inside teeth an all he paused in open admiration then we has ter settle it at it like demons we was ahittin and aslicin blood and gizzards all over the decks twenty on us an still it werent finished of davey he slips in the blood n in a flash them teeth has a slice outa his hide mullion swayed back in his seat as if backing away from the sight taking another pull of his rum he grimaced so help me joe when we cut im open is heart still beats right there in me hand an his tail still twistin even tho its cut right orf his body what did yer find in the stomach jeb crow wanted to know the table perked up in interest human skulls and gold watches impervious to stomach acids were not unknown last nights supper was the prompt reply bringing reluctant grins all round in a reflective quiet the mess finished their rum haynes raised his head and looked squarely at kydd who gazed back forthrightly so where are we at now mate he asked as if in atonement for his manner before kydd noted with satisfaction the assumption that he was in on the officerlike secret of their position but in truth he had no idea latitude and longitude were not yet in his experience which was mainly in the fair copying of prewses working notes were headed fr the dimetric meridian he said hoping that he had heard it right an were still a few days off dimetick who said haynes in disgust never heard any whos bin there the exact other side of the world broke in renzi smoothly when we get there and keep going were on our way back home the table stared at him the implications for their isolation clear been three thousan miles on the same course since christmas a shadow passed across every face an how far before our hooks down again mullion said in a low voice renzi looked at the man steadily from the meridian to the nearest point of mainland to the east is about a hundred and ten degrees say twice as far again but thats cape horn we wont trouble to linger there so after that well need to cross both the whole width and length of the atlantic ocean before our anchor touches ground again they looked at each other in silence the swinging lanthorn in the gloom plucking shadows from their faces bearing her crew on into the unknown artemiss decks rose and fell her movements as regular and unthinking as the rise and fall of a womans breast crow scratched his ear there is somethin by way of compensations mate his companions looked up were in fiddlers green fer women these islands yer cn buy a woman fer a nail or a bit o iron theyre hot even fer a pretty bit o rag all over yer like a rash theyll be have ter beat em off with a stick kydd saw renzis face tighten an they goes at it like good uns no hangin back renzi suddenly stood his face was pale and set they stared at him but he left abruptly what n hells bit im mullion said kydd could not believe that renzis usual near inhuman control had slipped on a matter of common coarseness he got to his feet hastily and went after his friend he found him standing at the ships side gripping a shroud and staring intensely out at the infinity of blue sea there are times when it is save your presence tom an insupportable burden to be closeted with such savages barbarians it was lewd talk is all not that never that i have heard worse in the best company no what freezes my blood is that they believe themselves the civilised enlightened society and the savage your unredeemable barbarian nothing could be more offensive to me tonight we will talk of the noble savage of rousseau the irreconcilable dichotomy between nature and the artificial perfectibility and man in a state of nature my friend your eyes will be opened you will understand the sources of unhappiness and discontent in our ways but as well you will come to know the potential human felicity in natural man kydd saw that renzi had been deeply moved and determined to pursue the reason further sir i give you joy we are at the furthest extremity of the world we have intersected the meridian you so desire and yet within span of your due date powletts words were dry and sarcastic but they did not affect the satisfaction in hobbess face my felicitations on your consummate maritime skills captain hobbes rejoined in like tones and now we have but to select a suitable point of land an island somewhere along this meridian to erect our observation platforms powlett glanced stonily at prewse sir the islands are here far separated days sailing one from the other prewse said doubtfully the nearest one then do i have to make my meaning plainer hobbes snapped we may raise nukumea before evening prewse replied nettled in deference to her condition her increasingly sunbleached sails and stretched rigging artemis did not tack about to her new northerly course but took the longer safer route of wearing ship they would track up the meridian until they found a suitable location for the observations within hours a tiny darkgreen smudge hoisted itself above the horizon it was an unremarkablelooking island a little lopsided with a peak to one side and the rest relatively flat nearer to they saw that the flat part was in fact a palmencircled inner lagoon and on the flanks of the peak was a plateau of higher ground pacific surf beat continuously on the bright sandy beach in a dull roar that sounded above the shipboard noises this may be suitable mused hobbes trying to steady a telescope against the moving deck yet i will trouble you for a boat to shore i will work a lunar to satisfy myself of our longitude you have doubts of our chronometers challenged prewse machines sir mere machines sniffed hobbes fit only to ease the life of the indolent if they should fail sir you will be cast away trust the heavens my dear fellow in which there is the cold truth of the eternal to be won by the diligent prewse snorted clear away the starbd cutter mr party powlett growled be so good as to accompany mr hobbes ashore observe and report to me on return even a quartermile offshore the leadline found no seabed so instead of lying to anchor the frigate heaved to with backed topsails to await the return of the boat the eyes of the whole vessel followed its progress as it sailed cautiously along the beach it rounded a point but its sails still showed above the low grassy spit of land the angle of the sails changed when the boat checked its course and suddenly moved inwards the sails disappeared behind a thicker clump of lofty palms reluctantly the onlookers left in ones and twos tiring of attempting to imagine what it was like ashore among the anonymous dark green verdancy it was trying but there was no alternative but to stand off and on sail on a course out to sea for a space of time then reverse course to arrive back in the original position a feat of navigation in itself at dawn the next morning artemis met her cutter as it emerged into the open sea this will serve captain hobbes said as soon as he had crossed the bulwark he hurried below leaving powlett glaring at the lieutenant mr parry he snapped sir the island would appear suitable for mr hobbess observations it is precisely on the line of the meridian the open area you see there has a good prospect for the erection of the platforms and it has adequate water parrys eyes showed weariness from the night spent under the stars with the acerbic hobbes thank you mr parry powlett conceded and sir if the sea state will allow it there is a possible careenage to the south ah is there b god said powlett with interest the chance to heave the ship down and get at the tropical sea growth on its bottom was too good to pass up there was besides their previous brush with the coral which would have damaged the thin copper sheeting and exposed the timbers beneath to attack by the pernicious teredo worm the cutter still bobbed alongside ill see for myself we have some weeks here at least gods bones but well not waste it above the crude rafts fringing the new waterline of artemis now heaved over in the shallows in the lee of the island the sight of her smooth verdigrisgreenblotched hull was breathtaking she lay on her side hauled down by tackles secured to her masts they were reinforced by additional purchases and stripped of all possible weight the curves of her underwater section were now accessible it had been a backbreaking task removing all the frigates stores equipment and fittings ashore but the seamen had been diverted by their exotic setting and the feel of dry land underfoot kydd had been strangely moved by the pristine shore with its soaring palms whose feathery fronds tossed in the oceanic air in the thick variegated undergrowth occupying the lower levels the vegetation was wild and profuse with orchids half a foot across a moody silence inland beckoned mysteriously powlett had been uncompromising however while the ship was being careened it was terribly vulnerable he fretted stumping restlessly about driving the men relentlessly the work was arduous harsh scraping and swabbing from the rafts with the seagrowths and detritus raining down on them the deep salty sea odour of it all contrasting fiercely with the rich soft land smell their sleeping place was on the higher open grassy plateau simple rectangular huts made snug from the cooler night breeze with woven palm thatch in the walls were all that was needed the sailors slung their hammocks inside to be safe against any unknown grounddwelling animals the officers had tents while the scientists insisted on separate accommodation in a capacious hut at the highest point of the plateau nothing more than a slight rise the observatory took shape the platform was stoutiy constructed and sheltering side roofs were prepared to keep the instruments safe against rain showers the few marines artemis carried were posted at the broad landward edge of the plateau facing into the unknown jungle there was not the slightest sign of human occupation and the sailors padded to and fro up the short path from the beach without any fear and above them all was erected the tallest flagpole they could contrive and from it a large ensign streamed out conspicuous and confident at dusk work ceased a large cooking fire blazed up a welcome beacon in the dark blue night the bubbling pots wreathed cooking smells about the hungry men beyond was the looming black mass of the peak in the darkness damn fine vittles said kydd with satisfaction as he gnawed at his bone renzi grinned in the companionable glare of the fire these are not the words you usually choose on board when we dine on this selfsame dish no but then i was never so sharp set kydd mumbled back renzi moved a few yards away from the fire to appreciate the brilliant coruscation of stars in the clear night over the peak would soon emerge the most splendid full moon and renzi felt a lifting satisfaction at his condition the young moonlight silvered the trees and huts but as well limned a solitary figure standing to one side renzi could just make out that it was evelyn still as a statue and staring out to sea his face in shadow he crossed over to him stumbling in the black and silver tussocks a glorious sight for an astronomer he said equably for a moment evelyn did not reply when he finally turned renzi could see that his face was drawn it is but you should comprehend that it is not my choice that i should be here he looked towards the fire and away again the adventuring life is not to my taste the privations the boredom my science is of a solitary kind not to be improved by enforced socialising i do apologise if i intrude renzi began evelyn moved to bring renzis face into the strengthening moonlight you appear to have a certain sensibility if i might be so crass as to remark it at present the sea life suits my disposition i have had my perspectives enhanced my views of the human condition elaborated and in fine it has been a salutary experience then i felicitate you on it evelyn said drily the theories propounded by mr hobbes are elegant and have deep implications for natural philosophy and this is why i am here in testing them not for any love of distant voyaging renzi opened his mouth to interject but evelyn added swiftly you know that william gooch was my learned tutor in the astronomical arts now i have heard that his bones lie in owhyee last year murdered by savages as was cook before him he lifted his chin and gestured to the invisible horizon have you any idea how inconceivably remote we are renzi kept silent la perouse and his gallant company in the astrolabe have been lost these five years they could be cast away and waiting for rescue on any one of some thousands of islands or then again their company might be destroyed every one wilson was cast up on the pelew islands some years ago renzi felt impelled to say and the native peoples there most hospitably treated him i remember he constructed a small vessel and sailed away and in it he conveyed at their request the son of the king of the pelews he attended at the court of king george you will recollect and i also recollect that the poor wight breathed his last the next year in rotherhithe and never did see his island again no sir you for reasons that must appear sufficiently cogent to you have adopted this perilous sea life but it is not congenial to me pray leave me to my science evelyn folded his arms and continued to stare seawards careening continued at first light on the other side of the hull the carpenter was now able to give his full attention to the ruckled copper plating that marked their encounter with the coral i shall not sleep peaceably until we are aswim again mr prewse powlett muttered i am sanguine that we shall be b morning then youll oblige me by powlett stopped short at the sudden widening of prewses eyes he swung round alarmed around the point swept a native warcanoe the savages rigid with surprise at the sight of artemis chapter theyll be no moren a thousan of em down on us like screamin banshees in a brace o shakes the boatswain said drily the canoe had taken in the scene of the helpless ship lying on her side then made away with impressive speed fairfax hurried over to powletts side sir the feejee is accounted an incorrigible cannibal he said with a worried frown powlett looked at him they smokes the heads n sticks em on a pole the boatswain added the gunner appeared and joined the group thirtytwo long guns an we cant use a one he said his eyes squinting at the sandy point where the canoe had slipped out of sight weve got one maybe two days t set the barky to rights cant be done the boatswain said loudly there was a general stir powlett frowned there was no glory in this kind of war set the boats aswim mr merrydew and i desire a swivel in the cutter the boats had been previously drawn up on the beach now they would be streamed afloat bows to sea and one with a small cannon i want fifteen stand of muskets loaded and primed larbd watch stand to in two hours with a fierce look at his men he said rest o you back to work it wasnt two or even three hours it was full evening when they came suddenly around the point in a swarm twentytwo impressive warcanoes and swelling numbers of tattooed warriors the ruddy glare of torches in each canoe flamed dramatically in the dusky light adding a devilish animation the sailors stood to arms immediately and lined the waters edge knowing that if the savages established themselves ashore it would be a grave situation his naked sword picking up the glow of the torches parry prowled in front of them looking repeatedly to powlett for the word no man to fire without my express order powlett thundered ominously there was no noise from the canoes no warcries or yelling just the silence of a murderous discipline a conch shell sounded from the largest canoe a low powerful ululation that set the hairs on the back of the neck on end the canoes slowly spread out in a wide semicircle just out of musket range clubs and spears plainly in sight here is yr noble savage then kydd growled at renzi gripping his sea service musket and wondering how a cutlass would stand up to a spear or club after his single shot renzi gave a halfsmile he is indeed can you not perceive his desperate need to defend his tiny perfect kingdom against the rude impact of our advance snorting kydd replied i cn see em well enough an they think were a poor vessel capsized an cast up on the beach which they think t plunder lifting his head renzi refused to be drawn see how they remain out of range of the muskets they have had dealings with civilisation before he lowered his musket a little and mused they very likely call it a firestick or similar there was a vigorous discussion in the largest canoe which contained a very fat individual sitting in a chair he wore a high colourful headdress a smaller canoe came alongside the occupants stepped out and a more slightiy built warrior climbed in followed by three others then it whirled about and paddled swiftly inshore its a parlay mr parry said powlett to the restless officer and i want to win time for the savants and their damn observations the canoe headed for the centre of the beach where the sailors reluctantly fell back powlett moved forward and waited arms folded the canoe grounded with a hiss and the warriors held the craft steady as the slightly built man stepped into the shallows he wore just one garment a sort of skirt falling a little below the knees and had on a minor headdress his slight build contrasted with the burly warriors taking up position on each side and he carried no weapons the threesome paused at the edge of the water a petty officer with a lanthorn appeared behind powlett the light appeared soft and gold compared with the red glare of the torches slowly the natives moved up the beach suddenly the slighter man hurled himself forward in a run the two flanking him were caught offguard raising their jagged bone clubs they sprang forward flinging himself at powlett the man choked something out unintelligibly powlett snarled present and all along the beach muskets brisded as they took aim at the warriors they stopped in their tracks milling about sullenly and calling out in hoarse angry phrases the sound of the mans tearing sobs sounded distressingly loud he was curled into a foetal crouch at powletts feet his body heaving horrified fairfax moved forward and pulled him to his knees its a a white man he said and let him drop powlett did not bend can you speak english he snapped the man pulled himself together lifting his head and looking from one face to another he staggered to his feet still staring at the silent faces he reached out to touch powletts threadbare sea uniform i can that sir he said his voice muffled at powletts interrogative expression he straightened and cleared his throat my deepest apologies sir for m display he continued his voice strengthening but its been four goddamn years since i clapped eyes on one o my own kind the american accent was stilted awkward you are shipwrecked and now live among the savages fairfax asked the man glanced back at the warriors menacing him from afar with their clubs he edged up the beach further into the protection of the armed sailors and continued nathaniel gurney mate o the narragansett as was th year eightyeight near the end of a tarnation good season whaling we follered a pod o right whales south into these unknown seas we let go th hook thinkin to wood n water when we was tricked ashore by the natives only i an two others was left aboard me bein mate o the watch he gulped saw it all happen along shore butchered th whole crew they did then they comes for us were not enough to work the ship so we hides when they finds us we think its the end but they laughs n thinks its a big joke so sir im guest o the panga people n the private lapdog of tofamaulu the king powlett took it in impatiently will they attack mr gurney gurney glanced at the warrior pair on the sand threatening and glowering i have your protection capn he said of course you have my word facing the two warriors gurney tore off his headdress and flung it in the sand this produced low groans from the warriors who halfheartedly threatened to resume the chase when we got word of a ship cast ashore an all arseyversey i thought shed be a lost whaler same as we but when we rounded the point i knew we was wrong yere a frigate at least his majestys frigate artemis thirtytwo guns said fairfax an so i made me a break for it powlett coughed meaningfully hold yr horses capn coming to it now they know ive gone over to you theyll not parlay but theyll listen to a deal im gonna tell em that youre well armed and the smart move would be t trade for what they wants that way they gets it without anyone gets killed very well what articles iron hoop iron off of barrels is best they cn shape that into knives very valuable that is ill need a hand axe t sweeten the king but dont queer the market with too much and we get youve been at sea what months get on with it powlett growled fruits plantains yams breadfruit set y up in finest fettle they will then gurney added with gravity an if youre figurin on staying for a spell it would be prudent sir to consider to build a stockade make this bit o the island all yourn just in case if you takes m meaning the stockade neatly enclosed the observatory and living huts on the grassy plateau the bamboo palisade extending down to the seashore on each end the stakes would deter all but the most determined assault and once artemis warped out and moored in the sheltered waters of this leeward side of the island the seaward approach would be secured the canoes that brought the foodstuffs were quite different from the lean warcanoes large catamarans with a central platform and matting sail they extended over the bright sea from the larger island over the horizon piled high with tropical harvest they also brought cargo of quite a different kind sir sir called fairfax breathless with anxiety and his run from the beach sir there are women in those canoes quantities of women the women flowers in their hair and chattering excitedly in their lilting liquidvowelled tongue steered their craft in through the rippling eastward entrance to the lagoon and glided in to the far beach the men at work on the bulking hull stopped and watched the procession pass them in astonishment a buzz of talk began interspersed with ribald calls which were returned in kind by the native girls who waved back happily the talk swelled to jollity then bawdiness haaands to muster by divisions the boatswains calls shrieked discordantly sending a cloud of small shrikes flying up from the thick vegetation on the sinuous length of beach in the lee of the grounded vessel the ships company mustered under their respective officers sailors in every sort of clothing in deference to the balmy warmth most barefoot but all with some form of headgear against the strong sun the officers were in the bare minimum of uniform and faded cocked hats rowley in shirtsleeves and breeches lace at his cuff and breast while parrys serviceable loose shirt was unbuttoned to the stomach powlett strode up despite the tropic warmth he wore his blue coat and laced cocked hat sword at his side still the boatswains calls pealed a single blast and the talking died away for long seconds powlett held them with his eyes the undercurrent of exhilaration among the men ebbing under his ferocious glare while artemis is heaved down should an enemy sail find us here we are dead men i will not have us so for a single minute longer than necessary there will be no rest for any officer or man until we are there he gestured seawards at anchor stores aboard and ready to fightpausing for emphasis he continued in forceful tones and if any man should think to straggle away for any reason i promise you most faithfully i will take it to be desertion in the face of the enemy the men glanced at each other there was sense in what powlett was saying there were some unknown weeks left until the scientists had performed whatever it was they were doing the women could wait masteratarms the nuggety figure stepped forward reluctantly he doffed his hat an incongruous move for he wore no shirt and with his fair colouring his body had reddened uncomfortably powletts eyes narrowed and his breath hissed between his teeth damn you sir get a shirt on he snapped before ordering more loudly the purser and his steward only to deal with the women no savage this side of the stockade under any circumstances post your guard inside and any man who disobeys my orders i want to see before me instantly despite their best efforts nightfall saw artemis still shorebound the big hawsers around her hull to tilt her over were gone as were all but anchors laid out from the bows and stern however they would have to wait until the first light of day before they could safely ease the frigate once more into her element in the living huts the womens low calls reached clear and soft on the night air they had not returned in their canoes and clearly expected some response from the strangers kydd lay back in his hammock and listened the warmth of the evening the violet clarity of the dusk the night scents of orchids all conspired against his peace of mind he could see the blaze of stars peeping through chinks in the matting roof and he knew that soon a full tropic moon would set the lagoon asparkle with silver behind the immense inky shadow of the ship one of the women began a soft song cool dreamy infinitely beguiling he tossed fretfully a cross voice came from the gloom in the hut fer cbrissakes shut yer face lofty a second voice grumbled an all of yez clap a stopper on itsnarled another the voices mumbled and stopped but sounds of restlessness continued the absence of deep regular breathing betraying sleeplessness be buggered a voice said decisively ive a mind ter do somethin about it a dark shape detached from a hammock and crouched down don do it toby another voice urged blackjack means it mate see yez in the mornin the first voice replied fruity with anticipation rouse out rouse out all the haaands heave along there lash n carry all the haaandsthe cries of the boatswains mates crashed into consciousness dispelling fitful sleep and sending the sailors automatically out of their hammocks blearyeyed kydd stood barefoot on the hut floor it was dawn only just outside the night was giving way to the first shafts of light stealing across the sky the grass was dewdappled a strange feeling to kydds bare feet and he shivered in the cool air then his brain registered that this was the first time that powlett always considerate of his men had reverted to sea routine while they were out of the ship could it be that they had sighted strange sail in the night renzis watchful face next to him seemed equally concerned boatswains calls shrieked haaands to muster haaands to muster by open list incomprehension was swiftly replaced by insight as kydd noticed a cynical smile pass over renzis face powlett was using the regular routine of mustering the men against their entry in the ships books as a means of detecting absconders sure enough powlett stomped down to the beach and waited grimfaced for the officers to muster the men of their divisions the masteratarms waited next to him artemisdetachment of marines in their full accoutrements drawn up behind the subdued grey light of predawn gave way to the first signs of the golden flood to come by the time the muster was complete marching forward the officers saluted gravely and muttered something to powlett before falling back on their men powlett clamped his jaw and waited the men shaken by his controlled fury waited also it did not take long down the path to the beach came all three absentees shamefaced but with a hint of bravado in their gait they separated to join their divisions two to rowley the other to parry take those men in charge masteratarms powlett roared above the cheerful morning chorus of the island the masteratarms gestured to his corporals who singled out the absentees and brought them defiantly forward powlett did not even glance at them his eyes were on his ships company in a steely glare articles of war he thundered there was a stir among the men with that single order powlett had transformed the occasion from a familiar routine to the awful majesty of a trial and not only this but a trial in which the evidence had all been heard now sentence would be pronounced article fifteen powletts voice was powerful and well suited to this duty to judge and sentence the men of hms artemis every person in or belonging to the fleet who shall desert or entice others shall suffer death the words rolled on the same grim laws they had heard read out a hundred times on a hundred sundays powlett hardly looked at the words and finished the recitation with a snarl do you wish a courtmartial he asked as was his duty and the sailors right there could only be one answer if they did request one they would be obliged to remain in irons until it could be convened that would not be until they reached spithead months and months ahead at best no powlett looked at the men in contempt twelve lashes apiece strip it had happened too fast the men stood dumbly stupefied strip powletts voice cracked like a whip the men began halfheartedly to pull off their shirts sir it was the boatswains mate his voice was small and apologetic then get one powlett bawled crimsonfaced the man doubled away the masteratarms came as close as he could behind powlett and leant forward to whisper powlett did not turn but growled a response the men stripped to the waist were led up the beach to one of the palms rearing up at the edge of the sand the first was secured with spunyarn by his thumbs in a parody of the gratings that would normally be rigged for punishment aboard ship powlett waited with a terrible patience for the boatswains mate to arrive breathless with his bag he nodded and the marine drummer began a roll it sounded tinny and unconvincing the martial sound deadened by the expanse of sand the boatswains mate drew out the cat and measured his swing the drum continued furiously then stopped suddenly just as the first blow landed to an agonised gasp it was the first major punishment kydd had seen in artemis he turned to look at powlett and caught a flash of feeling briefly cross the hard features a complex expression but it could be described simply in one word grief artemis was upright well before noon the sight of her truncated masts and hull riding high in the water driving powlett mercilessly on the frigate was kedged out to deeper water all her boats afloat every soul at work on rope capstan or oar in the warm zephyrs before the end of the afternoon watch the ship was rigged and the stores were returning aboard in a stream in the setting sun the job was complete artemis was a manowar once more riding to two anchors and ready for sea mr rowley powlett rasped his relief only partly concealed you will take the first part of the larbd watch and mount guard ashore over the observatory you will be relieved in twentyfour hours looking upward at the newclothed masts he added strongly the remainder will turn to partofship and set this vessel to rights for the first time in days there was a thin smile on powletts face there was no real need but kydd took another ropeyarn and added it to the three he was rubbing to and fro on an old piece of canvas on his knee his work would eventually turn out to be a dolphin for the crojack a simple stout rope with two eyes to prevent nip in the massive yard there was scope for fine seamanship in the careful pointing to finish over the plain worming and parcelling underneath and kydd relished its exercise do ye not want t step ashore nicholas he said to renzi similarly engaged next to him renzi raised his eyebrows a sign kydd knew to be the polite harbouring of a contrary view kydd saw this and grinned he had paid attention to renzis earnest exposition of rousseaus theories but his heart had prevailed over his intellect when he had heard of the philosophers orphaning of his own children in the interests of science and he had lost sympathy black jack is down on us seein the natives do ye think he admires yr rousseau kydd asked renzi stared back frostily as well you can conceive he selfishly consults the interests of his own ship that its warlike powers are not imperilled he laid down his yarns yet i must own to a powerful longing to see just for a morsel of time the outworking of pure nature on humankind only that he finished lamely kydd suspected he was shying from the difficulty of justifying his desire to visit the shore in the face of baser motives they both glanced shoreward were to be guard tomorrow kydd said neutrally it had been hard seeing the first part of the larboard watch pile into the boats laughing and boisterous and shove off for the sweets of the land but rowley had called on the masteratarms and three boatswains mates to land with them there would be no chance of tomfoolery night drew in again most men chose to remain on deck in the warm tropic evening smelling the cooking fires ashore but having to eat their own victuals boiled to a mush by a seacook who had stood wondering as the unknown foods piled aboard for stowing as the shore became an anonymous dark mass and lanthorns were hung in the rigging powlett came on deck he didnt waste time cutters crew to muster awaaaay larbd cutter this meant kydd who was bowman of the duty cutter it was already at the lower boom and kydd ran out along the spar in the darkness and swung down the jacobs ladder into the boat he singled up on the painter then hooked on alongside artemis to allow powlett to descend the steps and into the boat there was no talking as they pulled strongly ashore powletts expression deterred even the effervescent midshipman titmuss they passed through the dark phosphorescencestreaked sea in a rush and near to the ragged line of bluewhite that marked the tideline kydd leapt into the shallows to guide the cutter in powlett stepped rapidly along the thwarts and splashed down into the shallow water with me he said briefly to the midshipman and kydd and plunged forward heading rapidly for the path they paused just for a moment where the grassy plateau began powlett glared at the men clustered around the fire laughing and singing too late the marine sentry stumbled up and made his challenge his hat askew and musket without its bayonet without comment powlett thrust past and towards the firelight the singing died away as he was recognised mr rowley he snapped the men looked sheepishly at each other cowed by the naked fury on powletts face one man whom kydd recognised as hallison detached himself and touched his forehead ill find him fr you sir he said looking around before moving off into the darkness an ominous quiet descended the crackling of the fire sounding loud the mens eyes flicking about nervously titmuss seemed uneasy at the charged atmosphere and edged closer to the captain with a sudden flurry of movement rowley arrived with hallison breathless and in lace shirt and breeches only his cocked hat the wrong way around sir he said in guarded tones powlett drew a sharp breath then said with icy control be so good as to report your dispositions for the night mr rowley there was a brief pause before rowley began his report damn your blood sir powlett roared interrupting the hesitant words you treat your duty as a vile visit to a bagnio where are your sentinels why are these men in liquor sir i i stuttered rowley powlett leant forward piercing rowley with his eyes you sir are under open arrest get back on board this instant in the shocked silence powlett swung around to the midshipman pass the word for mr parry he is to assume mr rowleys duties ashore haynes was dismissive of the whole affair rowley has t be a right lobcock thinkin to bam black jack like that dice clattered to the table although gambling was a courtmartial offence there was no chance of a petty officers mess receiving the wrong kind of visitors without warning haynes peered at the dice in the light of the guttering rush dip and snorted in disgust picking them up and dropping them noisily into the leather cup mullion gave a glimmer of a smile cant blame a man fr wantin a fuckle he said an rowley is a man fer the ladies right enough lets his prick lead the way n he follows on behind his throw was vigorous and with a grunt of satisfaction mullion let haynes see the result before stretching out his hand to help himself to one of hayness littie store of worn dried peas hayness own hand flashed out and clamped over mullions fist crashing it to the table surprised mullion looked into hayness eyes haynes returned the look with smouldering intensity with his other hand he deliberately picked a pea from his own store and carefully added it to mullions pile his eyes never leaving mullions allow me he grated slowly he released mullions fist and sat back uneasy kydd broke into the savage silence shipmates he said whats this that y quarrel over a dish of trundlers he stood over the motionless pair at the messtable until mullion glanced up and allowed a trace of a smile to appear before relaxing back haynes mumbled something in his grating voice and subsided it worried kydd it was rare for shipmates to clash in this way and now within a short space tempers had flared again for want of somewhere to go he went forward to the galley renzi was proving a difficult friend while they were at the island and seemed to want to be alone more often than not around the galley were the usual crowd enjoying a pipe of tobacco and listening to yarns and songs kneeling on the deck eyes raised to heaven in mock reverence was a young irishman his round face wore a mournful aspect as he chanted an endless ditty bryan olynn and his wife and wifes mother they went in a boat to catch sprats there together a buttend got stove and the water rushed in were drowned by the holy says bryan olynn bryan olynn and his wife and wifes mother they went with the priest to a wake there together and there they got drunk and thought it no sin it keeps out the cold says bryan olynn bryan olynn and his wife and wifes mother they went to the grave with the corpse all together the earth being loose they all then fell in bear a hand and jump out says bryan olynn his audience listened in happy attention the verses following one after the other in a respectful monotone until a slight change in tone indicated the final stanza which was finished in a rousing climax bryan o lynn and his wife and wifes mother resolved then to lead a new life together and from that day to this have committed no sin in the calendar stands now sir saint bryan olynn hearty chuckles met this and kydd felt better at dawn powlett went ashore again grimfaced and irritable stomping up the path he nodded curtly at bored sentries and met parry coming from the living hut he was drawn and haggard and moved wearily report snapped powlett parry pulled himself together i am truly sorry to say that some of the men straggled in the night how many demanded powlett ill have the skin from their backs the rogues twentynine powlett stopped aghast this was over half the watch his hands twitched convulsively on his sword hilt before he turned abruptly on his heel and trudged down to the boat again he was still silent as he climbed the side of his ship acknowledging the boatswains calls as they piped the side he disappeared into his cabin later in the forenoon lieutenant rowley was summoned he was seen to enter powletts cabin with a truculent expression words were heard from inside hard and angry words rowley left with a set pale face stalking down to his cabin the rest of the forenoon powlett stayed behind his closed door the atmosphere aboard artemis became strained and moody radiating out from powletts closed door at noon the hands were called aft by parry the captain was not present in an expressionless voice party told the ships company they would revert to three watches for liberty one of which would be retained for guard duties the remainder having the freedom of the island it did not need much reflection to realise that powlett had capitulated to the situation renzi stepped out up the overgrown path inland towards the naked peak that towered ahead kydd followed behind puffing at the pace renzi was setting they reached a broad ledge of bare rock that allowed them to look back on where they had come from ah is not that sublime renzi stood on the lava rock as far forward as possible unconsciously taking the pose of a romantic hero one foot braced forward a noble brow shielded by his palm as he gazed out over the dramatic downward sweep of the foliage kydd was grateful for the breeze the day was sunny and close in the lee of the peak odd odours from the island vegetation and the warm smell of sun on the volcanic soil filled his nostrils what price yr diderot now kydd responded happily only hazily aware of the philosophers existence but knowing that it would give renzi pleasure that he had remembered their conversation what the man had actually said he couldnt recall renzi turned on him his face ablaze kydd recoiled in dismay yes youre right that is the essence of it we stand morally condemned man is not content with defeating nature he must triumph over it why yes o course this is very right kydd agreed and scratched his leg where some unknown insect had made itself known renzi had his oddities but his emotional tone of late was not in character and kydd felt some disquiet they resumed their upward climb and the bare grey rock of the peak presented close before them as a steep escarpment they cast about looking for a passage but for some time there had been no discernible track through the scrubby vegetation then kydd spied a break in the rockface and when they achieved this they found that they could now see both sides of the island the far side was much steeper and being to the weather side of the island the ocean surged in smashing down on the foreshortened beach in a ceaseless assault a constant mist of spume in a haze above the surf kydd could not make out anything of interest the anonymous riot of greenery stretched away unbroken in both directions a small bluff projected into the sea at one point its red soil distinctive and a small beach lay within its hook but that was all back to leeward the vista was more satisfying the shallows where they had careened were easily visible and towards the other end of the island they saw the crescent of a wide lagoon over a dozen canoes were drawn up on its inner beach and one or two smaller ones lay unmoving in the lagoon itself the occupants were fishing close inshore was artemis her trim lines sleek and satisfying she lay to both anchors and appeared rocklike still although kydd knew her to be lively and responsive to the modest swell the plateau was in plain sight below them much closer to the beach than kydd remembered and on it within the stockade were tiny figures working on the huts and the observatory his eyes strayed to the beach between the lagoon and the plateau path there were women down there with their wares laid out and he could see the unmistakable forms of sailors mingling among them a splendid situation for our repast renzi said hardly able to take his eyes from the abundance of nature kydds cloth bundle was added to the common pool and soon they were feasting on succulent fish cooked in plantain leaves ships biscuit and nameless hunks of a grey starchy substance they gorged on fruit to conclude and renzi apologetically poured rum and water for their wine they lay back eyes closed letting the airy warmth and perfect stillness work on their spirits so we are now at the far side o the world kydd said lazily just bringing out the words however brought a flash of memory here was guildford high street the old family shop now a stationers the crabby windows filled with patriotic and satirical mezzotints gentlemen with ladies on their arm were passing by he mentally corrected the image the idyllic weather here had induced a summer scene in england but of course right now it was winter and it would be a different prospect his mind drifted winter in macao had been cold but quite bearable in fact he and sarah he caught himself at the cold wash of remembrance her face returned to the centre of his vision tearstreaked and pale he jerked awake and sat up shall we return to the ship dye think he said scrambling to his feet he yearned for the simplicity of the human company to be found in artemis no said renzi decisively his eyes remained closed kydd hesitated the afternoon is passing i have no intention of returning renzi said his eyes flicked open and he looked up at kydd i cannot easily bring to recollection a greater peace and exaltation of mind than this prospect brings i shall remain here until driven back by nightfall he looked steadily at kydd the lines each side of his mouth lengthening then i have t return without company kydd said do so my friend renzi responded without a pause kydd waited then smiled reluctantly wish y joy of yr nature he said and turned down the path reaching sealevel he moved towards the figures on the beach he waved to doud who had a basket that he was carrying towards the informal market doud waved back cheerily kydd pressed on and saw his first native at close quarters a man standing expressionless under a palm gazing at the chattering groups his brown oiled body was tall and confident and he wore a finepatterned barkcloth skirt which extended from a broad woven girdle nearly to his ankles kydd offered an uncertain smile which brought no response he walked past approaching the women of the market who sat on palm leaves laid in a crisscross nutbrown and stronglimbed their noses broad and flat they had a vitality and animal suppleness they laughed and chattered and threw looks his way that were unmistakable ohe papalangithey teased and kydd grinned he passed by heading for the lagoon it was an idyllic prospect utterly peaceful and lazy under the tall palms he was drawn to the canoes pulled up on the sand they were finelined and beautifully finished he fingered a furled sail made of a woven matting it would not stand a gale at sea but he guessed that the canoe would head for the nearest island if it came on to blow they would probably be wet and waterlogged in the short seas of the english channel but here in the broad pacific they would respond to the spacious swells by riding up one side and down the other fast and dry his attention was on the canoe and he wasnt aware of the presence of another until he felt a gende touch on his arm straightening he turned to see a native girl hesitandy offering him half a coconut filled with waterjuice her face was open and her quick smile widened readily at kydds shy response why thank ee he said uncomfortably aware that her hand still lay on his arm er is this yr boat he accepted the shell and tasted the cool young juice was nectar and he drank again tamaha she replied happily she wore an anklelength coloured skirt similar to those of the men but her upper body was modesdy concealed by a string of pretty dried leaves and rushes hanging down from around her neck sorry i dont understand kydd said and smiled back she giggled then laid her hand on her breast tamaha she repeated then touched kydds breast oh well its tom tom kydd he said conscious that she did not withdraw her hand ah tonki she whispered and stroked his shirt curiously he looked down on her black hair and caught the scent of her a headswimming blend of coconut oil and sandalwood kydd cleared his throat and looked around the man under the palm was gone and their conversation had attracted not the slightest bit of attention from the few still on the beach urn tamaha he began and fell back on his previous piece of smalltalk this is your canoe he asked she seemed puzzled so he gestured meaningfully at the craft her face cleared and she slid the canoe easily into the still water of the lagoon he stood in confusion ohe tonki she called holding the canoe still and beckoning kydd found himself moving forward to her splashing in the bathwarm water he climbed in and settled in the after part laughing in embarrassment tamaha joined in the laughter and pushing off the outrigger climbed lithely aboard she plied her paddles easily and the canoe skimmed out over the water it glided to a lazy stop in the middle of the lagoon and kydd looked down through the crystal water to a riot of colour not thirty feet down a profusion of tumbling growths in an undulating underwater plain the most beautiful landscape he had ever seen he looked up to see tamaha regarding him seriously over her shoulder he grinned back his reserve melting she lowered her head then fumbled in the forward recesses of the canoe and came out with a palmleaf bundle eyes mischievous she lay back slowly until her head lay cradled between kydds thighs and her bare arm arched over to offer him a darkcoloured piece of fruit he accepted slowly and bit into it her eyes sparkled up at him and he felt desire mount in a betraying dull flush he looked over the side again while he collected his thoughts and she jerked upright again in mock exasperation thoroughly discommoded he studied the coral more closely at which she stood up in the canoe she looked at him once then in a single breathtaking movement she dived into the lagoon amazed kydd gazed deep down into the water seeing her brown body picking its way through the coral garden her garments floating erotically free she found what she wanted and surfaced water sparkling on her skin her black hair clinging it was a beautiful small white shell empty and delicate and as it took the air it became more and more intensely white she stared at him anxiously he accepted the gift reverently and without thinking held it first to his bosom and then kissed it before looking back into her eyes she retrieved her paddles and the outrigger moved purposefully through the crystal water past the lush coastline towards the end of the crescent it performed a neat curve and crunched up on the beach kydd got out and helped pull the craft clear of the water without a pause she held him by the hand and pulled him towards a rocky point lahi hakau loaloashe urged they ran together over the wet sand and up to a tiny track over the rocks it wound around the point and past a beach to the weather side of the island an undercut ledge of searoughened lava they stood together watching the waves approach in a long easy heave and swell suddenly kydd was aware of an exhalation a hoarse laboured breathing out like a huge whale there was a sudden thump and within seconds a giant gout of water roared up beside them and fell soaking them tamaha laughed excitedly her hair streaming heart hammering with shock kydd saw that she had lost her modesty in the deluge her breasts were now quite bare the water shot up again and descended once more as it receded tamaha gripped his arms and looked into his face she pointed to the blowhole once with emphasis then slid her hands up both sides of his hips and brought them up palms together kydd drew her face towards him and gentiy kissed it she looked up with a dazzling smile and they walked hand in hand to a grassy patch in front of a cave it was the most natural and the most desirable thing in the world she drew him down and they lost themselves in passion hand in hand they returned to the beach and lay together in sleep under the tall palms letting shadow patterns dance across their bodies and a warm zephyr play softly over them when kydd awoke tamaha was gone and the sun had descended in the sky he sat up a griping in his stomach reminded him that he had not eaten he ambled along the beach and saw mullion who lifted a hand in recognition and passed out of sight into the thick undergrowth closer to he realised that something was going on there he followed mullion along the path to a clearing on a fallen palmtree sat haynes and standing next to him was crow who held a gunners notebook and pencil mullion crossed to haynes and after a low conversation he was handed an article which he hastily pocketed curious kydd went over haynes looked up kydd yer wouldnt be lookin fer favours now would ye wha petty officer an messmate pays th same hayness gravelly voice held no warmth kydd was clearly missing something he hesitated cundall entered the clearing and leered at kydd then went straight to haynes two on yer account crow sucked his teeth and made an entry in his notebook cn yer tell us whats the goin rate cundall asked pocketing two large iron nails one nail fer short time bit o hoop iron fer all night in crow said then ill also ave some iron cundall said cheaper in th long run a hacked off piece of barrel iron emerged from the sack haynes had under the tree trunk and changed hands surprises me you should need persuasions cundall said to kydd and left at this rate artemis would be bled of her stores thought kydd but knew in his heart that he would find it difficult to condemn not tday he told haynes and left at the other end of the lagoon three men rolled along the beach one clutching a bottle kydd grinned at their antics heighho said john jones gesturing with his bottle at the canoes drawn up on the sand an its haaands to muster man the larbd cutter the others laughed and cackled look alive yer parcel o rogues his imitation of parry was nearly perfect jones went down the beach to one of the canoes launchho mates he called making ready to slip the craft into the warm lagoon the others lurched up a paddle around the limpid waters would be just the ticket an its one two six an a heeeavvyhe roared the canoe shot into the water but slewed sideways sending jones backwards into the water the others roared with laughter but the flailing man suddenly screamed a deathly inhuman shriek that paralysed kydd the laughter fell away into uncertainty the men staring fuddled and confused at the thrashing man kydd hurled himself down the beach and into the water as he splashed to the man he saw a nondescript fish flip away on the bottom warty ugly the colour of mud but with glaring red eyes and a gaping mouth that grotesquely opened and closed the mans body arched out of the water with pain and kydds attempts to drag him from the water were hopeless y useless bastards bear a hand here he screamed they held down the unfortunate sailor on the beach and tried to find the source of the excruciating pain kydd ripped off his shirt and saw it two small red marks under the nipple with a rapidly whitening outer area the mans eyes bulged and his arms beat on the sand his breathing turned to deep gasps and despite the restraining weight of several men his hands scrabbled at his throat his screams deteriorated to hoarse croaks kydd saw the whitened area extend over the chest as the man suffocated in front of him the body drooped with occasional muscle twitches and the light departed from his eyes the sun still beamed down the breeze ruffled kydds hair playfully but out of nowhere death had come to claim his own chapter kydd stumbled up the path to the cooking fire its ruddy glow a beacon in the gathering dusk he could hear the distinctive twang of gurneys american accent and saw that he was at the centre of a small group of seamen sitting together he hurried to join them still shocked by what he had seen and needing human company abe yer mustve had a such a time of it women all the vittles a man cd want nothin to do why dye want ter go mate asked an older sailor aye its paradise here added doud gurney didnt answer at first looking from one to the other with his head oddly cocked to one side as if in distrust of his audience yer think it is shipmates yair paradise right enough said a young foretopman leaning forward gurney responded passionately i grant ye the weathers always toprate an the vittles are there fer the takin but think on this you dont have nothin to do atall yer want anythin yer reaches out an picks it off a tree or somethin you never works never gets the satisfaction each day th same never see yr own kind never speak to a christian soul and the rest o the world just aint there fer all ye hear of it fer all i know king louis mayve come ter take back his louisiana from the spanish sardonic looks were exchanged no cuffin king louis aint no more doud told him gently frogs they has a revolution o their own an separates im from is ead gurneys eyes widened then how they has some sort o citizens er parleyment the gentry got their heads lopped off an all see doud was clearly having difficulty with the idea that someone could be ignorant of the tumult of blood that was convulsing the world and were at war with the crapauds theyre hard t beat on land said kydd but they cant best us at sea he added with feeling he thought over other events of the last four years the shocking mutiny on the ship bounty the terror in paris george washington becoming the first president of america these things gurney would learn about in time yeah but me here with a bunch o heathen always feudin and fightin struttin up n down like he stared gloomily at the remaining figures on the beach i seen sightsd make yer blood run cold theyre murderin heathens shipmates kydd thought of renzi highminded thoughts would be no proof against the savagery of the warriors should they grow tired of peaceful trade his thoughts drifted back to tamaha he would see her again tomorrow would she be thinking of him now would he tell renzi of her he knew that he was not immune to feminine charms their rivalry over sarah bullivant had shown that sarah the name caused a stab of feeling but he had now detached that part of his past into a selfcontained unit that carried her memory darkness lay softly over the island and kydd finished the last of his meal a boiled concoction of salt beef and yam served in a half coconut shell still no sign of renzi a buzz of talk washed about him he lay back on the grass and gazed at the stars thinking of nothing in particular just enjoying the night air drowsy he went to the living hut their hammocks were still slung and the matting sides were rolled up to give an airiness to the warm night as he climbed aboard his hammock kydd saw a dark form by renzis position nicholas he called softly the form froze is that you back with us yes said renzi shortly kydd sensed a bridge had been crossed did you i had the transcendent experience of communicating with the savages in their innocence renzi said stiffly so there would be no revision of rousseaus noble savage kydd wondered what form the communication had taken given the total lack of a common tongue john jones was taken by a devil fish he said it was the strangest thing y ever saw just a single bite an he was destroyed nathaniel gurney says it was the scorpion fish very bad an he also says as how the savage are treacherous heathens given to murderin each other and gurney is a fool renzi spat an ignorant wastrel who like us is causing the foul corruption of civilisation to lay its dead hand on these islands how so kydd replied with heat dye despise even yr own society renzi paused and kydd could hear his angry breathing i beg we will talk no more of it renzi said his voice thick kydd bit off his reply and settled in his hammock he awoke late with a muzzy head after a night of conflicting dreams he looked over the edge of his hammock to renzis but his friend had left as he was entitled to kydd reminded himself their spell of duty did not begin until noon tamaha was nowhere to be seen and he didnt feel like going down by the lagoon or taking the steep climb to the peak he wandered up to the observatory platform the observations had begun and kydd watched evelyns total concentration at the gleaming brass instruments and his quick scrawls as he added to his growing pile of papers hobbes glowered at the inquisitive onlookers and continued his dour ministrations you sir yes you it was evelyn beckoning to him while he remained bent at an eyepiece kydd came obediently knowing that evelyn was not given to idle whims be so good as to advise me mr mariner my glass has a propensity to tremble and sway in this rather forthright breeze it makes a ruination of my figures he waved at the slender brass length of his instrument up on its wooden platform kydd saw how the long optical piece was being affected by its length i believe y have here a mizzen gaff right enough yet wanting its rigging he pursed his lips ill return with the necessaries evelyn nodded bemused at the mysterious metaphor returning with a hank of spunyarn kydd capably set up a pair of vangs each side of the instrument leading to its outer end from the stout support posts of the platform he contrived a deadeye on one side which allowed him to tighten the rigging to a harplike tautness there he said with satisfaction do y take a look through y optics now evelyn bent and took the eyepiece again ah the very wonder of the age here we have a rocklike stillness he relinquished the instrument and stepped down my thanks mr mariner noticing kydds interest he added we have in these papers an infinitely precious aggregation of data which when matched with simultaneous observations in greenwich will settle once and for all the precessional paradox nodding wisely kydd noticed the care that evelyn took in replacing the papers in a polished wooden box no doubt this contained a final product of why the frigate had travelled so far to this remote region i have not seen your friend er nicholas renzi just so presumably he is distracted in making sport with the ladies of these islands kydd tried to suppress a smile he is not he has a hankerin after the theories of mr rousseau an believes that we corrupt the savage by our civilisation evelyns eyebrows rose rousseau you have debated him he looked out over the glittering blue ocean and continued for myself i cannot bear the bigot or his loose thinking but in this instance i am inclined to believe he is right we are a plague on these people the sooner we are sailed the better i shall like it he swung up to the platform again pray excuse i must return to my work kydd knew he was dismissed from evelyns universe parry was not the officer to accept weak excuses absence from place of duty was a dereliction that could not and would not be forgiven the offender would get no sympathy from the rest of the duty watch either for they had probably themselves been torn from willing arms to report kydd fretted for renzi who had probably wandered off in search of some marvel of nature possibly he had found an old native philosopher and was carrying on a deep conversation by signs now he was on report to the captain who would stop his liberty or worse duty ashore was not arduous there were stands of muskets to hand and the stockade to patrol but against whom it was not clear companionable tasks included assisting the cook to prepare the evening meal repairing the hut matting and the like less companionable was the sentrygo which involved porting a heavy musket in solitude along the length of the stockade supper was served out and kydd considered whether he should save some of his ration for renzi darkness stole in conversations became desultory and those free to do so retired to the living huts as the moon rose huge and magnificent over the craggyline of the peak escarpment it charged every object with a deep silver radiance and created myriad mysterious shadows back on sentrygo kydd paced slowly along the stockade peering over the top across the grassy slopes which disappeared into shadow at the woodland edge nothing moved the low soughing of the night breeze and creaks from the timbers of the stockade were all that fell on his senses he shifted the musket over his shoulder and padded on hsssst it was the beach sentry hurrying up the path he gesticulated sharply kydd hurried down to the man who was in grave breach of discipline by leaving his post come down to th beach the man whispered urgently kydd knew that there must be good reason he should go but if he was caught he looked back along the line of the stockade the other sentinels were indistinct dark blobs in its shadow he turned and plunged down the slope at the point where the stockade met the sea he saw two figures standing together in the moonlight which lay still and liquid on the pale beach well met my friend it was renzi his voice sounded gentle and noble but kydd approached in apprehension for what he might find renzi was in native dress a waistlength skirt and headdress of woven flowers next to him was a native woman dressed similarly and looking at kydd with a palpable tension toheumu said renzi introducing her she will be my wife when i settle here after you have gone kydd was struck speechless settle what utter madness to cut himself off from his own kind to i wish to farewell you now to let you know that i have found the contentment and fulfilment i have always craved a union between nature and man that will purify and scarify the soul of the gross humours that come from artificial society finding his voice kydd blurted but how will you live you have no means no there is no need for money or anything else we shall build a dwelling place and all around shall be the bounty of the good earth his tone strengthened and i shall bring into the world infants who will learn humility and awe at the altar of nature and they then will enter their true inheritance he turned to the woman and tenderly spoke a few native words her tense expression dissolved into one of deep affection that kydd saw had no room for others renzi held out his hand awkwardly kydds thoughts chased each other once artemis had sailed away renzi would be reckoned a deserter for the rest of his days there was no chance that they would ever see each other again it was staggering renzis fine mind wasted in this incomprehensibly remote piece of the earth it was an insane impossibility to see renzi tilling the soil reasoning with the warriors then probably a lonely death among the savages it was lunacy i go now be so good as to remember me in the years to come dear friend renzi said in a low voice his head fell but only for an instant he fixed kydd with a long look his deepset eyes moist then turned and marched away kydd balanced easily on the main topmast cap a hundred and twenty feet high with only the main royal mast above him just below doud pinto and others were seizing a futtock stave to the topmast shrouds ready to pass the catharping they knew their job backwards and kydd had no need to intervene while they had accepted his elevation to petty officer with equanimity he found it agreeable to his natural temperament to lead with a light touch far below on the quarterdeck stumped the foreshortened figure of powlett as irascible as a caged bear but energised by the prospect of getting to sea again they had reverted to one watch in three on liberty the other two watches devoted to work preparing for their voyage home in the fearsome roaring forties of the great southern ocean the only ocean to encircle the world completely its stormy seas swept huge and unobstructed and if there were any skimping on this work they might disappear from human ken for ever at this height it was possible to see much more of the island the variegated greens of the plateau and lower slopes and the blotchy bare rockfaces of the peak kydd couldnt see beyond the escarpment and wondered which part of the island renzi would select for his native home he would deeply miss renzi and the first seawatch especially he had heard that the scientists had nearly completed their work and there was a very real prospect that they would put to sea in a day or so it would be all over by then kydd touched the outer tricing line it was worn and hairy with use like much of the running rigging they had only so much in the way of sea stores and their stock of the aromatic stockholm tar used to preserve the standing rope had to be eked out on the focsle the sails were being roused out and checked the action of sun and salt water on canvas had made the flax deteriorate it was strange to think of high latitude sailing again of cold and blustery winds and harsh conditions while they lay at anchor here in this balmy pleasantness however kydd had a suspicion that he might grow increasingly restless at the relentless sameness of life on a south sea island then he remembered that this was how renzi would be spending the rest of his life they finished the job worming and leathering for better resistance to chafing instead of the usual parcelling and serving if there were any problem in the south latitudes it would be dangerous to send men up to this height kydd slid to the deck by the backstay avoiding the rows of cannon balls from the shot locker laid out in the sun for rustchipping by the gunners party powlett would not delay in having them all sweating at gun exercise just as soon as they made the open sea it was midafternoon when powlett ordered the cutter away for his check ashore on the duty watch and the progress of the scientists kydd took his position forward and the cutter left the ships side pulling strongly to the shore powlett performed his usual run over the thwarts to the beach and kydd had to move fast to keep with him powlett strode among the duty seamen growling an admonishment here or a word of encouragement there his greeting to the scientists was courteous but brief and he returned quickly to the path back to the boat suddenly kydd stopped in his tracks and powlett cannoned into him what the devil are you about sir powlett exploded holding up a hand kydd strained to hear a subliminal sound that had cut right through to a primal sense of danger there was an indistinct commotion and a midshipman of the watch raced down to powlett and saluted his face was pale with shock sir a native woman all covered with blood an two men powletts voice hardened what has this to do with us are we to judge in their domestic disputes sir no sir its a hell of a rout up there sir very well ill come said powlett crossly they retraced their steps and soon caught the harsh unhinged barks of a woman in the extremity of terror powlett hastened towards the growing crowd around her she was sprawled in the grass under the stockade hair matted and beslobbered with gore the two men appeared untouched but crouched eyes bulging as they stared wildly about them send for send for the american snapped powlett gurney sir said fairfax wringing his hands do it snarled powlett when the woman saw gurney approach she shrieked at him her arms held asplay the men began to babble loudly gurney listened asked some terse questions and tightened his expression first thing im gonna do is get aboard o yer barky an i advise you do the same he said fidgeting damn it man whats the problem the woman began wailing brokenly beating at the grass with her fists powlett caught gurneys arm and propelled him away noo it would happen sooner or later what roared powlett tuboualohi thats the son o the high chief hes kinda restless doesnt want t take his old mans rule fer much longer so hes done somethin about it catching powletts expression he hurried on hes got his friends from another island t help him hes gotta prevail quickly or he loses sends out raidin parties seems we have one arrived on the other side powlett glowered at him hands to quarters he ordered crisply the stands of muskets emptied and the seamen and marines hastily took up position at the stockade powlett pursed his lips mr parry be so good as to lead a reconnaissance party to the other side of the island and report the situation aye aye sir said parry and immediately detailed ten men for his party including kydd mr fairfax please to muster the ships company have them at readiness within the stockade he swung round and bellowed to the two scientists and their assistants still at the observation platform pray stand ready to reembark on my order hobbes barely turned his head indeed we shall not his voice sounded thinly over the distance it is not convenient at this time captain powlett ground his teeth get moving mr party the party doubled over the beach not a soul abroad with party in a fierce grimace and his sword out in the lead kydd smiled secretly as they rushed past the blowhole the other men flinching at the sudden gouts they reached the distinctive redsoil bluff that kydd remembered seeing from the peak rustling through an overgrown path to its low summit parry dropped to the ground his hand at the halt silence he hissed they crept cautiously to the edge of the bluff below the narrow beach was crowded with warcanoes and men the warriors were engaged in some form of ecstatic dance they circled around a firepit viciously waving bone clubs and spears at the head of the beach their prisoners seven of them were tied to the palms in a standing position kydd looked sideways parry was counting carefully assessing the warlike potential of the horde kydd admired his coolness but knew even without a count that they were far outnumbered what dye think theyll do t the prisoners whispered a man on one side theyll probably be some sort o slaves to th end o their miserable lives kydd muttered it made more sense than to kill them the prisoners did not move probably resigned to their turn of fortune the counting went on as did the circling about the fire a conch shell bayed a low and baleful sound varying in clarity as the man rotated slowly around the capering stopped from the dancers a warrior emerged with a tall headdress and anklets of sharks teeth carrying a broad bone club he pranced towards the prisoners passing from one to another menacing each with his jagged club he stopped before one the club rose slowly and fixed on the man in a quivering accusation a shout went up from the other warriors and the prisoner was instantly surrounded dragged down the beach and thrown to the ground he knelt his head drooping not a sound escaping the warriors drew back and in a single whirl of motion the bone club smashed the mans skull the dull squelch carrying up to the hidden watchers kydd was chilled to the core below him the body toppled slowly the executioner stepped back allowing others to move forward then in absolute horror kydd saw butchery begin limbs were separated and laid on plantain leaves strips of flesh torn and peeled from the carcass his mind threatened to fly apart when he saw one warrior casually carrying a whole leg down to the sea to wash it the flesh was wrapped in leaves and taken to the firepit where it soon left a rich aroma in the air like roasting pork retire by twos party whispered fiercely stunned kydd slid back they returned to the stockade in silence something about their manner communicating itself to the waiting seamen powlett rounded on fairfax they know were here and theyre not worried thats not good if they take it into their heads to make a sally well be put to severe hazard he looked soberly at gurney is it likely they will they stand t take a lot o plunder if they do an moren that whoever gets t kill a white man gets plenty o face as a warrior they wont attack at night the gods dont like it but tomorrow parry snorted we can blast them to kingdom come with artemiss great guns powlett glanced at him so we have wise shot mr parry which knows to seek out only the enemy at that range offshore we cannot reach the savages without we hurt our own no the scientificals have nearly concluded their work we have no further business here and therefore there is only one course i will contemplate we evacuate the island immediately muttering began among the men but powlett smiled grimly those who wish to linger i have no doubt will be right royally entertained by the savages he glanced up at the sun well not complete today get as much of the stores back aboard before sunset as you can mr fairfax the scientificals can remain until first light if they wish the ships company will take a twowatch guard i want to be at sea at dawn more shaken than he cared to admit kydd took his place at the stockade but his mind was on renzi lost somewhere in the interior not having any real means of communication with anyone he would be alone at a time of appalling danger and tomorrow was his last chance at escape kydd felt tears prick whether selfishly because he had lost a true sea companion or for helplessness at renzis dire plight it didnt matter a thought began to force itself on his consciousness a growing pressing thought he shuffled along the stockade until he found the end where it met the sea in an untidy pile of logs that you toby he called stirk was there and grunted a reply dark was rapidly falling and if kydd was going to do anything it would have to be in the blackness of night before moonrise i know where renzi is he said in a low voice stirks eyes gleamed in the dying light of the day but he didnt reply im goin after him yer want help mate stirk said kydd felt a surge of feeling here was what it meant to be shipmates no toby i need y here so when we gets back you cn let us back in kydd said he had no plan simply an urge to get to renzi he hesitated a musket would impede his progress considerably and a cutlass didnt have the reach compared to spears and clubs he would go unarmed he splashed around the end of the stockade luck matey stirk called quietly kydd stepped out nervously imagining unseen eyes on him with capture and a hideous death to follow his skin crawled but he went on towards the trail leading to the clearing where haynes had held his trade and which connected with the small path leading inland every bush and broad leaf that brushed his face and every root that grabbed at his ankles made his heart thump the sky was splashed with stars but die earth was in inky blackness the foliage fell away he had reached the far side of the plateau and would be able to follow along its fringe until he reached the forest path he sought if anyone could see him from the stockade which was doubtful in the gloom they would believe him to be a savage here was this the place where he and renzi had begun their final ascent to the peak for a minute of panic he could not recognise the area but remembered the casuarina with its feathery leaves overshadowing the track he plunged forward the moist cool of the night was laced with odours of decaying vegetation and night blooms things rustled and snapped panting loudly in the quiet of the woodland he wound his way up to where the escarpment bulked large and black against the stars he paused trying to remember the topography up here they had seen the other side of the island from this place cautiously kydd drew near there the other side of the island was already under the full radiance of a splendid moon but what chilled kydd was the distant sight of not one but four fires below he could see some figures moving others still and his heightened imagination told him that frightened souls were still tied to the trees there would be fresh meat in the morning he pulled away where would renzi have gone from here only one way along the base of the escarpment to the opposite end kydd struck out and after only a few hundred yards came to its end he stepped warily then stopped dead two figures appeared out of the dark stark against the moonlight nicholas is that you he hissed the figures stood rigid before one broke away and approached kydd it is said renzi there was a bare tremor in his voice artemis sails tmorrow we can lose no time a plaintive voice came from the other figure the import of the unknown words impossible to miss renzi murmured something over his shoulder but then he addressed kydd directly if by this you mean to persuade me to give up my decision and return to your world of hurts and unreason then you should stand disabused i will remain this afternoon with m own eyes i saw the savages kill n eat their own kind nicholas to devour a living human an theyre here still there was a hesitation then renzi spoke no doubt there will be those even of this world who will respond to nature by profaning in the worst possible way but that does not alter the premise by one whit that left to himself man will gracefully revert to his true self and attain the perfectibility of the spirit and if yr premise is wrong you will tell yr warriors they should mend their ways that enough renzis voice was defensive logic itself will tell you that both possible sides of the human condition cannot exist at the same time the same body one must prevail a pox on yr logic and on rank unreason both were breathing raggedly then y will not come i will not come kydds anger swelled to blind rage his muscles tensed in fury his fist slammed out connecting with renzis jaw and he crumpled soundlessly whimpering the woman scrabbled at his body but kydd pushed her away she fell back to the bluff rocks staring at him there was almost no time left the savages would be waiting for moonlight on the lee side of the island before they started picking their way across the island to be in position for dawn it might be too late now kydd thrust away the thoughts seizing renzis arm he hoisted him on to his back grateful for his slight build he hefted him into the most comfortable position and turned round for the long trip back the woman cried out once but didnt try to stop him he trudged along the track aware that she was following blindly finding the path downward he hurried along it renzis body was a dead weight that had him panting and straining he wondered what to do about the woman if she got hysterical she would certainly attract attention and of the worst possible kind he would have to silence her but how the moon burst above the line of the escarpment the whole island now lay still bathed in silver kydd cursed and redoubled his effort the clearing then the beach his muscles blazed intolerably with the strain he would have to rest he swung renzi down the body flopping untidily on the sand he looked up and the woman froze panting in burning gasps he confronted her with stabbing gestures he signed that he was taking renzi to the ship she nodded in mute understanding he then signed that she could go also she gazed at him her face frozen and shook her head slowly kydd repeated the gesture angrily seconds now could decide whether they lived or died she shook her head more emphatically then dropped to her knees beside renzi anguished cries racking her frame as she stroked his face tenderly for a mad moment kydd considered leaving renzi to her but recovered and tore him from her grasp triggering a hopeless paroxysm of sobbing he pulled at renzis arm to hoist him up but his strength was spent nearly weeping with frustration and weariness he tried again he fell to his knees panting uncontrollably there was a scurry of movement he looked up and saw the woman back away in fear and then run he swung round but it was too late dark shapes lunged across the beach towards him he stumbled to his feet get is feet then y ugly bastard stirk growled to another elbowing kydd aside they staggered and lurched along the limpid stillness of the beach and finally gloriously reached the stockade splashing round its end kydd felt overwhelming relief exhausted he staggered after stirk and the others who laid renzi down on the scrubby grass the moonlight had transformed the landscape now dappled and lovely it also revealed officers striding down to investigate renzi twitched and groaned the remains of his headdress still decorated his head but the native skirt was sadly bedraggled no one bent to see to him to avoid being associated by any implication in his criminality there he is said fairfax severely the deserter renzi well done you men powlett frowned but said nothing stirk turned his back deliberately on fairfax and touched his forehead to powlett renzi were taken b the savages earlier sir as yez can see seems e made is escape while they was arollickin an eatin of each other stirk shifted on his feet and thumbed at kydd kydd went out ter bring im in but he bein so near knackered powlett looked down on the groaning renzi poor devil he said who can guess what it is hes suffered he stared accusingly at fairfax but god be praised hes with his shipmates now his suffering is over renzi rolled to one side uttering something incomprehensible th experience has affected him sir kydd hastened to say makes him say crazy things lost his mind a bit id guess get him to the ship as soon as you can mr fairfax and tie him in his hammock poor wretch is not responsible for his actions powlett straightened and see that these fine men get a double tot of rum at dawn the woodland edge opposite the stockade was alive with movement but at last it was possible to run boats to the ship coral reefs made it far too dangerous at night too damned smart to come round our rear by canoe parry said grimly they know well blast em to flinders from the ship if they do the living quarters and other temporary works were to remain only sea stores would be retrieved hobbes beat a dignified retreat to the ship but evelyn insisted on completing his observations the sailors marvelling at his coolness at the eyepiece as yells and warlike sounds came faint but ever louder over the open ground we will retire by threes mr fairfax powlett ordered the first party led by you to the ship the second led by mr party to lie off in the boats to cover the third which i will lead and which will be the last to leave aye aye sir fairfax and parry acknowledged and you said powlett to kydd have my authority to remove mr evelyn and his gear by force if necessary he is to retire as of this moment aye aye sir kydd hastened to the observation platform he mounted the platform to speak to evelyn and could see over the stockade to the gathering warriors they were eddying out from the woodland edge prancing ferociously and moving forward to strike their clubs on the ground with a battlecry before retreating sir i have t tell you they are indignant that their plunder is sailing away from them evelyn said not even raising his eyes from his work no matter i am nearly done you may remove all but this kydd called across a party of men to carry the instruments to the boats fairfax had his men embarked and pulled back to artemis in good order the savages became more bold covering half the distance to the stockade now to perform their displays muskets banged away despite powletts orders to conserve fire for a rush and more and more bodies lay still in the grass the boats returned sir the captain kydd tried to say yes yes my last reading he will not grudge me that evelyn replied testily the sound of the warcries filled with bloodyminded hatred tore at kydds courage sir my authority he said earnestly but was interrupted by a disturbance a group of warriors had run along the length of the stockade outside and shielded by its timbers had gathered sufficient numbers for an assault they massed around one or two of the posts and heaved and pulled until they had loosened and fallen away they had breached the stockade fall back to the boats roared powlett as the savages poured through there would be no second chance and the defenders made haste towards the shore kydd swung to the ground and looked back to evelyn to see him take a spear in his side the astronomer slumped back in his canvas chair damn he said faintly plucking at the vicious barbed weapon kydd grabbed a musket and fired at the thrower the musket missed fire with a fizz of priming the warrior grinned and swung a bone club kydd swung the musket up with two hands the club splintered against it the musket bent uselessly but with it kydd crushed the warriors skull in their lust to stop the ship from escaping the savages streamed past each side of the platform leaving the two men untouched kydd bent to evelyn who was now white with shock th the observations he whispered in shallow gasps clutching the chair in great pain kydd looked down and saw the polished box open papers neatly inside he grabbed it and slammed the lid and looked up to meet evelyns wild stare leave kydd hesitated in an agony of indecision leave gothat is worth more than any mans life go damn you kydd nodded not trusting himself to speak and fled the box under his arm the last men were throwing themselves into the boats and kydd tossed the box into the pinnace he looked back but evelyn had disappeared under a swarm of enraged savages like ants over prey their barbarous weapons rose and fell hacking and chopping at last the bow swivel gun mounted in the cutter had a clear field of fire it blasted out and a storm of canister swept the scene changing the fullthroated warcries to screams one by one the boats from artemis retired in good order and headed back to their rightful place chapter kydds nose wrinkled the hogs lard was giving out and on the foreshroud deadeyes he was having to work with a nauseating mixture of fat and rancid butter it was essential activity for any slackness in the rigging would result in the destruction of a spar as it worked to and fro each separate shroud ended in a deadeye with lanniards running down to the channel outboard to give tension adjustment but kydd and his party found that such was the stretched state of the rope that now in addition they had to take up the racking on the shrouds themselves finally with gear well taut kydd was satisfied and allowed his three men to secure from work left alone he gave a final tug at the lines and became aware that he was no longer on his own he looked up and saw renzi standing with a set face looking out over the tumble of bluegrey seas kydd hesitated his sociable advances before had been repelled with a cold intensity and he was not sure how he would be received now he fiddled with the loose end of a downhaul and waited his decisive action on the island had not been forgiven by renzi who had retreated into himself but ironically in the week or so since this had been generously misinterpreted by his shipmates who were convinced that he was recovering from a mindscarring experience they gave him every possible sympathy kydd watched renzi covertly the face in profile appearing even more solitary and inaccessible a larger sea surged from astern faster than they could sail it overtook them with a swelling and falling accompanied by a marked lurch that sent them both staggering and reaching for a steadying rope this simple human impulse seemed to bring a fluidity to the situation kydd caught a flicker in renzis eye he wandered over beside him hearty sailin weather kydd said he tested the tautness of the nearest rope renzi did not move away he still faced outwards his expression set but his lips moved slightly as though speaking to himself encouraged kydd looked at him directly mullion says as how well be stayin on this same tack fr all of three thousan miles that would be a logical assumption renzi replied coolly his gaze still on the heaving seascape our gear had better be sound i believe kydd added anxious to keep momentum in the conversation renzi looked sideways if it is not then no one will ever know but us he said and kydd could swear a smile hovered a hard end t our island adventure he dared there was just a moments hesitancy then i have been considering the whole experience kydd waited it would appear that my expectations were oversanguine in the matter of man and nature the essence of rousseaus thesis remains unaltered timeless in its perception sublime in its penetration but it is subverted we are too late clearing his throat kydd began but why it is now very clear if even in so distant an island as this civilisation has come then it must have spread its canker over the entire inhabited globe is there anywhere left at all on this terraqueous sphere that a true self may go to attain perfectibility i think not a pensive expression replaced his forbidding look perhaps rousseau would have achieved a higher immortality were he to have demonstrated a modus of perfectibility within the mundus vulgaris in short my friend i accept that there is no longer any possibility for me to achieve a state of natural grace and thus i bow to the ineluctability of my fate the smile surfaced and kydd responded barely able to restrain himself from clapping renzi on the back never fear we have a long haul ahead before we reach our own civilisation an that at war he said renzis face cleared the blue pacific rollers were now behind them the grey of the southern ocean was the predominant theme and he gazed intensely at the clouds obscuring the wan sun fierce and more fierce the gathering tempest grew south and by west the threatening demon blew austers resistless force all air invades and every rolling wave more ample spreads yr wordsworth then kydd guessed he would have been just as happy at the fine words if it had been the village blacksmith i believe it might have been the peerless falconer talking about the mighty ocean in his shipwreck but i may be mistaken kydd smiled broadly all was right with the world yair second time fer me mates said crow his face animated at the memory an thats twice too many fer me he pushed his pot forward worst place in th whole godblasted world fer a sailor an thats no error the faces of his audience grew serious we gets westerlies all th way should be quick mullion said aye but were only at forty south now an its comin on ter blow we need ter get to fiftysix south fer cape horn an there its a reglar built hell nobody spoke black squalls hit yer out o nowhere grievous cold seas the size o which make yer blood freeze ter see em no galley fire on account o the lunatic movin o the barky its no place ter be but theres some days its as charmin as ever youd want mates seas calm an sun out ashinin on them great black rocks but yer knows that next its goin ter turn on yer like an animal screamin n shriekin an out ter tear the hooker t bits artemis swooped and lifted her hull creaking and working energetically it was easy to imagine the result of a harsher climate and kydd looked about at the swaying lanthorn and slight movement of the canvas screen and felt a quickening of his senses he was still affected by renzis labyrinthine musing on the nature of man dye know if theres any savages livin ashore there isaac he asked interested to see if renzis thesis would work at the opposite pole to paradise aye said crow that there are saw em once an they must be the lowest kind o hooman yer can get scraggy hair all ahoo mud all over n sulky with it dont trust em any of em he thought for a moment and added an their women are as rough as they is catch fish naked with a dog they does despite crows direful forecast kydd couldnt help but feel thrilled by the heightened sensations of speed and danger as they drove south entering the domain of the southern ocean proper everything was on the grand scale seas swelled to mountains a quarter of a mile between peaks and higher even than the maintop in the troughs as the following seas came on artemis would lift at the stern going higher and steeper until her angle down seemed a giddy impossibility and surfing down the face of the wave in an accelerating rush before the massive swell overtook and passed down her length with a consequent sudden deceleration her decks filled with a foaming hissing cataract then the process would begin again a regular three times a minute it was dangerous on deck and lifelines were rigged the length of the vessel if the unwary could not leap to the rigging in time only a desperate clamping on to this stout line would give a chance while the rampaging seas invaded the deck every man aboard knew that with the boats griped and lashed so securely there would be no lowering of them to rescue a man overboard even supposing the hurtling progress of the vessel could be stopped it would be a cold lonely and certain death on the helm it was doubly dangerous one of the massive seas coming in astern and catching the rudder at an angle unawares could slam it aside this would transmit backwards up through the tiller ropes and to the helm resulting in the weather helmsman being hurled through the air over the wheel while the lee man was smashed to the deck it called for ferocious concentration on the subtle motions of the sea and kydd learnt much as he and others fought artemis along if the crest of one of the gigantic waves broke it was a terrifying experience struggling at the wheel the first that the helmsman looking forward would know of its approach would be a sullen rumble rising to a rushing roar if he made the mistake of looking over his shoulder he would see a gigantic mass of foamstreaked sea about to fall on the vessel like an unstoppable avalanche the spectacle was of such primeval power that it was said to be not uncommon for a helmsman to flee the wheel days turning to weeks they sailed on the same course the same wind from astern each day the same wearing down of the spirit in a ceaseless fight against the danger the motion the discomfort forty degrees south turned to fortyfive then fifty and finally fiftyfive south as they shaped course for cape horn itself at these latitudes discomfort turned to pain exhilaration to dread skies ragged with racing scud squalls hammering in from nowhere shrieking like a banshee in the fraying rigging sails ripped to shreds in an instant it was a hellish world at noon each day a group of officers assembled staggering and lurching on the quarterdeck like the seamen they dressed in any ragged garment that could offer some proof against the weather and almost always they dispersed afterwards without the one thing they yearned for a sight of the sun without a sighting their latitude was so much guesswork and if this was mistaken then artemis would leave her bones on the ironbound coast of patagonia squalls now brought a new misery taking in yet another reef in the foretopsail kydd closed his eyes to reduce the soreness of saltreddened eyeballs as he worked at the stiff sodden canvas he sensed the cold feathery touch of snow when he opened his eyes he found himself isolated in a world of white flakes tossing and whirling around him wedy settling on spars and cordage before being whipped away it turned to a penetrating sleet and in the raw wet cold kydd climbed back on deck in the most acute bodily misery even so he could not escape the spray bursting aboard was now half frozen as it savagely sleeted across the deck it drew blood where frozen particles sandblasted his skin always it was a deep relief to go below and stagger along to his mess moving from hand to hand in the wild motion to the blessed benison of rum agetoughened cheese and hardtack and temporary surcease men sat silent and staring dealing with the conditions in their own way but never complaining that would have been the most futile thing they could do sometimes the weather played tricks the cloudbase would drop to masthead height the jagged cloud streaming past and heavy curtains of snow would advance rapidly to bring visibility down to feet then within minutes it would pass and cloudless skies would emerge as innocent of malice as a newborn but always accompanied by a freezing cold it was on one of these occasions when the biting sleet had moved away and the crystal dome of the sky had cleared ahead that there appeared across an infinite distance of tossing waters the distant sight of snowcapped mountains the far southern tip of the continent of south america the disbelieving yell of the lookout in the foretop hailed laand hoooo men tumbled up from below crowding the decks powlett appeared and stomped up to the master who stood with a look of wonderment on his seamed face god bless m soul my reckonin is that those peaks are not lessn eighty one hundred miles off so they are murmurs of amazement greeted this the horizon for a frigate was never more than twelve to fifteen miles away and the royals of a shipoftheline could be seen at twenty but this well done mr prewse voyage of half ten thousand miles and were right on the nose powletts satisfaction spread out like a ripple and smiles were to be seen for the first time for weeks aye sir but the hard part is acoming never fear prewse said stolidly brutally tired the ships company of artemis faced the final approach to cape horn the stark rockbound land stretched across their course and was downwind to the fiercest blasts to be experienced anywhere on earth if they found themselves in the wrong position there was little chance they could claw off back out to sea again at eight bells the watch changed the short day had turned to a fearful darkness out of which came the hammering blasts with just the same ferocity as in daytime the same dangers lurked the same treachery but these came invisibly and suddenly at night kydd nodded to his replacement who loomed up from the dismal gloom his trick at the wheel always left him aching bruised and punchdrunk with the merciless buffeting of the wind and he felt for his lashings with relief it was a critical time the handover the sea was always looking to take advantage of sleepweary men not fully aroused to their task hallison took the weather helm himself and was in the process of surrendering the wheel while kydd remained for a few more minutes until the new man was sure of himself others manning the after wheel were similarly engaged some instinct pricked at kydd at that precise moment and he snatched a glance back over his shoulder the size of seas coming in astern could be sensed by the amount of dark shadow they blocked against the stormy but slightly less gloomy sky rearing up was a truly huge immense black hill of sea which was just beginning to break an awful soulchilling threat kydd bawled a warning but it happened too fast for the weary seamen the ship lifted sharply to the watery mountain higher than it ever had before and as the comber broke it did so directly under her stern sending her skidding forwards at a disastrous angle at the same time the merciless wind pressed on her topsails and heeled her over even further the two forces combined could have only one ending broaching to the ship forced around broadside to the waves inertia rolling her over like a childs toy to destruction in an impulse of pure seamanship kydd strained to put on opposite turns at the wheel even before the slewing started but as the vessel lay over first hallison then others who had released their lashing slid and then fell to the side of the deck before disappearing under the torrent of white sea that came over the bulwarks audible even above the furious hissing roar of wind and sea was a heavy clatter and ominous rumble from deep within artemis her yards now nearly touched the sea with the heel kydd and the two who remained with him fought the helm for their very lives it was kydds instinctive early action that saved artemis it was sufficient to tip the balance of forces in favour of sails and helm the greater angle of rudder working with the remaining thrust from rags of sails to give sufficient way through the water to counter the broadside slewing agonising minutes later the ship slowly came back erect and before the wind again trembling with fatigue and emotion kydd was finally relieved going below to a desolation of broken gear all adrift the surge of water swilling over the deck and men stumbling about utterly exhausted after their battle for the life of their ship a day later a little after midmorning the weather moderated to racing low cloud against clearing curtains of heavy rain but the ship had been heavily battered by squalls of extreme intensity powlett and the master had never left the deck for as prewse quietly pointed out these squalls were born high up on the iceclad slopes of a mountain range somewhere close by air supercooled and made so heavy it hurtled down the valleys and to the sea this was proof positive that the bleak dread of cape horn was close at hand at a brief clearing of the atrocious conditions there it was a bare five miles away the very tip of the continent a low black straggling coast streaked with snow barren to the prevailing winds but darkly wooded elsewhere a picture of desolation two points to larboard snapped powlett hardly recognisable in his thick grego and woollen head covering we keep in with the land while we can how far to the horn itself mr prewse at a whisker less sixtyseven degrees west at last reckoning well see it today sir no doubt about it slong as the weather lets us with their sighting of the distant icy mountains prewse had been able to adjust his course so that they approached by running down the line of latitude of his objective now they would keep with the land until they had won through to the other side coast is bold hereabouts i believe powlett added shielding his eyes from flurries of spray prewse nodded aye sir very steep to ill agree a good thing o course and if there are hazards y can be sure that the rockll be covered in kelp easy t see ahead fr a warning if yr lookout is awake at the mizzen cleats crow heard the comment and muttered to kydd yair but does e think that cos every bit o kelp means a rock that no kelp means no rock he cracked a grim smile before cinching the rope and going below to kydd it was awesome and fascinating bucketing along before the moderating swell and seeing the stark black coast slip past the first land for so long at sea yet knowing that if they went ashore they would find it the most bleak and windswept corner on earth more rain it came in darkgrey curtains of misery washing over the battered frigate and sending kydd into paroxysms of shuddering at the cruel wind that always followed it cleared and there was cape horn kydd stared across the grey rollers at the dark mass one by one sailors came on deck to look expressions ranging from loathing to fascination here was the reality of why they had suffered from the low nondescript coastline it swept towards them from the north into a magnificent bluff well over a thousand feet high then plunged vertically into the sea as the breathtaking final point of a great continent kydd watched until the grand sight disappeared into the rain squalls and sea fret and without further ado they passed from the pacific into the adantic homeward bound the bows of artemis were now irrevocably directed towards england that wondrous place whose name could send seahardened men into mistyeyed reverie kydd surveyed the little gathering at the mess table sunken dark eyes and bowed backs introspective silences none of them was unaffected by the experience they had passed into the company of those few who could say they had doubled cape horn but there was a renewal of spirit nothing but a couple of months of steadily improving weather stood between them and england the few days they had spent in the tiny anchorage in the lee of tierra del fuego had broken the spell and given them back their strength the kelpstrewn rocks playground of seals echoing to the cries of wheeling terns and gulls this was a blessed haven while they readied their vessel for her final leg a warm feeling had come over kydd unexpectedly when he looked up at artemis from the boat that carried them around her battered hull seeking out hidden damage her colours were dulled her tarblack timbers streaked and worn her cordage frayed and white with salt but this was the ship that had carried him safely within her across the world to sights and adventures that would stay with him for the rest of his life crow lifted his eyes they now glimmered with life we get the trades well nough well be arollickin ashore in england before th buds o may his arm was still bound to his body but at least he was not tied to a cot like hallison and two others who had been left helpless with broken bones after their mauling by the giant wave the contribution from haynes was a grunt but kydd could see from his unwinking hard eyes that it would not be long before he would return as abrasive as ever mullion was cast down he had been greatly affected by the loss of his friend overside his grip on the mans wrist not strong enough to prevent his being carried bodily overboard by the seething torrent his last sight of his shipmate was of him flailing in the sea close by but being carried inexorably away mullion had stood helpless weeping in agony as the minutes of life left to his friend had passed away out in the anonymous blackness kydd caught renzis eye as far as anyone could tell apart from a deepening of the lines next to his mouth he was untouched by events cool and considered in his words as loftyminded as ever kydd smiled he himself had other concerns could do with somethin t eat other than hardtack somethin that sticks to y ribs there was a dry chuckle surprisingly from haynes yerll get yer meat soon enough he said the others looked up in curiosity how so said crow why said haynes th hardtack will be manned b bargemen kydd grinned lets tell ye how we used to clear the bread o bargemen in royal billy he had their attention every sailor was interested in ridding the hardtack of bargemen the weevils and other life particularly the large pale maggots that infested old ships stores well when we starts a bread cask in th hold we sets on it a plate with a ripe fish aboard bargemen they wait till its quiet then they swarm out t get a taste o the fish all ye do then is t heave the fish over the side n set another in its place until youve cleared the cask o the vermin the cheery response and the spreading comfort of the rum was gratifying kydds spirits rose artemis sailed steadily north the suns warmth swelled grey seas became tinged with blue and as the frigate ranged out into the adantic rollers it was almost possible to put from mind past dangers and harsh times but the ship and her company were sadly worn by the long voyage tired by the interminable movement jaded and soulweary it was seen in so many ways powlett appeared on deck in the morning but then retired to his cabin soon after his interchanges curt and monosyllabic on one night kydd had gone to merrydew the boatswain in his cabin to ask for some gear and had found him quite incapable with drink the surgeon who had no particular friends that anyone could name was acting oddly shutting himself away in the noisome gloom of his quarters his meals sent to him and the bickering between parry and rowley took a bitter edge a sarcastic and barely concealed animosity the pleasant northeast trade winds petered out into fitful flurries all too soon after they reached the tropics the sun was now hot and aggressive humidity making movement a trial merrydew rarely appeared he seldom spoke his red sweating face suffused with suffering kydd remembered the sunblasted sea from the last time they had passed this way and prayed that their passage would not be protracted aye both on em the little pursers steward anxiously awaited kydds response kydd was quartermasters mate and was therefore among those responsible for stowage in the hold it was shattering news two or three of the remaining ground tier of water casks had run afoul of each other probably as a result of their upset at the time of the monster wave and had chosen this time to split a stave each at the point of contact precious water had quietly seeped into the bilge and at a stroke artemiss sea endurance was curtailed there was no longer any question of her reaching england have y told the mate o the hold kydd asked but as he spoke he remembered that the old man was still lying helpless with broken ribs leaving the fetor of the hold he hurried up the hatchway the master himself would have to be informed mr prewse was at the lee hances in troubled conversation with powlett raised voices could be heard and powletts jutting chin and flinty manner augured ill for the news that kydd was bringing if y please mr prewse he said holding his hat respectfully in his hands the master turned his calm gaze to kydd unsure of whether the captain should know from him he paused but powletts clear impatience decided him and he made his report god blast it god damn it powletts rage shook kydd its intensity out of character powlett regained control the nearest watering he shot at prewse who thought carefully rubbing his chin well i we cannot go to eastd the spanish are probably now at war with us we can only fall back on brazil true aye sir said prewse neutrally then set our course in accordance snapped powlett closest point agreeable to the winds track the closest point thanks to the favourable southeasterly was but two days away it turned out to be a scrubby plain sandy and characterless through which a brownstained river wound listlessly the air was still and enervating and with a handlead swinging in the chains it took hours for the frigate to work in the watering party pulled ashore and began work the country was unattractive and had a persistent reek as of a longdead creature lying heavily on the air insects made their way out even as far as the ship the sudden maddening sting a disagreeable surprise after so long at sea as soon as the boat had been hoisted in artemis shaped course seawards but within a day there was good news glory be said crow a soueaster it was true they would have the unseasonally early good fortune of a wind in just the right quarter to see them past cabo de sao roque and on past the doldrums to the northern trade winds every weary heart aboard lifted at the news this would carry them into the north half of the world and they would then set course directly for home cape sao roque breathed kydd it was the last land they would see before england an undistinguished bluegrey tongue far to larboard their longawaited farewell to faroff lands and unknown perils soon they would be in familiar waters do y not feel it in yr bones we are homeward bound he added looking at renzi renzi looked thoughtful i am in two minds on the matter he said on the one hand we have had the felicity of adding to the breadth of our intellects by our voyaging to the far side of the world but i have to confess on the other there is nothing in compass that appeals to my spirit more at this moment than the prospect of surcease a cessation of striving the quiet land at last in thy green lap was natures darling laid kydd saw his friends face take on an enigmatic cast and suppressed his response his eye noted the worn ropes and frayed canvas then wandered over the vista of glittering blue sea ahead seven bells sounded distantly from the focsle and they swung out on the futtock shrouds and descended to the deck only a few weeks then isaac kydd offered to the silent table an not a minute too soon haynes grated i got such a pain in me back n legs after cape horn take months ter shake orf an you jeb kydd asked mullion the loss of his shipmate was taking its toll mullion seemed to have lost all appetite he looked up his eyes were dull and there was an uncommon lethargy in his movements ter tell th truth ive had this headache comin on coupla days now you should be seein the doc get him to bleed ye kydd said what that useless pinde tagger crow huffed aint seen hide nor hair o the bugger since west o the horn he glanced at mullion an i heard tell its his loblolly what set them bones he added an him without a surgeons mate an all the surgeons mate had missed the ship at macao but kydd remembered the sharpeyed young lad with the lame leg who had chosen to be a lowly loblolly boy rather than the rate of cooks mate to which he was entitled by his injury a lassitude seemed to be stealing down on the ship a torpor that was more evident in some than others bewildering in the general lift of spirits that went with a homeward course haaaands to make sail that would be rowley wanting to spread the weather fore topsail stunsl of somewhat questionable benefit to speed given that they were going large and the sail would almost certainly be blanketed by canvas on the main as kydd jumped to the bulwarks with the others of his watch for the brisk climb aloft he noticed that one of them millais a reliable jerseyman was not with them instead he was looking upward from the deck anxiously clinging to one of the shrouds disturbed kydd dropped back down beside the man lay aloft millais he ordered conscious that rowley would be impatient with delay millais stared back at kydd i i cant he began swayed and then before kydds disgusted eyes vomited helplessly sick drunk at this hour millais crumpled to his knees and looked up piteously i don feel s well mate he croaked the words were not slurred kydd felt a creeping fear and bent to help the man to his feet even at that distance he felt a raging heat radiating out from his body get aloft you infernal rascals came rowleys irritable bellow from the quarterdeck kydd hurried aft and confronted rowley sir that mans got a fever he watched rowley stiffen it was the worst possible news kydd sensed a scurrying down the main hatch and guessed that the news was being spread even as they spoke sling his hammock in the gundeck forward and put him in it rowley snapped it was the only thing possible frigates did not have even the rudimentary sick berths of a larger ship and tell the surgeon he added kydd touched his hat and rattled down the ladderway the sooner the surgeon could take strong measures the better for all the musty gloom was tinged with apprehension kydd had never had occasion to visit the surgeon professionally and like most healthy men felt uneasy there he took off his hat and crossed the wardroom to the louvred door of the surgeons cabin knocking firmly he was about to knock again when the door flew open nearly hitting him you said the surgeon puzzled kydd stepped back in surprise the surgeon was in his usual rumpled black but it was stained and there was a rank unpleasant odour about him kydd collected himself and reported sir respects from mr rowley an he wishes you t come he thinks we have fever aboard the surgeon looked at him and frowned pray inform milady jenkins that she must persist in the measures or i will not hold myself responsible for the outcome blinking kydd said carefully sir my name is not jenkins could y come now mr rowley is very concerned no you will tell lady bassett that i have done all i can all there is no hope none i grieve for you all goodnight the door slammed taken aback kydd hesitated across the wardroom party emerged from his cabin wiping his face with a towel what is it kydd he asked could be fever aboard sir kydd said respectfully he felt ill at ease in officers private territory parry paused you have seen this aye sir striding past kydd parry hammered at the door doctor we have a crisis sir please be so good as to come on deck at once there was no reply there is a fever on board damn your blood the door remained closed but from within kydd heard a desolate no hope none and a quiet sobbing parry slapped the towel at his side in frustration well get nothing from that useless ninny ill be on deck shortly fever it was feared more than any number of enemy cannon and with reason in a ship there was nowhere to hide nowhere to escape to every man aboard must face risking his life in the unknown miasma that brought the fever supper was a silent meal kydd slowly spooned his pease pudding across the table eyes followed his movements he glared back haynes coughed every eye swivelled to watch then dropped at his savage expression mullion seemed sunk in misery pushing away his wooden plate a pox on it snarled haynes a twisted smile acknowledged his unfortunate turn of phrase but he went on forcefully dont sound like any shipfever i know an it aint scurvy could be nuthin atall renzi raised his head or it could be deadly the table glowered at him collectively he lapsed into silence kydd watched him narrowly there was a halfsmile that he could only remember seeing before battle haynes tugged at his neckerchief port royal now thats th place fer a fever see them soldiers arrive chirpin merry an all in their lobsterback rig a week later an theyre sweatin and writhin with the yeller jack only a coupla days afore they tops their boom he brooded must be thousans left their bones there must be a spankinsize graveyard said kydd hoping to joke away the pall it was stirk who replied no mate very small see they buries em the same day at the palisades spit o sand away from the town come night all these ere land crabs pops out n digs em up fer a feast rousin good eatin should you get yerself a dish o them crabs kydd interrupted him whats this cuffin he had noticed how mullion held his head in his hands obviously in distress me head mate aches somethin cruel looks were exchanged around the table haynes stood up gotta get aloft that scurvy crew in the foretop not done yet ill ave their liver crow rose mumbled something and they both left stirk turned his gaze to kydd an you he said kydd stared him down then stood bear a fist then y henhearted lubbers mullion was difficult to handle as he staggered haphazardly they tumbled him into his hammock forward on the gundeck where he lay biting off moans kydd saw that there were slung numbers of hammocks now each bearing its burden of suffering the warm pleasant airs on the open deck were a relief but there was a sense of dread the ship had turned into a prison that was confining its inmates to permit an unknown death to overwhelm them kydd turned to renzi the halfsmile was still there what chance my dear fellow my education does not include physick i cannot say they glanced aft with a pugnacious stride and jutting chin powlett was now pacing the quarterdeck as if he had never left it i do wish however that the surgeon had retained but a modicum of his intellects said renzi still watching the captain it was churlish of him to take leave of them at this time the loblolly boy held a bowl of thin gruel over mullion trying to spoon it in but mullion twisted away his head fer chrissakes the lad muttered this was no time for games there were too many others to attend to take it jeb y needs the strength kydd urged mullion focused his dull eyes on him no mate give it ter the others he whispered this is me punishment i knows it cos i didnt hold on ter him i let im go ter his doom hed be aboard now an alongside us if idve held on he looked away in despair not knowing what to do kydd took the gruel from the loblolly who pulled aside mullions shirt kydd recoiled the torso was suffused by a pink rash and it glistened with sweat thats yer sign the loblolly said and took back the gruel to limp over to the next man suddenly gripped by an urgent desire for the open air kydd hurried on deck he saw haynes by the boatspace he was motionless staring out to sea his grip on a rope bringing white to his knuckles kydd sensed the mans fear comin for yr grog he said in as friendly a manner as he could slowly haynes turned his stare on him in horrible fascination kydd saw a betraying pinkness above the line of his opennecked shirt i got it aint i haynes mouthed there was no point in denying it y may have it but its a fever only nobody died you a sawbones then haynes came back but with little spirit he resumed his stare out to sea at barely six bells it was not yet time for kydd to go on watch at the helm but he was not ready to go below and swung forward abreast the forehatch was an anxious group in troubled conversation kydd saw petits lined features and nodded to him petit came over and touched kydds arm id be beholden were yer mate renzi ter help us he said in subdued tones nicholas says as how hes no physician his forehead creased with worry petit appealed yair but es booklearned he is knows a mort moren he says say that it would be kind in im jus ter step down an clap peepers on billy cundall hes very bad kydd touched him on the shoulder ill tell him elias renzi snorted rank superstition if i top it the physician it would be a mockery i will not nicholas could ye not go to them some words o yours little enough t ask theyd bring some comfort renzi frowned with irritation but kydd pressed on they trust you an even should ye not know the medicine y words will give ease with reluctance renzi allowed himself to be dragged down to the berth deck to the familiar mess of before cundall was lying in his hammock in the centreline of the ship moaning and writhing grimacing at the charade renzi stood beside him and the others crowded around i see he began hesitantly cundall looked up at him with piteous eyes a lost soul who barely resembled the loquacious braggart of before renzi took a wrist and made to feel the pulse he had no idea what to do so nodded sagely and let it drop how long has the rash been present he asked gravely a coupla days will i die cundall cried renzi was at a loss he had come prepared to go through a few token motions to offer the reassurance of his presence but he was speaking to a man who was ill of an unknown fever asking him to pronounce sentence life or death he thought briefly of physicians he had seen solemnly descending the staircase after visiting a sickroom and asked the same question his conscience tore at him at the prospect of laying either alternative before the victim he cleared his throat we see here as clear a case of persona non grata that i have yet seen petit looked pleased be damned will e be better there was a perceptible lightening of mood among the onlookers renzi moved quickly to head away from the moral quicksands of an answer do you steep six ounces of calamintha acinos for two hours and bathe the afflicted region every hour that is all we don have yon calaminthy nicholas petit said respectfully oh a pity it is a common herb in england the basil renzi said in lordly tones hey now quashee pushed himself forward my conweniences i have basil in my conweniences mr renzi splendid its carminative properties are always useful youll find i must go renzi left speedily cundall is in good hands i see kydd said hurrying to keep up his open admiration for his friend caused renzi to wince may i know what is your carminative renzi stopped turning to kydd he spoke slowly but intensely my carminative means that an essence of basil is said to be excellent for the quelling of flatulence farting if you will now pray do me the service of never again putting my sensibilities to hazard in this way physician indeed it was clear that mullion was sinking he barely moved the ferocious muscular pains coursing in his legs and back caused spasms that stopped his breath for long moments his face racked with suffering kydd patted his shoulder there was littie he could do he was now acting quartermaster with hallison down and he was due on watch soon kydd left to go aft but at the main hatch he bumped into renzi mullion is draggin his anchors for the other world he said could ye not i could not renzi said curtly coughing respectfully petit appeared standing with his hat off before him thanks t you mr renzi he said an billy cundall sends is respects an the rash is quite gone now with a groan renzi waited for petit to leave then glared at kydd so they all believe me now a master of physick aye nicholas said kydd meekly the number of sick had risen sharply and there was now a significant effect on the balance of men skilled in specifics in the watches fairfax was constantly worrying over his watch and station bill kydds temporary new rate as quartermaster was an important one he took up position at the conn with responsibility for the watch glass the slate of course details and other navigational matters leaving littie time to dwell on illness the watch drew on the officerofthewatch party unforgiving of the slightest sign of sloppiness later in the afternoon rowley emerged on deck to take the air it was not the custom for officers to promenade the focsle the quarterdeck was their proper place there was no alternative open to rowley other than to begin a slow circuit of the quarterdeck unavoidably confronting party on each lap kydd had always felt uncomfortable at the clear dislike the men had for each other and hoped that rowley would soon go below id be obliged were you to keep to leeward mr rowley parry said stiffly he was standing to weather as was his right but the effect of his order was to rob rowley of his circle he could now only pace up and down in a line rowley touched his hat with an expansive smile and exaggerated bow before complying the rest of the watch passed silentiy and with acid tension at seven bells powlett came on deck party moved to leeward in respect rowley promptly went below pass the word for petty officer renzi powlett growled parry nodded to the boatswains mate who trotted forward when renzi reported powlett spoke abruptly i hear you are something of a physician why not at all sir i have no power to warrant you in any position but you will take on medical duties as of now for as long as the surgeons indisposition lasts sir you are mistaken i that is all but sir there is go powletts voice was weary his bearing was faltering he looked as tired and worn as artemis now was renzi hesitated touched his hat and left mullion died in the same hour and cundalls symptoms reappeared the forward part of the gundeck was screened off and a windsail was rigged above the forehatch but the rows of hammocks increased it was puzzling some with raging fever saw their symptoms recede almost to nothing then return with brutal force while others recovered albeit profoundly deaf another two died trapped in the cheerless gloom of the gundeck in the midst of so much pain and squalor renzis world turned to a waking nightmare a boatswains mate pulled aside the screen his nose wrinkled in disgust there was no way that he would enter the moaning vomitstrewn hell he called across loudly mr fairfax passes the word for petty officer renzi straightening wearily renzi threw down the rag he was carrying and with bloodshot eyes pulled the screen aside he was touched to see kydd look up from a bench close to the screen he must have lingered there in support unable to do more kydd rose and as renzi went aft he tried to chat companionably with him fairfax was in his cabin with rowley come in renzi he said gravely the two officers looked seriously at renzi as he entered and he knew intuitively what they were going to say i am sorry to have to tell you that the captain has been taken ill of the fever rowleys eyes flashed nervously white we have endeavoured to communicate with the surgeon but unhappily he is beyond reach fairfax sighed heavily rowley leant forward impatiently therefore we require you to treat the captain using whatever you can find in the surgeons cabin appalled renzi gaped at them be so good as to begin immediately fairfax said his worried frown deepening if you have need of anything anything at all you will get it but the men are the loblolly is in attendance rowley said with irritation go to your duties now if you please get out the surgeon shrilled you have no right i will inform your mistress presently kydd held him back while renzi attempted to rummage about the sad ruins of the mans domesticity i know what you are you are the devils messenger are you not kydd felt destabilised by the surgeons high offkey voice at the edge of reason and even more so when the man began to scream and clutch at him in terror a knot of men waited outside including a marine sentry who had let his musket fall and stood in wideeyed horror they escaped with the surgeons bulky chest a hurried search had not turned up any book worthy of the name and rapidly made their way to the captains bedplace cabin he was lying quietly in his suspended cot his eyes closed renzi set down the chest carefully conscious of the tense presence of the officers and the captains coxswain pray leave us he is er not to be excited renzi pronounced at least they would not blunder about in front of an audience he looked apprehensively at kydd in all his rich and varied life he had never been in such a bizarre and helpless situation at his words powlett opened his eyes renzi he said thickly do your duty man renzi blinked do something his very being shouted but if he did the wrong thing does it pain you sir he opened yes powlett said briefly and this goddamned headache is oppressive to my spirit its pounding my brain the pressure he said a tremor in his voice renzi noticed heavy sweat beading the rash and trembling spasms of longendured pain in the confined space his senses swam he reached out to steady himself and his hand found the doorlatch he staggered out of the cabin the officers gazed at him in silence he pulled himself together and said er the loblolly if you please i must have assistance at least it would buy time the lad limped up and renzi drew him into the empty great cabin i must consult he muttered whats to be done he asked with a quiet dignity the loblolly looked frightened i i dont know he whispered but youve been surgeons mate all this while renzi coaxed you must have seen something not this he dropped his eyes i seen him do things but he never showed me less he wanted something done they would not get anything from the scared boy renzi felt a surging despair it was unfair to expect anything they had never suffered a killing fever like this before a cruel headache what did the doctor do for that it was at least doing something the loblolly thought and said calomel seeing renzi frown he added and bleeding o course renzi had been bled once he barely remembered it as he had been dead drunk at the time but he had a dim recollection of gleaming steel and a sharp pain in his arm before he had fainted can you do a bleeding he asked the loblolly i never seen it surgeon always did it private like renzi glanced up at kydd whose healthy complexion was rapidly paling kydd shook his head we must bleed him renzi said and dismissed the terrified lad together they returned to the captain firmly closing the door behind them we must bleed you sir renzi said trying to sound as confident as he could he pulled open the surgeons chest a neat complexity of compartments containing pharmacy bottles and dried herbs inside the lid were clamped a bewildering array of steel instruments which one do you use renzi whispered the prospect of cutting into the captains living flesh was appalling he fumbled among the contents of the chest i heard y use a fleam kydd interjected weakly and which the devil is that renzi said in a low voice powlett stirred get on with it you rogues renzis heart thudded he selected a bright blade with a point it gleamed evilly in the soft light of the lanthorn he pulled up powletts nightshirt sleeve baring the pale arm what are you waiting for you lubber powletts voice was a weak parody of its former self his head twisted away in anticipation of the blade renzi hesitated he pushed the knife against the captains skin which dimpled under the pressure but he could not steel himself to bring to bear the necessary force then he felt kydds presence and steadied it was easy really the knife sank in and dark venous blood gouted obediently turning the bedclothes scarlet a spreading flood of red that seemed never to end the cup you mumping fool powletts muffled voice sounded from the pillow well use a glass renzi told kydd and took a brandy glass but by then powlett had slipped into a swoon shakily renzi emerged from the cabin he told the waiting group what they wanted to hear and left haynes died never having left the deck once crouched in great pain against the ships side and cursing brokenly towards the end he was followed by cundall and three others but the last man to die caused artemis the most grief fairfax had the men mustered aft i have to tell you it is with intolerable feeling our brave captain is no longer with us there were gasps and cries from the few who had not heard the terrible news the first lieutenants grey worryfrown deepened therefore for the present and until we return to england i er will be your captain there was no response from the silent mass of men carry on snapped parry you do that agin you pocky bastard an ill cut yer liver out stirks eyes flashed hatred at crow across the table crow said nothing but he held his head very still fixing stirk with his hard glittering eyes then crow slowly passed his hand across his chest and began a deliberate scratch under his armpit stirk launched himself across the table crow snarled and smashed his fist into stirks face stow it y mad dogs kydd shouted trying to force himself between them stirk was angry and powerful but the slighterbuilt crow had a dogged tenacity that made it impossible for kydd to separate them it eventually ended in a panting truce and bitter words kydd pulled his shabby blue jacket closer artemis was now deep into the atlantic proper and the first cool precursors of the north were making themselves felt the fever had run its course only the poignancy of empty places at familiar seats a reminder of their time of trial he looked across at renzi but the sunken eyes and sallow appearance would take time to dispel renzi seldom spoke now there was a sullen lethargy about the men that kydd found difficult to confront he sympathised with their hard circumstances which he shared since the shock of seeing the body of their captain committed to the deep there had been a marked decline in the sense of unity and purpose the loss of such a strong figure at the centre of their world allowed it to fly apart petty tyrannies spread unchecked the humbler members of the power structure suffering the most the lack of a respected figure to distribute praise or criticism meant that the traditional engine of cohesion was no longer there and whatever else fairfax was he was not a leader a bare ten days or less and it would all be over but kydds heart was heavy it felt as though artemis herself seaworn as she was was the only one staying loyal and true to powletts memory his hand fell and under cover of the table he felt for the ships side and secretly caressed its her timbers the officers gathering on the quarterdeck for the noon sight stood together fairfax lowered his sextant and inspected it i make it thirtytwo degrees nineteen minutes north gentlemen and that is a bare four hundred leagues from england there was a favourable stir i will confess a fine game pie is haunting me perhaps in harness with a glass of decent claret not stinking of the bilge he handed over his sextant to be stowed below and stretched sniffing the steady trade winds it will not be long now we shall meet our families kydd at his post let the conversation slip past he watched the helmsman catch a windflaw and ease the wheel a spoke or two rowley added languidly i do believe we shall be in time for the season the duchess means her daughter to be presented at court this year and i have the liveliest recollection of vauxhall gardens by torchlight there is no likelihood of the season for me i fancy replied fairfax we are an old county family and there will be too much to attend to on the estate mores the pity he looked pleasantly at the wooden party you will be in town for the season or are you to be rusticated parry said with a set face neither sir he hesitated then added i believe i will visit my older sister at yarmouth yarmouth said fairfax oh he and rowley exchanged looks then stepped forward together in easy conversation they halted while rowley drew out his snuff box and laid some on the back of his hand before he could inhale a playful wind scattered the grains in the air and back over parry parrys face went red take your filthy habit somewhere else sir he shouted rowleys eyebrows rose in astonishment he glanced at fairfax then allowed an expression of exaggerated good humour to accompany his urbane inclination of the head he looked back at fairfax and burst out laughing storming forward parry fronted rowley breathing deeply and raggedly be damned to your popinjay ways rowley your infernal highborn humbug grates on my nerves fairfax looked shocked mr parry i do hope ignoring fairfax rowley replied coolly plucking at the lace of his cuffs sir intemperate words do nothing but reflect on breeding mr rowley this is not began fairfax his hands flapping pacifying with the entire quarterdeck watching silently parrys face clamped in a murderous loathing rowley if you cross my bows once more is this in the nature of a threat sir gentlemen i implore you please it is sir then may i take it that as a gentleman you are dissatisfied by my conduct gentlemen please i am sir damn you to hell parrys voice was thick with emotion rowleys voice turned silky then could it be that you are looking for satisfaction in the matter yes i am parry said hotly instantly rowley snapped to attention then sir i accept as mr fairfax is my witness turning to fairfax he continued kindly inform mr parry sir that my second will wait on his by sunset in the shocked silence fairfax wrung his hands gentlemen can you not be reconciled consider this is a ship of war we are parry drew in a breath with a hiss no sir we cannot with a look of savage content as of a monstrous burden lifted he added but of course i will allow mr rowley to withdraw rowley turned away and studied the horizon with his arms folded then it is my most sorrowful duty to inform you both that as there is no satisfaction offered then the matter must come to an unhappy conclusion fairfax paced aft pensively and returned there is no prospect of a meeting until we make landfall in england it is customary in these matters to refrain from interchanges but in the meantime for the sake of the ship i must ask you both to continue your professional duties but through an intermediary he wiped his forehead forlornly may i express how deeply saddened i am by the way this day has turned out on into the broad wastes of the north atlantic artemis sailed watch by watch routines performed by rote duties done with no heart in them the first atlantic gales came once more the smash of seas and hiss of spray over the decks racing dark clouds deep thrumming in the rigging when kydd came on watch at midnight dirty weather had set in to accompany the spiteful blasts of the gale rain driven with vindictive force that reddened cheeks and eyes he set the first helmsmen of the watch checked the slate by the light of the binnacle and took the state of sail it was a little surprising that the officerofthewatch rowley did not shorten sail in this blow for artemis was straining aloft and making hard work of the beat to windward but then again there would be few who would prefer to lose this chance to reach england the quicker kydd watched rowley standing ahead of him huddled in grego and tarpaulin facing into the blast but felt no sympathy for him in his larger situation that was a matter rowley and party must resolve and renzis reticence on the subject was sufficient commentary on his views kydd could see forward past the pale sails to the bowsprit plunging and rearing far ahead with a sudden bursting of spray over the focsle and he pitied the hapless forward lookouts at the catheads renzi would be with the rest of the dutymen hanking down after the customary sailtrimming at the turn of the watch he would be able to take shelter behind a weather bulwark the helmsman stolidly met the bullying of the gale his leeward mate following his motions on the other side two men necessary in this blow kydd was settling down to an uncomfortable and boring watch when against the buffeting roar of the wind he picked up a lookouts faint cry from forward it was picked up amidships and repeated immediately a dreadful yell breakers aheeeaaad two points on the weather bow a shaft of cold fear lanced into his vitals he tensed for rowleys order but rowley seemed to be deep in some sort of reverie the officerofthewatch had the responsibility and only him sir he bawled in alarm rowley seemed disoriented helm hard up he shouted this would instantly sheer the vessel away from the danger and away from the wind on the face of it a sensible move kydd roared at the helmsmen and they spun the wheel frantically the ship bucketed and rocked at the sudden change in direction parry appeared at the forehatch and bounded on deck belay that hard down the helm he bellowed kydd hesitated parry was senior to rowley and had every right to overrule him except that rowley was officerofthewatch and in charge quartermaster said rowley in hard tones inform mr parry that i am officerofthewatch i have the ship kydds jaw dropped he looked back at parry who bunched his fists sir mr rowley begs to tell you kydd tell that infernal idiot that the ship stands into danger helm hard alarboard it was clear to kydd that parrys order was indeed the right one admittedly they were now headed away from the breakers but they were going at an increasing speed to leeward and headlong towards whatever was out there parrys order would have had the effect of setting the ship all aback in stays but at least it would stop artemis in her tracks and buy them time to decide helm hard down he snapped at the helmsmen before they could move rowley shouted avast he turned to kydd although his eyes remained on parry enquire of mr parry if he is relieving me of my duties quartermaster parrys chest heaved but before he could respond another more urgent cry came breakers to looard i see breakin sea all t looard the voice ended in a falsetto shriek i have the conn roared parry helm down hard over for your lives their run downwind away from the first breakers had placed them in mortal danger from the second in the loom of night a continuous white line of breakers emerged to leeward and ahead it was plain they had unwittingly run into the arms of a small bay agonisingly the ships head came around again they brought up into the wind but the watch were not at stations to go about and the vessel fell away to leeward slewing hopelessly around it was now inevitable and at a little after two in the morning his majestys frigate artemis ran on to an offshore rocky ledge part of a small unknown islet somewhere in the atlantic kydds world dissolved into a frightful smashing rearing splintering chaos he was flung down and shot forward helplessly over the lurching wet deck in a welter of tarpaulins to fetch up painfully against the main jeer bitts artemiss bow mounted and fell and kydd felt her hoarse shriek as she was mercilessly disembowelled by the invisible black rocks a long drawnout sound that tore at his heart around and above him masts and spars swayed forward and gave way at the sudden stop crashing down like felled trees and bringing with them a mantrapping crazy web of rigging from aloft her forward motion ceased and the frigate settled to her bed of pain her hull lifting and crunching back under the driving waves like a mortally wounded soul trying to rise up again other sounds now broke in on kydds senses screams of agony as men were crushed by falling spars bubbling shrieks from below as men were drowned by the victorious sea flooding through her shattered bottom he fought his way out from the tangle of stiff wet ropes shivering uncontrollably with the mortal cold of deep shock the perspective from aft had a shocking unreality all masts were broken off short draped haphazardly about the ship was horribly disfigured desperately wounded numb kydd tried to take stock dying screams and screeches of agony tore at his nerves he peered into the rainlashed darkness searching for familiarity and security and through the bleak gloom he saw that they were hard up on an offshore ledge of rocks a halfmile to seaward of a small jagged island but that halfmile or so was a seething mass of whitestreaked stormdriven seas the boats on the skids amidships were smashed and splintered by toppling wreckage there was no chance of escape there a sense of the inevitability of his own death seeped into kydd stumbling figures in the darkness moved about the deck shouting and calling there was no sign of the two officers the stricken ship continued to lift and drop in an agonising grind and kydds heart wrung in anguish at the torment even as he reached for reality to longfamiliar deck fitments on the focsle there was a focus of movement and kydd felt drawn to the scene the only evidence of intelligence in the insanity he fought and clambered over the heaving wreckage towards it as he did so artemis was set upon by ferocious seas around her stern her fine run counter was slammed from under by their attack and as kydd passed the stump of the mainmast her keel gave way twisted by the great forces working at her vitals the after end of the ship broke in a series of shattering claps of thunder the stern portion fell at a different angle from the forward the decking just behind kydd splintered across and a void opened the forward part remained immovable on the rocks but the after fell away with a stupendous cracking a series of lurches now quite independent of the forward men clutching the deck on the stern saw their doom some slid into the ravening chaos between the two others were still clinging desperately as artemiss sternquarters slid backwards into the violence kydds mind froze in deathly fear unable to move hypnotised at the awesome scene there were scores of bodies in the water now tumbled and rolled by the contemptuous seas released by the breaking hull these had been the ones asleep below death had been forced on them instantly they would have had not the slightest warning of the streaming black rocks that had brutally broken in on them the after part quickly receded sinking as it did so the few remaining souls leaped or fell into the water they had no chance at all smothered by foaming seas battered by the pieces of black wreckage spewing obscenely from the innards of the ship they were swept into the outer darkness kydd tore his eyes from the sight and seized hold of his courage he resumed his scramble forward crying with grief at the hideous end of his ship and the loss of his friends artemis was now a dismembered corpse lying distorted and still her bowsprit and rags of headsails spearing up poignantly pointing at the distant shore he reached the knot of men on the focsle there was no sign of recognition they were nameless figures working despairingly on the wreckage with their knives they were trying to bind gratings and planking with ropes to make a raft but with only their seamens knives they could make little progress kydd did not have his knife as iron implements were not permitted near the compass he fell back and hung from the forebitts in utter despair looking across the whitestreaked rampaging seas rolling shorewards a hand clutched at him from behind and he turned ready to fight off a mindless soul but found himself staring at renzi he gripped his friend for long moments aware of renzis wild disordered state emotion cascaded through him renzi leaned forward and shouted at him lash ourselves wait until daybreak not trusting himself to speak he nodded and accepted the fall of a clewline cut off by renzi the new day would not change things but at least they could face directly whatever was due to them the night wore on in a daze of cold and fear but at about four just as a reluctant cold dawn hinted at light the carcass of artemis shifted grinding around to a new angle the movement destroyed the temporary feeling of security that her motionless wedging on the rock ledge had provided and at an hour before dawn it was clear that the end would not be long delayed kydd unlashed himself there was no point in being dragged down by the sinking wreckage but renzi pulled him round to face him we must jump he said his voice was strong and even although his body shuddered with the cold i would take it kindly dear friend if you would consent to taking the end of this line he was requesting that they be linked by a rope when they made their final leap kydds eyes stung a lump in his throat at the unfairness of it all the unreadable harshness of fate but he took the line and secured it to himself we have shared began renzi but did not finish kydd nodded and looked away a long grinding rumble sounded beneath them and the deck juddered and moved a sudden lurch came which sent kydd staggering and it was time they slid to the ships side clambered to the rail and leapt into the sea the water closed over kydd rushing and roaring in his ears the sea strangely warm out of the cold blast of the gale he kicked and flailed then broke surface briefly aware of the black bulk of artemis close by then was whirled away spluttering and helpless there was no question of swimming he could feel himself in the grip of strong waves that surged and pulled at him he became entangled in the rope that joined him to renzi but it was too chaotic even to know if renzi was still attached the tops of waves swept over him without warning and he choked on seawater his clothes began to hang as a dead weight and he knew that he was going down thrashing desperately at the water he breathed in the salty foam his throat raw and burning as he began to sink his legs brutally hit something solid the rising breakers lifted him up and again his legs struck wild with hope kydd frantically kicked and fought suddenly he was slammed against an unmistakable sturtly moving surface he was carried forward his body losing its buoyancy as it slithered and floundered across the sand in an instant he was aware that his direction had reversed and he felt himself being pulled back out to sea back into the frenzy of deep water in a fury of selfpreservation he clawed at the sand and suddenly found himself left high and dry by the receding wave it returned before he could do anything but he had been able to take long tearing breaths and was ready for the rush of water painfully he levered himself out of the sea unable to stand merely to drag himself above the line of waves where he collapsed spent he raised his head a few yards along was a shapeless bundle it was connected to him by a rope and was very still his mind refused to accept it at first but then with a roaring in his ears he shouted hoarsely he staggered to his feet crossed to the body and fell on it turning it over needing to see its face renzi vomited weakly seawater pouring from his mouth he lifted his head to look at kydd with dull eyes a slow smile crossed his features and on the tiny beach the two shipwrecked mariners embraced a hand touched kydds shoulder he jerked round in surprise and met the eyes of a foreign soldier nao se preocupe sua vida esta salvo pobre marinheiroj the man said softly kydd struggled to his feet but renzis voice broke through weakly i do observe dear friend that the presence of this man implies two things coughing feebly he continued first that this island is inhabited and we are spared an unfortunate death by starvation second he speaks portuguese probably this is one of the islands of the azores they are our oldest ally and thus we may believe we will soon be homeward bound kydd hid his leaping happiness behind a dry smile o course if theres any officer survived why therell be a mort of explainin hell have t do afore his courtmartial he said with satisfaction but in course we shall be witnesses of the first order added renzi and therefore i fear our return to guildford may necessarily suffer delay authors note at my

most like the reader to take away from my book is a perception of the reality of kydds world some have asked how real are the incidents in artemis there is an untold wealth in the histories but the gold is found in the letters home of a pressed man the diary of a gunner in antigua the musings of retired seamen what lies in the pages of my book is how it happened as closely as i can render it for todays readers sometimes the facts are more amazing than any fiction artemiss desperate battle is based on that of the nymphe and cleopatre of the time maillots millions gallant act did take place but in fact it was the captains own brother israel pellew who personally laid and fired the fatal carronade shot that turned the tide good fortune has played its part in allowing me to indulge my passion
