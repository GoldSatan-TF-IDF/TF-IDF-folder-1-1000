harry turtledove down to earth colonization atvar the fleetlord of the races conquest fleet and reffet the fleetlord of the colonization fleet were having a disagreement they had agreed on very little since reffet brought the colonization fleet to tosev atvar was convinced reffet still had no real understanding of the way things worked on this miserable planet he didnt know what reffet was convinced ofprobably that things on tosev were in fact the way the race had fondly imagined them to be before sending out the conquest fleet i do not know what you wish me to do reffet he said they were equals neither of them was exalted fleetlord to the other they could be and often were equally impolite to each other no matter what you may believe i cannot work miracles he swiveled his eye turrets this way and that to show exasperation reffet swiveled his eye turrets too and hissed for good measure i do not see that it is so difficult the ship the big uglies have launched is under very low acceleration you have plenty of time to send a reconnaissance probe after it and keep it under close secret observation and you brought starships across the lightyears between home and here atvar exclaimed you must have had good officers and good computers for you surely were not up to the job unaided he paced across his office which had been a suite in shepheards hotel before the race occupied cairo it gave him plenty of room to pace tosevites were larger than males and females of the race and naturally built in proportion to their own size leave off your insults reffet replied with another hiss an angry one his tailstump switched back and forth back and forth i repeat i do not see that what i have asked is so very difficult as i said that ship that clewis and lark is under acceleration of no more than a hundredth of the force of gravity lewis and clark atvar took no small relish in correcting his colleague and rival over even minute details that shouldnt have mattered to anyone save a big ugly that it is under tiny acceleration does not matter that it is under continuous acceleration does if we are to observe it closely and continually our reconnaissance must be under acceleration too and how i ask do you propose to keep that secret a spacecraft with a working engine is by the nature of things anything but secret by the emperor reffet burst out he lowered his eyes to the floor when naming his sovereign so did atvar on hearing the title from training since hatchlinghood any member of the race would have done the same still furious reffet went on these accursed tosevites have no business flying in space he used an emphatic cough to underline his words they have no business having instruments that let them detect what we do when we fly in space either atvar let his mouth fall open in amusement come here reffet he said walking over to the window come hereit is safe enough i intend no tricks and the riots seem to have quieted down again so no big ugly is likely to be aiming a snipers rifle in this direction at the moment i want to show you something suspicion manifest in every line of his forwardsloping body reffet came what is it the suspicion filled his voice too there atvar pointed west across the great river that flowed past cairo do you see those three stone pyramids there in the sand reffet deigned to turn one eye turret in that direction i see them what of it they look massive but weathered and primitive they are primitivethat is my point atvar said they are as old as any monuments on this world they were built as memorials to local rulers eight thousand years ago more or less eight thousand of our yearshalf that many for the years of tosev eight thousand years ago we had already had a planetwide empire for more than ninety thousand years we had already conquered the rabotevs we had already conquered the hallessi we were beginning to wonder if the star tosevthis worlds starhad any interesting planets here civilization was just hatching from its egg and it should have taken much longer to hatch too reffet said irritably the big uglies should still be building monuments much like these as we were not long after we started gathering in cities truth atvars voice was sad they should have in fact we thought they had you will have seen this picture of a tosevite warrior in full battle regalia before you set out from home of course he walked over to the hologram projector and called up an image he had seen it countless times himself both before reaching tosev and since it showed a hairy big ugly in rusty chainmail armed with sword and spear and ironfaced wooden shield and riding a fourlegged beast with a long head an unkempt mane and a shaggy tail yes of course i have seen that image reffet said it is one of those our probe took sixteen hundred years ago from it we assumed the conquest would be easy so we did atvar agreed but the point is in those intervening sixteen hundred yearseight hundred of this planets revolutionsthe tosevites somehow developed industrial civilization however much you and i and every other member of the race may wish they had remained primitive the sorry fact is that they did not we have to deal with that fact now it was not planned thus reffet made that an accusation the race moved by plans by tiny incremental steps anything different came hard atvar had been dealing with the big uglies for more then forty of his years by painful necessity hed begun to adapt to the hectic pace of tosev whether it was planned or not it is so you cannot crawl back into your eggshell and deny it reffet wanted to deny it again every line of his body showed as much so did the big breath of air he sucked deep into his lung i think i would rather deal with the tosevites than with you he snarled i know they are aliens with you i cannot tell whether you have become half alien or are simply addled like an egg gone bad that did it atvar drew in a deep angry breath of his own it brought the stinks of cairothe stinks of big uglies and of their food and their wastes as well as the stinks from the hydrocarbonburning engines they had developed themselvesacross the scent receptors in his tongue go away he told reffet and added an emphatic cough of his own i have not the time to deal with your stupidity whatever the big uglies in that spacecraft do they will not do it soon i am facing a serious uprising in the subregion of the main continental mass called china i have to deal with that now i will deal with the american spacecraft as i find the chance or when it becomes urgent meanwhile good day you have turned into a big ugly reffet said furiously all you care about is the immediate anything that requires forethought is beyond you tosev will do that to a maleunless it kills him first atvar answered then he paused both his eye turrets swung thoughtfully toward reffet have you any notion how many casualties the big uglies continual revolts have cost us no i do not reffet sounded peevish as far as atvar was concerned reffet sounded peevish far too often the fleetlord of the colonization fleet went on had you done a proper job of conquering this planet i would not have to concern myself with such thingsand neither would you i will not bite him atvar thought i will not tear his belly open with my fingerclaws but he hadnt known such temptation to pure cleansing violence since a gingerinduced mating frenzy in australia fortunately he had no ginger coursing through him now nor could he smell any females pheromones that let him stay his usual rational self deal with things here as they are reffet he said not as you wish they would be our casualties have been heavy far heavier than anyone could possibly have anticipated before we left home like it or not that is a truth very well that is a truth reffet still sounded peevish i do not see how it is a truth to concern me however i am in charge of colonists not soldiers all you care about is the immediate atvar said waggling his jaw as he dropped it to turn his laugh nasty he took malicious pleasure in bouncing the other fleetlords words off his snout anything that requires forethought is beyond you very well now reffet sounded condescending what fresh nonsense is this it is no nonsense at all but something we would have had to face sooner or later during our occupation of tosev atvar answered it might as well be now have you noticed that this is a world consumed by war and rebellion that the big uglies in the regions we occupy continually try to overthrow our rule and that the tosevites independent notempiresthe sssr the greater german reich the united states and also the weaker ones like nippon and britaintrain large numbers of their inhabitants as soldiers year after year i have noticed it reffet admitted but you are the fleetlord of the conquest fleet soldiers are your responsibility truth atvar said they are this is not home where save in a soldiers time of preparation for conquest we have no soldiers only police here we will need soldiers continuously for hundreds of years to come where shall we get them if we do not begin the training of males and possibly females as well from among your precious colonists what reffet cried this is madness it is nothing but madness my colonists are colonists how can they become fighters the males i command managed atvar said i am certain i can recruit trainers from among them think reffet he didnt bother being sardonic not any more the more he thought on this the more important it looked how long can the race endure here on tosev without soldiers to defend us reffet did think reluctantly atvar gave him credit for it after a pause the fleetlord of the colonization fleet said it could be that you are correct i shall not commit myself further than that without analysis from my experts if you would also convene a panel of your experts to examine the issue i should be grateful with any other member of the race on or near tosev reffet could have given an order and heard it shall be done as reply having to make a polite request of atvar surely grated on him atvar knew having to make a request of reffet grated on him here the request was nothing if not reasonable i will do that and soon atvar promised it is something we need to examine as i said so it is like atvars reffets temper seemed to be cooling he said if it proves we must do this thing it will make us different from the members of the race back on home and inhabiting rabotev and halless males of the conquest fleet are already different from all other members of the race atvar replied my hope is that over the course of hundreds of years we will gradually incorporate all the big uglies into the empire and assimilate them to our way of doing things if we succeed there the differences between those of the race here on tosev and those living on the other worlds of the empire will gradually disappear by the emperor may it be so reffet said he and atvar cast down their eyes again then half talking to himself reffet went on but what if it is not so that is my nightmare atvar told him that has been my nightmare since we first discovered the big uglies true nature they change faster than we do they grow faster than we do they are still behind us but not by so much as they were when we came to tosev if they or some of them remain hostile if they look like they are passing us his voice trailed away yes reffet prompted what then we may have to destroy this world and our own colony on it atvar answered unhappily we may have to destroy ourselves to save the race under an acceleration ofg lieutenant colonel glen johnson had to wear a seat belt to stay in his chair his effective weight was just over a pound and a halfnot enough for muscles used to earths robust gravity to notice any fidgeting at all would have sent him bouncing around the lewis and clarks control room bouncing around in a room full of instruments wasnt recommended he turned to colonel walter stone the american spaceships chief pilot this is the best seat in the house he said youd best believe it johnson stone answered the two of them might have been cousins they were both lean athletic men in their early middle years both crew cut both by coincidence from ohio johnson had started in the marines stone in the army air corps each looked down his nose at the other because of that at the moment though johnson wasnt interested in looking anywhere except out through the panoramic window it was doublecoated to reduce reflection peering out through it was about as close as a man could come to looking out on bare space he saw more stars than he had since another guy after the same girl suckerpunched him in high school the lewis and clark was aimed roughly in the direction of antares the bright red star at the heart of scorpio the milky way was near its thickest there and all the more impressive for not being dimmed and blurred by the lights and air of earth but johnson didnt pay much attention to the stars liberally sprinkled thereabouts instead leaning forward in his seat he peered farther south toward a region that even against the black sky of space wasnt so heavily populated he suddenly pointed thats it at least i think thats it walter stone looked at him in bemusement which one and whats it supposed to be anyhow that faint orange one there johnson pointed again i think thats epsilon indi the star the lizards call halless they rule a planet that goes around that star ah enlightenment filled stones craggy features you look farther west and up closer to the equator you can spot tau ceti too thats the place the little scaly bastards call home a moment later he said home again this time in the language of the race returning to english he went on and epsilon eridanis farther west still rabotev is the lizard name nothing to make either one of em stand out much theyre just stars like the sun a little smaller a little cooler epsilon indis quite a bit smaller and cooler yeah glen johnson nodded what i wouldnt give to be able to pay a call on the lizards one of these days you know what i mean oh yes stone nodded too i know exactly what you mean id say the line for that particular craving forms on the left but they can come here so its important that we figure out how to go there johnson said look at history the people who discovered other people usually came off pretty well the ones who got discovered didnt have such a happy time of it the spaniards got rich the indians ended up slaving for them no way in hell the indians could have sailed to spain except in spanish ships yeah thats interesting isnt it stone didnt sound as if he liked the way it was interesting then he stabbed out a finger at johnson but what about the japs what about the goddamn japs huh they got discovered instead of the other way round and theyre still in business yes sir thats right they are damn them but you know how come theyre still in business without giving stone a chance to answer johnson continued theyre still in business because they wised up in a hurry they learned everything they could from us and england and germany and france and inside of nothing flat they had their own factories going and they were making their own steamships and then they could damn well sail wherever they pleased they started playing the same game everybody else was yeah and then the slanteyed sons of bitches chose to sail for pearl harbor and give us one right in the nuts stone growled like most purely human conflicts the one between the usa and japan had gone by the boards when the lizards attacked it was gone but not forgotten oh hell yes sir johnson said but thats the point they were able to sail across the pacific and kick us when we werent looking if were able to do that to the lizards one of these days we wont be so bad off even if we dont do it we wont be so bad off because we can i see what youre saying stone told him the chief pilot waved around the lewis and clarks control room this isnt a bad first step is it its a lot better than what we would have had if the lizards hadnt come ill tell you that johnson answered i wonder if we would even have been in space by now he shrugged no way to tell i guess he didnt say so aloud but he thought of the lewis and clark as the equivalent of the first japanesebuilt coastal steamer which had surely been a clumsy makeshift vessel that barely dared sail out of sight of land it was very fine in its way but what he wanted were battleships and aircraft carriers out on the open sea stone coughed youre not supposed to be here to start a bull session you know youre supposed to be here to learn how to fly this thing in case mickey and i both wake up dead one morning sir the only controls that are a whole lot different from ones ive used before are the ones for the reactorand if i have to mess with those were all in a lot of trouble johnson said the motor sat at the end of a long boom to minimize the risk for the rest of the lewis and clark if anything went wrong with it one of the reasons youre learning is that were all liable to be in a lot of trouble stone pointed out face it you came aboard because you were curious about us right johnson could hardly argue with that it was the gospel truth stone waited to see if hed say something anyhow then nodded when he didnt uhhuh okay you arent the only one what if the lizards send a present after us what are we going to do about it or the germans johnson said stone shook his head now they cant catch us not any more this may not sound like a hot shipg wow he had a gift for the sardonic we tack on a whole four inches to our velocity every second doesnt sound like much does it it adds up though at the end of a day were going five miles a second faster than we were when that day started regular rockets kick a lot harder to start with but once theyre done kicking its free fall the rest of the way the nazis dont have any constantboost ships though ill bet you dollars to doughnuts theyre working on them now the lizards damn them do all right glen johnson said agreeably suppose they come after us at sayg thats ten times our acceleration we can run we cant hide and we cant even dodgethe lewis and clark is about as maneuverable as an elephant on roller skates so what do we do then besides go down in flames i mean if we have to we fight stone answered thats what i was coming to the fighting controls are right here he pointed weve got machine guns and missiles for closein defense none of that stuff is much different than what you used on the peregrine so you know what it can do nuclear tips on the missiles and all johnson asked thats right the senior pilot said except you carried two and weve got a couple dozen and that doesnt say anything about the mines he pointed to another rank of switches mines sir johnson raised an eyebrow now youve got me i dont have the faintest idea what youre talking about there are five of them one controlled by each switch here stone explained theyre the strongest fusion bombs we can build and theyre equipped with the most sensitive timers weve got if we know the lizards are trying to come up our rear ends we leave them behind timed to explode right when the enemy ship is closest to them maybe we nail it maybe we dont but its sure as hell worth a try even if we dont wreck it we might fry its brains johnson grinned i like that whoever thought of it has a really sneaky mind thank you walter stone said johnsons eyebrows jumped was it you stone grinned at him i didnt say that i said thank you here lets fire up the simulator and see what you do if the lizards decide to take a whack at us after all the simulator was a far cry from the link machines on which johnson had trained before the lizards came like so much human technology it borrowedstole reallywholesale from things the race knew and people hadnt back in the end result was something like a game something like a godseye view of the real thing with the lewis and clark reduced to a glowing blip on a screen the hypothetical lizard pursuit ship another blip and all the things they might launch at each other angry little sparks of light johnson lost the lewis and clark six times in a row before finally managing to save the ship with a perfectly placed mine by then sweat soaked his coveralls and slid away from his forehead in large lazy drops whew he said heres hoping the lizards dont decide to come after us because were sure as hell in trouble if they do amen stone answered you will get better with practice thoughor youd better get better anyhow i can see that johnson said first couple of missions i flew the only thing that kept me from killing myself was fool luck he paused eyeing the man who was training him you practice on this thing a lot dont you every day every chance i get stone said solemnly i figured you would its as close as you can come to the real mccoy johnson said the senior pilot nodded once more johnson took a deep breath okay with all the practice you put in how often do you win a little less than half the time stone replied the goddamn lizards can do more things than we can nothings going to change that if you cant handle the notionwell too bad they shot me down johnson said me too walter stone reached over and slapped johnson on the back without the safety strap the blow would have knocked johnson out of his chair stone went on we had to be crazy going up against the lizards in those prop jobs they were what we had and the job needed doing johnson said the life expectancy of a pilot whod flown against the lizards during the fighting was most often measured in hours if johnson hadnt been wounded when the lizards knocked his plane out of the sky if he hadnt spent a lot of his time afterwards flat on his back odds were he would have gone up again and bought himself the whole plot instead of just a piece of it he didnt care to dwell on those odds stone said i think weve put you through the wringer enough for one day why dont i turn you loose a couple minutes early so you can make it down to the mess hall before shift change thank you sir johnson said and unbuckled his belt my next shift back here with you i want another go at the simulator you wouldnt be much use to me if you didnt stone told him somehow or other i think that can be arranged catching one of the many handholds in the control room johnson swung toward the mess hall atg brachiating worked much better than walking he almost approached eagerness for good stretchessometimes even for hours at a timehe could forget he was never going home again lieutenant colonel sam yeager was muttering at the lizardbuilt computer on his desk sorviss a male of the race who lived in los angeles had been doing his best to restore yeagers full access to the races computer network so far his best hadnt been good enough sam had learned a great deal on the network pretending to be a male of the race named regeya as sam yeager human being he was allowed to visit only a small part of the network you son of a bitch he told the screen which said access denied in large red letterslizard characters actually he was picking up the telephone to let sorviss know his latest effort had failed when his son jonathan burst into the study yeager frowned he didnt like getting interrupted while he was working but what jonathan said made him forgive the kid come quick dadi think theyre hatching holy smoke sam put the phone back on its hook and sprang to his feet theyre three days early when president warren gave them to you he said the best guess for when theyd hatch might be ten days off either way jonathan yeager spoke with the usual impatience of youth for age hed turned twenty not too long before sam yeager didnt like thinking of it in those terms it reminded him hed turned fiftysix not too long before jonathan was already on his way up the hall are you coming or not he demanded if you dont get out of the way ill trample you sam answered jonathan laughed tolerantly he was a couple of inches taller than his father and wider through the shoulders if he didnt feel like being trampled sam would have had a devil of a time doing it the overhead light gleamed off jonathans shaved head and off the body paint adorning his chest and belly by what it said he was a landcruiserengine mechanic young people all over the world imitated lizard styles and thought their elders stodgy for clucking sams wife barbara was standing in front of the incubator the new gadget made the service porch even more crowded than it had been when it held just that washing machine and drier and water heater one of the eggshells already has a little hole in it barbara said excitedly i want to see sam said though getting close to the incubator in that cramped little space wasnt easy he went on i grew up on a farm remember i ought to know something about how eggs work something maybe barbara said with a distinct sniff but nobodynobody on earth anyhowhas ever watched a lizard egg hatch till now as she often did she left him struggling for a comeback while he was struggling jonathan gave him something else to think about dad may i call karen to come over and watch them with us his girlfriend was as fascinated by the race as he was she wore body paint too often with nothing but a tiny halter top to preserve the decencies she didnt shave her head though some girls did but that wasnt what made yeager hesitate he said you know i didnt get these eggs to entertain you or karen of course i know that his son said indignantly do you think im addled or something that bit of slang had made it from the lizards language into english no of course not sam answered doing his best to remember how touchy hed been when he was twenty but its liable to be important not to let anyone know we have lizard eggsor hatchlings which is what well have pretty darn quick now eighteen years of minorleague ball and twenty in the army had given him a vocabulary that could blister paint at forty paces around his wife and son he did his best not to use too much of it jonathan rolled his eyes what are you going to do dad hide them in the garage whenever people or males of the race come over when males of the race come over i just might sam said but he sighed his son had a point his orders were to raise the baby lizards as much like human beings as he could how was he supposed to do that if they never met anybody but his family and him with another sigh he nodded okay go ahead but when she gets here im going to have to warn her she cant blab sure dad jonathan was all smiles now that hed got his way this is so hot the race liked heat that made it a term of approval he sprinted for the telephone worry in her voice barbara said sooner or later the race is going to find out that we have these hatchlings therell be trouble when that happens i expect youre right yeager said but itll be trouble for the government not trouble for us if we have to give them up we have to give them up thats all no point to worrying too much ahead of time right right barbara said but she didnt sound convinced sam didnt know that he was convinced either but he forced whatever worries he had down to the bottom of his mind let me have a look will you he said as he had a moment before im the only one in the house who hasnt seen the eggs this morning now that jonathan was gone barbara had a little more room to move on the service porch as she stepped aside yeager lifted the lid on top of the incubator and peered down the two eggs inside both a good deal larger than hens eggs were yellow speckled with brown and white he would have bet they got laid in sand sure enough one shell showed a small hole will you take a look at that he said softly barbara had already taken a look at that her questiontypical of her questionswas very much to the point do you really think well be able to take care of them sam well hon we managed with jonathan and he turned out okay yeager said i see three things wrong with that as an answer she said crisply she ticked them off on her fingers number one were twenty years older than we were then number two there are two of these eggs and there was only one of him and number three not to belabor the obvious theyre lizards it wont be like raising babies its supposed to be as much like raising babies as we can make it sam replied thats why weve got the job not a fancy lab somewhere but yeah youre right from everything ive read it wont be the same from everything ive read too barbara set a hand on his arm are they really going to be like little wild animals till theyre three or four years old he did his best to make light of it saying what you dont think jonathan was instead of letting her hand rest quietly on his sleeve she started drumming her fingers there he coughed sheepishly then sighed from everything ive been able to pick up thats about right they dont learn to talk as fast as babies do and theyre able to move around by themselves as soon as they hatch if that doesnt make them little wild animals i dont know what would except were supposed to do our best to turn them into little tame animals instead i wonder if we can barbara said how many stories does the race tell about eggs back on home that hatched in outoftheway places and about lizards that lived like hunting beasts till they were found and civilized lots of them sam allowed of course we have stories like that too wild children barbara nodded but even in those something always helps the babies when theyre smallthe shewolf suckling romulus and remus for instance she had her literary references all lined up shed done graduate work in medieval english and just about all of our stories are legendsmyths really the ones from the lizards sound like news items they read as if they came off the united press international wire before yeager could answer jonathan came running back onto the service porch karens on her way he reported breathlessly she says not to let them hatch before she gets here fine with me sam said did she tell you how we were supposed to manage that jonathan glared at him hed been glared at by professionals from managers and umpires all the way up to generals and a couple of presidents he wasnt about to let his son faze him he pointed down into the incubator lookthe lizard inside the other eggs starting to poke his way out too they jockeyed for position in front of the incubator it wasnt easy for all of them to see at once sure enough both eggshells had holes in them now jonathan said those are more tears than cracks the shells look kind of leathery dont they not hard like hens eggs are as hens eggs are barbara said and then under her breath honestly i dont know what they teach people these days having watched a lot of chicks hatching sam knew it didnt happen instantly sure enough the tears in the shells hadnt got much bigger before the front doorbell rang jonathan dashed off to the door and returned a moment later with karen i greet you senior ordnance specialist sam said in the language of the race eyeing her body paint with both barbara and jonathan there he conscientiously didnt eye the skin on which the body paint was displayed that wasnt easyshe was a pretty redhead and freckled all overbut he managed i greet you superior sir she answered in the same language like jonathan like the rest of the younger generation she couldnt remember a time when the lizards hadnt been around she and he studied their language at ucla the same way they studied math or chemistry despite aping the race they took lizards more for granted than sam or barbara ever would four people crowding around the incubator made looking in harder than ever karen happened to have the best view when the first lizards snout poked out of the shell look she said hes got a little horn on the end of his nose its not a horn its an egg tooth sam said turtles and snakes and ordinary smalll lizards have em too to help them hatch itll drop off in a few days little by little the baby lizards hatchlings sounded reproachfully in his mind in the language of the race fought their way free of the eggs that had confined them they were a light greenish brown lighter than they would be as adults their scaly hides glistened with the last fluids from the eggs though the lightbulbs in the incubators swiftly dried them their heads look too big jonathan said so did yours when you were first born sam said barbara nodded jonathan looked embarrassed though karens head had undoubtedly looked too big for her body when she was a newborn too hearing voices above them the lizard hatchlings turned their tiny eye turrets toward the people sam wondered what he looked like to them nothing good evidently they skittered around the bottom of the incubator looking for somewhere to hide jonathan hadnt done that when he was a baby and thank god too sam thought he reached in to grab one of the lizards it hissed and snapped at him also unlike jonathan as a newborn it had a mouthful of sharp little teeth he jerked his hand back where are those leather gloves he asked here barbara handed them to him he slipped them on then caught one of the lizard hatchlings behind the head as if it were a corn snake back on the nebraska farm where hed grown up it couldnt get away and it couldnt bite though it tried to do both he carried it up the hall to the spare room that wasnt spare any more when he set it down it scurried into one of the many hiding places hed set up in the room an upsidedown bucket with a doorway cut into the side carefully closing the door behind him he went back and captured the other hatchling all right weve got em he said as he started up the hall with that wiggling little lizard now we get to make something of em felless was doing her best to talk sense into an official from the great german reich s ministry of justice an inherently thankless task if you do not do more than you have to control ginger smuggling into lands ruled by the race it is only natural that we have retaliated as we have she told the big ugly is it not just that we should assist the passage of tosevite drugs into the reich the official a deputy minister named freisler listened as his secretary translated felless words into the guttural language of the deutsche which she had not bothered to learn he spoke with what sounded like passion the secretarys reply however was all but toneless herr freisler rejects this equivalence out of hand he warns that drug smugglers seized inside the reich whether tosevites or belonging to the race will be brought before peoples courts and will be subjected to the maximum punishment allowed by law will be killed you mean felless said with distaste the secretary wagged his head up and down the equivalent of the races affirmative hand gesture the deutsche had a habit of killing anyone of whom they did not approve completely even for big uglies they were savage and to think i was fool enough to specialize in the race relations with newly conquered species felless let out a soft hiss of selfderision when shed wakened from cold sleep after the colonization fleet got to tosev shed discovered that hundreds of millions of tosevites remained unconquered the deutsche among them shed also discovered that the big uglies independent and conquered both were far more alien to the race than either the rabotevs or the hallessi and shed discovered ginger which was an irony in its own right thanks to the tosevite herb her own mating behavior had acquired a frenzied urgency not far removed from that of the big uglies the same was true of other females who tasted which was the greatest reason the race tried so hard to suppress the trade even as she argued against ginger to this freisler creature she craved a taste herself she took a breath to tear the big ugly limb from rhetorical limb but her telephone hissed for attention before she could speak excuse me she told the secretary who nodded she took the phone from her belt felless speaking i greet you senior researcher a male said into her hearing diaphragm slomikk speaking here i greet you science officer felless replied what news i am pleased to inform you that both hatchlings from your clutch have lost their egg teeth within a day of the normal period slomikk said that is indeed good news felless replied i am glad to hear it out she broke the connection and returned the phone to its belt pocket what good news is this the deutsch secretary inquired perhaps he was politely interestedperhaps but not probably what he was probably doing was seeking intelligence information felless did not care to give him any nothing of great importance she said now your superior there was attempting to explain why circumstances that apply to the race should not apply to the reich so far his explanations have merely been laughable when that was translated the big ugly named freisler let out several loud incoherent splutters then said i am not accustomed to such rudeness no doubt you have made the tosevites who came before you afraid felless said sweetly but i do not fall under your jurisdiction and so cannot be expected to waste time on fear more of the deutsch officials blood showed under his thin scaleless skin a sign of anger among the big uglies felless enjoyed angering the deutsche their murderous style of governmentand their irrationalityangered her that they were misguided enough to reckon themselvestosevites the master race angered her even more getting a little of her own back felt sweet she did not think of her hatchlings again till she was leaving freislers office he had not yielded in the matter of curbing ginger smugglers angering him had also left him stubborn diplomacyand the idea that she needed to be diplomatic toward big ugliesstill came hard to felless as it did to many of the race she hadnt been lying when she told the deutsch secretary the news slomikk gave her was of no great consequence the only reason the hatchlings crossed her mind was an idle wish that she still had an egg tooth herself were it so she might have torn the arrogant noisy freisler apart like an eggshell the temptation to violence the big uglies raised in her was appalling so was their weather they did not heat the interiors of their buildings to temperatures comfortable to civilized beings by which in her mind she meant females and males of the race but leaving the grandiose justice ministry and going out onto the streets of nuremberg was another savage jolt blaming the tosevites for the cold made no logical sense trying not to freeze felless cared little for logic fortunately her heated motorcar waited nearby back to the embassy superior female asked the driver yes back to the embassy felless answered i must report the tosevites obstinacy to ambassador veffani it shall be done the driver said and set the motorcar in motion it was of deutsch manufacture but ran reasonably well the big uglies had been in the habit of fueling their motors with petroleum distillates now many of them burned hydrogen another technology stolen from the race tosevites seemed to take such thefts and the changes that sprang from them for granted they would have driven the race mad felless more than half believed dealing with change on tosev had driven a good many males from the conquest fleet mad nurembergs main boulevards struck her as absurdly wide even for the capital city of an independent notempire the nazis the faction ruling the deutsche had an ideology that assumed bigger was automatically better a constable in one of their preposterously fancy uniformswhich also served an ideological functionhalted traffic so a female big ugly leading an immature tosevite by the hand and pushing another in a wheeled cart could cross she took her time about it not caring that she was inconveniencing felless felless tried to take advantage of the inconvenience by studying the way the female cared for her hatchlings the one in the cart was as absurdly helpless as all newly hatchedno the big ugly term was born tosevites were after emerging from their mothers bodies but even the one that walked by itself clung to the female who had presumably given it life of its own free will it submitted itself to her authority hatchlings of the race till reason truly sprouted in them assumed that their elders were predators and did their best to avoid them maybe that was why obedience and subordination were so thoroughly drilled into those hatchlings once they became educable the lessons almost always sank deep but big uglies who began so compliant ended up more individualistic than members of the race paradox the changes came with sexual maturation of course that propelled tosevites toward the autonomy to which they clung so fiercely from then on the race stayed on the quieter path untouched by hormonal tides except during mating seasonor when stimulated by ginger felless thought ginger disrupted patterns unshakable back on home after what seemed like forever the constable permitted traffic to move again now that her attention had been drawn to them felless kept noticing big ugliesmostly females by their wrapping styles and the length of their haircaring for tosevite hatchlings of various sizes she tried to imagine leading her own pair of hatchlings down the street holding each one by the hand the absurdity of the notion made her mouth drop open into a wide laugh the little creatures would do their best to bite her and escape civilizing hatchlings wasnt easy it was in fact one of the first specializations the race had developed back at or rather before the dawn of its history systematically civilizing hatchlings had helped lead to civilizing the race the motorcar pulled to a halt in front of the races embassy to the greater german reich felless sighed with relief not only relief at escaping the absurd fantasy that had filled her mind but also at seeing a sensible functional cube of a building the newer tosevite structures in nuremberg partook of the nazis passion for immense pretentiousness the older ones struck her as hideously overdecorated escaping to simplicity was a delight felless hurried to veffanis office the ambassador said i greet you senior researcher i am glad to see you resuming your full range of duties after laying your eggs i thank you superior sir felless replied either veffani or ttomalss an experienced researcher in tosevite psychology had fertilized those eggs theyd both mated with her when ginger made her seasonal pheromones spring to life had she been a tosevite she knew she would have cared which one was the father luckily being a female of the race she didnt need to worry about that business came first superior sir i regret to report that the deutsche appear unyielding on the matter of ginger smuggling i am disappointed but i am not surprised the ambassador said corrupting us appears to be part of their strategy truth felless said though veffani had been tactless he could scarcely help knowing she was one of those ginger had corrupted not when hed been stimulated to mate with her she feared he also knew she still craved the herb though penalties for females who used it grew ever more severe they do not fear our countersmuggling efforts then veffani said if they do they give little sign of it felless said though you have warned me they are adept at bluffing they are better than adept they are liars from the moment they leave their eggshellsuh that is the bodies of their mothers veffani corrected himself what is our course to be then felless asked i shall have to consult with my superiors the ambassador replied my own inclination is to continue on our present course until its failure is manifest that has certainly not been proved the deutsche will smuggle we should do the same to show them the game has its prices truth superior sir felless said in fact if you will recall i was the first to warn the deutsche that we were on the point of instituting such a policy she wanted credit for it too i do recall senior researcher i was there after all veffani sounded amused she didnt mind if he laughed so long as he remembered it but having reminded him she thought it wiser to change the subject slomikk tells me my hatchlings have shed their egg teeth as he might have sired them that might be of some small interest to him as it was to her yes it would be about time for that he agreed with the polite attention shed expected now back to ways of dealing with the miserable deutsche monique dutourd angrily shook her head no i dont want to go to the cinema with you she told dieter kuhn i dont want to go to supper with you i dont want to go anywhere with you if you care anything at all about making me happy go away and leave me alone kuhn was slight and dark he looked as much like a native of marseille as monique did shed assumed he was a frenchman when he enrolled in her roman history class at the university he wrote french like a native but he was no frenchman he was a sturmbannfuthrer in the ss in marseille to bring ginger smuggling through the port under the control of the reich he folded his arms across his chest in the lecture hall which was to moniques dismay empty but for the two of them i do not ask this because of my duty he said his spoken french was good but doubly alien in her ears he used parisian french not the local dialect and had a guttural accent that showed he was from the wrong side of the rhine i ask for myself how big a fool are you how big a fool do you think i am monique demanded hotly youve arrested my brother before now that pierres gone back on the arrangement he had with you you want to kill him the only reason you ever cared about me was to get at him that was a reason true he agreed with a brisk nod not in the least french but it was not the only reason i have always found you attractive hed said that before hed done so little besides saying it every now and again that shed put it down for just another ploy shed wondered if he preferred boys in fact if not wouldnt he have tried harder to get her into bed a woman in occupied france who told an ss man no ran all sorts of risks but hed never used his position to take advantage of her either never till now smiling not so pleasantly he went on you should be friendlier to me would you really care to have the reichs security service examine the political content of your lectures on the germanic invasions of the roman empire believe me i can arrange it ice ran through her when the germans investigated you they locked you up threw away the key and decided latersometimes much laterwhether they wanted to find it again but dieter kuhn had given her warnings like that once or twice before he hadnt followed up on them and so she shook her head again go away she said and then added a localism that meant the same thing but was a good deal stronger she hadnt really thought he would understand it by the way his face froze he did i believe you will discover you have made a mistake he said and turned on his heel with a military precision altogether teutonic when he strode out of the hail she discovered to her surprise that she felt worse alone in it than she had with him she looked down at her hands they were shakinga curious mixture of fury and fear her legs felt very light as she went downstairs to liberate her bicycle from its slot in the rack she rode north up rue breteuil toward her flat which was not far from the old port the one that had attracted the ancient greeks to what theyd called massilia the weather was crisp but not cold even february in marseille rarely had much bite as she pedaled along frenchmen whistled at her she was used to that and ignored it a couple of wehrmacht troopers in a fieldgray volkswagen utility vehicle also loudly approved of the way she looked she ignored them too they didnt know who she was just that she was a woman they found pretty that made them harmless she wished something would make dieter kuhn harmless too along with the frenchmen and women and germans on the streets of marseille she also saw a fair number of lizards theyd held the city and much of the south of france during the fighting and still did a lot of business with the greater german reich here some of that business was legitimate and craved by the occupiers but the nazis would have suppressed the rest if only they could ever since it was named massilia marseille had been a smugglers paradise and so when monique noticed a lizard slowly walking past her block of flats she didnt think much of it she came to a stop and got ready to lug the bicycle upstairs in this part of town unlike the university it would not be waiting for her in the morning if she left it in the street before she could manhandle it into her building the lizard came up to her and spoke in hissing not too grammatical french estce que vous etes monique dutourd yes im monique dutourd she answered with some surprise what do you want with me you are the brotherno i err the sisterof the famous pierre dutourd is it not so the lizard asked i seek to reach the famous dutourd on a matter of business for both of us but i have the difficulties you can it could be help his business had to be ginger ginger or drugs for people go away monique said quietly she wanted to scream it dieter kuhn or some other nazi was surely keeping an eye on her the germans wanted her brother too but why do you wish me to go the lizard asked his kind she had heard were naive but she hadnt expected him to be so naive as to ask a question like that before she could say anything he went on there could be much profit in the business i do with your famous brother some of that profit would go to you as middleman monique laughed in his face which startled him into drawing back a step go away she repeated dont you know the germans spy on me they are also looking for my brother my famous brother she laughed again though doubting the lizard understood the irony they are looking for him so they can kill him but why is this the male seemed honestly bewildered he still smuggles ginger to the race it is only that now he smuggles also other things to you tosevites could they care so much about this explaining things struck monique as more trouble than it was worth without even bothering to tell him to go away again she started taking the bicycle up the stairs she had papers to grade and with a little luck a longstalled project on the epigraphy of the cult of isis in gallia narbonensis to work on finally sensing he wasnt going to get anywhere the lizard called after her tell him my name is ssimachan he will know of me he will want to do business with me we can make much profit together he and i monique had no intention of telling pierre any such thing this ssimachan struck her as so inept he was far more likely to bring danger with him than profit he probably had swarms of gestapo men following him too if they happened to run into the ones who were or might be shadowing her that was as unpleasant a thought as shed had in quite a while she sauteed squid in olive oil for supper a meal the romans would also have enjoyed then she went through the papers as fast as she could as usual dieter kuhnshe went by the name of laforce in her classeswas very good she snarled something under her breath he never gave her any excuse to fail him or even to give him less than a superior mark after recording the grades she got out her photographs and photostats and copies of drawings made and published by classicists over the previous three centuries if she ever finished her monograph on isisworship in this part of the world during roman times she could publish it without too much fear unlike remarks on romanogerman relations the cult of isis held few modern political overtones at about eleven her yawns made her realize she wouldnt get anything more done that night she put away the inscriptions and her notes got into a nightgown and went to bed shed sometimes thought her life would be easier had dieter kuhn wanted nothing more than her body even so she was delighted to sleep alone the peremptory knock on her door came in the best cinematic style a few minutes past midnight too logy with sleep to be as frightened as she should she staggered out of bed and went to the door go away she said as she had to the lizard you damned drunk youre trying to get into the wrong apartment you will open at once in the name of the security service of the greater german reich a cold voice from the hall replied after that she wasnt sleepy any more and was as frightened as anyone could reasonably have expected her to be numbly she opened the door one of the germans standing in the hall aimed a pistol at her another one shone a bright flashlight in her face two more stepped forward and grabbed her by the arms they hustled her down the stairs and into their waiting van she hoped theyd closed the door after her but didnt get the chance to look back and see if they hadnt her apartment would be picked clean by the time she got back of course that assumed she would be coming back the glares the nazis gave her made such an assumption look worse by the minute the palais de justice lay on the rue breteuil she cycled past it every day what the german occupiers meant by justice was liable to be different from what the builders of the palais had in mind her captors frogmarched her into the building then shoved her at a trio of hardfaced blond women in fieldgray search her one of the men said in german and the women did with a thoroughness none of her doctors not even her gynecologist had ever come close to matching they enjoyed probing her at least as much as men would have and didnt bother hiding it she was smarting in more than one sensitive spot when they flung her into a cell humiliated terrified she lay down on the hard lumpy cot and dozed off she was in the middle of a nightmare when another brilliant light pried her eyelids open a couple of german troopers hauled her off the cot with effortless strength time for questions now an ss man said cheerfully they sat her down and started grilling her the questions were what she might have expected about her brother about his dealings with the lizards about the lizard whod tried to use her to reach him her chief interrogator grinned at her your precious pierre wont be very happy when he hears weve nabbed you will he i dont know he might not even care she answered if the germans were using her as a lever against her brother they were liable to be disappointed she hadnt even known he was alive till dieter kuhn told her and the milk of human kindness ran thin in his veins but her answer wasnt what the german wanted to hear lying bitch he snarled and backhanded her across the face things rapidly went downhill from there she told the germans everything they asked everything she knew it wasnt enough to satisfy them nothing she thought would have been enough to satisfy them at one point she moaned at least let me telephone the university and let them know i wont be in today whatever happened to her sheand her administratorsreckoned classes sacred her interrogator didnt he slapped her again and painfully squeezed her breast through the thin cotton of her nightgown i hope they fire you whore he said with a laugh then you can turn tricks for a living the way you did with that kike of a goldfarb who put him on to you anyhow i dont know she answered he never told me that got her another slap after some endless timelong enough for monique to piss herself for they made her go through that humiliation rather than pausing long enough for her to use a toiletthey took her back to the cell without food without water without anything worth having she didnt care she was past caring she lay down and fell asleep or perhaps passed out and then of course someone shook her awake blearily blurrily she looked up one eye was swollen nearly shut and saw dieter kuhn standing over her bonsoir monique the ss man said with a pleasant smile would you care to take supper with me tomorrow night she knew what she wanted to tell him she almost did but now she also knew what could happen to anyone who made the germans unhappy shed thought she knew before but now she understood the difference between academic knowledge and personal experience though she hated herself what passed her bruised dry lips was one croaked word yes group captain burton paston the commander of the raf radar station on the outskirts of belfast looked from the papers on his desk to flight lieutenant david goldfarb who sat across the desk from him you truly wish to resign your commission in the royal air force paston sounded incredulous as if goldfarb were coming to him for permission to commit some particularly sordid crime yes sir goldfarb said firmly paston scratched at his saltandpepper mustache and why might i ask do you seek to do such a thing its in the forms i filled out sir david goldfarb answered group captain paston should have read them that he hadnt was a bad sign my family and i have the opportunity to emigrate to canada but the dominion wont accept any serving officers in her majestys forces a policy of which i heartily approve i might add paston peered at goldfarb through the top half of his bifocals why would you want to emigrate in any case sir david stared at the station commander in dismay group captain paston hadnt come along yesterday he was no fool goldfarb knew as much if he was deliberately acting obtuse that had to mean trouble ahead taking a deep breath goldfarb laid it on the line sir you know im a jew and you have to know that things have been getting harder and harder for jews in britain the past few years his voice trailed off again his parents had fled to england from what was then russianheld poland to escape pogroms before the first world war but now with the united kingdom shorn of its empire by the lizards with the greater german reich across the channel britain was slowly accommodating herself to the masters of the continent that left little room for people like david goldfarb and his family and you want to get out while the getting is good is that it paston asked yes sir im afraid that is about it david answered caring nothing whatever for the service that took you out of east end london and made you into someone worthy of respect group captain paston said goldfarbs cheeks and ears heated ill care for the raf till my dying day but i must say sir i havent always got whatever respect i may be worth from some raf officersnot you sir i hasten to add but there are some in this service who think one of her majestys officers has nothing better to do than help smuggle ginger which is how i ended up in the nazis gaol in marseille if we can hurt the lizards in no other way than with ginger for the time being then ginger we must use paston said i do admit the line between official and unofficial can grow blurry in those circumstances but not half goldfarb broke in some of those blokeshe had group captain basil roundbush a former colleague and current oppressor in mindhave got themselves rich off the smuggling trade none of which has anything to do with you the group captain told him his voice suddenly distant and chilly nor can i in good conscience accept a resignation based on petty personal problems accordingly your request is denied and you will return to your normal duties at once what david yelped you cant do that not only can i flight lieutenant i just have paston answered he was righthe could goldfarb hadnt expected that he would though paston had always been pretty decent as far as commanding officers went but goldfarb had pointblank refused to do any more smuggling for basil roundbush and roundbush had promised hed regret it my god he burst out theyve told you to keep me stuck in the service so i cant leave the country he didnt know exactly who they were but he did know roundbush had friends in high places i havent the faintest notion of what youre talking about group captain paston said but for the first time he spoke with something less than perfect selfassurance and i have given you quite enough of my time too you want to be rid of me goldfarb said well i want to be rid of the raf ill do that any way i have to believe me by a deliberate show of disobedience or incompetence do you mean paston asked and david nodded the radarstation commander gave him a thin chilly smile if you try that flight lieutenant you will indeed leave the raf you will leave it with a badconduct discharge i promise you and you are welcome to see how well you do emigrating with that on your record goldfarb stared at him in dismay he could have said several different things any one of them might have brought him the sort of discharge group captain paston had mentioned at last after some effort he managed i believe thats most unjust sir im sorry you think so paston said but i have already told you i have no more time to listen to your complaints you are dismissed why you again david goldfarb bit back a response that would have landed him in trouble shaking he got to his feet as he turned to leave the group captains office though he couldnt help adding they have got to you paston busied himself with the papers in his in basket goldfarb didnt think he was going to answer but he did we all have to do certain things for the sake of the service as a whole flight lieutenant and im the pawn to be sacrificed is that it goldfarb said this time group captain paston didnt reply but he didnt really need to either still shaking his head in disgust goldfarb strode out of his office he didnt slam the door behind him however much he wanted to that would have been a petty revenge and the revenge he wanted was anything but petty how to get it without ending up in trouble much worse than a badconduct discharge was unfortunately another question altogether a couple of enlisted men saluted him as he walked out into the watery february sunshine that was the best belfast had to offer to them his officers uniform spoke more loudly than his sallow skin his beak of a nose and his curly hair of a brown now graying not quite the right shade for one whose ancestors were respectably anglosaxon or celtic goldfarb snorted bitterly as he returned the salutes he wished his superiors thought the same way what am i going to do he wondered he knew he had to do something staying in a britain slowly succumbing to the embrace of the reich didnt bear thinking about his parents had seen the writing on the wall and escaped from poland his wifes parents had got her out of germany not long before the kristallnacht spelled the beginning of the end for jews there waiting for trouble to land wasnt in his blood or naomis either without leaving the raf he couldnt go to canada and he couldnt get out of the raf he didnt think he could go to the united states either though the secretary at the american consulate hadnt been quite so definite about it have to find out he muttered under his breath suppose the yanks said no he didnt want to suppose that he wanted to suppose anything but that the way his luck was running thoughthe way basil roundbush and his pals were helping to make his luck runhe wouldnt have bet on anything going his way where else can i go another question this one addressed to the washedout smokestained sky the few bits of europe the germans didnt occupy were far more subservient to the reich than the united kingdom the soviet union he snorted again that would be jumping back into the frying pan his parents had fled the russians might want him for what he knew about radars but that didnt mean theyd treat him like anything but a damn jew goldfarb was about to climb aboard his bicycle to ride back to his flat in the officers housing and give naomi the bad news when he paused if all he wanted was to escape britain he was leaving more than half the world out of his calculationsthe part the lizards ran well its no wonder i didnt think of that straight off he said as if someone had asserted the opposite hed fought the lizards even harder than hed fought the nazis hed gone into a polish prison carrying a sten gun to get his cousin moishe russie out of there and hed fought with everything he could get his hands on when the race invaded england and now he wanted to live under their rule he shook his head he didnt want to living under the rule of the race was one of the last things he wanted to do but staying in britain any longer was the very last thing he wanted to do after a moment he shook his head again that wasnt right he might think it was when he was feeling down but it wasnt getting arrested in marseille had been very instructive in that regard he would much sooner have tried to spend the rest of his life in britain than set foot in the greater german reich again for even ten minuteswhich was about how long he thought hed last and ive even got wires to pull he murmured these days moishe russie far from languishing in a lizard prison sometimes advised the fleetlord himself on how to deal with troublesome tosevites his cousins influence had got him out of that nazi gaol maybe it could get him out of britain too he swung onto the bicycle and started to ride as he did so a new name welled up in his mind palestine his cousin moishe lived in jerusalem hed gone there after the nazis resentfully turned him loose what would living in palestine be like next year in jerusalem for how many centuries had that been a jewish prayer could he make it come true an austinhealey almost ran him over he shouted something unkind at the driver who kept on going without a clue about the near miss goldfarb had had to make his way against the tide of antisemitism throughout his life hed conducted himself creditably in combat on the ground and in the air and had the medal ribbons above his breast pocket to prove it against idiot drivers though the gods contended in vain after his brush with death goldfarb realized hed asked himself the wrong question he thought he had a good chance of being able to move his family to palestine if he couldnt get to canada or the usa which counted for more freedom or simple survival how much freedom will i have ten years from now if i stay here he mused how much will my children have he didnt like the answers he found for either of those questions his parents had known enough to get out when the getting was good so had naomis that made up his mind for him if traffic didnt do him in hed keep trying to escape even if escape meant palestine little by little jerusalem began to settle down after the latest round of arab rioting reuven russie shook his head as he walked toward the medical college that bore his fathers name it wasnt so much that jerusalem was settling down as that the riots had a few days between them now rather than coming one on the heels of another when the arabs erupted they were as fierce as ever for the moment they were quiet an arab woman in a long black dress with a black scarf on her head walked past reuven he nodded politely so did she though his clothes and his fair skin clearly said he was a jew did something nasty gleam in her eyes despite the polite nod maybe maybe not the arabs riots were aimed first and foremost at the lizards with the jews being secondary targets because they got on with the race better than their arab neighbors did reuven wondered if that woman had been screeching allahu akbar and breaking windows or throwing rocks or setting fires during the latest round of turmoil he wouldnt have been a bit surprised the sour smell of old burning still clung to jerusalem even after a latewinter rainstorm the rain hadnt been able to wash away all the soot streaking the golden sandstone that was the most common local building material either a razorwire security perimeter surrounded the moishe russie medical college as reuven approached a lizard in a sandbagged strongpoint waved an automatic rifle at him show me your authorization for entry the lizard snapped in his own language no one who didnt understand that language was likely to have authorization to pass through the perimeter it shall be done reuven said also in the language of the race he handed the lizard a plastic card with his photograph the lizard didnt compare the photograph to his appearance even after more than twenty years on earth many males of the race had trouble telling one human being from another instead the soldier fed the card into an electronic gadget and waited to see what colored lights came on the result must have satisfied him for he handed the card back to russie when the machine spat it out pass on he said gesturing with the rifle i thank you reuven answered the medical college had come under heavy attack during the fighting he was glad the race thought the school important enough not to be endangered so again he certainly thought it was that important though he would have admitted he was biased nowhere else on earth did the lizards teach people what they knew of medicine and their knowledge was generations ahead of what humanity had understood about the art before the race came learning some of what the lizards knew had been moishe russies goal ever since the fighting stopped reuven was proud hed been accepted to follow in his fathers footsteps if he hadnt passed the qualifying examinations the name above the entrance to the block lizard building wouldnt have meant a thing he went inside the race had built doors and ceilings high enough to suit humans and the seats in the halls fit tosevite fundaments other than that the race had made few concessions reuven carried artificial fingerclaws in a little plastic case in his back pocket without them he would have had a devil of a time using the computer terminals here more people than lizards bustled through the halls on the way to one class or another the peoplemost of them in their mid to late twenties like reuvenwere students the lizards instructors physicians from the conquest fleet now joined by a few from the colonization fleet as well reuven and another student got to the door of their lecture hall at the same time i greet you ibrahim reuven said in the language of the racethe language of instruction at the college and the only one all the human students had in common i greet you ibrahim nuqrashi replied he was lean and dark with a perpetually worried expression since he came from baghdad which was even more convulsed than jerusalem reuven had a hard time blaming him they went in together talking about biochemistry and genesplicing when they got inside their eyes went in the same direction to see if any seats were empty near jane archibald jane was blond and shapely easily the prettiest girl at the college no wonder then that she was already surrounded by male students this morning she smiled at reuven and called good day in englishshe was from australia though heaven only knew if shed go back there once her studies were done the lizards were colonizing the island continent more thoroughly than anywhere else except perhaps the deserts of arabia and north africa nuqrashi sighed as he and reuven sat down maybe i should learn english he said still in the language of the race english was the human language most widely shared among the students but reuven didnt think that was why the arab wanted to acquire it he didnt get much of a chance to worry about it into the lecture hall came shpaaka the instructor along with the other students reuven sprang to his feet and folded himself into the best imitation of the races posture of respect his human frame could manage i greet you superior sir he chorused with his comrades i greet you students shpaaka replied you may be seated anyone who sat without permission landed in hot water even more than most lizards shpaaka was a stickler for protocol his eye turrets swiveled this way and that as he surveyed the class i must say that until i read through this latest set of examination papers i had no idea there were so many ways to write my language incorrectly jane archibald raised her hand when shpaaka recognized her she asked superior sir is that not because we are all used to our own languages rather than to yours so that our native grammar persists even when we use your vocabulary i think you may well be correct shpaaka replied the race has done some research on grammatical substrates work occasioned by our conquests of the rabotevs and hallessi our ongoing experience with the multiplicity of languages here on tosev clearly shows more investigation will be needed his eye turrets surveyed the class once more any further questions or comments no very well i begin he lectured as if his human students were males and females of the race diluting nothing slowing down not at all those who couldnt stand the pace had to leave the medical college and pursue their training if they pursued it at a merely human university reuven scribbled frantically he was lucky in that hed already known hebrew english yiddish and childhood pieces of polish before tackling the races language after four tongues adding a fifth wasnt so bad students whod spoken only their native language before tackling that of the race were likelier to have a hard time after lecture laboratory after laboratory more lecture after that more lab work now concentrating on enzyme synthesis and suppression rather than genetic analysis by the end of the day reuven felt as if his brain were a sponge soaked to the saturation point by tomorrow morning he would have to be ready to soak up just as much again wringing his hand as he stuck his pen back in its case he asked jane would you like to come to my house for supper tonight she cocked her head to one side as she considered its bound to be better than the food in the dormitoriesthough your mothers cooking deserves something nicer than that said about it she answered your father is always interesting and your sisters are cute reuven thought of the twins as unmitigatedwell occasionally mitigatednuisances what about me he asked plaintivelyshed mentioned everyone else in the russie household oh you her blue eyes twinkled i suppose ill come anyway she laughed at the look on his face then went on if the riots start up again i can always sleep on your sofa you could always sleep in my bed he suggested she shook her head you didnt sleep in mine when you spent that night in the dormitory while the fighting in the city was so bad she wasnt offended she reached out and took his hand come on lets go im getting hungry standing here talking several students gave reuven jealous looks as he and jane left the campus hand in hand they made him feel three meters tall in fact he was a thoroughly ordinary one meter seventythree centimetersin absent moments he thought of it as five feet eightso when he and jane looked into each others eyes they did so on a level three or four arab men whooped when they saw jane they approved of big blondes she took no notice of them which worked better than telling them where to go and how to get there that only encouraged them ive brought jane home for supper reuven called in yiddish as he came inside thats fine his mother answered from the kitchen in the same language there will be plenty rivka russie reuven was convinced could feed an invading army as long as it gave her fifteen minutes notice his sisters came out and greeted jane in halting english and in the language of the race which they were studying at school judith and esther had just entered their teens next to janes ripe curves they definitely seemed works in progress she answered them in the bits and pieces of hebrew shed picked up since coming to jerusalem reuven smiled to himself like most native english speakers she couldnt come out with a proper guttural to save her life judithhe was pretty sure it was judith though the twins were identical and wore their hair the same way not least for the sake of the confusion it causedturned to him and said cousin davids having more troubles fathers doing what he can to fix things but she shrugged what now reuven asked its not the nazis again is it no but the english dont want to let him leave his sister answered and things are getting scary for jews over there gevalt he said and then translated for jane she nodded understanding its like being a human in australia the lizards wish none of us were left after what they did to our cities its a wonder any of us are for her dealing with oppression from outside had begun when she was a little girl for reuven it had begun two thousand years before he was born he didnt make the comparison not out loud his father came home a few minutes later moishe russie looked like an older version of reuven hed gone bald on top and the hair he had left was iron gray reuven asked whats this i hear about cousin david moishe grimaced that could be a problem the fleetlord doesnt seem very interested in helping him out its not as if hes in jail or about to be executed hes just having a hard time atvar thinks plenty of tosevites are having worse times so he wont do anything about it he and reuven had both spoken hebrew which jane could follow after a fashion in english she said thats terrible what will he do if he cant get out of england english was moishe russies fourth language after yiddish polish and hebrew he stuck to the latter hell have to do the best he can right now i dont know how i can give him a hand from the kitchen rivka russie called suppers ready everyone come to the table reuven headed for the dining room but discovered hed lost some of his appetite the flatthey didnt call them apartments down herein which the lizards had set up rance auerbach and penny summers was barely half the size of the one rance had lived in by himself in fort worth and that one had been none too large he limped to the refrigerator which was also about half the size of the one hed had up in the states even though the flat was tiny he was panting by the time he got there hed never win a footrace not after the lizards had shot him in the leg and in the chest during the fighting in colorado he supposed he was lucky nobodyd amputated that leg he would have been a lot more certain had keeping it not meant living in pain every day of his life since one way or another he did what he could to ease that pain he took a lion lager out of the icebox and popped off the lid with a churchkey at the hiss penny called bring me one of those too will you okay he answered his texas drawl contrasted with her harsh flat kansas tone here in south africa they both sounded funny he opened another beer and carried it out to penny who was sitting on a sofa that had seen better days she took it with a murmur of thanks then lifted it in salute mud in your eye she said and drank she was a brassy blonde of about forty a few years younger than rance sometimes she still looked like the farm girl hed first met during the fighting more often though a lot more often she seemed hard as nails with a sardonic glint in her blue eyes she raised the beer bottle again and heres to south africa goddammit oh shut up auerbach said wearily it was hot in the flat late february was summer down here not too humid thoughthe climate was more like los angeles than fort worths auerbach sank down on the sofa beside her he grunted his leg didnt like going from standing to sitting it liked going from sitting to standing even less he took a pull at his lion then smacked his lips they do make pretty good beer here ill give em that hot damn penny said even more sarcastically than before she waved her bottle around arent you glad we came well that depends thanks to the bullet hed taken in the shoulder and lung rances voice was a rasping croak he lit a cigarette every doctor hed ever seen told him he was crazy for smoking but nobody told him how to quit after another sip he went on it beats spending the rest of my life in a lizard hoosegowor a german one for that matter it beats going back to the usa too on account of your gingersmuggling buddies want you dead for stiffing em and me for plugging the first two bastards they sent after you he had to pause and pant a little he couldnt give speeches not these dayshe didnt have the wind for it while he was reinflating penny said you still think it beats australia if she hadnt burst back into his life on the run from the dealers shed cheated he would still be back in fort worth doing what he knew what getting drunk collecting pension checks and playing nickelante poker with the other ruined men down at the american legion hall he coughed a couple of times which also hurt yeah it still beats australia he answered at last the lizards wouldnt have been happy shipping us thereas far as theyre concerned its theirs and even if they did do it theyd have their eye turrets on us every second of the day and night yeah yeah yeah i know i know i know penny plucked the pack of cigarettes out of his shirt pocket and lit one herself she smoked it in short savage puffs and then when it was hardly more than a butt aimed the glowing coal at him like the business end of a pistol but when you asked em to send us here mr smart guy you didnt know it was gonna be nigger heaven did you no i didnt know that auerbach answered querulously how the hell was i supposed to know that white men ran things here before the fighting i knew that much tell me you heard a whole hell of a lot about south africa in the news since the lizards took it over go on i dare you penny didnt say anything she stubbed out the cigarette and lit another one rance used that pause to take a swig from the lion lager and to draw a couple of breaths he went on i guess it makes sense the way they did what they did they dont give a damn about white men and black men and there are more blacks than whites here and the whites are the ones who fought em hardest and so so its nigger heaven penny rolled her eyes you know what till the lizards came i never even saw a niggernot for real i mean only in the movies werent any where i grew up i didnt figure itd be like this when we came here neither did i auerbach admitted how could i have you wanted to go to a place where people speak english as much as i did that didnt leave us a whole lot of choice not to anywhere the lizards were willing to send us some people speak englisha lot fewer than i thought penny aimed that second cigarette at rance too and a lot fewer than you thought too and you cant tell me any different about that either at least in the united states the colored people can talk with you and they mostly know their place too she got up from the sofa and walked quickly to the window of the thirdfloor flat the stairs were hell on rances bad leg but he couldnt do anything about that staring out onto hanover street the main drag of cape towns disreputable district six penny gestured to him come over here though his leg felt as if hed jabbed a hot iron into it rance rose and limped to the window he looked down and saw a trim figure in a khaki uniform and a cap like the ones british officers wore the man had a bayoneted rifle slung on his back what did you get me up for he asked ive seen potlako on his beat plenty of times before hes a cop penny said hes black as the ace of spades and hes a cop almost all the cops in cape town are black as the ace of spades hes a pretty good cop too by what ive seen rance said which made penny give him a furious look ignoring it he went on the lizards arent stupid they tried playing blacks against whites in the usa too but it didnt work out so well there a lot more smokes than white men here and i guess the south africans treated em worse than we did our colored fellows so theyre happy as you please working for the lizards sure they are you just bet they are penny snarled and now they treat us like we was niggers and i tell you something rance auerbach i dont like it for hell auerbach limped into the kitchen opened another beer and went back to the couch i dont like it either but i dont know what i can do about it if you cant stand it any more i bet the lizards would fly you back to the states after all by now theyve probably figured out youd last about twenty minutes after you got off the plane thatd suit em fine i bet she put her hands on her hips looking for a moment like a furious schoolgirl she sounded like one too when she wailed look what you got me into he was sipping from the lion lager he started to laugh and choked and sprayed beer out his nose and generally came closer to drowning than he ever had in his life when he could talk againwhich took a little whilehe said who called me out of the blue after more than fifteen years whose fault was it that i shot those two nasty bastards whose fault was it that i ended up in a lizard jail for running ginger down into mexico or in a nazi jail for trying to get pierre the damn turd to quit running it out of marseille you know anybody who fills that bill by the time he got through he was speaking in a rasping whisper that being as much air as he could force out of his ravaged lungs he waited to see how penny would take a little plain home truth thrown in her face sometimes she went off like a rocket sometimes he thought she was going to ignite here she started to he saw that then all at once she laughed instead she laughed as hard as she would have raged if shed stayed furious oh you got me god damn you she said wiping her eyes on the sleeve of her checked cotton blouse you got me good there okay i had a little something to do with getting you into things too just a little something yeah rance agreed penny got herself a fresh beer too then came over and sat down beside him so close they rubbed together she swigged set down the bottle and leaned over to look into his face from a distance of about four inches havent i done my best to make it up to you she asked and ran her tongue over her lips i dont know what the hell youre talking about rance said evenly for a second he thought hed blown it and made her angry but to his relief she decided to laugh again well then ill just have to show you wont i she said and brought her mouth down onto his she tasted of beer and cigarette smoke but he did too so that was all right the kiss went on and on auerbach brought up his hand and tangled his fingers in her yellow hair so she couldnt pull back finally he was the one who had to break away it was either that or quit breathing altogether she let his hand slide down to the back of her neck where he started undoing the buttons on the blouse arent you a sneak she said as if shed never expected he would do any such thing she took matters into her own hands yanking the blouse off over her head he undid her bra and grabbed for her breasts she still had a hell of a nice pair when she laughed this time it was down deep in her throat she unzipped his fly pulled him out and bent down over him his gasp had very little to do with bad lungs she had a hell of a mouth too if shed felt like going on that way till he exploded he wouldnt have minded a bitwhich was putting it mildly but after a little while she pulled down his chinos took off her skirt and her girdle and swung astride him as if she intended to ride him to victory in the kentucky derby his mouth closed on her nipple now she grabbed his head and pressed him to her he slipped a hand between her legs and rubbed gently her breath came almost as short as his and shed never taken a bullet in the lungs when she gasped and shuddered and arched her back she squeezed him inside her almost as if she had a hand of her own down there he groaned and came and had to work very hard to remember not to bite god damn he said sincerely its worth fighting with you just on account of the way we make up who says weve made up penny demanded but whether she wanted it to or not her voice held a purr that hadnt been there before she slid off himand dribbled on his thigh god damn he said again this time in mock anger i put that stuff where it was supposed to go im not supposed to be wearing it i dont want it staying where you put it either she retorted thatd be the last thing i needgetting knocked up at my age she shook her head in what was either real horror or a pretty good imitation then gathering up her clothes she hurried off to the bathroom auerbach sat there in just his shirt waiting for her to come out he wanted another cigarette all of him except his lungs wanted one anyhow what with all the trouble hed had breathing while penny straddled him he let them win the argument for once instead of the smoke he finished the rest of the lion lager sitting on the table it felt like what it was a consolation prize but life didnt hand out so many prizes of any sort that he could turn one down when penny did come out she smiled to see him still mostly naked he picked up his pants and used the arm of the sofa to help lever himself to his feet that took some of the strain off his bad leg but made his ruined shoulder groan cant win he muttered as he limped past her toward the john christ you cant break even either if being in cape town didnt prove that he was damned if he knew what would gorppet rattled along in a mechanized combat vehicle heading northwest toward the tosevite city of baghdad basra where hed been stationed was calm these daysor so his leaders kept saying gorppet had seen a lot of nasty fighting after the race landed on tosev basra didnt feel calm to him nor anything close but no one had asked his opinion he was there to do what his officers told him to do if that turned out to be stupid as it sometimes did he had to make the best of it too bad about fotsev said betvoss one of the males in his squad truthtoo bad agreed gorppet who didnt much care for betvoss he was a good male and a good squad leader now you are stuck with me instead he swung an eye turret toward betvoss to see what the other male would make of that i curse the big uglies betvoss said the spirits of emperors past will surely turn their backs on them his voice went shrill with complaint as it did too often to suit gorppet i curse them all the more for forcing ginger on the females of ours they had kidnapped and for using the females pheromones to lure us into that ambush they are sneaky gorppet said if you forget how sneaky they are you will regret itif you live to regret it he put his own worries into words i hope they are not quieting down in basra to persuade us to lessen the garrison there so they can rise up again after we have weakened ourselves they are not clever enough to think of something like that i am sure of it betvoss said another reason gorppet was less than fond of him was that he thought he knew more than he did he went on besides if we can stamp out the rebellion in this baghdad place it will also fade in basra that might even have been true baghdad was a bigger more important tosevite center than basra even so gorppet didnt care to admit betvoss could be right about anything the squad leader said until we hunt down that maniac of an agitator called khomeini this whole subregion will go on bubbling and boiling like a pot over too high a fire he wondered if betvoss would argue about that since betvoss was ready to argue about almost everything it wouldnt have surprised him but the other male only made the affirmative hand gesture and said truth one of the things we will have to do to carry this world fully into the empire is to bring the big uglies superstitions under our control we ought to do that anyhow for the sake of truth betvoss said imagine believing some sort of oversized big ugly up above the sky manufactured the whole universe can you think of anything more preposterous no but then i am not a tosevite gorppet said speaking the last phrase with considerable relief in an effort to be charitable he added of course up till now they have not known of the emperors and so have been forming their beliefs in ignorance rather than in truth but they cling to their false notions with such persistencewe would not be going from one city to another like this if they did not betvoss said and if i never hear allahu akbar again i shall not be sorry for it truth every male in the rear compartment of the mechanized combat vehicle said that several of them added emphatic coughs to show how strongly they felt about it truth indeed gorppet said any male who has served where they say such things knows what a truth it is because it is a truth we must stay especially alert remember too many of the local tosevites will give up their own lives if they can take us with them they believe this will assure them of a happy afterlife as you said they know not the emperors betvoss voice dripped scorn gorppet scorned the big uglies for their foolish beliefs too that didnt mean he failed to respect them as fighters and especially as guerrilla fighters he pressed an eye turret to the viewing prism above a firing port and looked out of the combat vehicle he sat on the left side of the vehicle the one that faced away from the river so he could see not only the farmlandworked by big uglies in long flowing robesbut also the drier country where irrigation stopped the landscape in fact put him in mind of home it was no wonder the colonists were running up so many new towns in the interior of this region towns watered with pipes from desalination plants by the edge of the nearest sea even the weather in this part of tosev was decent the mechanized combat vehicle didnt have its heater going full blast as it would have on most of the planet gorppet had fought through one winter in the sssr hed told some stories about that when he went into one of the new towns none of the newly revived colonists believed him hed stopped telling those stories for that matter hed stopped going into the new towns he disliked the colonists almost as much as he disliked the big uglies he disliked everyone except his comrades from the conquest fleet and with betvoss beside him he was forcibly reminded he didnt much care for some of them either before it should have the vehicle came to a halt tracks rattling oh by the emperor what now gorppet demanded none of his fellow infantrymales knew of coursethey were as cooped up as he he picked up the intercom and put the question to the driver if he didnt know everybody was in trouble he had an answer all right but not one gorppet cared to hear the accursed tosevites managed to sabotage the bridge we are supposed to pass over what do you mean sabotage gorppet asked irritably i am in this metal box back here remember i cannot see straight ahead if i do not look out a viewing prism i cannot see out at all they bombed the span it fell into the river is that plain enough for you exalted squadlord the driver also sounded irritable how did they manage to bomb it gorppet exclaimed which made the males in his squad exclaim too he went on whoever let that happen ought to have green bands painted on himthe mark of someone undergoing punishmentand spend about the next ten yearsthe next ten tosevite years mind youcleaning out the big uglies stinking latrines with his tongue his squadmates laughed he was too furious to find it funny the driver said i agree with you but i cannot do anything about it how is this column of vehicles to proceed on to baghdad then if we cannot use the bridge gorppet asked we shall have to go on to as samawan and cross the river there the driver replied while it is not the route originally planned it should not delay us too much that is good gorppet said then he paused in sudden sharp suspicion why would the big uglies blow up a bridge if doing so causes us no great harm who knows why tosevites act as they do the driver said i know this they act as they do to cause us the greatest possible harm gorppet said with great conviction either they have an ambush waiting for us on the road to this as samawan place or they are going to the founder of the superstition in which the local big uglies believed so passionately a certain muhammad was said to be a prophet a male who could see the future the notion like so many on tosev was alien to the way the race thought but gorppet though not pausing even for a moment proved a prophet in his own right he hadnt finished his sentence before bullets started slamming into the mechanized combat vehicle a lot of bullets were slamming into the vehicle they must have a machine gun out there may the purple itch get under their scales he exclaimed grabbing for his own automatic weapon as he spoke the light cannon mounted atop the combat vehicle barked into life he peered out through the vision prism he couldnt see much because they were close by the riverthe tosevite name for it was the tigrisplant life grew exuberantly providing excellent cover for the big ugly raiders someone should have thought to trim the vegetation farther back from the roadway but no one had he didnt like that how many big uglies were sneaking through the rank noxiously green foliage toward the column there was the muzzle flash of the tosevites machine gun that being the only sure target he had gorppet started shooting at it if the machine gun fell silent he would know he was doing some good the rest of the males in his squad were also blazing away he didnt know what the males on the far side of the combat vehicle were shooting at but they seemed to have found something before he could ask a big ugly burst from the greenery and rushed toward the vehicle he was inevitably shouting allahu akbar he carried in his right hand a bottle with a flaming wick gorppet had seen those in the sssr they were full of petroleum distillates and could easily set even a landcruiser afire gorppet sprayed the tosevite with bullets one of them struck the bottle it burst and exploded into flame which caught on the big uglys robes and his flesh he would have been in greater torment still had gorppets bulletsand probably those of other males as wellnot toppled him and sent him quickly on the road to death then a grenade flew out of the plants and exploded not far from gorppets vehicle he fired in the direction from which it had come but couldnt tell whether hed hit the thrower another grenade burst on the far side of the vehicle we are surrounded betvoss shouted in alarm if betvoss could see it it should have been obvious to anyone gorppet yelled into the intercom we had better get out of here while we still can i have no orders the driver answered which struck gorppet as not being nearly reason enough to stay before he could say as much the other male added and i will not abandon my comrades without orders that unfortunately did make sense to gorppet he spotted a shape moving in among the greenery and fired at it even through the mechanized combat vehicles armor he heard the shriek the big ugly let out he snarled in savage satisfaction the vehicle did begin to back away then which presumably meant the ones behind it in the column had already started retreating the machine didnt have to go around any burning hulks for which gorppet let out a sigh of relief smoke dischargers helped shield the column from the tosevites eyes before long all the combat vehicles were speeding northwest along the road to as samawan gorppet wasnt the least bit unhappy to leave that marauding band of big uglies behind praise the spirits of emperors past that was not too expensive anyhow betvoss said all they made us do was change our route now we have to hope they have not mined the highway to as samawan gorppet said betvoss laughed but the squad leader went on i was not joking they have forced us to do something we did not plan to do that means we are moving to their plan not to our own they will have something waiting for us again he proved right the column had not gone much farther before a mine exploded under the lead combat vehicle fortunately it did no more than blow off a track the vehicles crew scrambled out made hasty repairs with soldiers and the guns of the rest of the column protecting them and got moving again all things considered it was as betvoss had said an inexpensive journey as a shuttlecraft pilot nesseref was one of the first females revived from the colonization fleet that meant she had more experience with big uglies than most of the other colonists in the new town outside jezow poland despite that experience she admittedindeed she proclaimed whenever she got the chanceshe did not understand the way the minds of the natives of tosev worked superior sir when i began coming into this city i could not imagine why you treated the tosevites with such restraint she told bunim the regional subadministrator based in lodz now having spent a while on the surface of the planet i begin to see they are all of them addled and many of them heavily armed i can conceive no more appalling combination the male from the conquest fleet answered you may think you are joking shuttlecraft pilot but that is the problem facing the race all over tosev poland is merely a microcosm of the planet as a whole in no way was i joking superior sir nesseref replied the poles are heavily armed they hate the jews the deutsche us and the russkis in that order the jews are also heavily armed they hate the deutsche the poles the russkis and us in that order the deutsche off to the west hate the jews us the russkis and the poles in that order the russkis off to the east hate the deutsche us the jews and the poles in that order the deutsche and the russkis of course are even more heavily armed than the jews and poles do i have it all straight more or less bunim said you will notice however that in your list each group of big uglies hates some other group of big uglies more than it hates us that is what makes our continued administration of this region possible yes i understand as much nesseref said but i also notice that each group of big uglies does hate us this strikes me as ungrateful on their part but seems to be so truth bunim agreed that is what makes our continued administration of this region difficult that is what makes our continued administration of this whole planet difficult each tosevite factionand there are tens upon tens of themreckons itself superior to all the others each resents being administered by anyone but one of its own members each also resents being administered by anyone not of the tosevite species and with so many explosivemetal bombs on this planet and orbiting it we must be cautious in our actions lest we touch off a catastrophe madness nesseref said utter madness oh indeed bunim used an emphatic cough to show just how much madness he thought it was but it is not madness we can afford to disregard understanding that fact has often come hard to males and females of the colonization fleet you show a better grasp of it than most i thank you regional subadministrator nesseref said difficulties in finding land for the shuttlecraft port and in dealing with big ugly laborers in the construction process have proved most educational i can see how they would everything on tosev is educational although some of the lessons are those we would rather not learn bunim paused and you are also acquainted with the jew anielewicz are you not yes superior sir nesseref answered she also paused before continuing for a big ugly he is quite likable she wondered how bunim would take that he certainly seemed none too fond of any of the tosevites whose territory he helped govern to her surprise the regional subadministrator said truth but bunim went on he is very clever he is very capable he is very dangerous he plays us off against the deutsche the poles and the russkis and plays those groups off against one another his own group should be the weakest among them but i am not nearly sure it isand if it is not that is largely thanks to his abilities many tosevites i gather are able nesseref said your experience is greater than mine but i would say as many tosevites are as able as are members of the race yes i would say that is probably a truth bunim agreed we would have an easier time on this planet were it a falsehood he let out a long heartfelt sigh no doubt nesseref said many big uglies are able as i say but few are or can make themselves be congenial to us anielewicz is one of those who can i count him a friend of sorts even if he is not of our speciescertainly more of a friend than an accursed male who sought to give me ginger to induce me to mate with him i sometimes think ginger is the revenge tosev is taking on the race for our efforts to bring this world into the empire bunim said wearily in some ways the herb causes us more trouble than the big uglies do truth nesseref said with an emphatic cough shed tried ginger once herself before the race fully understood what it did to females shed gone straight into her season of course and mated with a couple of bunims sentries only luck that she hadnt laid a clutch of eggs afterwards and only luckluck and a strong strong willthat the one taste hadnt led to addiction as it had for so many males and females bunim went on i also note that however congenial you may find anielewicz by no means do all of his fellow tosevites share your opinion he was recently the target of an assassination attempt by one of the big ugly groupings with no great use for jews i am not certain which but there is no shortage of such groups you have shown you understand as much yes nesseref did her best to hold in surprise and dismay murder especially political murder was rare among the race she supposed she shouldnt have been shocked to learn it was otherwise here on tosev but she was an attempt you say superior sir was he injured no apparently fearing someone might be seeking to attack him he dropped to the floor an instant before the assailant fired through the door of his flat whoever that assailant was he escaped i am relieved to hear anielewicz was not harmed nesseref said so was i the regional subadministrator answered you cannot imagine the chaos into which a successful assassination would have thrown this area i very likely cannot imagine it either and i am glad i do not have to he cared only about the politics involved not about anielewicz as an individual nesseref supposed she understood that bunim would have to go on dealing with whoever anielewiczs successor proved to be had the jew been killed still the attitude saddened her she returned to her own immediate business i do thank you for expediting inspections of the liquidhydrogen storage system at the shuttlecraft port an accident would be unfortunate truth bunim looked at her sidelong you have a gift for understatement shuttlecraft pilot i thank you nesseref answered i would be less concerned had the race done all the construction but even with the tosevites working to our specifications i want every possible assurance that they did the job properly i understand i shall see to it bunim turned one eye turret toward a chronometer and now if you will excuse me i also have other things to see to of course superior sir nesseref left bunims office and also left the building housing it having been in the hands of the race since shortly after the arrival of the conquest fleet it suited her kind about as well as a building originally put up by big uglies could when she went outside into the cold of the bialut market square she found herself back in a different world even tosevites had to wear layer upon layer of wrappings to protect themselves from their own planets weather that didnt deter them from gathering in large numbers to buy and sell foods of all sorts were on display no almost all sorts for this was a market full of jews and so held no pork which was to nesserefs way of thinking most regrettable so were more of the big uglies wrappings so were pots and pans and plates and the curious implements the tosevites used to feed themselves and so were a good many items obviously manufactured by the race nesseref wondered how theyd got there she wouldnt have been the least bit surprised to learn it was through no legitimate means the window in bunims office overlooked the market square she wondered if the regional subadministrator or his subordinates paid any attention to the commerce the big uglies were conducting right under their snouts then she wondered if the tosevites quietly paid some of those subordinateswith ginger sayto turn their eye turrets in a different direction she wouldnt have been surprised about that either big uglies were more voluble than males and females of the race they shouted and whined and gesticulated and generally acted as if the world would come to an end if bargains didnt come out exactly the way they wanted them their frantic eagerness would have impressed and probably influenced nesseref the tosevites against whom they were dickering though were used to such ploys and took no notice of themor else they too were shouting and whining and gesticulating someonea big ugly by the timbre and mushy accentcalled her name she swung an eye turret in the direction from which the sound had struck her hearing diaphragm and saw a tosevite approaching waving as heshe no he by the wrappings and the voicedrew near a little more slowly than she should have she recognized him i greet you mordechai anielewicz she said annoyed hed seen and known her first i greet you shuttlecraft pilot the big ugly said extending his right hand in the greeting gesture common among his kind nesseref took it his fingers though large felt soft and fleshy against hers they also felt cool her body temperature was a couple of hundredths higher than his speaking the language of the race pretty well for one of his kind he went on i hope you are well well enough i thank you though i do not much care for the cold and damp i am glad spring is coming nesseref replied she wagged the eye turret with which she was looking at him as she might have done to commiserate with one of her own kind i have heard from the regional subadministrator that you are having a difficult time of it why no the pains are no worse than anielewicz caught himself oh you must mean the male with the gun he missed me he has not returned since i do not worry about him too much his hand dropped to the butt of the pistol he wore on his hip who would wish to kill you nesseref asked the big uglys mouth twisted in the gesture nesseref had come to associate with amusement though she didnt understand why the circumstances should amuse him who he said the deutsche the poles the russkis perhaps and perhaps also the regional subadministrator bunim nesseref made the negative hand gesture impossible the race does not do such things besides he would have mentioned it to me he spoke of its happening through some agency other than his own he would not admit to it anielewicz said even if he arranged to have it done he would not admit it not to anyone who did not have to know of it why not again nesseref was puzzled again the tosevite smiled again the shuttlecraft pilot could not see any reason to show amusement as if speaking to a hatchling barely old enough to understand words mordechai anielewicz replied because if he arranged to have it done and if i found out he had arranged it i would probably try to kill him in retaliation and he knows it he spoke as far as nesseref could judge quite calmly she reckoned him her friend as far as she could across the lines of species but hed just shown her how alien he was her shiver had nothing to do with the chilly weather mordechai anielewicz could tell hed horrified nesseref he didnt really think bunim had tried to assassinate him had bunim done so he wasnt sure he would try to take revenge by killing the regional subadministrator murdering a prominent lizard was the best way he could think of to land the jews of poland in serious trouble of course if what he said got back to bunim it might keep the regional subadministrator from coming up with any bright ideas he hoped it would and how is your explosivemetal bomb nesseref asked him casually not for the first time he wished hed never mentioned the bomb to her and now instead of displaying his amusement he had to hide it the shuttlecraft pilot was trying to get information out of him the same way he was trying to give it to her he answered it is very well thank you and how is yours i have none as you know perfectly well nesseref said all i have to worry about is a great deal of liquid hydrogen back before the invasions of first the nazis and then the lizards forced him into war and politics anielewicz had studied engineering he whistled respectfully he knew a little something about the kinds of problems he might be facing and of course when he thought of hydrogen he thought of the hindenburg the newsreel footage was still vivid in his mind after more than a quarter of a century the lizards were a lot more careful than the germans ever dreamt of beingthe lizards were in a word inhumanly carefulbut still how do you make that noise nesseref asked i have heard other tosevites do it but i cannot see how what whistling mordechai asked the key word came out in yiddish if it existed in the lizards language he didnt know it he whistled a few bars nesseref made the affirmative hand gesture he said you shape your lips this way he started to pucker then stopped oh once examined the problem was simple nesseref couldnt pucker her face didnt work that way she didnt even really have lips only hard edges to her mouth she could no more whistle than anielewicz could perfectly produce all the hisses and pops and sneezing noises that went into her language she realized that at about the same time he did and let her mouth fall open in a laugh i see now she said it is impossible for one of my kind i fear that is truth anielewicz agreed i also fear i must shop now or my wifeanother yiddish word another concept missing from the language of the racewill be very unhappy with me he used an emphatic cough to show just how unhappy bertha would be farewell then nesseref told him i return to my new town perhaps you will visit me there one day i thank you i would like that mordechai meant it regardless of what they thought of the weather lots of lizards were colonizing poland he was very curious about how they lived but as nesseref went about her business anielewicz realized he had to go about his bertha would indeed be unhappy if he came home without the things shed sent him to buy cabbage was easy several vendors were selling it he had only to choose the one with the best price potatoes didnt prove any great problem either and he got a deal on onions that would make his wife smile eggs now hed expected eggs to be the hard part of the shopping and they were you could always count on plenty of people having vegetables for sale ever since the nazis had been driven out of poland there had been enough vegetables to go around and vegetables or a lot of them stayed good for weeks or months at a time none of that held true for eggs you never could tell how many would be on sale when you went to the market square or what sort of prices the vendors would demand today only a couple of peasant grandmothers scarves around their heads against the winter cold displayed baskets of eggs radiating charm anielewicz went up to one of them hello there he said cheerfully he spoke polish as readily as yiddish as did most jews hereabouts unlike a lot of them he also looked more polish than jewish having a broad face fair skin and light brown almost blond hair sometimes his looks helped him when he was dealing with poles not today the old lady with the eggs looked him up and down as if hed just crawled out of the gutter hello jew she said flatly well few goyim came to buy at the bialut market square during the nazi occupation it had been the chief market of the lodz ghetto the ghetto was gone but this remained the jewish part of town mordechai gathered himself if she was going to play tough he could do the same pointing to the eggs he said how much for half a dozen of those sad little things two zlotys apiece the polish woman said sounding as calm and selfassured as if that werent highway robbery what anielewicz yelped thats not selling thats stealing is what it is you dont want them you dont have to pay the woman answered ewa over there shes charging two and a half but she says hers are bigger eggs you go on over and see if you can find any difference its still stealing mordechai said and it waseven two zlotys was close to twice the going rate feeds gone up the polish woman said with a shrug if you think im going to sell at a loss youre meshuggeh where he stuck to polish she threw in a yiddish word with malice aforethought a moment later she slyly added and i know you jews arent crazy that way what are you feeding your miserable chickens anyhow caviar and champagne anielewicz shot back breads up a couple of groschen but not that much i think youre out for some quick profit her eyes might have been cut from gray ice i think if you dont want my eggs you can go away and let someone who does want them have a look dammit he did want the eggs he just didnt want to pay so much for them bertha would pitch a fit then shed make disparaging noises about the uselessness of sending a mere man to the market square mordechai was or thought he was a competent shopper in his own right ill give you nine zlotys for half a dozen he said for a bad moment he thought the egg seller wouldnt even deign to haggle with him but she did he ended up buying the eggs for ten zlotys forty groschen and won the privilege of picking them himself it wasnt a victoryhe couldnt pretend it was no matter how hard he triedbut it was something less than a crushing defeat weighed down by groceries he started south on zgierska street then turned right onto lutomierska his flat wasnt far from the fire station on that street the backs of his legs pained him as he walked his arms felt as if he were carrying sacks of lead not vegetables and eggs scowling he kept on hed never been quite right after inhaling german nerve gas half a lifetime before at that hed got off lucky ludmila jagerludmila gorbunova shed been thenwas far more crippled than he while the gas had helped bring heinrich jager to an early grave anielewicz found that dreadfully unfair were it not for the german panzer colonel an explosivemetal bomb would have blown lodz off the face of the earth and probably would have blown up the thenfragile truce between humans and lizards anielewiczs younger son was named heinrich there was a stretch of several years when he would either have laughed or reached for a rifle had anyone suggested he might name a child after a wehrmacht officer panting he fought his way up the stairs to his flat he paused in the hail to catch his breath gathering himself so bertha wouldnt worry before he went inside he also paused to examine the new door after the wouldbe assassin put a submachinegun magazine through the old one it had become too thoroughly ventilated to be worth much the flat also had new windows when he did go inside the look on his wifes face said he hadnt paused long enough it must be bothering you today bertha anielewicz said not too bad mordechai insisted if she believed it maybe he would too and i did pretty well at the market that won a smile from his wife she wasnt pretty in any conventional sense of the word but she turned beautiful when a smile lit up her face then of course she wanted details when he gave them to her the smile disappeared hed known it would thats robbery she exclaimed i know he said it would have been worse robbery if i hadnt haggled hard we did need the eggs we needed the money too bertha said mournfully then she shrugged well its done and the eggs do look good her smile returned he smiled back knowing full well she was letting him down easy vyacheslav molotov was not happy with the budget projections for the upcoming five year plan unfortunately the parts about which he was least happy had to do with the money allocated for the red army since marshal zhukov had rescued him from nkvd headquarters after lavrenti berias coup failed he couldnt wield a red pencil so vigorously as he would have liked he couldnt wield one at all in fact if he made zhukov unhappy with him a red armyled coup would surely succeed behind the expressionless mask of his face he was scowling after zhukov got all the funds he wanted the red army would in essence be running the soviet state with or without a coup were zhukov a little less deferential to party authority that would be obvious already the intercom buzzed molotov answered it with a sense of relief though he showed no more of that than of his inner scowl yes he asked comrade general secretary david nussboym is here for his appointment his secretary answered molotov glanced at the clock on the wall of his kremlin office it was precisely ten oclock few russians would have been so punctual but the nkvd man had been born and raised in poland send him in pyotr maksimovich molotov said dealing with nussboym would mean he didnt have to deal withor not deal withthe budget for a while putting things off didnt make them better molotov knew that but nothing he dared do to the five year plan budget would make it better either in came david nussboym a skinny nondescript middleaged jew good day comrade general secretary he said in polishflavored russian every word accented on the nexttolast syllable whether the stress belonged there or not good day david aronovich molotov answered take a seat help yourself to tea from the samovar if you care to no thank you along with western punctuality nussboym had a good deal of western briskness i regret to report comrade general secretary that our attempt against mordechai anielewicz did not succeed your attempt you mean molotov said david nussboym had got him out of his cell in the nkvd prison otherwise berias henchmen might have shot him before marshal zhukovs troops overpowered them molotov recognized the debt and had acquiesced in nussboyms pursuit of revenge against the polish jews whod sent him to the ussr but there were limits molotov made them plain you were warned not to place the soviet government in an embarrassing position even if you are permitted to use its resources i did not and i do not intend to nussboym said but with your generous permission i do intend to continue my efforts yes go ahead molotov said i would not mind seeing poland destabilized in a way that forces the lizards to pay attention to it it is a very useful buffer between us and the fascists farther west he wagged a finger at the jew a show of considerable emotion for him under no circumstances however is poland to be destabilized in a way that lets the nazis intervene there i understand that david nussboym assured him believe me it is not a fate id wish on my worst enemiesand some of those people are see that you dont inflict it on them molotov said wagging that finger again poland genuinely concerned him if things go wrong that is one of the places that can flash into nuclear war in the blink of an eye it canbut it had better not no debt of gratitude will excuse you there david aronovich nussboyms features were almost as impassive as molotovs the jew had probably learned in the gulag not to show what was on his mind hed spent several years there before being recruited to the nkvd after a single tight controlled nod he said i wont fail you having got the warning across molotov changed the subject and how do you find the nkvd these days morale is still very low comrade general secretary nussboym answered no one can guess whether he will be next everyone is fearful lest colleagues prepare denunciations against him everyone frankly shivers to think that his neighbor might report him to the gru this is what an agency earns for attempting treason against the workers and peasants of the soviet union molotov said harshly even so he was disquieted he did not want the gru the red armys intelligence arm riding roughshod over the nkvd he wanted the two spying services competing against each other so the party could use their rivalry to its own advantage that however was not what georgi zhukov wanted and zhukov at the moment held the whip hand thank you for letting me continue vyacheslav mikhailovich nussboym got to his feet i wont take up any more of your time he used another sharp nod then left molotovs office molotov almost wished hed stayed longer anything seemed preferable to returning to the five year plan but then the intercom buzzed again and molotovs secretary said comrade general secretary your next appointment is here the ambassador from the race along with his interpreter next to confronting an irritable lizardand queek was often irritablethe five year plan budget suddenly looked alluring bozhemoi molotov thought no rest for the weary still his secretary never heard the tiny sigh that fought its way past his lips very well pyotr maksimovich he answered i will meet them in the other office as usual the other office was identical to the one in which he did most of his work but reserved for meetings with the race after he left it he would change his clothes down to his underwear the lizards were very good at planting tiny electronic eavesdropping devices he did not want to spread those devices and let them listen to everything that went on inside the kremlin thus the meeting chamber that could be quarantined he went in and waited for his secretary to escort the lizard and his human stooge into the room queek skittered in and sat down without asking leave so did the interpreter a stolid broadfaced man after the ambassador spokea series of hisses and popsthe interpreter said his excellency conveys the usual polite greetings the fellow had a rhythmic polish accent much like david nussboyms tell him i greet him and hope he is well molotov replied and the pole popped and hissed to the male of the race in fact molotov hoped queek and all his kind except possibly the lizards in poland who shielded the soviet union from the greater german reich would fall over dead but hypocrisy had always been an essential part of diplomacy even among humans ask him the reason for which he has sought this meeting he thought he knew but the question was part of the game queek made another series a longer one of unpleasant noises the interpreter said he comes to issue a strong protest concerning russian assistance to the bandits and rebels in the part of the main continental mass known as china i deny giving any such assistance molotov said blandly hed been denying it for as long as the lizards occupied china first as stalins foreign commissar and then on his own behalf that didnt mean it wasnt trueonly that the race had never quite managed to prove it now queek pointed a clawed forefinger at him no more evasions he said through the interpreter who looked to enjoy twitting the head of the ussr no more lies too many weapons of your manufacture are being captured from those in rebellion against the rule of the race china is ours you have no business meddling there had molotov been given to display rather than concealment he would have laughed he would in fact have chortled what he said was do you take us for fools would we send soviet arms to china betraying ourselves if we aided the chinese people in their struggle against the imperialism of the race we would aid them with german or american weapons to keep from being blamed whoever gives them soviet weapons seeks to get us in trouble for things we havent done is that so queek said and molotov nodded his face as much a mask as ever but then to his surprise and dismay queek continued we are also capturing a good many american weapons do you admit then that you have provided these to the rebels in violation of agreements stating that the subregion known as china rightfully belongs to the race damnation molotov thought so the americans did succeed in getting a shipload of arms through to the peoples liberation army mao hadnt told him that before launching the uprising but then mao had given even stalin headaches the interpreter grinned offensively yes he enjoyed making molotov sweat imperialist lackey and running dog that he was but molotov was made of stern stuff i admit nothing he said stonily i have no reason to admit anything the soviet union has firmly adhered to the terms of all agreements into which it has entered and you cannot prove otherwise i hope for a bad moment he wondered if queek would pull out photographs showing caravans of weapons crossing the long porous border between the ussr and china the lizards satellite reconnaissance was far ahead of anything the independent human powers could do but the ambassador only made noises like a samovar with the flame under it turned up too high do not imagine that your effrontery will go unpunished queek said after we have put down the chinese rebels once and for all we will take a long hard look at your role in this affair that threat left molotov unmoved the japanese hadnt been able to put down chinese rebels either communists or nationalists and the lizards were having no easy time of it either they could hold the citiesexcept when rebellion burned hot as it did nowand the roads between them but lacked the soldiers to subdue the countryside which was vast and heavily populated guerrillas were able to move about at will almost under their snouts do not imagine that your colonialism will go unpunished molotov answered the logic of the historical dialectic proves your empire like all others based on the oppression of workers and peasants will end up lying on the ash heap of history marxist terminology did not translate well into the language of the race molotov had seen that before and enjoyed watching the interpreter have trouble he waited for queek to explode as lizards commonly did when he brought up the dialectic and its lessons but queek said only you think so do you yes molotov answered on the whole sincerely the triumph of progressive mankind is inevitable then queek startled him by saying comrade general secretary it is possible that what you tell me is truth the lizard startled his interpreter too the pole turned toward him with surprise on his face plainly wondering whether hed really heard what he thought he had with a gesture that looked impatient the lizard ambassador continued it is possiblein fact it is likelythat if it is truth you will regret its being truth careful molotov thought he is telling me something new and important here aloud he said please explain what you mean it shall be done queek said a phrase molotov understood before the interpreter translated it at present you tosevites are a nuisance and a menace to the race only here on tosev yet your technology is advancing rapidlywitness the americans lewis and clark if it should appear to us that you may become a risk to the race throughout the empire what is our logical course under those circumstances vyacheslav molotov started to lick his lips he stopped of course but his beginning the gesture told how shaken he was now he hoped he hadnt heard what he thought he had countering one question with another he asked what do you believe your logical course would be queek spelled it out one option under serious consideration is the complete destruction of all independent tosevite notempires you know this would result in the immediate destruction of your own colonies here on earth molotov said if you attack us we shall assuredly take vengeancenot only the peaceloving peasants and workers of the soviet union but also the united states and the reich you need have no doubts about the reich for once he was able to use the germans ferocity to his advantage or so he thought till queek replied i understand this yes but sometimes a mangled limb must be amputated to preserve the body of which it is only one part this bluff will not intimidate us molotov said but the lizards as he knew only too well were not nearly so likely to bluff as were their human opposite numbers again their ambassador echoed his unhappy thoughts saying if you think of this as a bluff you will be making a serious mistake it is a warning you and your tosevite counterpartswho are also receiving ithad better take it as such i shall be the one who decides how to take it molotov replied he concealed his fear for him that was easy making it go away was something else again up until now the only time since the japanese overran her village just before the little scaly devils came that liu han had lived in a liberated city was during her visit with her daughter to the united states now now in exultation she turned to liu mei and said peking remains free i never thought we would be able to drive out the scaly devils garrison liu meis eyes glowed though the rest of her long face remained almost expressionless the scaly devils had taken her from liu han just after she was born and for more than a year set about raising her as if she were one of theirs they had not smiledthey could not smileback at her when she began to smile as a baby without response her ability to smile had withered on the stalk that was one reason and not the least of reasons liu han hated the little scaly devils shanghai is still free too liu han went on so is kaifeng they are still free of the little devils yes but they arent in the hands of the peoples liberation army the way peking is liu mei said her revolutionary fervor burned hotter than her mothers we share them with kuomintang reactionaries the way we share harbin and mukden up in manchuria with projapanese reactionaries but peking is ours next to the little scaly devils the fighters from the kuomintang arent reactionaries theyre fellow travelers liu han answered next to the scaly devils even the jackals who want to turn manchuria back into manchukuo and make it a japanese puppet again are fellow travelers if we dont have a common front together against the little devils we are bound to lose this struggle the logic of the dialectic will destroy them in their turn liu mei said confidently liu han was confident that would happen too but not so confident about when had she replied just then liu mei wouldnt have been able to hear her killercraft piloted by scaly devils screamed low above their rooming house in the western part of pekings chinese city cannons roared bombs burst close by with harsh roarscrump crump window frames rattled the floor beneath liu hans feet quivered as if at an earthquake down on the ground machine guns rattled and barked as the menand a few womenof the peoples liberation army tried to bring down the scaly devils airplanes by the way the jet engines of the killercraft faded in the distance liu han knew the machine guns had failed again her mouth twisted in vexation we need more antiaircraft weapons she said we need better antiaircraft weapons too we only got a few guided antiaircraft rockets from the american and weve used most of those liu mei answered with the fighting the way it is how can they send us any more i would take them from anyone even the japanese liu han said we need them without them the little scaly devils can pound us and pound us from the sky and we cant hit back i wish we had more mortars too and more mines we could use against their tanks while youre at it why not wish for the moon she thoughtnot a chinese phrase but one shed picked up in los angeles before liu mei could answer a new cry pierced the shouts and screams that mingled with the gunfire outside the cry was raw and urgent and came from the throats of both men and women fire liu han rushed to the window of the room she shared with her daughter sure enough a column of black smoke rose from a building only a block or so away flames leapt up red and angry turning to liu mei she said wed better go downstairs thats a big fire and it will spread fast we dont want to get stuck in here liu mei didnt waste time answering she just hurried for the door liu han followed they went down the dark rickety stairs together other people in the rooming house some of them also prominent communists were scurrying to the ground floor too when liu han got down there she ran out into the hutung the cramped alleywayonto which the rooming house opened peking was a city of hutungs between its broad thoroughfares alleys ran every which way packed with shops and eateries and shacks and rooming houses and taverns and everything else under the sun hutungs were commonly packed with people too in a country as crowded as china liu han hadnt particularly noticed that till she went to the usabefore then shed taken it for granted now every so often she didnt this hutung at the moment was so packed people had a hard time running the windas usual from out of the northwest from the mongolian desertblew smoke through the alley in a choking cloud eyes streaming liu han reached out for liu meis hand by what was literally blind luck she seized it if she hadnt they would have been swept apart two different ships adrift on the hwang ho river as things were they drifted together no one will be able to get through to fight the fire liu mei had to scream to make herself heard in the din though her mothers ear was only a couple of feet from her mouth i know liu han said it will burn till it stops thats all peking had seen a lot of fires since the uprising against the little scaly devils began a lot of them had ended that way too fire trucks were all very well for blazes on the larger streets but hadnt a prayer of pushing their way into the hutungs and bucket brigades werent much good against the massive fires combat caused even a bucket brigade would have had a hard time breasting this tide of fleeing humanity more smoke billowed over liu han and liu mei they both coughed horribly like women dying of consumption behind them people shrieked in panic above the shrieks came the crackle of flames the fire is moving faster than we are liu mei said fear in her voice if not on her impassive face i know liu han answered grimly she had a knife in a hidden sheath strapped to her ankle she didnt go anywhere unarmed these days if she took it out and started slashing at the people ahead of her would it clear a path so she and liu mei could outrun the flames the only thing that kept her from doing it was the cold judgment that it wouldnt help and then without warning the pressure eased like melon seeds squeezed between the fingers she and liu mei popped out onto a wider street one with cobblestones rather than just dirt she hadnt even known it was close by for she couldnt see over the backs of the people ahead liu mei hadnt seen it either though she was a couple of inches taller than her motherbobby fiore her american father had been a big man by chinese standards now people could move faster liu han and liu mei fled the fire and gained on it gods and spirits be praised liu han gasped even though as a good marxistleninist she wasnt supposed to believe in gods or spirits i think well get away liu mei looked back over her shoulder she could do that now without so much fear of getting trampled after a misstep the rooming house must be burning she said in a stricken voice yes i think so liu han said we are alive we will stay alive and find another place to live the party will help us if we need help things are not important we didnt have many things to lose anyhow having grown up in a peasant village she needed few things to keep her going but tears streamed down liu meis expressionless sootstreaked and yes rather bignosed face the photographs we got in the united states she said in a broken voice the photographs of my father and his ancestors oh liu han said and put a consoling arm around her daughter ancestors mattered in china filial piety ran deep even among party members liu han had never imagined that liu mei would be able to learn anything about bobby fiore and his family even after leaving china for the united states but yeager the expert on scaly devils with whom shed talked had turned out to be a friend of fiores and had put her and liu mei in touch with his family everything the fiores had sent was indeed bound to be going up in flames liu han sighed you know what you know if peace comes backshe was too honest to say when peace comes back we can get in touch with the americans again liu mei nodded yes thats true she said thank you mother that does make it easier to bear i thought my family was being all uprooted i understand no one had tended the graves of liu hans ancestors for a long time she didnt even know if the village near hankow had any people left in it these days how many times had the redhot rake of war passed through it since the little scaly devils carried her off into captivity a roar in the air that might have come from a furious dragons throat warned her the little devils airplanes were returning for another attack run all over peking machine guns started shooting into the air even though their targets werent yet in sight before long those bullets would start falling back to earth some would hit people in the head and kill them too all that passed through liu hans mind in a couple of seconds then the scaly devils killercraft roared low overhead one of their pilots must have spied the swarm of people in the street because of the fire for he cut loose with his cannon when one of those shells struck home it tore two or three people into bloody gobbets of flesh that looked as if they belonged in a butchers shop then exploded and wounded another half a dozen in that tightpacked crowd the little scaly devil had a target he could hardly miss the attack itself lasted only a moment then the killercraft that had fired was gone almost as fast as the sound of its passage the horror lasted longer men and women close by liu han and liu mei were ripped to bits their blood splattered the two women along with its iron stink liu han smelled the more familiar reek of night soil as shells and their fragments ripped guts open the wounded those unlucky enough not to die at once shrieked and howled and wailed so did men and women all around them seeing what they had become liu han shouted dont scream dont run help the injured people must be strong together or the little scaly devils will surely defeat us more because hers was a calm clear voice than because what she said made sense people listened and obeyed she was bandaging a man with a shattered arm when the roar of jet engines and the pounding of machine guns again cut through every other sound though she ground her teeth she kept on working on the injured man peking was a vast city surely the killercraft would assail some distant part but they roared right overhead instead of ordinary bombs they released swarms of little spheres be careful of those liu han and liu mei cried together some of the spheres were tiny mines that were hard to see but could blow up a bicycle or a man unlucky enough to go over them others others started squawking in chinese surrender you cannot defeat the scaly devils give up while you still live someone stomped one of those to silence it it exploded a sharp flat bark the woman stared at the bloody stump that had replaced her foot then toppled screeching to the ground even if we hold peking i wonder if anyone will be left alive inside the walls liu han said glumly that is not a proper revolutionary sentiment liu mei said her mother nodded accepting the criticism but liu han twice her daughters age had seen far too much to be certain proper revolutionary sentiment told all the truth there was to tell as lieutenant colonel johannes drucker stopped his volkswagen at one of the three traffic lights greifswald boasted drizzle began to fall that was nothing out of the ordinary in the north german town only a few kilometers from the baltic greifswald knew fog and mist and drizzle and rain with great intimacy it knew snow and ice too but the season for them was pastdrucker hoped so anyhow he pulled the windshieldwiper knob as the rubber blades began traveling streakily across the glass in front of him he rolled up the driversside window to keep the rain out of the automobile his wife kathe did the same thing on the passengers side with the two of them in the front and with heinrich claudia and adolf squeezed into the back the inside of the hydrogenburning vws windows began to steam up drucker turned on the heater and vented the warm air up to the inside of the windshield he wasnt sure how much good it did or if it did any good at all the light turned green go father heinrich said impatiently even as drucker put the auto into first gear heinrich was sixteen now and learning to drive had he known half as much about the business as he thought he did he would have known twice as much as he really did as the volkswagen went through the intersectionno more slowly than anyone elsea great roar penetrated the drizzle and the windows peenemunde was only about thirty kilometers east of greifswald when a rocket went up everybody in town knew about it who would that be father adolf asked sounding as excited as any elevenyearold would have at the prospect of blasting into space its joachimsuh major spitzlersturn in the rotation drucker answered unless he came down with food poisoninga euphemism for getting drunk but adolf didnt need to know thatlast night hes heading for orbit right now when do you go up again claudia sounded wistful not excited she enjoyed having her father down on the ground drucker enjoyed it too but as he had to be he was intimately familiar with the duty roster as the roar from the a slowly faded he said im scheduled for next thursday claudia sighed so did kathe he glanced over at his wife it wont be so bad she sighed again he prudently kept driving she knew how much he loved going into space he knew better than to rhapsodize about it he even enjoyed weightlessness which put him in a distinct minority and coming back after being away gave him several honeymoons a year abstinence makes the heart grow fonder he thought cheerfully butchering shakespeareamerican spaceman had taught him the pun which didnt work in german when they got back to their neat twostory home on the outskirts of greifswald the children hurried to the door and went inside drucker didnt bother locking it unless everyone was going to be away longer than for an hours shopping greifswald had few thieves few people were rash enough to want to risk falling foul of the ministry of justice lets get the packages out of the boot kathe said you have to wait for meive got the key drucker reminded her he pulled it from the ignition switch and walked up to the front of the car as he walked his mouth twisted he or rather kathe had fallen foul of the ministry of justice theyd found out she had or might have had a jewish grandmotherwhich under the racialpurity laws of the reich made her a jew and liable to liquidation because drucker was a wehrmacht officer and one with important duties hed been able to pull strings the gestapo had set kathe free and given her a clean bill of racial health but pulling those strings had cost him hed never rise above his present rank not if he served his country till he was ninety from what the commandant at peenemunde said he was lucky he hadnt been thrown out of the service altogether he opened the boot kathe scooped up the bundlesclothes for the children who outgrew them or with the boys wrecked them faster than he thought they had any business doing he didnt really want to think about clothes though he slipped an arm around his wifes waist kathe smiled up at him he leaned over and planted a quick kiss on her mouth tonight he murmured what about it by the smile in her voice she knew just what he had in mind and liked the idea too before he could answer the telephone rang inside the house he let out a snort of laughter we dont have to worry about that itll be ilse calling heinrich or else one of claudias school friends nobody bothers with old folks like us but he was wrong claudia came hurrying to the door pigtails flying its for you fathera man did he say which man he was drucker asked claudia shook her head drucker scratched his that eliminated everyone military and most of his civilian friends toothough his daughter would have recognized their voices still scratching he said all right im coming he slammed down the volkswagens boot lid and went inside hed shed his overcoat by the time he got to the phone the furnace kept the house toasty warm picking up the handset he spoke briskly johannes drucker here hello hans you old son of a bitch said the voice on the other end of the line how the hell are you been a goddamn long time hasnt it who is this drucker demanded whoever he was he sounded not only coarse but more than a little drunk drucker couldnt place his voice but couldnt swear hed never heard it before either harsh raucous laughter dinned in his right ear thats how it is all right thestranger said people go up in the world they forget their old pals i didnt think it would happen with you but fuck me if im too surprised either who is this drucker repeated he was beginning to be sure this fellow was looking for some other hans drucker had given his last name but how often did drunks bother to listen he turned out to be wrong again the other fellow said how many lizard panzers did we blow to hell and gone in poland you driving and me at the gun no wonder the voice seemed as if he might have known it before grillparzer he said in slow wonder gunther grillparzer christ man its been close to twenty years too goddamn long agreed the gunner with whom drucker had shared a panther panzer through the most desperate fighting hed ever known well well make up for lost time you and me were going to be buddies again damned if were not just like the old days hansexcept maybe not quite his laugh was almost a giggle drunk all right drucker thought what do you mean he asked sharply when grillparzer didnt answer right away he found another more innocuous question what have you been doing since the fighting stopped kathe was giving him a curious look old army pal he mouthed and she nodded and went away what have i been doing grillparzer echoed oh this and that old son yeah thats about righta little of this a little of that a little of something else now and again too drucker sighed that meant the panzer gunner was a bum or a petty criminal these days too bad so what can i do for you he asked he owed grillparzer his neck he wouldnt begrudge him five hundred or even a thousand marks he could afford it and gunther was plainly down on his luck like i say youve come up in the world the gunner said me i wasnt so lucky his voice turned into a selfpitying whine how much do you need drucker asked patiently im not what youd call richnobody with three kids is likely to bebut ill do what i can for you hed expectedhed certainly hopedgrillparzer would babble in sodden gratitude that didnt happen either it wasnt his day for guessing right instead the exgunner said do you remember the night we went after those blackshirted pigdogs with our knives ice prickled up druckers back yes i remember that he said toward the end of the fighting the ss had arrested the regimental commander colonel heinrich jager in whose panzer drucker and grillparzer had both served the panzer crew had rescued him before he got taken away from the front and had bundled him into the airplane of a red air force senior lieutenanta pretty woman drucker recalledbound for poland no one but the panzer crew knew what had happened to those ss men drucker wanted to keep it that way dont talk about it on the phone you never know who might be listening youre righti dont grillparzer agreed with good humor that struck johannes drucker as put on i might lose my meal ticket if people start hearing things before i want em to cant have that can we hans he laughed out loud drucker was feeling anything but cheerful what do you want from me he asked hoping against hope it wasnt what he thought but it was whatever youve got and then another fifty pfennigs besides grillparzer answered youve lived high on the hog these past twenty years youre an officer and everything after all now itll be my turn after a look around the living room to make sure nobody in his family could hear drucker pressed his mouth against the phone and spoke in a low urgent voice my arse if you bring me down ill sure as hell take you with me if you dont think ill sing when they start working me over youre out of your goddamn mind but gunther grillparzer laughed again good luck he said youre the first fellow whos called me gunther in a devil of a long time name got too hot for me to keep wearing it the papers ive got with this one are damn good too all i have to do is write the gestapo a letter i dont even have to sign ityou know how those things go that drucker did only too well the reich ran on anonymous accusations and he was already in a bad odor with the gestapo and with his own higherups because of the accusations against kathe regardless of whether there was any truth in grillparzers letter drucker couldnt stand another investigation it would mean his neck and no mistakeand probably his wifes neck too after he couldnt protect her any more he licked his lips how much do you want he whispered now youre talking like a smart boy grillparzer said with another nasty chuckle i like smart boys five thousand for starters well see where it goes from there drucker let out a silent sigh of relief he could make the first payment maybe grillparzer aimed to bleed him to death a little at a time not all at once after that first payment hed worry about that later how do i get you the money he asked ill let you know the exgunner answered im going up next week drucker warned my wife doesnt know anything about this and i dont want her to dont mix her up in this grillparzer or youll get trouble from me not cash im not afraid of you hans old boy grillparzer said but that might not have been altogether true for he went on all right well play that your wayfor now youll hear from me he hung up kathe chose that moment to come into the living room and how is your old army buddy she asked indulgently fine drucker answered and the lie survived his wifes long and intimate acquaintance with him he nodded ever so slightly now he had a little stretch of time in which to plan how best to commit a murder ttomalss had been studying the big uglies ever since the conquest fleet came to tosev sometimes he thought he understood this worlds strange inhabitants as well as anyone not hatched among them could he certainly had that reputation among the race he was after all the only male whod ever successfully reared a tosevite hatchling from its earliest days to the approach of maturity he was so far as he knew the only male addled enough even to try such a mad venture but despite that success despite endless other research despite endless study of others research on the big uglies and even their research on themselves he sometimes thought he didnt understand them at all hed had a lot of those moments since coming to the greater german reich now he found himself facing another one a big ugly named rascher who called himself a physicianby tosevite standards maybe he was one but tosevite standards were low lowspoke in the tones of calm reason that so often characterized officials of the reich at their most outrageous of course these individuals deserve death senior researcher they are a weakness in the fabric of the aryan race and so must be plucked from it without mercy he used the language of the race as far as ttomalss was concerned that only made the horror underlying his words worse the researcher said i do not understand the logic behind your statement i ought to learn that phrase in the language of the deutsche ttomalss thought spirits of emperors past know i use it often enough is it not obvious dr rascher said does the race not also punish males who mate with other males ttomalss shrugged that was a gesture the race and tosevites shared i have heard of such matings happening among us he admitted during the mating season we are apt to become rather frantic but the occurrences are rare and accidental so what point to making a fuss let alone punishing the behavior it is not rare and accidental among us the big ugly said some misguided males deliberately pursue it they must be rooted out exterminated lest they pollute us with this unnatural behavior i do not understand ttomalss said again if they mate among themselves they cannot have hatchlings this in itself eliminates them from your gene pool where is the need to root out and exterminate mating among males is filthy and degenerate dr rascher declared it corrupts the young in the reich even if what you say is trueand i have seen no evidence to that effectdo you not believe the problem to be selfcorrecting ttomalss asked i repeat these males are unlikely to breed and so except for new mutationsassuming this trait to be genetically induced about which i have seen no evidence either for or againstwill in the course of centuries gradually tend to diminish you deutsch tosevites if you will forgive me for saying so have always struck the race as being impatient even for your species he had been around big uglies long enough to recognize dr raschers glower for what it was the deutsch physician snapped and the race has always struck us aryans as being insanely tolerant if you are daft enough to put up with degeneracy in your own kind for centuries or millennia on end that is your affair if we choose to take direct action in uprooting it that is ours plainly ttomalss wouldnt get anywhere with this line the race to its dismay had got nowhere in attempting to dissuade the deutsche from slaughtering the jews in their notempire for no other reason than that they were jews since they were as determined to slaughter males with different mating habits they would go on doing that too males that sparked a thought in ttomalss mind have you also females who mate with females if so what do you do with them exterminate them when we catch them of course dr rascher replied we are consistent did you expect anything different not really ttomalss said with a sigh unless he was mistaken raschers face bore an expression of smug selfsatisfaction the researcher hadnt been familiar with that expression in his work in china but had seen it on a great many deutsch officials they are ideologymad he thought too many big uglies are ideologymad they are as drunk on their ideologies as they are on their sexuality you should not have dr rascher said and added an emphatic cough it is most important for the aryan race to preserve its purity and to prevent its defilement by such elements as these i have heard you deutsche use this term aryan before ttomalss said sometimes you seem to use it to refer to yourselves and yourselves alone but sometimes you seem to use it in a different way please define it for me he knew how important precise definitions were the deutsche all too often preferred arguing in a circle to precision though they vehemently denied that was the case dr rascher said i will define it with great pleasure taking the definition from the words of our great leader adolf hitler aryans have been and are the race which is the bearer of tosevite cultural development it is no accident that the first cultures arose in places where the aryan in his encounters with lower races subjugated them and bent them to his will as a conqueror he regulated their practical activity according to his will and for his aims as long as he ruthlessly upheld the master attitude not only did he really remain master but also the preserver and increaser of culture which was based on his abilities when he gives up his purity of blood he loses his place in the wonderful world which he has made for himself this is why we so oppose the idea of mingling races you deutsche see yourselves as aryans then but not all aryans are necessarily deutscheis that correct ttomalss asked it is although we are the most perfect representatives of the aryan race anywhere on tosev rascher replied fascinating ttomalss said most fascinating indeed and what is your evidence for these assertions why i told you dr rascher said in his writings hitler sets forth the doctrine of the aryans in great detail yes you did tell me that ttomalss agreed but what was hitlers evidence did he have any what do tosevite historians say about these questions what does archaeology say about them why do you accept hitlers word and not the statements of those who disagree with him if there are any behind corrective lenses that magnified them dr raschers eyesthey were of a washedout gray a very ugly color to ttomalssgrew larger still a token of astonishment hitler was the leader of the reich the deutsch physician exclaimed but naturally his writings on any subject are authoritative why ttomalss asked in genuine puzzlement he must have known something about leading of course or he would not have led your not empire but how much did he understand about these other things how much could he have understood he spent most of his time leading or getting ready to lead did he not what chance did he have to study these other issues in any sort of detail he was the leader dr rascher replied he knew the truth because he was the leader he tacked on another emphatic cough ttomalss and he stared at each other in perfect mutual incomprehension after a long long pause ttomalss let out another sigh hed had a lot of these moments with big uglies trying to get past this one he said you claim this as revealed belief then not as scientific knowledge you hold it as a superstitious opinion like the ones expressed in what is the local one here ah christianity yes he was pleased hed remembered the name but rascher shook his head this is scientific truth christianity on the other fork of the tongue is a belief similar to your veneration of the spirits of emperors past he might know the idioms of the races language but he was an ignorant barbarous big ugly and did not cast down his eyes when mentioning the emperors and he mentioned them in insulting fashion too you have no business speaking of that which you are too foolish to comprehend ttomalss snapped dr rascher laughed a yipping tosevite laugh which further infuriated the researcher neither have you the big ugly retorted now ttomalss and he stared at each other in perfect mutual loathing whatever the veneration of the spirits of emperors past may bettomalss lowered his eye turrets toward the ground he was no ignorant barbarianwe do not shape the policy of the empire around it even as he spoke he realized that wasnt completely true after its first two planetary conquests the race had encouraged emperorveneration among the rabotevs and hallessi using it as one means of binding the subject peoples to the empire plans had been developed to do the same here on tosev so far however none of those plans had come to anything dr rascher said whether the race lives according to its principles is of no concern to me the reich i am proud to say does these principles seem to include slaughtering anyone your famous leader happened to dislike ttomalss was too nettled to stay anywhere close to diplomatic how fortunate for you that his dislikes did not include doctors hed succeeded in making the big ugly as angry as he was rascher sprang to his feet and pointed toward the door get out he shouted get out and never show your ugly snouted face outside your embassy again he punctuated that with another emphatic cough your kind deserves extermination far more than any tosevites ttomalss also rose with more than a little relief he found the big uglystyle chair in which hed been sitting imperfectly comfortable i never thought any intelligent race or subgroup deserved extermination he said you deutsche though tempt me to believe i may have been mistaken having got the last word he returned to the races embassy in something approaching triumph he was still studying his recorded notes trying to find anything resembling sense in the reich s policies when the telephone circuitry in his computer hissed for attention on activating the telephone he found himself looking into veffanis face the ambassador said i have received a complaint of you from the deutsche it could be superior sir ttomalss said i have a good many complaints against them too he summarized his conversation with dr rascher including the big uglys revolting comments about the veneration of the spirits of emperors past they are revolting veffani agreed but you have insulted them to such a degree that they insist you leave the reich immediately by the usages of diplomacy on tosev they are within their rights to make such a demand it shall be done ttomalss did his best to sound as if he were obeying an order he didnt care for inside though he felt like skittering for joy mad and carefree as a hatchling i want you to know one thing senior researcher veffani said what is that superior sir ttomalss asked as he knew he should it is very simple by the emperor how i envy you kassquit passed tessrek in a corridor of the orbiting starship where shed spent almost her entire life tessrek she knew loathed her for what she was and for what she had so nearly become but the male was a colleague of ttomalss and so kassquit bent into the best posture of respect she could and said i greet you superior sir i greet you tessrek replied and went on his way without so much as turning an eye turret back in her direction it was the minimum possible politeness but kassquit did not feel insulted on the contrary most of what shed had from tessrek over the years were insults hed given them to ttomalss too he was a thoroughly badtempered male after shed insulted him in return though hed become a lot more waryshed gone from target to possibly dangerous foe that will do kassquit murmured as she let herself into her own cubicle let him hate me so long as he fears me a little too once inside she went over to the computer terminal and sat down in front of it before she began to use it she took a set of artificial fingerclaws from a drawer below the keyboard and put them on she could not use voice commands as shed seen time and again the machine stubbornly refused to understand her a glance at her reflection in the computer screen told her why as if she hadnt known no way around it though ttomalss had raised her as a hatchling and then as a female of the race she was a big ugly the computer knewit couldnt follow the mushy way in which she pronounced the language of the race it was the only language she knew and she couldnt speak it properly that struck her as most unfair she shaved the hair on her head since her body matured shed shaved the hair under her arms and between her legs too having the stuff at all disgusted her getting rid of it didnt make her soft smooth hide much like the scaly skin a female of the race should have had even her color was wrong she was golden not a proper greenish brown her eyes were too small and too narrow and did not lie in moving turrets she had no proper snout she had no tailstump either and when she stood she stood far too erect shed tried leaning forward all the time like a proper member of the race but it made her back hurt shed had to give it up i am not a proper member of the race she said rubbing it in i am very ugly but i am civilized i would rather be what i amand what i almost amthan a wild big ugly down on tosev as she turned on the computer and colors filled the screen she let out a sigh of relief for one thing those colors made her own reflection harder to see which made it easier to imagine she really was a female of the race for another the computer gave her access to the races information and opinion network there she might as well have been a female of the race no one could tell otherwise not by the way she wrote her views were worth as much as anyone elsessometimes more than someone elses if she could argue better she wondered what males and females of the race would think if they knew the person who challenged their views was in fact an overtall overstraight softskinned smalleyed big ugly actually she didnt wonder she knew whatever respect shed earned for her brains would vanish dissolved in the scorn and suspicion the race felt toward tosevites she felt the same scorn and suspicion toward tosevites herself shed learned it from ttomalss whod raised her since hatchlinghood from every other maleand since the coming of the colonization fleet femaleof the race shed met in person and from every bit of video and writing the race had produced about tosev but having it aimed at her hurt almost too much to bear she checked for new comments and speculations about which independent tosevite notempire had attacked and destroyed more than ten ships from the colonization fleet not long after they took up their orbits around this world the race had delivered token punishments to each of the three suspectsthe sssr the usa and the reich because it could not prove which of them had done the murderous deed that didnt stop males and females from speculating endlessly but the speculations as far as kassquit could see had reached the point of diminishing returns and the less the speculators knew the more strident they were about advancing their illinformed claims with more than a little relief she escaped that area and went to one nearby one where the race discussed the american spacecraft known for no reason she could fathom as the lewis and flark no she corrected herself the lewis and clark changing the name made it no more meaningful to her here too discussion had died down the lewis and clark had been a mystery when the american big uglies were fitting out their former space station to travel through this solar system theyd done so in such ostentatious secrecy that theyd aroused everyones suspicion and alarm most males and females had feared they were turning it into some immense and immensely dangerous orbital fortress it had even aroused the big uglies suspicions somehow or other a tosevite going by the name of regeya had wormed his way onto the races network to learn what he could of what the race thought and had learned about the space station no one had recognized him for what he was till kassquit did i should be proud of that she thought i got him expelled from areas of the network where he had no right to go with a sigh kassquit made the negative hand gesture she was proud but then again she wasnt the tosevite who called himself regeya had had a more interesting way of looking at things and expressing himself than most of the males and females with whose opinions shed become all too familiar the network was a duller place without him on it it is a more secure place without him on it kassquit told herself that consoled the part of her which devoted itself to duty a very large part thanks to ttomalss training but it wasnt all of her the rest craved fun and amusement she sometimes wished it wouldnt but it did some of the curious part of her also wished regeya remained on the network before shed recognized him as a big ugly hed come close to doing the same in reverse she didnt know how her command of the races written language was perfect which his wasnt quite but he had hed asked to talk to her by telephone she couldnt do that not without giving away what she was fun she said aloud amusement she went to a new area on the network one that offered both of those the area devoted to discussion of the best ways to nurture hatchlings the conquest fleet had been allmale not till the colonization fleet arrived did that area become necessary how do you make hatchlings not bite when you feed them someonea harassed someonehad written since kassquit last checked there someone else evidently a voice of experience had given a threeword reply to that you do not the responder had also added the races conventional symbol for an emphatic cough the next message was a glyph of an open mouth the conventional symbol for laughter kassquits mouth fell open too she laughed like that when she remembered to sometimes though amusement made her yip the way a big ugly was biologically programmed to do a few messages further on someone named maargyees wrote this is my very first clutch of eggs i wish i had never laid them not being able to talk to the hatchlings is driving me out of my scales what do i do about that live with it answered the cynic whod replied to the earlier message we all do someone else added sooner or later they turn into civilized beings we did you know maargyees wasnt easily quelled sure seems like later to me she wrote how is it that you are so ignorant of hatchlings and their ways a male asked me maargyees answered i was hatched in a barn myself i do not know anything know i do not even suspect anything that sent several laughter signs up onto the computer screen kassquit added one of her own maargyees had a flippant irreverent way of looking at the world very different from the endless run of boring comments from most males and females kassquit hadnt seen anything like it for quite a while she hadnt seen anything like it as a matter of fact since she paused with her artificial fingerclaws poised above the keyboard since regeya she said aloud and she knew only too well who or rather what regeya had turned out to be could the obstreperous big ugly having been booted off the network once have found a new disguise under which to return kassquit decided to do a little checking no messages from anyone named maargyees appeared anywhere until some time after regeya had been removed that didnt prove anything but it was suggestive maargyees sounded more like a name a rabotev should carry than one belonging to a female of the race but that didnt prove anything eithersome members of the race hatched on rabotev had local names as she had for the falsely named regeya kassquit checked the records sure enough a maargyees had come with the colonization fleeta maargyees with a personal identification number different from the one this female was using well well kassquit murmured she knew she ought to report the wild big uglys return to the network but had trouble bringing herself to do it things had been dull since regeya vanished from the network and kassquit had a hard time seeing how asking questions about hatchlings constituted any sort of danger for the race she could always report the tosevite later for now she sent himhim not heran electronic message i greet you maargyees and how is the life of a senior tube technician these days that was the fictitious occupation the equally fictitious regeya had said he used if she didnt get an answer kassquit vowed she would report that the tosevite was roaming the network again but one came back before long i greet you kassquit and how is the life of a snoopy nuisance these days with the words he used the symbol suggesting he didnt intend to be taken seriously very well i thank you kassquit answered and have you truly laid eggs oh yes regeyaso she thought of himanswered a big square green one and a little purple one with orange spots kassquit stared at the words on the screen imagining a big ugly producing such a preposterous clutch she dissolved in tosevitestyle noisy giggles the picture was too deliciously absurd for anything else i like you she wrote i really do you must regeya wrote back why else would you get me in so much trouble kassquit cocked her head to one side how in the name of the emperor was she supposed to take that straha jumped when the telephone rang the exiled shiplord laughed at himself as he went to answer it hed been living in the united states more than forty years now more than twenty of tosev s slow turns about its star after all that time ringing telephones could still sometimes startle him by rights phones were supposed to hiss as they did back on home he reached for the handset with a small scornful hiss of his own tosevite telephones were good for little more than voice communication not nearly so sophisticated as the flexible instruments the race used this is what you getthis is part of what you getfor casting your lot with the local primitives he thought but hed been sure atvar would give him worse had he stayed defying the fleetlorddefying him but not overthrowing himhad a price so did exile hed paid again and again he would go on paying till the day he diedand maybe after that if the spirits of emperors past turned their backs on him for his betrayal he picked up the telephone i greet you he said in his own language by now he spoke and understood english quite well but his native hisses and pops went along way toward getting rid of annoying big uglies who wanted nothing more than to sell him something i greet you shiplord and hope you are well that was a big ugly speaking all right but one whose voice was familiar and welcome in strahas hearing diaphragm i greet you sam yeager straha answered yeager might inhabit a tosevite body but he was good at thinking like a male of the racebetter than any other big ugly straha knew and what would you like today what do you want from me was really what he meant as exiles had to do hed earned his keep by telling the rulers of his new home everything they wanted to know about his old one hed known he would have to do that when he fled the th emperor yower in a shuttlecraft hed been doing it ever since but all yeager asked was how does the race ever manage to civilize its hatchlings far as i can see predators are welcome to them straha laughed we do eventually improve you tosevites are liable to be less patient than we are as your hatchlings develop language faster than ours in every other way though ours are more advanced shiplord that is a big exception the tosevite used an emphatic cough i suppose so straha said indifferently as for myself i never had much interest in trying to civilize hatchlings i never had much interest in trying to civilize anyone maybe that is why i have not had too much difficulty living among you big uglies he used the races imperfectly polite name for the tosevites without selfconsciousness when they were speaking english yeager called him a lizard just as casually you came down in the right notempire shiplordthat is what it is yeager said suppose you had landed in the soviet union whatever sort of time you are having here it would be worse there so i am given to understand straha answered at the time it was a matter of luck i had a friend stationed in this notempire which gave me a plausible excuse for coming here so i instructed vesstil to bring me down not far from that other males ship had he been in the sssr i would have gone where he was by everything hed learned since he would indeed have regretted that the russkis seemed interested in nothing but squeezing males dry and then discarding them the americans had squeezed him dry but theyd rewarded him too as best they could he had this house in the section of los angeles called the valley he had a motorcar and a tosevite driver who was also bodyguard and spy at his disposal and he had the societysuch as it wasof other males of the race living in this relatively decent climate they werent exiles but former prisoners of war whod decided they liked living among the big uglies they could if they chose travel to areas of tosev where the race ruled straha couldnt not while atvar remained fleetlord and he had ginger the americans made sure he had all he wanted why not it was legal here the local big uglies wanted him happy and ginger made him that wayuntil he crashed down into depression even into despair as the effects of each taste wore off thinking about tasting made him want to do it it also made him miss a few words of what yeager was saying do not guess you are the right male to come to for advice about the little creatures then no i fear not straha said why are you suddenly interested in them anyhow as i said i am not so very interested in them myself i am always curious about the race and its ways the tosevite replied an answer that was not an answer you may find out more than that one of these days but the time is not right yet i hope you will excuse me now but i have other calls to make goodbye shiplord farewell sam yeager straha swiveled an eye turret in perplexity why was yeager asking questions about hatchlings the only time straha had thought about them since coming to tosev was after hed mated with a female whod tasted ginger at a former prisoners home hed wondered if his genes would go on in the society the race was building here on tosev even though he couldnt well if yeager had got an itch under his scales that was his problem not strahas big uglies had more curiosity than they knew what to do with what straha had was a yen for ginger the house in which he lived was built to tosevite scale which meant it was large for a male of the race he kept his supply of the powdered herb at the back of a high cupboard shelf if he didnt want a taste badly enough to go to the trouble of climbing up onto a chair and then onto a counter to get the jar then he would do without he was perfectly willing to go clambering today a breathy sigh of anticipation escaped him as he got down and set the jar on the counter he took a small measuring spoon out of a kitchen drawer then undid the lid to the jar he sighed again when the gingers marvelously spicy aroma floated up to his scent receptors one hand trembled a little as he took a spoonful of the herb from the jar and poured it into the palm of his other hand of itself his head bent his tongue shot out and lapped up the ginger even the flavor was wonderful though it was the least part of why he tasted almost before he knew it the herb was gone and almost before he knew it the ginger went straight to his head like that of mating its pleasure never faded he felt twice as tall as a big ugly full of more data than the races computer network able to outpull a landcruiser all that or almost all of ithe really did think or thought he thought faster with the herb than without it was a gingerinduced illusion that made it no less enjoyable experience had taught him not to try to do too much while he was tasting he really wasnt infinitely wise and infinitely strong no matter what the herb told him during the fighting a lot of males had got themselves and their comrades killed for ginger made them think they could do more than they really could straha simply stood where he was eyeing the ginger jar before long the herb would leave his system then he would feel as weak and puny and miserable as he felt wonderful now and then without a doubt he would have another taste he was still feeling happy when the telephone rang again he picked it up and speaking as grandly as if he were still the third most senior male in the conquest fleet rather than a disgraced exile he said i greet you and i greet you shiplord this time the telephone wire brought straha the crisp tones of a male of the race hello ristin he said grandly still what can i do for you ristin had been one of the first infantrymales captured by the americans these days he might almost have been a big ugly himself so completely had he taken on tosevite ways he said no shiplord it is what i can do for you ah and what is that straha asked he did not altogether like or particularly trust ristin while he himself lived among the big uglies he had not abandoned the ways of the race he still kept his body paint perfect for instance and often startled males and females who saw him without realizing for a moment which shiplord he was ristin by contrast wore and wore proudly the red white and blue prisonerofwar body paint the big uglies had given him in hot springs arkansas his housemate ullhass was the same way straha found them in large measure unfathomable but then ristin said shiplord i can get you several prime ssefenji cutlets are you interested i am i cannot deny it and i thank you straha said i had heard that the colonization fleet was beginning to bring down domestic animals but i did not know the meat was available yet ssefenji he let out a soft exclamation redolent of longing i have not tasted ssefenji since before we left home neither had i ristin answered it is as goodwell very nearly as goodas i remembered too i have some in the freezer i will bring it to you today or perhaps tomorrow may you eat it with enjoyment and may you eat it with greek olivesthey go with it very well i shall do that i have some in the house straha said i thought you would ristin said straha made the affirmative hand gesture though the other male couldnt see that not over a primitive screenless tosevite telephone malesand femalesof the race found a lot of the food big uglies ate on the bland side ham salted nuts and greek olives were welcome exceptions straha said so there are herds of ssefenji roaming tosev now eh and azwaca and zisuili too i should not wonder i believe so shiplord though i have not been able to get any of their flesh yet ristin answered perhaps i can manage that straha said his connections within the american army and the american government ought to be able to arrange it if i can do it of course i shall make you a return gift you are gracious shiplord ristin said for all the world as if straha were still his superior ssefenji straha said dreamily the ginger was wearing off now but he didnt feel so depressed as he would have otherwise azwaca zisuili good eating the herb still sped his wits to some degree for he went on and not only good eating but also a sign that we are beginning to make this planet more homelike high time we had our own beasts here truth and my tongue quivers at the thought of fried azwaca ristin sounded dreamy too in musing tones straha said i wonder how our animals and the local ecology will interact with each other that is always the question in introducing new lifeforms to a world the results of the competition should be interesting our beasts and plants prevailed on rabotev and halless ristin said no doubt it will be the same here you are likely to be right perhaps it was the onset of aftertasting depression that made straha add but this is tosev you never can tell jonathan yeagers alarm clock woke him at twenty minutes before six he sat up in bed and rubbed his eyes he hated getting up so early but he had an eight oclock class in the language of the race at ucla and chores to do before then with a grunt he got out of bed turned on the ceiling light and put on a pair of tightfitting blue jeans and an even tighterfitting fleshcolored tshirt adorned with a fleetlords body paint hed showered just before he went to bed so he ran a hand over his scalp and his chin his face needed shaving his scalp didnt that saved him a little time in the bathroom he went out to the kitchen as quietly as he could his parentslucky them were still asleep he poured himself a big glass of milk and cut a slab off the coffee cake in the refrigerator inhaling breakfast was a matter of moments he ate like a shark and never gained any weight over the years the things his father said about that had grown increasingly rude that thought made jonathan laugh his old man was an old man all right even if he did know a hell of a lot about the lizards jonathan washed his glass his plate and the silverware hed used and set everything in the dish drainer by the sink the hard time his mom would have given him if hed left the stuff for her made that more trouble than it was worth then he muttered to himself he was going to have to get another knife dirty he got a cooked ham out of the refrigerator cut off a couple of thick slices and cut them into inchwide strips he put those strips on a paper towel took a pair of leather gloves from a drawer and put them on and went down the hall to the room in which the baby lizards lived before he opened the door to that room he shut the door at the end of the hall every so often the lizards didnt feel like eatinginstead they would run past him and try to get away they were much easier to catch in the hall than when they got into places where they could skitter under or behind furniture jonathan sighed mom and dad never had to do this when i was little he muttered as he opened the door to the lizards room and flipped on the light now closing the door behind him he spoke aloud come on mickey wake up donald rise and shine both baby lizards were holed up in a corner behind a chair that had been ragged before they hatched and that their sharp little claws had torn up further they often slept back there it wasnt quite a hole in the ground or a cave but it came pretty close they came out at the light and the sound of jonathans voice donald was a bit bigger and a bit more rambunctious than mickey he if he was a he the yeagers didnt know for sure was also a little darker he and his brothersister both made excited hissing and popping noises when they saw the ham strips jonathan was carrying he squatted down the lizards were a good deal bigger than they had been when they hatched but their heads didnt come anywhere close to his knee he held out a piece of ham donald ran up grabbed it out of his hand and started gulping it down mickey got the next one donald the one after that jonathan talked to them while he fed them they were pretty much used to him and to his mother and father by now and associated humans with the gravy train feeding them these days was a lot like feeding a dog or a cat jonathan wore the gloves more because the lizards got excited when they ate than because they were trying to nip him after awhile donald finished a piece in nothing flat and tried to get the next one even though it was mickeys turn no jonathan said in english and wouldnt let him have it jonathan wanted to use the language of the racethe noises the baby lizards made clearly showed where its sounds came frombut his father would have pitched a fit the idea here was to make the lizards as nearly human as possible not that theyd be speaking any language themselves for quite a while seeing mickey get the strip of ham hed wanted donald went over and bit his sibling on the tailstump they started fighting like a couple of puppies or kittens that was another reason jonathan wore leather gloves to break up squabbles without getting hurt in the process no no he said over and over as he separated them like puppies or kittens or small children they didnt hold grudges they wouldnt start up again after he left the room sooner or later with luck theyd learn that no no meant they were supposed to stop what they were doing then he wouldnt need the gloves any more that wasnt close to happening yet though when the ham was gone mickey and donald kept on looking expectantly at him he wondered what was going on inside those long narrow skulls the hatchlings had no words so it couldnt be anything too complex but was he only room service for them or did they like him too the way a puppy liked its master he couldnt tell and wished he could before he left he used a strainer to sift through the cat box in another corner of the lizards room theyd figured that out even faster than a cat would have and rarely made messes on the floor even when they did the messes werent too messy their droppings were firm and dry chores done he shut the door on the lizards went back to his own room grabbed his books and hopped in the jalopy he drove to school a gasolineburning ford an aquaandwhite twotone job that seemed almost as tall as he was it got lousy mileage and drank oil but it ran most of the time as he started it up the tinny car radio blared out the electrified country music that was all the rage these days the westside freeway was new and cut travel time from gardena to ucla almost in half now that he was a sophomore hed gained an oncampus parking permit that saved him a good part of the hike hed had to make from westwood every day during his freshman year a lot of students had early classes some of them carried coffee in waxedcardboard cups jonathan had never got that habit which amused his father to no end he often got the idea his dad thought he had life pretty soft but he didnt have to listen to the when i was your age lecture too often so he supposed things could have been worse a few students wore jackets and slacks the rest were about evenly divided between guys who kept their hair and wore ordinary shirts and their female counterparts in clothes their mothers might have worn on the one hand on the one fork of the tongue jonathan thought using the lizard idiom and those like him on the other fellows and coeds who made the race their fashion wearing body paint or with the weather cool bodypaint t shirts a lot of the fellows in that crowd shaved their heads but only a few of the girls no girls went barechested on campus eitherthere was a rule against itthough a good many did at the beach or even on the street jonathan didnt mind the lack too much he had plenty to watch anyhow he trudged up the broad expanse of janss steps to royce hall a big romanesque redbrick building with a colonnade in front in which he had his class in the language of the race he wasnt surprised to see karen sitting under the colonnade her pert nose in the textbook hi he said in english and then switched to the races tongue i greet you and i greet you she answered in the same language before she looked up when she saw the shirt hed chosen she smiled and added exalted fleetlord oh yes i am an important male he said with an emphatic cough that told just how important he imagined he was karens expression said he wasnt so important as all that tacitly admitting as much he went on are you ready for todays quiz i hope so she said which made him chuckle he spoke the language of the race pretty fluentlygiven what his parents did he had no excuse not tobut she understood the way the grammar worked better than he did she also studied harder which she had ever since high school closing her book she got to her feet shall we go see how it is sure jonathan said in english and tacked on another emphatic cough a lot of his conversations with his friends mixed his own language and the lizards that kept most of the older generationthough not worse luck his own mother and fatherfrom knowing what they were talking about he took karens hand she squeezed his hard they hadnt just been studying together since high school theyd been dating since then too giving him a sidelong glance she asked have you heard anything from liu mei since she went back to china no jonathan answered which made karen squeeze his hand againin relief probably hed been taken with the daughter of the communist envoy whod come to the usa for weapons theyd been able to talk with each other too because liu mei knew the language of the race but she was gone and karen was still around he did add with all the fighting over there i hope shes okay karen considered that with some reluctance decided it was unexceptionable and nodded she went on and how are your little friends theyre fine he said he didnt want to say too much more than that not in a crowded hallway where anybody might be listening an officers son he understood the need for security even if he wasnt always perfect enough about it to delight his father theyre getting bigger he could tell her that safely enough if you want you can feed them next time youre over okay karen giggled thats the funniest way to get a girl to come over to your house i ever heard of and you know whats funnier itll work good jonathan said as they went upstairs together he stopped in front of a door with painted on a rippledglass window in blocky oldfashioned numbers the oval brass doorknob polished by countless students palms was oldfashioned too royce hall dated from the s before the lizards came jonathan thought a whole different world he tried to imagine what it would have been like then with people smugly convinced they were alone in the universe he couldnt do it even though his folks talked about those times as if theyd happened day before yesterday it must have been boring was the first thing that always sprang to mind no televisors no computers no satellite networks to bring the whole world into your living room from what his father said theyd barely even had radio he shook his head i couldnt have lived like that the chimes in the powell library bell tower across the square from royce hall announced eight oclock as soon as the last note died the instructor rapped a pointer down on the lectern i greet you class he said i greet you superior sir jonathan chorused along with everyone else by his body paint the instructor a male named kechexx had once served in the artillery now like a lot of captured lizards whod chosen not to rejoin their own kind he made his living by teaching humans about the race his eye turrets swiveled this way and that taking in the whole class it was to be a quiz today did you think i would forget his mouth fell open in a laugh did you perhaps hope i would forget i have not forgotten take out a leaf of paper it shall be done jonathan said with his classmates he hoped he wouldnt forget too much the train rattled east over the dry south african plain rance auerbach and penny summers sat side by side staring out the window like a couple of tourists they were a couple of tourists this was the first time theyd been out of cape town since the lizards sent them into exile there looks like new mexico or maybe arizona rance said same kind of high country same kinds of scrubby plants i went through there a couple of times before the fighting started he shifted in his seat trying to find the least uncomfortable position for his bad leg and shoulder new mexico arizona penny looked at him as if hed gone out of his mind i never heard of antelopes out there by god bouncing along like theyve got springs in their legs or those big white plumy birds standing in the fields egrets auerbach supplied those are the ones penny agreed and we saw a lion half an hour ago you ever hear of a goddamn lion in arizona sure he said just to watch her eyes get big in a zoo he wheezed laughter penny looked as if she wanted to hit him with something he went on the country looks that way i didnt say anything about the animals he might as well not have spoken even the cows look funny penny said having grown up in western kansas she spoke of cows with authority their horns are too big and they look like those whatdoyoucallemsbrahmas thats what i want to say they look like longhorns to me auerbach said that wasnt quite right but it was as close as he could come he knew horses better than cattle with a chuckle he added they used to have longhorns in new mexico maybe they still do for all i know hot damn penny said unimpressed she held out a peremptory hand give me a cigarette here he took the pack out of his shirt pocket and handed it to her after she lit one he found himself wanting one too he stuck one in his mouth and leaned toward her so she could give him a light he sucked in smoke coughed a couple of timeswhich hurtand said just like in the movies how come all the little stuff is like it is in the movies and all the big stuff really stinks penny asked thats what i want to know damn good question rance said now all we need is a damn good answer for it he stared out the window at what looked like a big hawk on stilts walking across the landscape the train swept past before he got as good a glimpse of it as he would have liked he and penny werent the only ones smoking in the railway car far from it smoke from cigarettes and cigars and a couple of pipes turned the air bluer than pennys language everybody smoked whites blacks east indians everybody a couple of rows ahead a black kid who couldnt have been more than eight was puffing on a handrolled cigarette about twice the size of the storebought one rance was smoking his sigh turned into another cough everybody rode together too it hadnt been like that back in the united states despite everything hed already seen in south africa he hadnt expected it to be like that here either but the only ones who got special privileges on trains in this part of the world were the lizards and they didnt ride trains very often the car might have been the tower of babel african languages dominatedsome with weird clicking noises that seemed more as if they belonged in the lizards speech than in anything human others without but auerbach also heard the clipped sounds of the britishstyle english some whites spoke here the harsher gutturals of afrikaans and the purring noises the little brown men and women from india used every so often the train would stop at a tiny sunbaked town not much different from the tiny sunbaked towns of the american southwest and then at last the conductor shouted beaufort west all out for beaufort west he repeated himself in several different languages in spite of all the repetition rance and penny were the only ones who got off at beaufort west it wasnt a tiny town it had advanced to the more exalted status of small town and lay on the northern edge of the great karoo auerbach shrugged he didnt know exactly what a karoo was but the country still put him in mind of west texas or new mexico or arizona drier than kansas penny said shading her eyes with her hand hotter tooeven if its not as hot as it was on the train looks like the middle of nowhere no two ways about that well thats what we came for isnt it auerbach answered we can rent a car or get somebody to drive us around and look at lions or whatever the hell else lives around here he wondered if hed see one of those tall funny hawks close up okay penny shrugged and picked up their suitcases she carried things better than rance did now all we have to do is find the donkin house it was only a block away logically on donkin street which looked to be beaufort wests main drag such as that was it was hardly out of the motel class which didnt surprise auerbach he registered himself and penny as mr and mrs south africans were even more persnickety about that than americans beef stew at a little cafe across the street from the donkin house wasnt anything like what rances mother had made but wasnt bad a bottle of lion lager improved his outlook on the world well take it easy tonight he said and then tomorrow morning well go out and see what there is to see miles and miles of miles and miles penny predicted miles and miles of miles and miles with lions and antelopes and maybe zebras too auerbach poked her in the ribs hey youre not in kansas any more i know penny grimaced im not wearing ruby slippers either in case you didnt notice as things turned out nobody in beaufort west had a car to rent the locals even the ones who spoke english looked at rance as if he were mad for suggesting such a thing the only taxi in town was an elderly volkswagen whose engine coughed worse and louder than auerbach the driver was a middleaged black man named joseph moroka you speak english funny he remarked as he drove rance and penny out of town onto the karoo auerbach thought the cabby was the one with the funny accent but penny said were from the united states oh up there in the front seat moroka nodded yes that is what it is you talk like films i have seen at the cinema he got friendlier after realizing they werent native south african whites that no doubt said something about the way things had been here before the lizards came he found his passengers lions they were sleeping in the shade of a tree he found plenty of gemsbok and kuduhe almost ran over a gemsbok that bounded across the road he found a fox with ears much too big for its head and auerbach discovered that his hawk on stilts was called a secretary bird it had a couple of plumes sticking up from its head that looked like pens put behind a mans ear it is a good bird moroka said seriously it eats snakes here and there cattle roamed the countryside now and then pausing to graze need a lot of land to support a herd here auerbach said that was true in the american southwest too joseph moroka nodded again shall we head back toward town penny said rance gave her a dirty look if you just want to sit around in the room we could have done that back in cape town he said well we can go out again tomorrow if theres anything different to see than what we just looked at she answered had they been by themselves she likely would have told him where to head in but like most people she was less eager to quarrel where outsiders could listen and compromise didnt look like the worst idea in the world to rance either all rightwhy not were going to be here a week no point to doing everything all at once i guess he tapped the driver on the shoulder you can take us back to the hotel joe for the first time the black man got huffy you please to call me mr moroka most white men here they never bother learning blacks have names until the lizards come now they have to learn and learn right he spoke with quiet pride it had been like that in the american south too boy would do the job or uncle for an old negro things were changing there things had been forcibly changed here auerbach rolled with the punch okay mr moroka his greatgrandfather a confederate cavalryman wouldnt have approved but greatgranddad had been dead a long time moroka looked back and grinned good i thank you if auerbach showed manners hed show them too rance supposed he could live with that the cabby turned the vw aroundthere wasnt any other traffic on this stretch of narrow poorly paved roadand started jouncing back toward beaufort west he topped a low rise and had just begun the long downgrade on the other side when rance and penny both cried out at the same time wait hold up stop the damn car auerbach added the last word that needed to be said what the hell are those things dinosaurs penny said in astonishment and then but dinosaurs are supposed to all be dead extinct she nodded in satisfaction at finding the right word they are dinosaurs rance said his eyes bugging out of his head a whole herd of dinosaurs what the hell else can they be they were bigger than cows though not a whole lot their scaly hides were a sandy yellowbrown lighter than those of the lizards they went on all fours and had big broad heads with wide beaky mouths as rance took a longer look at them though he noticed that their eyes were mounted in big upstanding chameleonlike turrets that gave him his first clue about what they had to be joseph moroka breaking into peals of laughter gave him his second the lizards call them zisuili he said pronouncing the alien name with care they use them for meat and blood and hide like we use cattle these things give no milk but i hear they lay eggs like hens they are new here he laughed again the lions have not yet decided if they are good to eat they dont graze like cattle again penny spoke with expert assurance they graze more like sheep or goats look at that rancethey dont hardly leave anything behind em they crop everything right on down to the ground youre right auerbach said he could see from which direction the herd of zisuili was coming by the bare trampled dirt behind them wonder how the antelopes are going to like thatand the real cows too moroka wasnt worrying about it he was still laughing but the lizards they do not use their cows to buy wives oh no they have no wives to buy i should be like a lizard eh he found that funny as hell auerbach hadnt thought about the lizards having their own domestic animals back on their home planet he supposed it made sense that they would they didnt have trouble with much earthly food so he tapped joseph moroka one more time anybody tried eating these things yet we are not supposed to the cabby replied auerbach coughed impatiently that wasnt an answer and he knew it after a moment moroka went on i heari only hear now i do not knowi hear they taste like chicken atvar studied a map of the subregion of the main continental mass called china we make progress he said in some satisfaction truth exalted fleetlord replied kirel the shiplord of the th emperor hetto the bannership of the conquest fleet we have taken harbin back from the rebellious tosevites and this other city this peking cannot hold out against us much longer i should hope not at any rate atvar said the chinese have no landcruisers and no aircraft to speak of without them they can still be most troublesome but they cannot hope to defeat us in the long run truth kirel said again he was solid and conservative and sensible atvar trusted him as far as he trusted any male on tosev back during the fighting kirel had had his chances to overthrow the fleetlord especially during strahas uprising after the tosevites detonated their first explosivemetal bomb he hadnt used them if that didnt establish his reliability nothing would thinking of explosivemetal bombs in that context made the fleetlord think of them in this one as well these big uglies the emperor be praised cannot lure a great part of our forces forward and then destroy them with a single blast kirel cast down his eyes emperor be praised indeed he said you speak truth again exalted fleetlord they are too primitive to create explosivemetal bombs some other tosevite notempire would have to provide them with such weapons before they could use them atvar swung both eye turrets toward the second most senior male from the conquest fleet now that is a genuinely appalling thought the chinese must understand that if they did such a thing we would bomb them without mercy in retaliation unlike the independent notempires they could not hope to respond in kind even so kirel gestured in agreement we could destroy half their population without doing the planet as a whole severe damage but the fleetlord remained worried i wonder how much they would mind along with india which presents its own problems china is the subregion that reminds me most urgently of how many big uglies there are and how few of us the chinese tosevites are liable to be willing to accept the loss of half their number in the hope that doing so would damage us more in the long run exalted fleetlord when have you ever known big uglies to think of the long run kirel asked well that is also a truth and a good thing for us that it is too atvar said even so you have given me something new to worry about after so long here i thought i had exhausted the possibilities i am sorry exalted fleetlord kirel bent into the posture of respect do you think warning the independent notempires against pursuing such a course would be worthwhile after brief consideration atvar made the negative hand gesture i fear it would be likelier to give them ideas that have not yet occurred to them although i admit that ideas of a troublesome sort very readily occur to big uglies so they do kirel used an emphatic cough still though in spite of the difficulties the tosevites pose we do make progress all over this world some not enough atvar said kirel had put him in a fretful mood i would give a great deali would give almost anything i can think ofto know for instance which of the notempires did in fact attack the colonization fleet that by the emperor would be a vengeance worth taking indeed it would kirel sighed but knowing the enormity of the crime they were committing those big uglies took pains to conceal their footprints one day we shall know one day they will pay atvar said and that will be progress too a step we can measure indeed it will kirel agreed i was i confess thinking of smaller steps for instance it is good to taste the flesh of our own domestic animals again after so long living on solely tosevite rations i will not say you are wrong for i think you are right the thought of grilled azwaca cutlets makes my mouth water atvar had always been especially fond of azwaca he walked over to the window of his suite and looked west across the great river toward the pyramidal funerary monuments that passed for ancient on tosev in the green strips between the monuments and the river azwaca were grazing though without magnification he could not see them i am more partial to zisuili myself but the taste of every one of the beasts is a reminder of home kirel said truth but do you know what atvar asked he waited for kirel to make the negative hand gesture then continued i have already begun receiving complaints from tosevite agriculturalists and pastoralists to the effect that our domestic animals graze so thoroughly no fodder is left for any of theirs i had not heard of such complaints but they do not surprise me kirel said tosevite grazers have evolved in an environment of relative abundance because moisture is more widespread here than back on home so is vegetation tosevite animals can afford to leave some behind and still flourish our own beasts by the nature of the terrain to which they are adapted have to be more efficient over the course of time it will be interesting to see what they do to the ecosystems in which they find themselves atvar said they may well make large stretches of this world resemble home more closely than is now the case do we have analysts examining the issue kirel asked i do not atvar answered reffet should this is after all more properly an issue involving the colonization of this planet than its conquest but what reffet should be doing and what he is doing are too often not one and the same he scribbled a note to himself i shall send an inquiry he will resent it kirel said he resents everything i do and everything i do not do the fleetlord said scornfully let him resent this too but if tosevite ecosystems become more homelike that will aid in assimilating this world into the empire will it not i can justify the query on those grounds no doubt you can exalted fleetlord fleetlord reffet will still resent it kirel had long since made plain that his opinion of the head of the colonization fleet was not high that had not failed to endear him to the head of the conquest fleet he added since you are rationalizing it as a conquest issue perhaps our experts should also examine it perhaps they should atvar sighed we are stretched very thin we have been stretched very thinthinner than anyone ever imagined we would besince we came to tosev and discovered the inadequacies of the data our probe sent us well perhaps we can stretch a little thinner yet we have said that a good many times and we have always succeeded in stretching up till now kirel said we should be able to stretch once more so we should atvar said i keep worrying that we will eventually snap and break but it has not happened yet why it has not happened yet i cannot imagine given what this world is but it has not before kirel could answer atvars telephone hissed for attention when he activated the screen link his adjutant stared out at him what is it pshing he asked suspiciously pshing being one of his principal links to tosev was also one of his principal sources of bad news exalted fleetlord the adjutant began and then broke off atvars heart sank this was going to be one of those times like an itch the certainty burrowed under his scales you had better tell me he said heavily it shall be done exalted fleetlord pshing said yes he was gathering himself yes that meant he needed to gather himself after a deep pause he went on exalted fleetlord there has been an attack on the desalination plants supplying fresh water to the new towns in this region a map appeared on the screen beside his face it showed the eastern coast of the peninsula the big uglies called arabia that depended from the main continental mass tell me more atvar said how serious is this attack is it the work of the local tosevites springing from their superstitious fanaticism or are the independent notempires using them as a cloak for their own larger designs against us those two need not be inseparable kirel pointed out atvar made the hand gesture of agreement but then waved the shiplord to silence he wanted to hear what pshing had to say one of the plants is destroyed another badly damaged the adjutant reported red dots appeared on the map to show the affected desalination plants the others remained amber our defense forces have slain a large number of tosevites all of whom appear to be native to the vicinity whether they were inspired or aided by other groups of big uglies as yet remains to be determined they were surely aided in one way or another atvar said they do not produce the weapons they use against us truth kirel said but whether the deutsche or the americans or the russkis furnished weapons for this particular attack is another matter indeed it is atvars voice was grim adjutant were there for example rockets fired at these installations there do appear to have been some yes exalted fleetlord pshing replied but only those of the common and primitive type manufactured in the sssr and known as katyushas he had as much trouble with the tosevite word as big uglies did with the language of the race those things kirel spoke in disgust they are as common as sand and are easy to carry on the backs of beasts even if they were supplied especially for this assault the independent notempires will be able to deny it and still seem plausible they have done that too often atvar said we shall have to seek ways to punish them nevertheless he swung an eye turret back toward pshing one plant destroyed you said and one damaged how severe is the impact on the new towns in the area production loss is about fifteen percent exalted fleetlord pshing replied the damaged plant will return to full operation in about forty days as a preliminary estimate that will reduce losses to about ten percent rebuilding the wrecked plant will take three times as longassuming no more attacks from khomeinis fanatics ahyou did not mention that maniac before atvar said so these big uglies profess his variant of the local superstition they do pshing said those captured proudly proclaim it during interrogation we would be better off if he were dead kirel said we have not been able to eliminate him and rewards have failed to turn any big uglies against him now he sighed the tosevites will betray us whenever they see the chance it seems most unfair so it does atvar knew he sounded unhappy but couldnt help it i shall increase the size of the rewardagain with a long resigned sigh monique dutourd sat up in bed she reached for the pack of gauloises on the nightstand lit one and turned to dieter kuhn who sprawled beside her there she said are you happy he rolled over and grinned at her a large sated male grin of the sort she found particularly revolting now that you mention it yes he answered give me a smoke will you she handed him the pack and the book of matches what she wanted to do after that was go into the bathroom and soak in the tub for an hour or perhaps for a week long enough to get the feel of him off her body if hed cared what she wanted though he wouldnt have made her go to bed with him in the first place after a long deep drag on the cigarette he asked and how was it for you monique shrugged it made her bare breasts bounce a little his eyes went to them shed been sure they would draw his notice and felt vindicated to find herself right nowhow to answer the question well she said it was i suppose better than being hauled off to the palais de justice and tormented if thats what you mean your praise overwhelms me he said he didnt sound too angry why should he have hed got it in after all hed had a fine time and if she hadnttoo bad he hadnt deliberately tried to hurt her she gave him that much shed dreaded worse when he made it very plain she could either come across or face another stretch of interrogation if shed let him have her because she liked him rather than acquiescing to a polite rape she might have enjoyed herself as things were well it was over going to bed with me wont get you any closer to my brother she warned if he finds out i did it will only make him trust me even less than he does now and he doesnt trust me very far as is so you say but blood in the end is thicker than water speaking french as a foreign language kuhn was fond of cliches they let him say what he wanted without having to think too much about it he went on your dear pierre does stay in touch with you we know that even if we dont always know what he says you never know what he says monique replied stubbing out her cigarette in the glass ashtray on the nightstand while wishing she could put it out on some of the more tender parts of the ss mans anatomy as long as pierre stayed tight with the lizards they gave him gadgets that defeated the best electronic eavesdroppers mere humans could build but kuhns smug look now was different from the one hed worn after grunting and spurting his seed into her we know more than you think he said monique was inclined to take that as a boast to get her to tell the german more than he already knew but then he went on we know for instance that he told you the other day he was going to eat a big bowl of stewed mussels for his supper oh i am sure that will help you catch him monique said sardonically under the sarcasm though she worried pierre had mentioned the mussels that meant the nazis could unscramble some of what he said to her did it also mean they could unscramble some of what he said to other people or to lizards she didnt know she would have to find a way to make her brother aware of the risk without letting kuhn and his pals find out shed done it one never knows he said giving her a smile she was sure he was sure was charming she remained uncharmed kuhn got up on his knees and leaned across her to put out his own cigarette which hed smoked down to a very small butt instead of drawing his hand all the way back he let it close over her left breast he twiddled her nipple between his thumb and forefinger as if he were adjusting the dial on a wireless he probably thought that would inflame her she knew better his hand slid down to the joining of her legs he rubbed insistently he could have rubbed forever without doing anything but making her sore but after a little while apparently satisfied hed done his duty he drew her to him she had to suck him before he would rise for his second round she particularly hated doing that and hated it worse after he laughed and murmured ah the french as he held her head down if hed spent himself in her mouth she would have done her best to vomit on him but after a while he rolled from his side to his back and had her get on top of him she hadnt known an ss man was allowed to be so lazy she did what he wanted hoping he would finish soon he finally did afterwards he got dressed and left though see you again soon wasnt the sort of farewell she wished shed had from him monique used the bidet in the bathroom then did climb into the tub she didnt feel like a woman violated if a woman violated was supposed to feel downtrodden and put upon what she felt like was a woman infuriated but how to get revenge on a nazi in longoccupied marseille that wouldnt be easy suddenly monique laughed out loud dieter kuhn wouldnt have been happy to hear that laugh not even a little she didnt care what would make the ss man happy she didnt care at all she had or might have connections to which the average woman of marseille could not aspire she couldnt call her brother from the flat not when the germans had proved they truly could hear some of those conversations she didnt dare even more than she didnt want to see kuhn again erect while lying down she didnt want to revisit the palais de justice she didnt think the gestapo had learned much from its interrogation of her but what shed learned about mans inhumanity to manand to womanmade her certain she never wanted to see the inside of that building again phoning from a telephone box was risky too she didnt know whether the nazis had their listening apparatus on her telephone noshe didnt know whether they had it only on her phone for they surely had it there or on pierres line as well she couldnt write a letter either had the postman known her brothers address the germans would have known it too merde she said and shifted so the water sloshed in the tub even with unusual connections getting what she wantedgetting dieter kuhns naked body lying in a ditch with dogs and rats gnawing on itwouldnt be so easy not unless she wanted to endanger not only herself but also whoever might try to help her she got her own naked body which was beginning to resemble a large pink raisin out of the tub she dried as vigorously as she ever had in her life especially between her legs however hard she scrubbed at herself the memory of the germans fingers and privates lingered maybe i feel violated after all she thought three nights later kuhn knocked on her door again she enjoyed that visit no more than she had the earlier one but not a great deal less eitherhe didnt turn vicious he just wanted a woman and instead of hiring a tart he got himself a politically suspect professor for free that was not the sort of teutonic efficiency about which the nazis boasted but it served him well the next afternoon monique stopped at a greengrocers for some lettuce and onions on the way back from the university she was about to take her vegetables over to the proprietor when a woman a year or two older than she wasshort and dumpy with the distinct beginnings of a mustachecame into the shop monique she exclaimed how are you darling she had a throaty sexy voice altogether at odds with her nondescript looks bonjour lucie monique said to her brothers lady friend i was hoping to run into you before too long i have so much to tell you she did her best to sound like a woman getting ready to swap gossip with an acquaintance im all ears and ive got some things to tell you too lucie answered in like tones just let me get some garlic and ill be right with you she chose a string of fragrant heads while monique was paying for what she wanted monique went out to her bicycle and waited by it she could speak more freely outside than anywhere indoors who could guess where the nazis might have planted microphones lucie came out a couple of minutes later grumbling about the prices the grocer charged they werent that bad but lucie liked to grumble she reached into her handbag and took out a pair of sunglasses maybe she thought they made her look glamourous in that case she was wrong maybe on the other hand she just wanted to fight the glare even in early spring marseilles sun could give a foretaste of what brilliant summer days would be like monique looked around nobody was paying any more attention than what people usually gave a couple of women chatting on the street a man riding by on a bicycle whistled at them he was easy to ignore taking a deep breath monique said the germans can tap your phone at least when you and pierre talk with me ah lucie nodded i knew that i wanted to warn you of it she frowned the nazis turn into bigger nuisances every day oh dont they just monique said lucie had given her the perfect opening for the rest of what she had in mind and she proceeded to use it everyone would be better off without one nazi in particular i think dieter kuhn lucie spoke the name without hesitation and with great assurance so much so that monique wondered if pierre and his friendshuman and otherwisehad microphones in her flat too lucie went on perhaps that can be arranged i do not say it surely can be but perhaps it depends on whether we can find a way that does not point straight back at ourselves if you can do it that would be wonderful monique said if not i will try to think of something else some people need killing lucie said matteroffactly monique found herself nodding before she wondered what she was doing associating with people who said things like that shed had no choice but that wouldnt be enough to satisfy her priestnot that shed been to confession in a good long time and besides she was the one who wanted the german dead but she might not be the only one who wanted him dead if you could arrange for the lizards to do the job it could be lucie said they have not always the stomach for killing but some of them do without a doubt they differ less one from another than people do i think but they are not all the same either i may know a male or two who would do better business without this nosy nazi poking into their affairs just then a lizard came by on the other side of the street lucie shut up with a snap monique wondered if he was one of the males pierres companion had in mind before she could ask she stared at something else the lizard was walking a longnecked fourlegged scaly creature on a leash for all the world as if it were a poodle or a greyhound pointing toward it she said for heavens sake what is that thing it has a name ive heard it but i forget what it is lucie answered the males of the conquest fleet were here to tend to business the colonization fleet has also brought farm animals and pets like that one ugly little thing isnt it monique said which the lizard or the pet lucie asked and startled a laugh out of monique her brothers lady friend went on i do business with them but that doesnt mean i have to love them au contraire monique nodded and then looked thoughtfully at lucie that was the first confidence no matter how small she could remember getting from her was lucie starting to trust her at last and if lucie was what did that say about monique that she was the kind of person a drug smugglers woman would trust shed hoped she might think of herself as something better than that like what she jeered a nazis whore she reached out and set a hand on lucies arm all at once being her confidante didnt look so bad with a hiss of glee nesseref strode into the new shop that had opened in the races new town outside of jezow pets she exclaimed now this truly makes me think i am back on home i am pleased i am finally able to open replied the female in charge of the place the animals of course were almost all brought here as frozen fertilized ova at last we have been able to begin thawing them and letting them come to maturity one small step after another we do advance on this world the shuttlecraft pilot said when i talk with males from the conquest fleet they often seem amazed at how far we have come when i talk to males from the conquest fleet i am amazed at how little those ragamuffins have done the other female declared they should have delivered all of tosev to us not just patches of the planet and this place her eye turrets waggled in exasperation it is so chilly and wet i might as well be back in cold sleep when i was first revived i was furious to discover the conquest incomplete too nesseref said as i have come to see more of the big uglies and the things they can do i have more sympathy for the conquest fleet i do not care to see more of the big uglies the female said and used an emphatic cough i have already seen more than i like not only are they barbarians they are dangerous barbarians the only worthwhile thing this planet produces has been made illegal and where is the justice in that ginger do you mean nesseref asked and the other female made the affirmative hand gesture nesseref said the stuff has been made illegal for good reasons it tears up our society as nothing else has ever done when i taste it uh that is when i did taste itthe female in the shop was being cagey not knowing exactly who nesseref wasi did not care about the society of the race all i care uh cared about was how good i felt yes i understand as much nesseref decided to let it go pretty plainly the female in the shop was still tasting laws or no laws as plainly nothing nesseref said would make her change her mind nesseref hadnt come into the shop to argue about ginger anyhow she said i want to see your tsiongyu most males and females are more interested in my befflem the other female replied she was going to score points off nesseref any way she could for nesseref had tried to score points off ginger patiently the shuttlecraft pilot answered befflem need care every day my work can take me away from here for days at a time tsiongyu are better at fending for themselves when their owner is away the petshop keeper sighed i wish my work took me away from this frigid place for days at a time i would love to go somewhere anywhere with decent weather she seemed to remember she needed to do business come with me you will have to walk past the befflem i am afraid i have them in front because they are in greater demand befflem turned their eye turrets toward nesseref as she went by they wanted to be bought every line of their small sinuous bodies proclaimed how much they wanted to be bought they opened their mouths and squeaked endearingly nesseref was tempted to change her mind no doubt about it befflem were more friendly more responsive than tsiongyu but a beffel without companionship from the race would not be happy and was liable to turn destructive nesseref did not want to come back to her apartment and find it torn to pieces by an animal with nothing better to do here are the tsiongyu the other female said as if she didnt expect nesseref to recognize them without help where the befflem were eager to make friends with any female or male who came near the larger tsiongyu sat aloof in their cages each one was as proudly drawn up as if it were the emperor nesseref pointed to one with striking redbrown stripes may i see that male please it shall be done the proprietor answered and opened the cage when she reached for it the tsiongi hissed in warning as its kind had a way of doing had it tried to bite and scratch nesseref would have asked to see another even after so many millennia of domestication about one tsiongi in four remained convinced it was by rights a wild animal after hissing though this one allowed the female to pick it up and take it out of its cage when she set it on the floor it stood there on all fours lashing its tail as if to show how irate it was at being handled but did not streak for the door as many of its kind might have here and there back on home feral tsiongyu no less than befflem made pests of themselves nesseref extended a hand toward the animal it hissed once more not so loudly as it had before but again did not try to bite instead it extended its tongue in the direction of the hand nesseref waited knowing its scent receptors were telling it what to think of her it seems to accept you the female from the shop said by her tone she might have wished the tsiongi had taken a bite out of nesseref so it does nesseref said i will buy it and i will need supplies for its care at least it will not have parasites here which will make things easier truth the proprietor said you will need a leash a container for its wastes and absorbent for the container at least until you train it to use your own wastedisposal unit will you also require a supply of food this would come from the flesh of tosevite animals nesseref asked yes of course the other female replied eventually we will use our own beasts as we do back on home but that time is not yet herelike the pets the food animals are only now coming to tosev i will feed it table scraps then nesseref decided the petshop proprietors tailstump quivered in poorly concealed annoyance she would get less from nesseref than shed hoped nesseref wondered how much she was spending on ginger and how badly she needed more well that fortunately was not the shuttlecraft pilots worry she picked up the tsiongi moving slowly and carefully so as not to take the animal by surprise it stuck out its tongue again and studied her with its large eyes very much like those of the race she took it up to the front of the shop past the befflem they tried to leap through the bars of their cages they did not like tsiongyu the tsiongi eyed them with lordly disdain as if to say it knew it could dispose of three or four befflem without working very hard here are the other things you will require the shopkeeper said if you will let me have your card so i can make the charge against your account i thank you and here is the statement of what you have purchased and i thank you nesseref examined it to make sure the other female hadnt charged her for tsiongi food or anything else she hadnt bought satisfied she tucked the bit of paper into one of the pouches she wore on her belt then she set the tsiongi on the floor and fastened the leash onto its long flexible neck it endured the indignity of being leashed with the air of a prisoner enduring interrogation from the deutsche or some equally fierce big uglies but when nesseref started out of the shop the tsiongi trotted along at her heels when she got to the door she turned back and said to the shopkeeper if i had bought a couple of befflem they would already have tangled their leashes around my legs three different times befflem are not hatched to be led on leashes the other female replied their free spirits are what make them enjoyable their free spirits are what make them nuisances nesseref said if they had any brains and werent so friendly theyd be tosevites the female in the pet shop drew back obviously insulted nesseref left before that female found anything to say the tsiongi stayed right with her the wild ancestors of tsiongyu had hunted in pairs a leader and a follower in domesticating them the race had in effect turned its own males and females into pair leaders nesseref proudly led her new pet through the streets of the new town several males and females exclaimed over it a couple of them asked where shed bought it she told them about the pet shop the tsiongi meanwhile accepted the attention as nothing less than its due its air of restrained nobility lasted till it caught sight of a feathered tosevite flying creature a plump beast with a metallic green head and a grayish body walking along looking for tidbits the tsiongi turned an eye turret toward nesseref plainly expecting her to attack this thing that could only be prey when she didnt when she just kept walking the tsiongi gave what sounded like a male or females hiss of irritation then it sprang for the flying creature itself the leash which nesseref hung on to brought the tsiongi up short the tosevite creature flew away with a whir and a flutter of wings the tsiongi stared as if it couldnt believe its eye turrets maybe it couldnt fewer animals flew back on home than here on tosev and tsiongyu didnt hunt flying creatures there it had probably thought this one couldnt do anything but slowly walk along the feathered creature had given it a surprise as all manner of tosevite creatures had given the race unpleasant surprises come along nesseref told it i will feed you something even if you could not catch that animal still looking as if it thought it had been cheated the tsiongi reluctantly followed half a block farther on it saw another bird again it tried to attack again the bird flew away again the tsiongi seemed astonished that happened twice more before nesseref got back to her apartment building by then she was laughing at the tsiongiall the more so because the beasts native dignity seemed so frazzled she had got the tsiongi almost back to the apartment building when a beffelnaturally not on a leashran past the male to whom it more or less belonged called careful there goldenscale goldenscale didnt feel like being careful it infuriated nesserefs tsiongi in a way the birds hadnt and the beffel wanted to fight too nesseref had to drag her pet the rest of the way to the entrance you had better be careful she called to the male with the beffel your little friend there will be someones supper if you are not befflem do what befflem do the male answered with a shrug which had some truth to it he raised his voice come goldenscale come despite his emphatic cough the beffel went on doing what it did which in this case involved antagonizing nesserefs tsiongi the tsiongi tried to slam through the glass entryway door to get at the obnoxious beffel it slammed into the glass instead and looked even more bewildered than it had when the birds flew away nesseref took it to the elevator once the tsiongi couldnt see the beffel any more it regained its dignity even so nesseref wondered if she would ever be able to take it out on the street for a walk flight lieutenant david goldfarb was going through the motions and he knew it the canadian consulate in belfast had lost interest in having him as an immigrant once he proved unable to retire from the raf officials at the american consulate hadnt formally told him no yet but they hadnt shown any signs of saying yes either and the lizards on whom hed pinned such a great part of his hopes had let him down from what cousin moishe said hed done his best to get the fleetlord interested in the plight of an oppressed british jew but his best hadnt been good enough goldfarb believed moishe had indeed done his best he just wished that best had been better since it hadnt been he was left to keep an eye on the radar screens that watched the sky and space above belfast he was doing just that and trying not to doze off inside the darkened room that housed the radar displays when an aircraftman first class came in and said telephone call for you sir thanks goldfarb replied and the enlisted man saluted goldfarb turned to sergeant jack mcdowell his partner on the shift will you keep an eye on things jack i doubt ill be long aye sir ill do it mcdowell replied in his rich burr he didnt look down his nose at goldfarb for being jewishor if he did he kept it to himself he didnt even have to do that his place in the raf was oddson to be more secure than goldfarbs not caring to dwell on such things david tapped the aircraftman on the shoulder lead on macduff he misquoted and followed the youngster down the hall and into an office where a telephone lay with the handset off the hook goldfarb eyed it with the warm affection a bird gave a snake it was he feared all too likely to be basil roundbush trying to get him into fresh troubleas if he didnt have enough already with a sigh he picked up the telephone goldfarb here hullo old man said a cheerful voice on the other end of the line three words were plenty to tell goldfarb the owner of that voice had gone to oxford or cambridge and to one of the best public schools before that roundbush his tormentor had done all those things but this wasnt roundbushs voice it wasnt any voice with which david was immediately familiar its owner went on havent seen you in a long timenot since we went trolling for barmaids together back in dover eh jerome jones by god goldfarb burst out theyd worked side by side on radar sets through the battle of britain and then during the onslaught of the lizardstill radarseeking missiles had taken out their sets and reduced them to using field glasses and field telephones right out of the first world war what the devil are you doing with yourself these days im in the importexport business jones answered and davids heart sank if that wasnt a euphemism for smuggling ginger he would have been astonished and if jones wasnt going to try to use him some way or other he would have been more astonished still sure enough his former comrade went on i hear youve come on a spot of trouble lately what if i have goldfarb asked tightly jerome jones wasnt in her majestys forces david could tell him where to head in without worrying about getting courtmartialednot that hed let that bother him when hed finally told roundbush where to go and how to get there even though jones father had headed up a bank dear jerome would be hardpressed to land goldfarb in worse trouble than hed already found for himself why i wanted to lend you a hand if i possibly could jones said sounding surprised david would have to ask what sort of hand goldfarb remained deeply suspicious he knew the kind of answer he expected if you need to put a few hundred quid in your pocket jones would say you can take this little shipment to buenos aires for me or maybe it would be to warsaw or to cairo or even god help us to nuremberg jerome jones said unless the little bird ive been listening to has it altogether wrong there are some people giving you a bit of difficulty about leaving the country thats true goldfarb kept on answering in monosyllables waiting for the sales pitch he remained sure it was coming what would he do if good old jerome promised to help him emigrate after he did his former pal one little favor that would undoubtedly turn out not to be so little also undoubtedly good old jerome had the clout if he could be persuaded to use it its bloody awful is what it is jones sounded indignant how smooth was he these days back when goldfarb had known him hed been distinctly callow but he was a captain of industry these days not a puppy still wet behind the ears youve done more for britain than britain wants to do for you were still a free country by god from where you sit maybe david said from where he sat himself the united kingdom tilted more toward the greater german reich with every passing day with most of the british empire in the lizards scaly hands with the usa still rebuilding after the fighting and with the reich just across the channel he supposed that tilt was inevitable that didnt mean he thought it was anything but disastrous i also hear your superiors have taken unfair advantage of you officers are nasty that waythink theyre little tin gods what jones chuckled i always thought that back when i was wearing raf blue though there was damn all i could do about it things are different now if i ring the minister of defense i expect hell listen to me hed damn well better his son is married to my first cousin my god goldfarbs voice was hoarse you really mean it well of course i do jones answered whats the point of having influence if you dont get to use it id have rung you up sooner but i only heard of your difficulties a few days ago thats all right david said vaguely back when theyd served in the raf together hed thought about jerome jones secure upperclass upbringing and his own roots in east end london then hed thought the most he could aspire to was a little wirelessrepair shop after the fighting ended staying in the raf looked like a road to a better life it had been for a little while ill ring you back directly i know something jones told him be good in the meanwhile he hung up the line went dead goldfarb stared at the telephone handset before slowly returning it to the cradle the young aircraftman was long gone goldfarb went back to the radar screens by himself his head whirling a few days later he was watching the glowing green screens again they showed a soviet spacecraft passing north of the uk the americans and germansand likely the race toolaughed at the craft the russians flew the americans called them flying tin cans because of the limits to their craft soviet spacemen couldnt do nearly so much up there as their counterparts from the usa and the reich but they were flying britain had no spacemen watching everyone else go by above his head goldfarb acutely felt the lack he was about to remark on it to sergeant mcdowell when a freshfaced enlisted man stuck his head into the room and said the base commandants compliments flight lieutenant and hell see you in his office fast as you can get there taking the privilege of long acquaintance mcdowell asked what have you gone and done now sir i dont know david answered but i expect ill find out before long dont let that russian land in belfastpeople would talk before the scotsman could find a comeback goldfarb headed for group captain burton pastons office paston was doing paperwork when he walked in the commandants face normally dyspeptic now grew less happy still oh its you goldfarb he said as if hed been expecting someone elseperhaps the spanish inquisitioninstead reporting as ordered sir goldfarb said coming to attention and saluting as he waited to discover what sort of new trouble he was in yes distaste filled pastons voice too some little while ago you attempted to resign from the royal air force yes sir i did but ive performed my duties since to the best of my ability goldfarb said if group captain paston thought hed be able to hang a badconduct discharge on him he had another think coming but paston waved that away you seem to have friends as well as enemies in high places he remarked why so many people would get themselves exercised over a flight lieutenant up from the ranks is beyond me but thats neither here nor there the point of the matter is i have been instructed in no uncertain terms to reconsider your resignation having done so ive elected to accept it after all have you sir david breathed no matter what jerome jones said he hadnt dreamt his old pal really did have so much clout nor that he could work so fast he also noted that paston had tacitly admitted hed been under pressure to reject the resignation before gloating would have felt good but wouldnt have helped goldfarb could see as much all he said was thank you very much im not nearly certain youre welcome the base commandant answered youre the most experienced radar operator weve got and im damned if i know where well come up with another one even half as good if hed put something like that on a fitness report goldfarb might have risen higher than flight lieutenant on the other hand he couldnt do anything about being a jew so he might not have too he said i do appreciate this from the bottom of my heart now that hed got what he wanted he could afford to be gracious he couldnt very well afford to be anything else burton paston shoved forms across the desk at him im going to need your signature on all of these yes sir david signed and signed and signed when he was done the base commandant handed him a copy of one of the forms if you take this to the canadian consulate it will serve to notify them that you have in fact separated yourself from the raf and that no impediment stands in the way of your emigration thats splendid thanks goldfarb reflected on what influence could do before paston would sooner have thrown him in the guardhouse than let him leave her majestys service now he was practically laying down a red carpet to help speed goldfarb out the door so much cooperation got goldfarb worried suppose sir that the blokes who dont like me so much have got to the canadians if they turn me down will i be able to rescind this resignation i dont fancy being down and out with no hope for any job in sight if they and the yanks turn you down yes paston answered your friend already considered that possibility youre lucky to have so many people looking out for your interests i suppose i am sir david said he didnt point out to paston that since he was a jew he automatically had a lot more people doing their best to give him a knee in the ballocks the group captain wouldnt understand that and wouldnt believe it either goldfarb shrugged he knew what he knew and one of the things he knew was that he was getting out at last he was getting out one thing johannes drucker appreciated about his long service to the reich he had no trouble getting his hands on a firearm rifles and especially pistols were hard to come by for civilians in the reich every officer though had his own service weapon drucker would have preferred a pistol not so easily traced back to him but with any luck no one would associate gunther grillparzers untimely demise with him anyhow he tried to read a copy of signal as the train rolled southwest toward thuringia by what the magazine said everyone in europe was delighted to live under the benevolent rule of the reich and to labor to make germany greater still drucker hoped that was true which didnt necessarily mean he believed it as usual the compartment was tightly shut up against the outside air the atmosphere was full of smoke from cigarettes and a couple of cigars in the forward compartment of this car thered been a screaming row earlier in the trip someonea foreigner without a doubthad had the nerve to open up a window everyone else had pitched a fit till a conductor quite properly shut it again and warned the miscreant hed be put off the train if he opened it again the interior remained unsullied by fresh air until a conductor came through the car calling weimar all out for weimar as the train slowed to a stop at the station drucker grabbed his carpetbagall the luggage he had with himand descended from the car weimars station had a shabby rundown look to it as drucker carried the bag out to the street to flag a taxi he saw that the whole town looked as if it had seen better days the reich and the national socialists did not love the place where the preceding unhappy german republic had been born drucker discovered he didnt need a cab after all he could see the hotel elephant from where he was standing he hurried toward and into it a clerk nodded to him from behind the desk yes sir may i help you i am johann schmidt drucker said using the voice an officer used toward an enlisted man to hide his nervousness i have a room reserved that tone worked wonders as it so often did in the reich the desk clerk flipped pages in the register yes sir he said nodding he handed drucker a key youll be in sir i hope you enjoy your stay with us weve been here on the marktplatz for more than two hundred years you know bach and liszt and wagner have stayed here not wanting to drop his air of lordly superiority drucker said i hope the plumbing is better now than it was in those days oh yes sir herr schmidt the clerk said you will find everything to your satisfaction well see having established a personality drucker played it to the hilt oh one thing more where is the central post office on dimitroffstrasse sir just west of the square here the desk clerk answered you cant miss it that seemed worth another sneer having delivered it drucker climbed the hotels sweeping staircase to the third floor once he got there he discovered the bath was at the end of the hall he felt like going down and complaining it would have been in character with a shrug though he let himself into the room except for the lack of private bath it seemed comfortable enough he changed into fresh shirt and trousers and as nondescript a jacket as he owned the jackets one virtue was that it had big roomy pockets he put the pistol in one and a paperbound book in another then went downstairs and headed across the square to dimitroffstrasse for a wonder the clerk had got it right he couldnt have missed the post office for it lay only a couple of buildings away from the gothic church that dominated weimars skyline the postoffice building on the other hand was severely utilitarian drucker sat down inside on a bench that gave him a good look at the bank of postal boxes pulled out the book and began to read a postal protection nco in fieldgray uniform with orange piping strolled by and eyed him the postschutz was a branch of the ss and had been since a couple of months before the lizard invasion drucker kept on reading with a fine outward appearance of calm the nco paused between one step and another then shrugged and walked on his booted feet clicking on the marble floor drucker wasnt a bum or a drunk he didnt look as if he intended causing trouble if he felt like reading in a post office well there was no regulation against it drucker kept a surreptitious eye on box hed mailed gunther grillparzeror rather grillparzers alias maxim kipphardthis first payment two days earlier it should be reaching grillparzer today by the way grillparzer had sounded he wouldnt let it sit around in the postal box for long no hed spend it either to keep a roof over his head or perhaps more likely on schnapps maybe i should have worn a disguise drucker thought but the idea of putting on false whiskers had struck him as absurd and all the false whiskers hed ever seen looked false in the end hed decided that being what he wasan ordinarylooking middleaged german in ordinary clothesmade as good a disguise as any the expanzer gunner wouldnt have seen him for more than twenty years after all the postal protection nco tramped past him again drucker not only pretended to be absorbed in his booka study of what people knew or thought they knew about homebut actually got interested in it that was an acting triumph of which he hadnt thought himself capable the postschutz man didnt even bother pausing this time hed accepted drucker as part of the landscape a fat man came up and opened a postal box it wasnt when the fat man pulled out an envelope he muttered something sulfurous under his breath drucker couldnt see the envelope was it a pastdue bill a letter from an exwife a writers rejection slip hed never know still muttering the fat man went away drucker returned to his book when someone did come to box drucker almost didnt notice it wasnt gunther grillparzer but a blond womanquite a goodlooking onein her mid to late twenties she took out an envelopethe envelope the one drucker had sentand left the post office scheisse drucker muttered under his breath as he got to his feet stuck the book in his pocket and went out after the woman things werent going as hed planned no plan survives contact with the enemy he thought all the while wishing grillparzer hadnt found a way to complicate his life he hadnt been trained in shadowing people had the woman looked back over her shoulder she would have spied him in the blink of an eye but she didnt she stood at a street corner waiting for the trolley drucker decided to wait for the trolley too what am i supposed to do now he wondered he had no qualms about killing gunther grillparzer none whatever but a pretty stranger who might not even know what she was carrying in her handbag that was a different business here came the streetcar clanging its bell she got on so did drucker he didnt know the right fare and had to fumble in a pocketnot the one that held the pistolfor change the trolley driver gave him a severe look feeling absurdly sheepish he went back and sat down beside the young woman she nodded politely and then ignored him he marveled that she couldnt hear his heart pounding in his chest the streetcar rattled along for several blocks heading into as seedy apart of town as weimar had when it stopped the woman murmured excuse me and walked past drucker and out he didnt get out with her that would have been giving himself away instead he stared out the window hoping to see where she headed he got lucky a lorry on the cross street blocked the intersection for fifteen seconds or so no matter how angrily the motorman clanged the truck didntlikely couldntmove that let drucker see the woman go into a block of flats whose brick front was streaked with coal soot he got out at the next stop and hurried back to the apartment building in the lobby as hed expected he found a brass bank of mailboxes none said gunther grillparzer none said maxim kipphardt either before he started knocking on doors at randoma desperation ploy if ever there was onedrucker noticed that the one for e did say martin krafft in detective novels people often used aliases whose initials matched their real names martin krafft wasnt grillparzers real name but hed said hed been using a false one for a while without any better ideaswithout any better hopesdrucker started up the stairs panting a little wishing the place had a lift he stood in the fourthfloor hallway which smelled of cabbage and spilled beer there was e opposite the stairway drucker slipped his right hand into the pocket with the pistol he thought fast as he advanced on the doorway and used his left hand to knock who is it the womans voice his knees sagged with relief one right guess drucker grimaced now he had to take another chance telegram for herr krafft he said if grillparzer wasnt there life would get more difficult still but a moment later the door opened and there stood the expanzer gunner middleaged and podgy fat and looking more than a little bottleweary he needed a couple of seconds to recognize drucker and that was a couple of seconds too long by then the pistol was aimed at his face let me in gunther drucker said dont do anything stupid or youll never do anything at all ever again keep your hands where i can see them you wont get away with this grillparzer said as he backed away drucker came in and kicked the door shut behind him his former comrade went on i thought youd be a smart boy and pay me off when i denounce you drucker laughed in his face he tapped one of the buttons on his coat you foolthe ss is listening to you run your mouth now thanks to my transmitter here grillparzer looked horrified drucker was horrifiedat the bluff he was running but as hitler had said the bigger the lie the better i am the ss and you my friend have cooked your own gooseand your girlfriends too if the woman standing in back of grillparzer had been his wife or his kid sister drucker wouldnt have looked infallible and he might have had to start shooting but the exgunner only grimaced christ what a pack of lies you must have told to get yourself into the ss you murdering bastard i dont know what youre talking about and you cant prove i doits your word against mine drucker answered i do know and i have evidencehe tapped the button againthat youve tried to blackmail me cough up the cash you cant use it anyhow the banks have the serial numbers of all the notes on their watch list as soon as you spent one itd just be another nail in your coffin he sounded convincing as hell he would have believed himself and grillparzer believed himor believed the pistol turning his head he said hand it over friedli the son of a bitch has got us dammit the woman had only to reach onto the cheap pine table behind her to retrieve the envelope drucker took it by one corner with his left hand both your fingerprints are on this now of course he said cheerfully the envelope had been opened but still weighed about what it had when hed posted it grillparzer andfriedli hadnt had the chance to do much plundering remember if you even think of giving me grief again youll be sorrier than you can imagine christ why didnt you just tell me over the phone you were a blackshirt along with being a spaceman grillparzer asked by the look in friedlis eyes he was going to be sorrier than he could imagine even if drucker had nothing to do with it cheerful still drucker answered youll remember the lesson longer this way auf wiedersehen and out the door he went sam yeager sighed hed drafted his son to feed mickey and donald breakfast and jonathan often gave the lizard hatchlings supper too for their lunch though the kid was at school that meant sam needed to do the job himself well he could have given it to barbara but his pride prevented that president warren had assigned him the job of raising the baby lizards so he couldnt very well palm all of it off on his family besides the critters were interesting ive been in the army too long he said as he stood in the kitchen slicing ham even if its fun i dont want to do anything i have to what did you say honey barbara called from their bedroom which was at the other end of the house nothing reallyjust grousing he answered a little embarrassed that shed heard him he looked at how much meat hed cut just after the lizards hatched it would have kept them going for a couple of days now it was just one meal or would be after he put a couple of more slices on the plate donald and mickey were almost five months old now and a lot bigger than when theyd fought their way out of their eggshells he took the plate piled high with ham down the hail to the lizards room they still liked to bolt whenever they got the chance so he shut the door at the end of the hall before opening theirs these days they didnt quite make the mad dash for freedom they had when they were smaller it seemed more a game of the sort puppies or kittens might play no matter what it was though he didnt feel like running after them not at his age he didnt when he did open the door to their room he found them rolling on the floor clawing and snapping at each other they rarely did any damage again they could have been a couple of squabbling puppies from what hed learned on the races computer network these brawls were normal for hatchlings of their age he didnt give his leather gauntlets a workout by pulling them apart the way he had the first few times hed caught them tangling even though he didnt try to separate them they sprang apart when he stepped inside you know i dont like you doing that dont you he said to them he talked to them whenever he fed themwhenever he had anything to do with them at all they didnt pick up language and meaning as readily as human babies did but hed already seen they were a lot smarter than dogs or cats that did make sense by the time they grew up theyd be at least as smart as he was maybe smarter for the time being they were more interested in him as the dinner wagon than in him as a person their eye turrets focused on the plate of sliced ham to the exclusion of everything else they let out little excited hisses and snorts maybe it was sams imagination but he thought he caught some humanlike sounds among their noises were they trying to imitate him and his family he supposed he would have to listen to a comparison recording of the noises of lizardraised hatchlings to be certain come and get it boys he said though mickey and donald might have been girls for all he knew he crooked his finger in the comehere gesture people used it wasnt a normal lizard gesture when they wanted to tell someone to come they used a twist of the eye turret to get the message across but yeager watched mickey crook one of his skinny scaly clawtipped tiny fingers in just the same way as he hurried forward to get his lunch sam felt like cheering instead he gave mickey the first piece of ham that usually went to donald who was a little larger and a little quicker mickey made the ham disappear in a couple of quick snaps he cocked his head to one side and turned an eye turret up at yeager who was feeding donald his first slice of meat what wheels were spinning inside mickeys head sam had wondered that since the day the lizard hatched lizards thought as well as people but they didnt think like people in a lot of ways and did hatchlings could hatchlings really think at all in the strict sense of the word when they had no words with which to think quite deliberately mickey bent his finger into that purely human comehere gesture again you little son of a gun yeager exclaimed you figured out that that means you get extra didnt you he rewarded the hatchling with another piece of ham donald had one eye turret on sam the other on mickey he saw the reward hisbrother sister had got when he crooked his finger he was imitating mickey not yeager no you fellows arent dumb at all sam said and gave donald some meat from then on both lizards kept making comehither gestures till yeager ran out of ham sorry boys thats all there is he told them they didnt understand that any more than puppies or kittens would have but their little bellies bulged so they werent in imminent danger of starving to death he looked from one of them to the other i dont know i have the feeling you guys may start talking sooner than you would if you were around a bunch of other lizards what have you got to say about that they didnt have anything to say about that jonathan wouldnt have had anything to say about it at five months old either physically the lizards were a long way ahead of where jonathan had been at their agehe couldnt even sit up unsupported then let alone run and jump and fight yeager had always thought they were developing more slowly when it came to mental processes now suddenly he wasnt so sure all right maybe they wouldnt talk as fast as a human baby would but plainly a lot was going on inside their heads it might not come out in words one way or another though it looked as if it would come out see you later sam told them and waved goodbye to his disappointment they didnt try to imitate that of course it didnt have food attached to its meaning maybe the big difference between the way they thought and the way people thought was just that they were a lot more practical he went back to the kitchen washed the plate and set it in the dish drainer then he went back to the bedroom those little guys are getting smarter he told barbara and explained what the hatchlings had done that is interesting she said i think youre right something is definitely going on inside their headsmore than i would have expected since they dont have words with which to form concepts i was thinking the same thing sam answered not surprising considering that they were married and considering that hed learned from her a lot of what he knew about the way languages worked something else was on his mind when do you suppose we can start letting them go around the house more when we can teach them not to tear up the furniture so much barbara replied promptly as if she were talking about a couple of kittens that enjoyed sharpening their claws on the sofa she went on if youre right though we really might be able to start trying to teach them might be worth doing theyd enjoy it yeager was about to say something more but paused hearing footsteps on the front porch if he could hear them whoever was making them could hear him a moment later the mail slot in the front door opened envelopes landed on the rug the footsteps went away sam said lets see to whom we owe money today he wagged a finger under barbaras nose you were going to nail me if i said who we owe money to today of course i was she answered that kind of grammar deserves it but she was laughing she didnt take herself too seriously and didnt mind teasing about what she admitted to be her obsession they went out together to check the mail no bills yeager said with some relief shuffling the envelopes just ads and political junk i wont be sorry to see the primary come barbara said its still six weeks away and look at everything were getting junk is right yeager held up a flyer extolling the virtues of president warren i dont know why his people bother to mail this stuff hes going to get reelected in a walk let alone renominated christ i wouldnt be surprised if he won the democratic primary too hes done a good job barbara agreed ill vote for him again no doubt about it sam said and one of the reasons ill vote for him again is that he doesnt take a lot of chanceswhich is probably why he has his people send this stuff out in carload lots i suppose youre right barbara said but since we already know what were going to do she took the political flyers and the advertising circulars into the kitchen and pitched them in the trash good for you sam called after her she was death on traveling salesmen too if they didnt back away in a hurry theyd get their noses smashed when she slammed the door in their faces having grown up on a farm where such visitors were always made welcome sam liked to chat with them half the time hed buy things from them too barbara and he didnt have many arguments but that could touch one off he went into the study and turned on the humanbuilt computer that shared desk space withand used more of it thanthe lizards machine he preferred but the lizards didnt have access to the rather fragmentary network that had grown up in the united states over the past few years he certainly hoped they didnt anyhow still if he could sneak around through their electronic playground they were bound to be trying to sneak around through the usas waiting for the screen to come to life which also took longer than it did in the lizardbuilt computer he wondered how good his countrys electronic security really was hed got in dutch when he poked his nose in where it didnt belonghed bought himself a royal chewingout from a threestar general when he tried to find out what was going on with the lewis and clark before the united states was ready to let anybody know the answer with any luck at all the race would have as much trouble but he hadnt tried to be sneaky he supposed the lizards would and theyd been using computers as long as people had been counting on their fingers how sneaky could they be if they put their minds to it that wasnt his problem no it was his problem but he couldnt do anything about solving it he had other things on his mind anyway in his spare timea concept ever more mythical now that mickey and donald were aroundhe kept poking around trying to find leads that would show either the reich or the ussr had blown up the ships from the colonization fleet if he ever did find anything he intended to pass it on to the lizards as far as he was concerned that attack had been murder and could have touched off a nuclear war he wouldnt shed a tear if the nazis or the reds got hammered on account of it thanks to his dealings with the race he had a security clearance that let him go almost anywhere on the us network not quite as hed found out when he went snooping after data on the lewis and clark hed found a couple of interesting archives of signals received just after the orbiting weapon whosever it was launched its warheads at the orbiting ships of the colonization fleet the screen went dark after a moment a message appeared connection broken please try again disgustedly he whacked the computer that happened all too often with it miserable halfassed piece of junk he growled few men in the history of the worldno of the solar systemhad enjoyed the view glen johnson had now there was ceres below him mostly dustcovered rock with a little ice here and there it was the biggest asteroid in the whole damn belt but not big enough to be perfectly round it looked more like a roundish potato than anything else the landscape put johnson in mind of the heavily cratered parts of the moon rocks of all sizes had been slamming into ceres for as long as it had been out there colonel walter stone had a different way of looking at things thats the worst case of acne ive ever seen he said yeah any kid with that many zits wouldnt like high school a whole hell of a lot johnson agreed none of the other asteroids can tease ceres though his mentor observed theyre all just as ugly and just as pockmarkedor if there are any that arent we havent found em yet still no matter how ugly it is were in business here and thats what counts weve been in business for a while too johnson observed i cant believe how fast we got here just a couple of months stone sounded as complacent as if hed got out behind the lewis and clark and pushed you have to remember glen old boyhe put on a british accent too fruity to be realthis isnt one of those oldfashioned rocket ships theyre as out of date as buggy whips dont you know and we could have been a little faster too if we hadnt swung wide to keep from coming too close to the sun johnson shook his head in slow wonder i wouldnt have believed how quick we could get here if i hadnt done the mathwell had the math done for me anyhow and if we hadnt been hanging around here in orbit for the past three and a half months stone added except were not really hanging around were going exploring thats what its all about finding that big chunk of ice only a few hundred miles away was a lucky break johnson remarked thats not a chunk of iceits an asteroid walter stone said and it was only part luck there are lots of chunks ofuh icy asteroids floating around here the first exploration team saw that no reason why one of em shouldnt be someplace where we can get at it lieutenant colonel mickey flynn a large solidly built fellow who let nothing faze him floated into the control room im here a couple of minutes early out of the goodness of my heart the lewis and clark s second pilot said so you poor peasants can get an early start on supper i expect nothing in return mind you worship isnt necessary even simple adoration seems excessive youre what seems excessive stone said with a snort being senior to flynn he could sass him with if not impunity at least something close and why should we trust anybody whos named after a knockout drop thats finn my cousin flynn said in dignified tones sassenachs the both of you and sassenachs wasting their time getting out of here by giving a hard time to a son of erin who never did em any harm johnson undid his harness ill go to supper he said unsnapping his safety belt now that the lewis and clark was in orbit around ceres he didnt even haveg to hold him in his seat he pushed off grabbed the nearest handhold and then swung onto the next still snorting stone followed him because of the banter theyd traded with their relief the mess hall was already crowded when they got to it then the banter started up again a woman called if youre here whos flying the damn ship nobody johnson shot back and if you dont believe me go ask flynn hell tell you the same thing no hed say that was going on during the shift before his somebody else returned walter stone said something pungent johnson mimed being wounded in spite of that he was grinning when he first involuntarily came aboard the lewis and clark people wouldnt give him the time of day they treated him like a spy a lot of people had thought he was a spy now he was one of the crew he might not have helped build the spaceship but hed helped fly her and even if he was a spy he couldnt very well telephone whoever he was spying for not from a quarter of a billion miles away he couldnt what he could do better than stone or flynn or anybody else was fly the little hydrogenburning rockets the lewis and clark used to explore the asteroids in ceres neighborhood they werent just like peregrine the upper stage hed flown countless times in earth orbit but they werent very far removed either he understood them the way his grandfather had understood horses he didnt fully understand the dynamics of chow lines in weightlessness not yet at last though he drifted up in front of the assistant dietitian who gave him chicken and potatoes that had been frozen and dried out and were now reconstituted with water they tasted like ghosts of their former selves with them he got a squeeze bulb full of water and a lidded plastic cup full of pills vitamins and calcium supplements and god only knew what all else i think we carry more of these than we do of reaction mass he said shaking the pills the assistant dietitian gave him a dirty look what if we do she said if we get here but cant finish the mission because were malnourished whats the point of coming at all well youve got me there glen said and drifted away there werent any tables or chairsthey were no good in weightlessness or even ing instead he snagged a handhold and started gossiping with some people who looked interestingwhich was to say at least in part some people who were female more women had come along in the lewis and clark than hed expected when he came aboard they made up something close to a third of the crew very few of them were married to male crew members either come to that very few of the men were married johnson was divorced walter stone a widower mickey flynn a bachelor and they were pretty typical of the crew and military rules about fraternization were a dead letter the lewis and clark wasnt going home again more people might come out but nobody here was going back people had to do the best they could with their lives out here and to hell with mrs grundy so far as johnson knew nobodyd got pregnant yet but that wasnt through lack of effort hi glen said the mineralogist a brunette named lucy vegetti she was on the plump side but he liked her smile he liked any womans smile these days she went on have you heard about the latest samples up from ceres he shook his head nope sure havent whats the new news plenty of aluminum plenty of magnesium plenty of all the light metals she said all we need is energy and we can get them out of the rocks weve got energy by godweve got more energy than you can shake a stick at johnson answered pointing back toward the engine on its boom at the rear of the lewis and clark just have to worry about getting it out he was also worrying about getting it in but not to the point where it made him stupid any man who lived by himself and didnt take advantage of the fivefinger discount was a damn fool as far as he was concerned one of the ships three doctorseverything aboard the lewis and clark was as redundant as anybody could figure out how to make itsaid but we cant build everything well need for the project out of aluminum and magnesium johnson listened to miriam rosen with careful attention he told himself he would have listened to her the same way even if she werent a redhead who wasnt half badlooking sometimes for little stretches of time he even believed it lucy vegetti said no we cant build everything but we can sure build a heck of a lot she doubled in brass as an engineer and was learning more about that part of her business every day redundancy again johnson was just glad he had one skill anybody aboard found useful if he hadnt he might have gone out the air lock instead of coming along for the ride can we really do this he asked or will we all die of old age out here before it happens for a little while silence reigned around him he grimaced hed asked the question too bluntly and stuck his foot in it people knew they were never going to see earth again but they didnt like to think about that when they didnt have to just when the pause threatened to become really awkward dr rosen said well probably find plenty of things besides old age to die of that produced another silence but not one aimed at johnson he smiled his thanks toward her she didnt smile back hed got to know she was like that she spoke the truth as she saw it i think we can do it lucy vegetti said i really do oh well need more help from back home but well get that the lewis and clark showed that we could make constantboost ships the next one that comes out will be better well have a good start on things by then too pretty soon well be mining a good stretch of the asteroid belt i think well find most of the metals we need sooner or later what about uranium miriam rosen asked not likely well find much of that here is it lucy shook her head wed have to get lucky i think the asteroids arent as dense as rocks back on earth which means there are fewer heavy metals around but you never can tell was she looking at johnson when she said get lucky he wasnt sure and he didnt want to foul up a chance for later by messing up now the rules on the lewis and clark hadnt fully shaken out yet but one thing was already clear the ladies did the choosing maybe things would have been different if thered been two gals for every guy but there werent a couple of other male optimists came floating up to join the conversation johnson took his squeeze bags and lidded cup now empty of pills back to the assistant dietitian nothing got thrown away on the lewis and clark everything was cleaned and reused that included bodily waste water one more thing the crew preferred not to think about a spaceship beat even a nuclearpowered submarine as a selfcontained environment swinging out of the galley johnson went to the gymnasium he logged in strapped himself onto an exercise bicycle and grimly began pedaling away that helped keep calcium in his bones he wondered why he was bothering if he wasnt going back to earth and earths gravity who cared if his bones were made of calcium or rubber bands but orders prescribed at least half an hour of exercise every day hed been in the army too long to think orders had to make sense they were just there and they had to be obeyed on he pedaled going nowhere in his time in lodz mordechai anielewicz had heard a lot of strange noises coming from alleys once hed foiled a robbery though he hadnt caught the robber the fellow had leaped over a wallan olympicquality jumpand got away once hed surprised a couple making love standing up in a doorway hed felt like leaping over a wall himself then bertha still didnt know about that more often than not though noises down alleys meant animal fights dogdog catcat catdog these furious snarls were of that sort and under most circumstances mordechai would have paid them no special attention but as he walked past the mouth of the alley some of the noises proved to have a stridency the likes of which hed never heard before almost before he knew what he was doing he craned his neck to see what the devil was going on he was surprised enough to stop in midstride one foot off the ground till he noticed and made it come down the alley was just an alley cobblestones weeds pushing up among them a couple of dead vodka bottles one of the beasts down it was a cat sure enough it was clawing at its foe like a lioness ripping the guts out of a zebra but that foe gevalt what is that thing mordechai exclaimed and hurried past a battered trash barrel toward the fight to find out whatever it was hed never seen anything like it it was clawing at the cat too but it was also biting and it had a very big mouth full of sharp teeth pretty plainly it was getting the better of the fight for the cats claws and even its needlesharp canines had trouble piercing its scaly hide anielewicz stooped and grabbed a stickalways handy to have when breaking up a fight between animalsbefore advancing on the cat and the thing he hadnt taken more than a couple of steps toward the beasts when the cat decided it had had enough it broke free of the fight and levitated up a wooden fence leaving only bloodstains behind to prove it had been there the other animal was bleeding too though not so badly now that mordechai got a good look at it he saw it was smaller than the cat it had just mauled it stuck out a long forked tongue and licked a couple of its worst wounds it was looking at him too while it tended to itself one turreted eye swung in his direction to make sure he didnt mean trouble realization smote him it must be from the lizardsworld he exclaimed either that or he was hallucinating he shook his head he couldnt have imagined anything so funnylooking and he did remember hearing that the colonization fleet had brought along some of the lizards domesticated creatures he hadnt expected his first meeting with one to be in an alley though now that it wasnt fighting the lizardy thinghe didnt know what else to call itseemed to relax when mordechai didnt wave the stick or do anything else untoward the animal turned both eye turrets toward him and let out an absurdly friendly squeak he laughed he couldnt help himself snarls and hisses were one thing he would have expected noises like those from a small creature that could take on a cat and win he hadnt expected the thing to sound like a rubber squeeze toy whatever he thought of the noises the animal made it didnt like the ones he made it streaked past him nimble as a champion footballer getting past a midfielder who only stepped onto a soccer pitch as a weekend amusement it was he thought even faster and more agile than a cat though it had shown no signs of being able to climb out on the street someone exclaimed in surprise what was that what was what somebody elsea womansaid i didnt see anything anielewicz laughed again as he threw down the stick and walked out of the alley some people were always unlucky enough to miss things he wondered if this lady would ever have another chance to see an animal from another planet he also wondered in a different and more urgent way this time what an animal from another planet was doing in an alley in lodz besides fighting a cat that is he hadnt intended to go by the bialut market squarebertha was reluctant to let him anywhere near the place too after his fiasco with the peasant woman selling eggsbut bunims headquarters looked out onto it he didnt suppose the lizards would mind talking about the animals theyd brought to earth as he started for the market square he laughed again he wasnt likely to have much immediate interest in animals from home and neither was any other polish jew how likely were they to divide the hoof and chew a cud not very which put them beyond the pale as far as he was concerned people and a few lizards crowded the square since mordechai wasnt shopping he ignored the frantic haggling in yiddish and polish and every now and then the hisses and pops of the language of the race he strode up to the building from which the lizards administered this stretch of polandalong with the shadow governments of the jews and poles the guards in front of the building were alert as they had reason to be what do you want one of them asked in passable polish the male didnt recognize him well that was all right he had trouble telling one lizard from another i just saw an animal he began also sticking to polishhe could do a better job of describing the creature in that tongue than in the races ah the guard said when he was through that is a beffel they will run wild crazy as a beffel on a leash is a saying in our language a beffel mordechai repeatednow he had a name for the beast what good is it do you eat it or is it just a pet eat a beffel what an ignorant tosevite you are the guards mouth dropped open in amusement so did his partners no it is only a pet as you say all right i am ignorantid never seen one till now it was fighting a cat anielewicz said are they going to start running loose all over the place now i would not be surprised the guard replied they get to be nuisances back on home so do tsiongyu whats a tsiongi mordechai asked another kind of pet larger the guard said you speak some of our language to know the singular when you hear the plural truth anielewicz answered shifting to the language of the race so are we to be overrun with animals from home if we so choose the lizard replied we rule this part of tosev we have the right to bring in the beasts on which we feedand we are doing that tooand the beasts that are our friends what business do you have to say otherwise that was a pretty good question although the male sounded arrogant even for one of his kind mordechai didnt try to answer it instead he asked a question of his own how will your animals like the winters here in poland by the way both guards winced he knew hed struck a nerve we cannot know that until we find out by experiment said the one who was doing the talking the hope is that they will do well i certainly hope this our beasts are better eating than your tosevite animals truth the other guard proved he could talk anielewicz wondered if he needed to go inside and talk with bunim he decided he didnt hed learned everything he needed to know from the regional subadministrators guards bunim wouldnt stop bringing his kinds of animals into poland just because mordechai asked him to europeans had brought cows and pigs and dogs and cats to america and australia why wouldnt the race bring its creatures to earth the lizards had come to stay after all and the poles probably wouldnt mind the new domestic animals one bit they didnt have to worry about keeping kosher mordechai chuckled wondering how soon some strange meat would start turning up in polish farmwives pots and how soon polish leather makers would start tanning new kinds of hide sooner than the lizards expect he thought yes the poles were very likely to turn intowhat did the westerns imported from the united states call cattle thieves rustlers that was it and an old joke about the recipe for chicken stew floated through his mind first steal a chicken do you need anything else the first guard asked if that wasnt a hint for anielewicz to clear out hed never heard one no i thank you for your time he said and made his way back across the bialut market square these days he was always in the habit of keeping an eye open for possible assassins amazing what a burst of submachinegun fire through the door would do now though he also kept an eye out for befflem and tsiongyu he wouldnt have known a tsiongi if it walked up and bit him not really but any sort of alien animal that wasnt a beffel would do for one till he knew better no doubt because he was on the lookout for the races pets he saw none as he went back to the flat all the way there though he kept thinking about how the beffel had laid up that cat cats were tough not many earthly animals their size could take them on and win what did that say about how rugged other beasts from home were liable to be did it say anything at all nobody could predict a cow from a cat so why was he trying to figure out what the races equivalent of a cow would be like from extremely brief acquaintance with a beffel then he paused smiling in spite of himself the lizardy creature had squeaked most endearingly he wondered what sort of pet a beffel would make for a human being would it accept a person as a master or would it think he was a large fearsome wild animal his son heinrich would like to know the answer to that question too heinrich couldnt see a stray dog without saying can we keep it the answer in a flat none too big for the people who lived in it was inevitably no but that didnt keep him from asking over supperchicken soup with dumplingsmordechai talked about the beffel sure enough heinrich exclaimed what a greatsounding animal i want one can we get one father before anielewicz could answer heinrichs older sister miriam said a thing that looks like a little lizard thats disgusting i dont want anything that looks like a lizard here she made a horrible face a beffel looks about as much like a lizard as a cat or a dog looks like a person its about so longmordechai held his hands thirty or forty centimeters apartand goes on all fours like a regular lizardnot like one of the race i mean his daughter sounded no happier thats even worse no not like a regular lizard either anielewicz said sort of like what a dog or a cat would be if a dog or a cat had scales and eye turrets predictably that entranced heinrich and even interested his older brother david but left miriam cold theres no point in worrying about these creatures now bertha anielewicz said spreading warning looks all around we dont have them and as far as we know we cant get them we dont even knowshe eyed heinrichif wed want one i know her younger son exclaimed youve never even seen one bertha said but that was the wrong way to go about things and mordechai knew it for now i dont think people can have befflem so theres nothing we can do about that he told heinrich anyhow i just saw this one by luck i dont know if ill ever see another one so theres no point worrying about it is there if i find one can i keep it heinrich asked i dont think youre going to his mother said but all right heinrich grinned from ear to ear bertha looked confident mordechai wished she would have given him the chance to speak first but she hadnt and now they were both stuck with her answer kassquit was as happy as the anomalous combination of her birth and her upbringing let her be she hadnt fully realized how much she missed ttomalss till he returned from the greater german reich of all the males of the race he came closer to understanding her than any other having him around having him here to talk to was far better than staying in touch by telephone and electronic message in a way though he said as they sat down together in the starships refectory my absence may well have helped you mature you might not have confronted tessrek had i been here for instance instead you would have left the disagreeable task to me but you did it and did it well only because i had to answered kassquit who would indeed have preferred not to confront a male of superior years and rank exactly my point ttomalss picked up his tray and now i hope you will excuse me i have many reports to organize and write my stay among the deutsche proved most informative if not always very pleasant i understand superior sir kassquit did her best to hide her disappointment she was not a hatchling any more and could not hope to monopolize ttomalss time as she had when she was smaller and more nearly helpless she could not hope to but she could wish after ttomalss left she finished her meal in a hurry she did not enjoy the company of large numbers of the race seeing so many males and females together always acutely reminded her of how different she was back inside her cubicle she was simply herself and did not need to make comparisons she was simply herself on the electronic network too what she looked like what she sounded like didnt matter there only her wit matteredand that she had seen was a match for those of most males and females no wonder she spent so much time in front of the screen then she was heading toward the area where males and females discussed the new generation of the race that had been hatched on tosev when the telephone attachment hissed for attention with a sigh she arrested her progress on the network and activated the phone connection kassquit speaking i greet you and i greet you superior female no image appeared on the screen the conversations remained voiceonly the male on the other end of the linea male with a voice of odd timbrewent on i needed to do a little of this and a little of that before i was able to call you but i managed who is this kassquit asked in some annoyance whoever he was he had a very strange voice not only deeper than it had any business being but also mushy as if he were talking with his mouth full what he said and somehow managed to make his interrogative cough sound sarcastic you mean you do not recognize the voice of your old notquitefriend the senior tube inspector ice and fire chased each other through kassquit oh by the emperor she whispered and cast down her eyes you are a tosevite she was talking with a wild big ugly somehow hed found her telephone code and arranged access to a phone connected to the races communication system i sure am answered the big ugly male she thought of as regeya i bet you could tell the instant i opened my mouth i cannot make some of your sounds the way his voice trailed off with dull horror kassquit knew what was coming next regeya was no fool hed heard her speak she reached for the recessed key that would break the connection but her hand faltered and stopped the tongue was out of the mouth any which way if the worst was coming she might as well hear it and it was in slow wonder regeya went on you have trouble with the same sounds i do are you by any chance a tosevite yourself kassquit kassquit thought she spoke much better than the wild big ugly not only did he have trouble with some of the pops and special hisses of the races tongue but he also spoke it with an odd syntax and accent shadows no doubt of his own tosevite language but that had nothing to do with anything i am a full citizen of the empire she answered proudly despite the pride it was an evasion and regeya recognized as much you did not answer my question he said are you a tosevite he answered it himself you must be but how did it happen what made you throw in your lot with the race he thought she was a tosevite traitor as some males of the race from the conquest fleet had turned traitor after the big uglies captured them she proceeded to disabuse him of the notion i would not be anything but a citizen of the empire she declared the race has raised me since earliest hatchlinghood regeya said something in his own language that she didnt understand then let out several barking yips of tosevite laughter when at last he returned to the language of the race his only comment was is that a fact yes it is a fact kassquit said with more than a little irritation why in the name of the emperorcalling on him made her feel more securewould i waste my time lying to you you are on the surface of tosev while i orbit above it since you must remain there what can you possibly do to me shed nipped the big uglys pride but not quite as shed expected i have been farther from tosev than you he answered for i have walked on the surface of the moon so i might visit you one day i hope not was the first thought that went through kassquits mind the idea of coming face to face with a wild big ugly terrified and horrified her nor would she tolerate regeyas scoring points off her you may have gone from tosev to its moon she said but the race has come from its sun to the star tosev well that is a truth the big ugly admitted pretty proud of the empire eh that last grunt was almost an interrogative cough in its own right i am part of it why should i not feel pride in it kassquit said all rightsomething to that too regeya said how old are you kassquit how old were you when the race took you from the female who bore you i was taken away when i was newly hatched kassquit answered had i been brought up as a big ugly even in part i would have had more trouble becoming as fully a part of the race as i have the male who raised me began the project not long after the fighting stopped so you would be close to twenty now regeya said half to himself kassquit began to correct him but then realized he naturally reckoned by tosevite years rather than those of the race laughing again he went on well well quite a head start kassquit didnt know what that meant regeya was still talking did the male who raised you tell you that you were not his first attempt oh yes kassquit replied at once he had to return one hatchling to the tosevites because of political considerations and was kidnapped while seeking to obtain another with me however he succeeded as much as he could as much as anyone could she thought but she would not let the big ugly see what lay in her mind he was honest with you at any rate that is something regeya said and you may be interested to know that i have met the tosevite whom your male released she is a normal young adult female in most ways except that her face has no motion in it to speak of neither has mine kassquit said here among the race that is of small account yes i suppose it would be regeya said it is different among us big uglies he wasnt shy about using the races nickname for hisand kassquitskind you may also be interested to know that shethis other femaleis one of the leaders in the rebellion against the race in china no that does not interest me at all kassquit answered in the long run rebellions will not matter all of tosev will become part of the empire males and females will be proud citizens as i am that is possible the big ugly on the other end of the line said which surprised her he went on but i do not think it is certain our kindby which to kassquits annoyance he had to mean his and hersis different from the race in important ways for instance we are sexually receptive all the time and the race is not do you not agree that that is an important difference how do you deal with it there by yourself none of your business kassquit snapped she felt blood rising to her face as it did when she was embarrassed having continuous sexuality among beings who did not was extremely embarrassing she had learned that stroking her private parts brought relief from the tension that sometimes threatened to overwhelm her but shed been humiliated to find out ttomalss knew what she did even if he intellectually understood her need she wished she were like the race in that regard but she wasnt to her relief regeya did not press her he said i am going to go now i am using a telephone at the races consulate in los angeles and it is expensive for me if you want to get in touch with me again my name is sam yeager i decided to call just to say hello i tell you the truth when i say that i had no ideal would be speaking with another tosevite i am not a tosevite not in the same sense you are kassquit said once more with considerable pride as i told you i am a citizen of the empire and glad of it now she broke the connection she did not think it would offend the big uglythe other big uglyfor sam yeager not regeya had already said he was going a wild tosevite her hand moved in the gesture of negation the two of them might be similar genetically but in no other way his accent his alien way of looking at things made that perfectly clear but in some ways genetics and genetic predispositions did matter regeya had for instance unerringly focused on her sexuality as an important difference between herself and the race ttomalss looking at the issue from the other side of the divide had proved far less perceptive kassquit wondered what the big ugly looked like it does not matter she told herself he probably had hair all over his head which would make him even uglier than tosevites had to be his face would be snoutless his skin scaleless he could not help being ugly given all that but she remained curious about the details on the telephone he seemed much as he did in his electronic messages clever and possessed of a quirky wit very different from the way males and females of the race thought she should have despised him for being what he was she tried but could not do it he intrigued her too much he is a relation she thought in a way he is the closest relation with whom i have ever spoken she shivered though the air in her chamber was not cold or even cool it was adjusted to the warmth the race found comfortable shed never known air of a different temperature shed never known anyone but males and females of the race eithernot till now she hadnt she shivered again over lamb chops and carrots and mashed potatoes jonathan yeager listened to his father in fascination thats amazing he said theyre holding her prisoner up there and she doesnt even know she is one his father shook his head are mickey and donald prisoners no jonathan said were raising them to see how much like people theyll turn into theyre guinea pigs i guess but theyre not shoveling in another forkful of potatoes let him make the pause less awkward than it might have been otherwise okay i see where youre going the girl up there is a guinea pig too his mother said thats right now his father nodded twenty years ago the lizards started doing what were doing now i wonder what sort of experiments theyve run on her he sipped from a glass of lucky lager makes me think twice about what were doing with the baby lizardsseeing the shoe on the other foot i mean it certainly does jonathans mother said that poor girlbrought up to be as much like a lizard as she could she shuddered if shes not completely out of her mind its gods own miracle she sounded sensible enough his father said she doesnt know what being a human is like what bothers her most i think is that she cant be as much like the racelike the rest of the race shed probably sayas shed like if thats not crazy what is his mother returned his father took another sip of beer in much the same way as jonathan had eaten those mashed potatoes we ought to set her free jonathan exclaimed the idea blazed in him wethe united states i meanought to tell the fleetlord we know theyve got her and they have to let her go he expected his mother and father to catch fire too instead they looked at each other and then at him i dont think that would be a good idea jonathan his mother said after a moment what why not he demanded if id been living up there all this time id sure want to be free no his father shook his head in a way that could only mean he was ready to lock horns on this one if youd been living up there all this time youd want what kassquit wants to be more like a lizard you play games about imitating the race with her its not a game its the real thing jonathan started to get angry at that a couple of years earlier he would have for sure his old man had a lot of damn nerve saying his study of the race was only a game but he had to admit trying to live like the lizards wasnt the same as never having seen never even having talked to another human being in his life well maybe he said grudginglyfrom him a large concession his father must have seen that hed been on the point of blowing up because he leaned across the kitchen table and set a hand on jonathans for a moment youre growing up he said which almost caused trouble again because jonathan was convinced hed already grown up but then his dad said something that distracted him besides if you look at it the right way kassquits our ace in the hole huh jonathan said i dont follow that either his mother added with a pointed look at jonathan she went on im more polite about the way i say it though his father grinned he always did when he put one over on jonathans mom not least because he didnt do that very often he said suppose the race finds out weve got mickey and donald what will the fleetlord do scream his head off thats what and probably tell us to give em back before he sends in the lizard marines oh i get it jonathan said excitedly i get it thats hot dad if he says give em back we can answer why should i youve had this girl for years his old man could be sneaky no two ways about it but jonathans mother said i dont like that sam it turns the girl into nothing but a pawn hon we both just told jonathan that kassquits never ever going to have a normal life or anything close to it his father said shes been the lizards pawn ever since they got hold of her if she turns out to be our pawn too whats so bad about that i dont know his mother answered her gaze went down the hail toward mickey and donalds room its different somehow thinking of that being done to a human being rather than a lizard thats what the race would say too mom except theyd put it the other way round jonathan said hes not wrong hon his father said his mother still didnt look happy but she finally nodded his father went on and speaking of mickey and donald he got up from the table and put his dishes in the sink then pulled a knife from the drawer next to it and opened the refrigerator time they had their supper too jonathan also got up ill feed em dad if you want me to thanks his father nodded im glad you help with the chores around here believe me i am but ill take care of this i was the one who got ordered to raise them after all so i will well ill come along if thats okay jonathan said i like lizards in case you hadnt noticed he tapped himself on the chest with the weather warm he didnt bother wearing a shirt this week his body paint declared him an electronic instruments repairmale his father paused while slicing corned beef jonathan sometimes thought the hatchlings ate better than he did but then the government paid for all their food while his folks had to shell out for what went down his throat sure come right ahead be good for the little guys to know people visit sometimes that we arent just the gravy train as they walked down the hall toward the lizards room jonathan asked arent you going to shut that door hmm oh yeah his dad did but then said it wont be too long or i hope it wont before we dont have to do that any more well be able to start letting them loose in the house i hope we will anyhow you dont think theyll rip the furniture to ribbons jonathan said mom wont be real happy if they do well neither will iweve talked about that his father answered as he opened the door to mickey and donalds room but heck you can teach a cat to use a scratching postmost of the time anyhowso i figure we can probably teach these guys to do the same thing theyre smarter than cats thats for darn sure the hatchlings had been playing some sort of game with a red rubber ballan active one by the way they stopped and stood there panting when jonathan and his father came in the ball was about golfball size a human baby would have stuck it in his mouth and likely choked to death jonathan wouldnt have known something like that for himself but his parents both insisted it was true mickey and donald were different though unlike human babies they knew from the very beginning what was food and what wasnt at need they could catch their own donald did something with the ball no cat could he picked it up and threw it at jonathan jonathan tried to catch it but it bounced off his hand and away both donald and mickey sprang after it his father clicked his tongue between his storebought teeth have to score that one an error son yeah i know jonathan said in mild annoyance he was sure that had the baby lizard thrown the ball at his father he would have caught it even though he had only one free hand jonathan was stronger than his dad these days but he still wasnt half the ballplayer his father was that got under his skin when he let himself think about it but he preferred thinking about mickey and donald come and get it his father told them and they didnt waste much time abandoning the ball for corned beef he and jonathan both talked to them and with each other letting them get used to the idea of language jonathans dad always called that turning to jonathan he remarked they arent stupidtheyre just different uhhuh jonathan could get away with grunts and even split infinitives around his father where his mother would come down on him like a ton of bricks he sometimes wondered if his dad found talking around his mom hard too but that wasnt anything he could ask instead he pointed to mickey who had a little shred of corned beef hanging from one corner of his mouth and said youre a little pig you know that one of the hatchlings eye turrets swung to follow his pointing finger it might have been danger or so evolution warned mickeys other eye kept watching jonathans father who at the moment emphatically was the source of all blessing sure enough he offered mickey another strip of corned beef and the little lizard leaped forward to take it i wonder what he and donald will be like in twenty years jonathans father said and then more than half to himself i wonder if ill be around to see it jonathan had no idea how to respond to that last sentence and so he didnt he said i wonder what thatkassquit was that her name is like now shed be somewhere close to my age wouldnt she maybe a little youngershe said the lizards got her after the fighting stopped his father answered shes smartno two ways around that but as for the rest i just dont know pretty strange she cant help that id like to talk with her myself jonathan said it would be interesting he used an emphatic cough forgetting he wasnt supposed to do that around mickey and donald dont know if i could arrange it his father said in tones suggesting he had no intention of trying but then his gaze sharpened you know it might not be so bad if i could though especially with the video hooked up you look like a lizard you know what i mean or as much as a person can that might make her feel easier jonathan agreed and then what does she look like his father laughed i dont know she didnt have her video on either okay okay i just asked thats all but jonathan was glad karen hadnt been around to hear that question she wouldnt have taken it the right way he was sure of that women are so unreasonable he thought and never stopped to wonder how he would have felt had she asked whether some man was goodlooking donald and mickey were both looking at his father sorry boys sam yeager told them thats all there isthere aint no more he winked at jonathan as if to say he knew he was putting one over on jonathans mother by using bad grammar behind her back the baby lizards didnt understand anything about that but theyd put away enough corned beef that they werent too disappointed not to get any more byebye jonathan said to them and waved his father echoed him with word and gesture and a little tentatively a little awkwardly the hatchlings waved back even a couple of weeks before they hadnt known to do that excitement tingled through jonathan the lizards couldnt talk heaven only knew when they would but theyd started to communicate without words slowly ttomalss said tell me slowly about the conversation you had with this big ugly he was most careful not to say with this other big ugly it shall be done superior sir kassquit said but a moment later she was babbling again her words falling over one another in their eagerness to come forth ttomalss tried to decide whether that eagerness sprang from glee at surviving the encounter or from kassquits desire to talk with the tosevitethe other tosevite again as soon as she got the chance he couldnt i shall have to check the recording of the conversation myself the researcher thought kassquit didnt know her telephone was constantly monitored ttomalss knew he would have to take care not to reveal any undue knowledge that would destroy kassquits spontaneity and lessen her value as an experimental subject when she finally slowed down ttomalss asked her and how do you feel about this encounter her face unlike those of big uglies raised by their own kind revealed little of what she thought that made her seem a little less alien to ttomalss after a pause for thought she said i do not precisely know superior sir in some ways he seemed to understand me remarkably well like calls to like ttomalss thought but he did not say it for fear of putting thoughts in kassquits mind that she hadnt had for herself what he did say was more cautious in some ways you say but not in all oh no superior sir not in all kassquit answered how could that be possible i have been raised among the race while he is only a wild big ugly unmistakable pride rang in her voice ttomalss understood that he wouldnt have wanted to be a wild big ugly either he asked are you interested in holding further conversations with thiswhat did you say the tosevites name was sam yeager kassquit naturally pronounced the alien syllables more clearly than ttomalss could have done yes superior sir i think i amor willing at any rate you have spoken of me as a link between the race and the tosevites i know the races side of this link well except for my biology though i know next to nothing about the tosevite side her ignorance was deliberate on ttomalss part hed wanted to integrate her as fully into the race as he could now it was time to see how well hed done but something else sprang to mind first sam yeager he said knowing he was botching the name but wanting to bring it out as well as he could that is somehow familiar why is it somehow familiar i do not know superior sir kassquit answered it was not familiar to me but ttomalss hadnt asked the question of her not really hed been talking to himself he went over to his computer terminal and keyed in the name the answer came back almost at once i thought so he exclaimed skimming through the information on the screen this yeager is one of the big uglies leading experts on the race and has done considerable writing and speaking on the subject as if the big uglies could have experts on the race kassquit said scornfully they seek to learn about us as we seek to learn about them ttomalss answered i am in some measure an expert on tosevites so this big ugly may be my counterpart in the notempire known as the united states after some thought kassquit made the affirmative gesture it could be so she said he appeared on our computer network for some time without drawing suspicion no one with only a little familiarity with the race could have done that truth ttomalss said he would not have cared to try to impersonate a big ugly even if only electronically in his way then he too may be a link between the tosevites and the race perhaps further conversations between you may indeed be of value i am glad you are willing to hold them i suppose i am kassquit agreed we must make arrangements before we can do that of course his telephone is not fully integrated into our network he came to our consulate in his city to call me i can exchange messages with him by computer but that is not quite the same thing noit lacks immediacy ttomalss agreed but it will do to set up a time for another conversation feel free to make those arrangements very well superior sir kassquit assumed the posture of respect i depart she left his compartment ducking her head a little to get out through the doorway ttomalss wondered if he ought to get in touch with this yeager himself after the deutsche a tosevite who showed some understanding of the race would prove a refreshing change in the end though he refrained let kassquit handle it he thought best to learn how she will fare in this new situation she had the right of it he had brought her up as a link between the wild tosevites and the empire between tosev s past and its future an unused link was useless and it was very interesting indeed that the big uglies were developing links of their own to the race ttomalss spoke into the computer the tosevites consistently demonstrate coping skills far superior to those the rabotevs and the hallessi showed after their initial contact with the race this no doubt hatches from the intense competition among groups of big uglies prior to the arrival of the race the tosevites have come to view us as if we were one more of their notempires dangerous to them but not necessarily of overwhelming superiority he stabbed out a fingerclaw and turned off the recording mechanism nevertheless he continued speaking out loud it helped him put his thoughts in order and how do the tosevites coping skills compare to those of the race unless i am badly mistaken they outdo us to the same degree as they do the rabotevs and hallessi they are used to dealing with powerful rivals and to adapting themselves to changing circumstances both these things are unfamiliar to us or were unfamiliar to us before we came to tosev he sighed that was if anything an understatement back on home and throughout the empire the race viewed change with active suspicion it occurred slowly over centuries so that it was rarely visible in the course of a male or females lifetime things werent like that on tosev another understatement with the recorder still off ttomalss continued and the big uglies have had an altogether unexpected influence on the race because the tosevites have proved so strong and so quick to change they have forced the males of the conquest fleet to become far more changeable than is our norm this is also proving true for the males and females of the conquest fleet but to a lesser degree indeed the difference in outlook between veterans of tosev and the far more numerous newcomers has caused considerable friction between the two groups hed seen that firsthand not least in his dealings with felless she had learned a good deal since her revival but still did not really appreciate just how changeable the big uglies were because she was not very changeable herself except when shed tasted ginger ginger ttomalss muttered before he said anything else he checked to make sure he truly had turned off the recorder talking about ginger was nearly as dangerous as talking about explosive metal once hed satisfied himself no one but he would ever hear his words he went on ginger is another change agent here on tosev that was true before the colonization fleet came but it is even more true now thanks to the herbs effects on females tosev disrupts even our sexuality pushing us closer to tosevite norms this will have profound consequences for the relationship between this world and the rest of the empire for a very long time to come no he couldnt have said any of that in a place where it might have become public from things hed gathered down at the embassy to the reich discussions on these subjects were under way at the highest levels if the fleetlords and shiplords and ambassadors wanted his opinions they would ask for them his title might be senior researcher but he was not senior enough to offer his views unsolicited nor would those above him be delighted if his unsolicited views went out over the computer network he sighed hierarchy and concern for status were and always had been hallmarks of the race back on home where everyone played by the rules they worked fine and contributed to the stability of society on tosev here ttomalss feared they made the race less adaptable than it should have been adaptable he muttered coping skills the race shouldnt have had to adapt it shouldnt have had to cope the big uglies should have been the ones doing all the coping by now they should have accepted the conquest they should have been learning the language of the race in place of their own multitude of tongues they should have begun to venerate the emperor as ttomalss did himself instead they stubbornly preferred their own superstitions some of them even presumed to mock the veneration of emperors past even if it had served the race well for a hundred thousand years and more and the rabotevs and hallessi since they were conquered ttomalss hissed angrily remembering the arrogant dr rascher in the reich out shot his fingerclaw again this was for the record my view is that we should go forward as aggressively as possible with programs to acquaint the big uglies with the spiritual benefits of emperor veneration bringing them to a belief system more congruent to the truth than are their own superstitions can only help in assimilating them into the empire with an emphatic cough he turned off the recorder once more that opinion needed to get into the races data stream he felt so strongly about it he added an emphatic cough the sooner fanatics like khomeini could no longer use the local superstitions to rouse the big uglies against the race the better and then ttomalss had an inspiration he turned on the recorder for the third time economic incentives he said getting the main idea out and then amplified it if tosevites are taxed for the privilege of continuing to adhere to their native superstitions but not if they agree to venerate the spirits of emperors past the truth will be more readily propagated among them almost of itself his hand shaped the affirmative gesture if adhering to their superstitions cost the tosevites under the races rule money they would be more inclined to drop those superstitions and adopt the correct usages that prevailed on the other three planets of the empire they would not be compelled to do so which was apt to spark fanatical resistance they would simply come to see it was in their own best interest to conform to standard practice how splendidly devious ttomalss said what better way to get rid of superstition than to tax it out of existence now he was going to have to look for males and females in positions of authority to support his scheme he wanted to skitter with glee and excitement he hadnt had such a good idea since hed decided to raise a tosevite hatchling among the race then he remembered what had happened to him after he took his second hatchling he was lucky liu han hadnt murdered him after his kidnapping but surely the big uglies would not get so excited about taxes as they did about their own offspring gorppet liked baghdad no more than hed liked basra if anything he liked it less than hed liked basra because it was a bigger city with more big uglies in it and all of those big uglies were united in their hatred of the race his squad always moved together that was a standard order in baghdad males could not travel these narrow winding streets by ones and twos they simply disappeared when they did disappeared or were ambushed and slain whole squads had perished that way too gorppet didnt like to dwell on that how do we tell what is a street and what is not betvoss asked peevishlyhe could always find something to complain about with so much rubble strewn everywhere what used to be streets and what used to be houses look the same just follow me gorppet answered and pressed on he had trouble telling streets from houses too but wasnt about to admit it he picked what looked like the easiest route through the cratered landscape his eye turrets tried to look every which way at once the rubble showed that the big uglies had fought hard hereabouts enough was left standing to give their diehards lots of hiding places too and there were plenty of diehards someone had scrawled something in the sinuous local script on a whitewashed stretch of mudbrick wall that hadnt been knocked down what does that say superior sir one of gorppets troopers asked spirits of emperors past turn their backs on me if i know he answered ive learned to speak some of this miserable languagearabic they call itbut i cant read a word each sound has one character if it is at the beginning of a word another one in the middle and still another if it is at the end more trouble than it is worth it probably just says allahu akbar anyhow betvoss said i do not think these tosevites know how to say anything else shoutstosevite shoutscame from ahead gorppet swung his rifle toward them we advancecautiously he said he envisioned all sorts of dire possibilities as he took advantage of piled rubble to climb up and see what was going on without exposing most of himself to gunfire what is it superior sir even betvoss sounded anxious anyone who wanted another fight with the big uglies was addled or so gorppet thought he reckoned betvoss addled all right but not so addled as that and then when he could see what was going on he laughed in relief nothing but a pack of tosevites kicking a ball around a flat stretch of ground he said we can go on kicking a ball around was the big uglies favorite sport hereabouts it was from what gorppet had heard the big uglies favorite sport in almost all the lands the race ruled gorppet couldnt see much point to it himself but thenthe emperor be praised he was no big ugly the tosevites looked up warily as he and his comrades approached go on he said in the guttural local language play we do not trouble you if you do not trouble us if the big uglies did feel like causing trouble but one of them spoke in the language of the race it is good he said the same thing in arabic so his fellow tosevites would understand they started kicking the ball again their robes flapping as they ran after it still wary gorppet led his males past the big uglies but they were intent on their sport and paid the squad little attention gorppet wondered how many of them had been fighting hereabouts till the race brought in enough soldiers to reduce the latest uprising from boil to sizzle quite a few unless he missed his guess as if getting by the pack of tosevites were a good omen the rest of the patrol also went smoothly gorppet brought his squad through the perimeter of razor wire and back to the barracks without any untoward incidents if only it were this easy all the time he said it probably means the big uglies are plotting something betvoss said gorppet wished he could quarrel with that but he couldnt as things turned out the race was plotting something an officer harangued the patrol leaders one of our experts on the big uglies has come up with a way to bring them round toward reverencing the spirits of emperors pastmaking them pay if they do anything else we are ordered to collect coins outside the houses of their superstition if they do not pay they are not to be admitted gorppet stuck out his tongue calling for attention when the officer granted him leave to speak he said superior sir do you mean to say that we are becoming tax collectors rather than soldiers we are becoming tax collectors and soldiers the officer replied and gorppet realized the fellows fancy body paint didnt keep him from being very unhappy about the orders hed received i do not say this will be easy for i do not believe that for a moment but it is what we are required to do and so it shall be done superior sir have you any idea what the big uglies are likely to do if we try to make them pay before we let them enter the houses of their superstition gorppet demanded he had such an idea and did not care for it at all we are also going to move a landcruiser or mechanized combat vehicle up before each of the said houses by tomorrow morning the officer answered which proved he did indeed have some idea the way he ignored the nearly insubordinate tone of gorppets questioning proved the same thing he went on this policy you must understand is not regional in scope it shall be done over all the areas of tosev under the races rule the sooner the big uglies begin venerating the spirits of emperors past as we do the sooner they will become contented citizens of the empire gorppet supposed that made sense at least in the long run the race habitually thought in terms of the long run and had succeeded by pursuing longterm strategies until tosev such strategies might yet succeed here too but they were apt to end up unpleasant for the poor males who had to put them into motion right at the moment another squad leader had to be thinking along those same lines for he said i expect we can count on khomeini and the other fanatics to exploit our policy to the greatest possible degree i think that is likely to be truth the officer agreed unhappily we shall have to see whether the results of the policy justify the difficulties it will bring with it we are all veterans here every single male from the conquest fleet we know our dealings with the tosevites are full of experiments and improvisations maybe this one will work maybe it will not we shall have to wait and see he made a peremptory gesture you males are dismissed so much for being veterans together gorppet thought he went back to the barracks and told the males of his squad what the new plan was none of them had much to say about it betvoss was too startledperhaps too appalledeven to complain an orderly came by with the locale of the house of superstition to which the squad was assigned that confirmed gorppets words and left everyone glummer than ever when morning came all the males made sure they were carrying plenty of ammunition they also made sure their body armor did the best possible job of covering their vitals it might not hold out a highpowered bullet but it was the best hope they had to gorppets relief the house of superstition where his squad had to collect fees wasnt far from the barracks the troopers got there just before sunrise a landcruiser had already arrived which made the squad leader feel better he devoutly hoped its immense bulk and formidable gun would make the big uglies think twice about any trouble a tosevite in wrappings and head cloth was expostulating at the landcruiser commander who stood up in his cupola watching and waiting that male either spoke no arabic or preferred to pretend he didnt the big ugly rounded on gorppet what are you doing here he demanded collecting money gorppet answered if your males and females do not pay half a dinar each they do not go in half a dinar the big ugly howled half a dinar at each of five daily prayers you will make beggars of us i have my orders gorppet said stolidly he gestured with his rifle barrel toward the landcruiser i have the power to make orders good you are wicked the great satan will burn you in the fires of hell forever the big ugly said why do you torment us why do you persecute us as far as gorppet was concerned tosevites tormented the race far more than the other way round before he could say as much amplified screeches from the towers at the corners of the house of superstitions summoned the local big uglies to the days first petitions to the imaginary allpowerful big ugly beyond the sky gorppet positioned his males in the entranceway since he knew more arabic than the others he made the announcement half a dinar to go inside if you do not pay go home and venerate the spirits of emperors past his fellow males backed him up with rifles aimed at the big uglies coming to worship the landcruiser backed him up with its cannon and machine gun and intimidating massiveness despite all that he thought he would have to start firing into the building crowd the tosevites screamed and cursed and waved their arms in the air and jumped up and down but they had been taken by surprise and had not thought to bring firearms to the house of superstition some of them threw down coins or fluttering pieces of paper also in circulation as money gorppet wasnt sure all of those payments were halfdinars he didnt check very closely any payment was enough to satisfy him he used the barrel of his rifle to beckon into the house of superstition those who gave money of any sort some of the others kept angrily milling about others headed back toward their homes he hoped they were relieved to have an excuse to go away and were not going to return later with weapons rather to his surprise the big uglies didnt start shooting betvoss said well we got away with it i would not have believed that we could we got away with it this time gorppet said these tosevites come here to pray five times a day remember we are going to have to charge them this fee every time they come who knows how long they will tolerate it he sighed if only they would venerate the spirits of emperors past life would be easier for us truth betvoss said but they have all these houses for their own superstition and none for the truth how can we expect them to venerate the emperors if they have nowhere to do it gorppet stared at the other male in surprise like any malcontent betvoss was full of ideas as with any malcontent most of them were bad but this one struck gorppet as quite good he said you ought to pass that along to the authorities betvoss it might get you a bonus or a promotion if it got betvoss a bonus that might improve his sour attitude stranger things had happenedon tosev plenty of stranger things had happened and if it got betvoss a promotion gorppet wouldnt have to worry about him any more gorppet swiveled his eye turrets this way and that he wouldnt have to worry about much of anythingnot till the next call for worship at this house of superstition anyhow along with his family reuven russie walked toward the synagogue a few blocks away for friday evening services he was less devout than his parents and sometimes felt guilty about it theyd suffered because of their judaism even before the nazis invaded poland for him being a jew had been pretty easy through most of his life the lizards generally preferred jews to muslims he wondered if his faith needed strengthening in the fire of persecution on the other hand judith and esther took their belief more seriously than he did his and theyd never been persecuted at all they chattered with their mother as the family rounded the last corner on the way to the synagogue maybe they just hadnt yet been exposed to the flood of secular knowledge hed acquired but his father was full of secular knowledge too and still believed reuven scratched his head plainly he didnt understand everything that was going on moishe russie pointed toward a crowd of jews gathered in front of the synagogue that was unusual hello he said i wonder whats going on whatever it was a lot of people were excited angry shouts in yiddish and hebrew reached reuvens ears rivka russie pointed too look she said theres a lizard standing in front of the entrance whats he doing there maybe he wants to convert esther said judith giggled reuven leaned toward his father and murmured how would we circumcise him moishe russie let out a strangled snort he waggled a reproachful finger at reuven but his heart wasnt in the gesture it was the sort of joke any doctor or medical student might have made as reuven got closer to the synagogue the shouting began turning into intelligible words an outrage someone cried an imposition someone else exclaimed we wont put up with this a woman warned shrilly reproach filled a mans voice after all weve done for you the lizardwho was armed and wearing body armorkept speaking hissing hebrew i have my orders i cannot go against my orders what are your orders reuven asked in the language of the race pushing through the crowd toward the doorway as hed hoped the male responded to hearing his own tongue perhaps you will explain it to these tosevites better than i can he replied my orders are that no one may enter this house of superstition without first paying five hundred mills half a pound reuven exclaimed why what is the purpose of this order how can i explain it if i do not understand it it is to reduce superstition the lizard told him if you tosevites have to pay a tax to gather together to celebrate what is not true the hope is that you will turn toward the veneration of the spirits of emperors past which is true a woman grabbed at reuvens arm whats he saying she demanded reuven translated the males words they brought a fresh storm of protest some of the language in which the protest was couched made esther and judith exclaim whether in horror or in admiration reuven couldnt quite tell a tax on religion someone said who ever heard of a tax on religion but an old man with a white beard answered i came to palestine when the turks still ruled here they used to tax jews and christians too only muslims got off without paying understanding that the lizard said we tax muslims too we tax all who do not venerate the emperors theyre trying to convert us a woman said indignantly the lizard understood that too and made the negative hand gesture you may follow your superstition he said if you do though you have to pay moishe russie took out his wallet i am going to pay he said and gave the male a twopound note and another worth five hundred mills this is for all my family pass on the lizard said and stood aside to let the russies into the synagogue reuven discovered they were not the first to go in he and his father sat on the right side of the aisle his mother and sisters on the left all the conversation among men on the one side and women on the other was about the tax how will poor jews pay it a fat man asked it is not a small fee maybe we can get the race to lower it reuvens father said if we cant the rest of the congregation will have to pay for the jews who cant pay for themselves how could we spend money in a way more pleasing to god the fat man didnt look as if he wanted to spend money at all whether it pleased god or not reuven set a hand on his fathers arm im proud of you he said moishe russie shrugged if we dont help one another whos going to help us the answer is nobody weve seen that too many times over too many hundreds of years we have to take care of our own a couple of rows in front of the russies a scholarly looking man with a fuzzy gray beard was saying the romans worshiped their emperors too they didnt try to make the jews do it the lizards arent trying to make us worship their emperors either somebody else answered theyre just trying to make it expensive for us if we dont true enough the man who looked like a scholar nodded but that wasnt quite my point who worships dead roman emperors nowadays reuven burst out laughing he couldnt help himself there we go he exclaimed well convert all the lizards to judaism and then we wont have to worry about paying the tax any more that got a laugh even from his father but the graybearded man said and why not hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one that doesnt say what he looks like he doesnt look like anything he is as much the lizards god as he is ours nothing holds them back from becoming jews we dont talk about god having a human son reuven almost repeated the crack about circumcising lizards but held his tongue it didnt seem to fit not inside the synagogue thoughtfully his father said they could become muslims as easily as jews that brought on a glum silence no one liked the idea at all the scholarly looking man said they could but they wont not as long as the muslims keep rising against them and pretty plainly they want us to forget our own religions and worship their emperors that would make it easier for them to rule us politics and religion moishe russie said religion and politics they shouldnt mix trouble is too often they do he sighed for a while here we just got to worship as we pleased i suppose it was too good to last before anyone could say anything to that the rabbi and the cantor took their places at the front of the congregation singing in the welcome for the sabbath made reuven forget about the tax his father had paid to enter the synagogue for a little while anyhow but after the service was over after reuven and his father rejoined his mother and twin sisters he said if the muslims have to pay half a pound five times a day all the rioting weve been through so far is going to look like nothing in particular this town will go up like a rocket we have enough groceries to last a while his mother said weve been through this before we can do it again even if the riots will be worse whatever the arabs do they cant be worse than the nazis were in warsaw thats true reuvens father agreed and added an emphatic cough for good measure i thought the reich would have fallen apart from its own wickedness by now but i was wrong back when we were living in london that fellow named eric blair who used to broadcast with me called the nazis and the russians a boot in the face of mankind forever i used to think he was too gloomy but im not so sure any more you mention him every now and then reuven said do you know what happened to him after we left england hes deadten or fifteen years now moishe russie answered which took reuven by surprise his father went on tuberculosis he had that particular soft cough even back when i knew himbut as far as i know he never let it get in the way of his broadcasting he sighed its too bad he would still have been a young man and he was one of the most honest people i ever met they walked on through the quiet streets back toward their house moths fluttered around street lamps the days heat had faded the night air made reuven glad he had on a sweater a mosquito landed on his hand he slapped at it but it buzzed away before he could squash it when the muezzins call for prayer tomorrow morning he began well find out what happens his father said no point to borrowing trouble we get enough of it anyhow because the next morning was saturday reuven didnt have classes the race thought humanitys sevenday cycle absurd but had given up trying to impose their own tenday rhythm on the medical college weekend was an english word the lizards had had to borrow their custom was to rotate rest days through the week so ninety percent of them were busy at any given time they reckoned the muslim friday day of rest the jewish saturday and the christian sunday equally inefficient reuven slept through the amplified sunrise calls to prayer from mosques in the muslim districts of jerusalem and no gunfire awakened him either he ate bread and honey for breakfast and washed it down with a glass of milk the relief he felt at the silence in the city was sweeter than the honey though it didnt last hed hoped it would but hadnt expected it to not down deep he and his family were heading toward saturday morning services when as the call to prayer drifted in from the muslim districts gunfire rang out not just rifles but automatic weapons and a moment later cannon moishe russie stopped in his tracks we go back he said and his tone brooked no contradiction god only knows what the streets will be like when services are done and i dont care to find out by experiment god will also know why we didnt go to shul this morning rivka russie agreed she set a hand on each twins shoulder come on girls back to the house the gunfire started up anew this time much closer esther and judiths mother gave them a shove and hurry by the time they got home emergency vehicles were racing along the streets those of human make clanging bells and those with lizards inside hissing urgently to clear the right of way reuven hurried toward the telephone before he could pick it up it rang he grabbed it hello are you all right jane archibald asked yes were fine here he answered adding i was just about to call you is the dormitory safe so far yes she answered no trouble here yet this is all aimed at the lizards not at us but everyone is worried about you and your family that deflated reuven hed hoped jane had called only because she was worried about him but he repeated were fine i hope therell be something left of the city when all this dies down again if it ever does jane said and im not half sure the lizards hope the same thing they may be looking for another excuse to slaughter the people who dont like them and have the nerve to stand up to them because of what the race had done to australia she naturally thought the worst of them but as a helicopter flew low over the house and began pouring rockets into a target bare blocks away reuven had a hard time telling her she was bound to be wrong liu han liu mei and nieh hoting peered north from a fourstory building the little scaly devils somehow hadnt yet managed to knock down through smoke and dust liu han spied the column of tanks advancing on peking another column was coming up from the south the peoples liberation army had done everything it could to throw back the scaly devils in the end everything it could do hadnt been enough what now liu han asked nieh now the peoples liberation army officer echoed his face grim now we try to escape to the countryside and carry on the revolutionary struggle there we cannot hold this city and there will surely be a great bloodbath of a purge after the little devils retake it truth liu han said in the scaly devils language after their uprising succeeded the communists had meted out summary punishment to every collaborator they could catch liu han was sure the enemy would not be so foolish as to fail to return the favor one of the advancing tanks started pumping rounds into the city from its big gun every explosion wrecked a little more of pekingand drove home to the people left inside that they could not hope to halt the little scaly devils advance but the peoples liberation army kept fighting pekings defenders had no real artillery with which to oppose the little devils tanks they did have mortars the tubes were hardly more than sheet metal and artisans could make the bombs they fired those bombs began bursting among the tanks liu han cheered so did liu mei though she didnt change expression nieh looked as sour as if he were sucking on a lemon that will do no good he said and it will tell the enemy where our weapons are positioned sure enough the little scaly devils who had been shooting more or less at random began concentrating their fire on the places from which the mortars had opened up one after another the mortars fell silent liu han hoped at least some of them were shamming but she had no way to know nieh hoting said and if we are going to leave we had better leave now if we wait till the little devils are in the city it will be too late they will set up checkpoints and they will have collaborators with them people who are liable to recognize us no matter what stories we tell again he assumed the scaly devils would follow the pattern the party had used again liu han found no reason to disagree with him but liu mei asked can we do anything more here before we have to leave no nieh answered if we had a radio we might direct firefor a little while till the scaly devils triangulated our position and flattened this building that would not take long and it would not help the cause the best thing we can do is survive and escape and fight on hes right liu han told her daughter to prove she thought so she started down the stairs nieh hoting followed without hesitation liu han looked back over her shoulder fearful lest liu mei in a fit of revolutionary fervor stay behind to court martyrdom but her daughter was following though shaking her head in regret seeing liu mei made liu han go faster when they got to the ground she asked which way out the scaly devils are coining from the north and south nieh answered we would be wise to go east or west west liu mei said at once were closer to the western gates as good a reason as any and better than most nieh ho ting said while liu han nodded nieh went on the last thing we want is to get stuck in the city when it falls that can be very bad oh yes it can be bad in a village too liu han said remembering what had happened to her village at the hands of first the japanese and then the little scaly devils it would be even worse in a big city though so it would nieh agreed it would indeed a couple of youths ran past both with shaved heads and wearing tightfitting shirts with the patterns of body paint printed on them they looked and sounded frightened not of the people around them but of the little scaly devils whom they aped now they were discovering where their loyalties truly lay some of their number though would be joining the collaborators whod escaped the purges in welcoming the little scaly devils back into peking liu han was sure of that some of them before too long would be marked down for liquidation she was sure of that too liu mei said im afraid i dont really know how to live in the countryside i havent gone out there very often its not like the citythats true liu han said and this time nieh nodded in response to her words but well get along one way or another we will she set a hand on her daughters shoulder youre not afraid to work as long as you keep that in mind youll do all right the walls that in earlier years had shielded peking from the world around it were now battered by the little scaly devils bombardment people werent fleeing only at the gates they were also scrambling out through breaches in the wall thousandstens of thousandsof men and women would be descending on the villages around the city eee liu han said unhappily they will be like so many locuststhey will eat the countryside bare there will be famine that word heard too often in china was enough to make two women also hurrying toward the gate whip their heads around in alarm liu mei said would we do better trying to stay then no nieh hoting and liu han spoke at the same time nieh continued once we get among people who know who and what we are we will not starve they will set food aside for the leaders of the struggle against the little devils imperialism that is not as fair as it might be had liu mei been able she would have frowned her revolutionary fire burned very bright very pure nieh hoting shrugged i could justify it dialectically maybe i will when we have more time for now all ill do is say i dont feel like starving and i dont intend to when your belly cries for noodles or rice you wont feel like starving either that quelled liu mei till she and liu han and nieh hurried out through the hsi chih men the west straight gate it led to the great park called the summer palace a few miles northwest of peking but the fugitives did not go in that direction instead they fled through suburbs almost as battered as the interior of the city until at last buildings began to thin out and open fields became more common by then the sun was sinking ahead of them the moon nearly full rose blood red through the smoke and haze above peking nieh said i think we had better sleep under trees tonight any building will already have snakes in ittwolegged snakes wed better keep a watch through the night too he wore a pistol on his hip and tapped it with his right hand good idea liu han said they werent really in the countryside not yet but the very air around her felt different from the way it had back in peking she couldnt have told how but it did she cocked her head to one side come on she said pointing there will be water over there youre right nieh said i can tell by the way the bushes grow liu mei looked from one of them to the other as if theyd started speaking some foreign language she didnt understand unlike nieh hoting liu han hadnt consciously known why she was so sure they would find water in that direction shed spent half her life in peking so much shed taken for granted when she was young would seen strange now to say nothing of unpleasant but she hadnt forgotten everything she might not have known how she knew water was there but she had it tastes funny liu mei said after they drank youre not used to drinking it when it hasnt come out of pipes liu han said for her water straight from a little stream was a taste out of childhood nieh took it for granted too but for liu mei it was new and different liu han hoped it wouldnt make her daughter sick they found a place where pine trees screened them from the road and settled down to rest there liu han took the first watch nieh hoting handed her the pistol lay down among the pine needles twisted a few times like a dog getting comfortable and fell asleep liu mei had never tried sleeping on bare ground before but exhaustion soon caught up with her the late spring night was mild explosions kept rocking peking careless of them owls hooted and crickets chirped flashes on the eastern horizon reminded liu han of heat lightning fugitives streamed away from the doomed city even in darkness liu han hung on to the pistol she hoped nobody else would try to rest here among the trees no one did not while she was on watch in due course she woke nieh gave him back the automatic and went to sleep herself she didnt think shed been asleep very long when three gunshots hammered her out of unconsciousness screams and the sound of pounding feet running away followed those thunderclaps somebody who thought hed try being a bandit to see what it was like nieh said lightly i dont think he cared for it as well as he expected to bandits never think victims are supposed to have guns of their own did you hit him liu mei askedshe was sitting up too i hope so nieh hoting answered im not sure though i know i scared him off and thats what matters go back to sleep both of you liu han doubted she could but she did when she woke birds were chirping and the sun was rising through the smoke above peking her belly was a vast chasm deeper than the gorges of the yangtze she went back to the little stream and drank as much water as she could hold but that didnt help much we have to have food she said well get some nieh sounded confident liu han hoped his confidence had some basis had she been a peasant villager she wouldnt have wanted anything to do with refugees from the city when they came to a village the peasants greeted them with rifles in hand keep moving one of them shouted we have nothing for you we havent got enough for ourselves but nieh hoting said comrade is that the proper revolutionary spirit he went up to the peasant leader and spoke to him in a low voice several other peasants joined the discussion so did a couple of their womenfolk at one point nieh pointed to liu han and spoke her name the women exclaimed that seemed to turn the argument a few minutes later liu han and liu mei and nieh hoting were slurping up noodles and vegetables a woman came up to them are you really the famous liu han she asked i really am liu han answered now i am also the hungry liu han but the woman didnt want to take the hint how did you get to be the way you are she persisted liu han thought about that never give up she said at last never ever give up she bent her head to the noodles once more straha made the negative hand gesture even though sam yeager couldnt see it not with the primitive tosevite telephone he was using no the exshiplord said and added an emphatic cough i was not aware of this it did not come to my attention before i ah decided to leave the conquest fleet and come to the united states okay yeager answered an english word he sometimes threw into conversations even in the language of the race just as he sometimes used emphatic and interrogative coughs while speaking english i did wonder and thought you might know i did not straha said that we should attempt to rear tosevite hatchlings makes sense to me however how better to learn to what degree your species can come to conform to our usages he waited for the big ugly to wax indignant tosevitesespecially american tosevitesoften got very shrill about the rights of their kind especially when they thought the race was violating those rights if they or their fellow big uglies violated them though they were much less strident to strahas surprise all yeager said was yes i can see how that would make sense from your point of view but i have the feeling it is liable to be hard on the hatchling you are rearing that is part of the nature of experimentsdo you not agree straha said it is unfortunate when the experiments involve intelligent beings but i do not see how it is avoidable sometimes such things are necessary again he expected sam yeager to get angry again yeager failed to do so you may have something there shiplord he replied straha had to fight down a small puzzled hiss hed known this big ugly longer than almost any other and thought he knew him better than any other save perhaps his own driver now yeager wasnt responding as he should have straha knew the tosevites were a highly variable species but yeager usually thought so much like a male of the race that the exshiplord had expected him to maintain a respectable consistence how did you happen to make the acquaintance of this tosevite reared under the tutelage of the race straha asked trying to find what lay behind yeagers curious indifference to the experiment she identified me as a big ugly by the way i wrote yeager answered i had no idea she was one till i heard her speak you know we have trouble with some sounds in your language because of the way our mouths are made yes just as we do in tosevite tongues straha agreed yeager didnt seem inclined to be very forthcoming for which straha could hardly blame him that being so have you anything else no shiplord i thank you for your time the big ugly said and broke the connection straha also hung up the tosevitestyle telephone he did let out the discontented hiss hed held in before something was going on under his snout and he didnt know what it was that annoyed him he walked from the kitchen into the front room where his driver sat leafing through a tosevite news magazine i greet you shiplord the big ugly said as far as grammar and pronunciation went he spoke the language of the race as well as yeager he didnt think like a male of the race though his next question was sharp not deferential what was that all about on the telephone that was sam yeager the soldier and student of the race straha answered his driver was not just an aide the tosevite was charged with monitoring what straha did the english description for such a male which straha found expressive was watchdog ah the driver said sam yeager has a gift for sticking his snout where it does not belong what was he trying to learn from you that is none of his business nothing as a matter of fact straha said tartly in my humble opiniona bit of sarcasm all too likely to sail past the tosevitea female of your kind who has been raised by the race from hatchlinghood to maturity is very much within yeagers area of responsibility ohthat yes truth shiplord the driver said then he let out several barks of big ugly laughter more truth than you know about as a matter of fact suppose you enlighten me then straha suggested to a male of the race such a suggestion would have been as good as an order the driver shook his head and then for good measure also used the races negative hand gesture suppose i do not shiplord his tone was so emphatic he didnt bother with a cough you do not need to know that straha understood security without having a big ugly explain it to him he also understood the driver had slipped then you should not have alluded to such a thing he said now my curiosity is aroused you speak truth shiplordi should not have mentioned it the tosevite admitted since i did i must ask you to pretend i did not next i suppose you will ask a female to unlay an egg straha snapped what would happen if i went back to the telephone and asked sam yeager to tell me what you will not he might do it he has a way of talking too much the driver said but shiplord i very strongly ask you not to do that now he did use an emphatic cough he was not simply asking straha realized he was giving an order and expected to be obeyed that the driver presumed to do such a thing spoke of who had power here and who had none with an emphatic cough of his own straha said i am not your servant nor am i going to betray whatever i may learn to the race nor is the race likely to try to kidnap me not after all these years perhaps not the driver replied but the race may well be monitoring your telephone line and yeagers i would be were i a male from the conquest fleets intelligence service straha hissed unhappily his driver made a good point the big ugly went on and we still do not know at whom the miscreants were shooting when you visited yeagers house while the chinese females were also there it could have been them it could have been yeager but it could also have been you shiplord me straha swung both eye turrets sharply toward the driver such was his surprise i assumed those females were the targets the race is not in the habit of using assassination as a weapon the race has picked up all sorts of bad habits since coming to tosev his driver answered to compound his insolence the tosevite bent his head over one hand and pretended to taste ginger but what he said while it held enough truth to be infuriating did not hold enough to be convincing i am not involved in the ginger trade except as one more male who tastes straha said and since you are giving forth with nonsense who would want to murder yeager and why who would want to kill yeager strahas driver echoed someone who got tired of his habit of sticking his snout where it does not belong that is who i assure you he has made enemies doing so and are you one of those enemies the exshiplord asked you certainly speak as if you have considerable knowledge of them i shall have to find some way to warn sam yeager straha thought yeager had always behaved in a proper manner toward him like any welltrained male of the race straha understood that loyalty from below created obligations in those above yeager had left straha in his debt and debt required repayment in some ways at some time i may be an enemy of yeagers the driver answered evenly i had nothing to do with the shots fired at his home however indeed if you will recall i shot at the shooters yes i do recall straha said wondering if the driver had opened fire to make himself appear innocent all things considered i still believe the attack was most likely aimed at the chinese females the big ugly said an assault on you or on yeager would have been better planned and would also have been more likely to succeed you so relieve my mind strahas voice was dry i am so happy to hear it so was his drivers straha would have taken most tosevites literally with this one he knew better the driver continued it is however one more reason for you not to telephone yeager it may be if what you say is truth straha said you have not proved that you have only mentioned it as a possibility the driver sighed shiplord is this your day to be particularly difficult perhaps it is straha answered and perhaps we can compromise at a time convenient to sam yeager will you drive me to his house so we can discuss these things without fretting over insecure telephone lines it shall be done the tosevite said and sighed again he was not happy about strahas request but evidently saw no way to evade it gradually over the long years of his exile the exshiplord had come to learn the subtleties of the big uglies responses when setting out for tosev he hadnt imagined such knowledge would be usefulbut then the race hadnt imagined a great many things about tosev since his driver was also in some measure his keeper and was his link to the tosevite authorities of the united states straha decided conciliation might be a wise course will you eat with me he asked that was an amicable gesture among the big uglies as it was among the race i have some zisuili chops defrosting in the kitchen will they poison me the driver asked i doubt it straha answered few tosevite foods have proved poisonous to us he thought of ginger and sometimes when they do poison us we enjoy it even so shiplord i think i will decline the tosevite said i have not found appetizing the odors that come from your meats no straha shrugged then thought on how best to manipulate big uglies particularly the males of the species if you have not the courage to try new things i will enjoy a larger meal of my own in due course he and the driver sat down at the table together the tosevite ate a small bite of zisuili meat then paused in thought of his own not so bad he said at last are all your meats as salty as this though yes straha answered to us as you well know uncured tosevite meats seem unpleasantly bland more potato chips i thank you but no the driver said i will make do with what i have here he did dutifully finish the portion straha had given him when he was through he gathered up his dishes and strahas and began to wash them having an intelligent being perform such a service for straha took him back to the most ancient days of the race most of the time he would have reckoned it a reversion to barbarism this once he found it no less than his due vyacheslav molotovs secretary stuck his head into the kremlin office molotov most commonly used comrade general secretary the ambassador from the race has arrived the fellow said thank you for informing me pytor maksimovich molotov answered he had no great desire to see queek but could hardly refuse his request for an interview tell him i shall be there directly the secretary hurried away molotov nodded to himself as he rose if he found an interview with queek unpleasant he was determined that the lizard should not enjoy it either having promised to come at once he deliberately took his time in walking to the office where the ambassador and his interpreter waited queek sat impassively but the pole who did his talking for him sent molotov a dirty look the general secretary savored that as he would have savored a particularly delicate tea to business he said as if he had not delayed at all i must tell you that the peaceloving peasants and workers of the soviet union again reject out of hand the invidious assertions the race has made in regard to our alleged collaboration with the freedomloving peoples of those parts of the world you now occupy queek spoke at some length the interpreter summed up his first couple of hissing sentences in one word nichevo it doesnt matter eh molotov said in that case why did your principal demand this meeting after the interpreter had done his job queek spoke again the pole turned his words into russian i wanted to inform you personally that peking is once more in the hands of the race this effectively brings to an end the rebellion the soviet union fomented and abetted i deny fomenting the rebellion of the freedomloving chinese people and their peoples liberation army molotov answeredtruthfully for mao would have risen up against the lizards without any encouragement from moscow and i also deny assisting the rebellion in any way that was a great thumping lie but the race had neverquitebeen able to prove it unusually queek didnt try to prove it now he just said your claims are noted they are also as i say irrelevant china is ours china will remain ours the same applies farther west on the main continental mass our cities in that region do not suffer to any great degree despite the damage inflicted on the seaside desalination plants thereabouts we had nothing to do with that damage either molotov said that wasnt the whole truth but it wasnt a lie either the soviet union did smuggle arms down into the middle east but the locals there used them as they saw fit not as the ussr desired mao was a nationalist but he was also a communist the arabs and persians hated moscows ideology almost as much as they hated the race your rockets called katyushas were among the weapons employed against the desalination plants queek said katyushas have been in production for more than twenty years molotov said blandly many were captured by the fascists in their invasion of the soviet union and others by the race these weapons are also widely imitated you always have excuses and denials queek said do you wonder that the race has trouble taking them seriously what i have is a complaint and the race had better take it seriously molotov saidhe was indeed intent on making sure queek went away unhappy we shall treat it with the seriousness it deserves whatever that proves to be the lizard answered i do find it intriguing that this notempire the cause of so many complaints is now issuing one say on i hope you intend no frivolity none whatsoever said molotov to whom frivolity was as alien as satyriasis the ironic style queek affected was also the one he preferred he flattered himself that he was better at it than the lizard he went on my complaintthe soviet unions complaintis that your alien domestic animals have begun straying from the border regions of the territory you occupy into land unquestionably under the jurisdiction of the soviet union i demand that the race do everything in its power to curb these incursions and that you pay compensation for damage to our crops and livestock animals unfortunately know nothing of political borders they go where they can find food queek said we shall have no complaints if you drive them back over the frontier we shall also have no complaints if you slay them when you find them on your territory compensation for damages does not strike me as unreasonable provided your claims are not exorbitant it was a softer answer than molotov had expected and so one that left him disappointed he said some of your beasts are devouring the crops that will yield the bread that feeds the soviet people others kill chickens and ducks and have even been known to kill cats and dogs as well the translation took a little while molotov guessed that the interpreter had to explain to the lizard what sort of animals he was talking about finally queek said you would be referring to befflem i suppose in the matter of your livestock befflem and possibly tsiongyu molotov cared very little about the races names for its annoying creatures he was about to say as much but checked himself queek would surely respond that the names of proper earthly animals did not matter to him either forestalling an opponent could be as important as counterattacking after a sally the soviet leader contented himself with observing whatever else these creatures may be they are pests and they will be exterminated from soviet soil i wish you good fortune in your efforts along those lines queek said yes he did have a sardonic turn of phrase the race has been making similar efforts since long before the establishment of the empire some few have been partially successful most however were undoubted failures molotov studied the lizard he reluctantly concluded queek despite the sarcasm was not joking he thought about feral cats that lived off pigeons and mice and squirrels and such and about packs of wild dogs that scavenged in the cities and sometimes killed cattle and sheep out in the countryside you have released a new plague on us you are telling me he said queek shrugged after that was translated you have your domestic animals and we have ours they have accompanied us as the empire has grown we see no reason why tosev should be different from any other world in this regard you have not conquered us as you conquered these other worlds molotov said your animals have no business on our soil i repeat we are willing to discuss reasonable compensation the ambassador from the race said but i also repeat that you are unreasonable if you expect us to keep perfect control over all our animals at all times i am certain your own notempire is unable to do this so why do you assume we can for that molotov found no good answer he shifted his ground it appears to me that you are seeking to win through environmental change what you could not win at the battlefield or at the negotiating table our intention is to colonize this world we have never said otherwise queek replied we are not at war with the soviet union or with any other independent tosevite notempire but we do hope and expect to bring all of tosev into the empire in the fullness of time that shall not happen molotov declared perhaps you speak truth the lizard told him i do not deny the possibility but as i said at a previous meeting this is not necessarily to your advantage if you become a threat to the empire as a whole rather than merely to peace and good order here on tosev we shall be as ruthless as circumstances require do not doubt that i mean this with complete sincerity however much molotov wanted to he didnt doubt that we must also be able to protect ourselves from you he warned you want us to abandon technical progress as i have said before that is impossible the ussr didnt just have to protect itself from the race either the reich and the usa remained potential enemies so did japan in a more limited way molotov had been a boy during the russojapanese war but he still remembered his countrys humiliation one day the soviet union would settle scores against all its neighbors human and otherwise queek said it appears then that we are on a collision course in that case squabbles over domestic animals suddenly become less important would you not agree molotov shrugged since we are not in combat my view is that we had best behave as if we were at peace ah the lizard said yes that is a sensible attitude i must admit i would not have expected it of you the polish interpreters eyes gleamed as he turned that into russian life is full of surprises molotov said have we anything further to discuss i think not queek replied i have delivered the statement required of me by my superiors i have heard your complaint and suggested a possible resolution and i have listened to your bluster pertaining to your notempires technical prowess nothing more remains that i can see bluster travels on both sides of the street molotov said icily and rose from his desk this meeting is at an end the guards will escort you back to your limousine good day he didnt say good riddance but his manner suggested it after the lizards ambassador and his interpreter had left molotov went into the antechamber to one side of the office there he changed all his clothes down to socks and underwear if queek or his human stooge had smuggled electronic eavesdropping devices into the office they would go no farther than the antechamber molotov wondered if the race knew he entertained human visitors in another office he wouldnt have been surprised he didnt mind offending the lizardsor anyone elsebut didnt care to do so inadvertently once back in clothes sure to be uncontaminated molotov returned to the regular office no sooner had he got there than the telephone rang he picked it up marshal zhukov on the line his secretary said molotovs expression did not change but he grimaced inside zhukov knew altogether too much about his comings and goings no doubt the marshal had a spy among molotovs aides put him through molotov said suppressing a sigh and then good day georgi konstantinovich and how are you fine thank you comrade general secretary zhukov replied outwardly deferential but a blunt soldier he had little patience with small talk what did the lizard want to brag that the race has suppressed the uprising in china molotov said he labored under the delusion that we did not already know ah zhukov said molotov could imagine his nod even if he couldnt see it the marshal went on when the chinese are ready themselves or when we can stir them up they will rise again of course you had a countercomplaint ready i assume oh yesthe matter of these animals from home on our soil molotov said zhukov would hear it from someone else if not from him they do threaten to become a nuisance in our border regions but queek proved conciliatory on the matter of compensation i wish you had found something stronger zhukov grumbled but i suppose foreign affairs is your bailiwick for as long as i feel like letting it be your bailiwick marshal zhukov didnt always say everything he thought either but then he didnt always have to that was what holding power meant felless felt isolated and useless and frustrated at the races embassy to the reich with ttomalss gone she had no one there with whom she could really have a conversation grounded in her professional expertise most of the males and females at the embassy dealt with the deutsch tosevites in a purely pragmatic way caring nothing for the theoretical underpinnings of interspecies relations the deutsche cared nothing for those underpinnings either so far as felless could tell as time went on they grew less and less willing to discuss with her the rationale behind their strange notempire she had had trouble enough grasping even what they were willing to discuss now that new information came in more slowly than it had before she despaired of ever making sense of their system shed thought about insulting some deutsch official to the point where his government would expel her from the notempire as ttomalss had been lucky enough to manage shed not only thought about it shed tried to do it a couple of times that had involved her in shouting matches with big uglies but no expulsion order came worse luck she remained stuck here in nuremberg stuck without escape and hating every moment of it her office was her refuge she could analyze such data as she had and she could reach out to the wider world of the race through the computer network and sometimes she would stay in her office for days at a time bringing food back from the refectory storing it in a little refrigerator and reheating it in an even more compact radar oven the locked door there was a shield against a world far more unpleasant than she had imagined on waking from cold sleep behind that shield she could do her best to make the world go away after finishing the first of several meals she had waiting in the refrigerator she went over to her desk opened one of the drawers reached behind several file folders and took out a small plastic vial half full of brownish powder by the emperor she said softly ginger is the only thing that makes tosev even close to being a world worth living on her fingers trembled in anticipation as she took off the stopper she couldnt taste as often as she craved the herb not with the punishments to which males and femalesespecially femaleswere liable these days only when she was sure no one would disturb her till she no longer reeked of pheromones did she dare shake powdered ginger into the palm of her hand bend her head low over it and flick out her tongue gingers hot spicy flavor was marvelous enough but what the herb did when it coursed through her blood and set her brain afire made the flavor seem a small thing when she tasted ginger she was as near omnipotent as made no difference somewhere back inside her mind she knew both the omnipotence and the delight that came with it were illusions she knew but she didnt care she also knew the euphoria she got from ginger wouldnt last long enough to suit her it never did the only way it could have lasted long enough to suit her was never to end but the herb didnt work that way however much she wished it did all too soon she began to slide down into the depression that was the price she paid for the euphoria she hissed in despair and walked over to the desk she knew that if she tasted again the depression would only be worse and deeper after that second taste again she knew but she didnt care that would be later she felt bad enough now to want to escape and escape wasnt far away she didnt have to think to yank the top off the vial of ginger pour some more of the herb into the palm of her hand and lap it up she sighed and shuddered with pleasure again she was brilliant strong invincible again she could the telephone hissed she strode over to it as if she were the emperor at a ceremonial function she didnt mind talking on the telephone while ginger lifted her it made her feel more clever than the caller whoever he might be this time she saw as she turned an eye turret toward the screen it was ambassador veffani i greet you superior sir she said and assumed the posture of respect and i greet you senior researcher veffani answered please come to my office immediately several males and females have come from cairo to discuss our present relations with the reich and your contributions would be valuable felless stared at him but superior sir she began and discovered the difference between feeling brilliant and actually being brilliant if she went out of her office now she would turn the whole embassy topsyturvy let alone that chamber full of males and females with fancy body paint but what sort of excuse could she find for not coming when the ambassador required her presence the ginger didnt give her any marvelous ideas she tried her best superior sir could i not participate by telephone i am in the midst of an exacting report and no veffani broke in conference calls with too many participants quickly grow confusing please come and give your insights in person he said please but he meant it as an order but superior sir felless repeated that might not be the best idea right now veffani knew she had a ginger habitor rather he knew she had had one she hoped he would be able to hear what she wasnt saying if he could he didnt choose to he said senior researcher your presence is required here i will see you directly felless let out along hissing sigh had he forgotten about the herb or was he going to use this opportunity to show her up and expose her to punishment it didnt really matter hed left her no choice she sighed again it shall be done superior sir she said and broke the connection she knew what would happen when she stepped out into the corridor and headed for veffanis office the only question was where and with whom as things happened she hadnt gone more than half a dozen steps before she saw slomikk the science officer he saw her too i greet you senior researcher how are you tod his voice trailed away as the pheromones she couldnt help emitting reached his scent receptors almost at once he straightened till he stood nearly as erect as a big ugly the scales of his crest rose along the crown of his head too as they did at no other time than during a mating display and his visual cues affected felless just as her scent cues affected him she bent down till her snout all but touched the floor the mating posture was not so far removed from the posture of respect hurry she said with the small part of her rational mind that still functioned i must see the ambassador slomikk wasnt listening she hadnt expected that he would be he took his place behind her of itself her tailstump moved up and out of the way the science officer thrust his mating organ into her cloaca the pleasure she felt was different from what she got with ginger though she couldnt have said how she remembered from earlier matings that the pleasure would ease the slide down from the heights of ginger slomikk hissed in delight as he finished felless straightened up and hurried on toward veffanis office another male mated with her on the way there veffanis secretary was a female and so did not notice the pheromones coming off felless in waves all she said was go right into the conference chamber superior female the ambassador is expecting you so he is felless said but not like this she sighed wondering if she would lay another clutch of eggs matings after ginger seemed less likely to lead to gravidity than those of the normal mating season but they easily could she knew that from experience bracing herself for what she knew would happen she went into the conference chamber veffani turned an eye turret toward the opening door an here she is now he said senior researcher i was just telling the males and females here from cairo of the strides you have made in unraveling the as slomikks had his voice trailed away the ventilation system swept her pheromones toward him and toward the other males and females of the race the females didnt notice the males did almost in unison they sprang from their seats and stood straight up their crests rose this time they were displaying to warn off one another as well as to make felless assume the mating posture assume it she did one of the females from cairo exclaimed oh by the emperor she has been tasting ginger felless cast her eyes down to the ground on hearing the emperors name since the carpet was very close to the tip of her snout she got an excellent view of it a maleshe couldnt tell if it was veffani or one of the visitors from cairostepped up behind her and began to mate two other males brawled sending chairs flying every which way and yet another male inflamed by her pheromones went into a mating display in front of a female who was not in her season the female exclaimed in disgust felless thought every male in the chamber had coupled with her by the time the ginger ebbed from her system even as she straightened out of the mating posture one of the males from cairo was sidling around behind her to try to mate again enough she said and hoped she sounded as if she meant it yes enough that was veffani who sounded shaken to the core looking round the conference chamber felless could hardly blame him one chair lay on top of the table a male was rubbing at clawmarks that scored his flank another nursing a bitten arm that dripped blood turning to veffani felless assumed the posture of respectcarefully so none of the males would take it for the mating posture i apologize superior sir she said i knew something like this would happen when i came here but you required it of me and i had no choice but to obey you have been tasting ginger veffani said truth felless admitted what she could hardly deny now the aftertasting depression was on her whatever the ambassador chose to do to her at the moment she felt she deserved every bit of it and more besides we depend on highranking females to set an example for those below them veffani said senior researcher you have failed in this fundamental obligation truth felless repeated veffani was making her feel even worse than she would have anyhow do with me as you will superior sir i do not seek to evade my responsibility veffani swung both eye turrets toward her i know you have not been happy here senior researcher accordingly the most severe punishment i can mete out to you is that requirement that you continue your duties and your investigation of the deutsche exactly as before it shall be done superior sir felless said dully even in the depths of her depression she had trouble believing she deserved to be punished that harshly lieutenant colonel johannes drucker was walking past peenemundes liquidoxygen plant when loudspeakers throughout the enormous rocketry complex began blaring out his name lieutenant colonel drucker lieutenant colonel johannes drucker report to the base commandants office immediately lieutenant colonel drucker donnerwetter drucker muttered what the devil has gone wrong now he couldnt remember the last time hed heard anyone so summarily summoned to lieutenant general dornbergers office he couldnt report there immediately either not when he was closer to the peene river side of peenemundes flat muddy peninsula while the commandants office lay a couple of kilometers away hard by the baltic he started down the road toward the office hoping to flag a lift along the way no such luck he made the journey by shanks mare and arrived about as sweaty as he could get in a cool clammy climate like northern germanys reporting as ordered he told dornbergers adjutant a skinny major named neufeld who always looked as if his stomach pained him yes lieutenant colonel one moment please major neufeld pressed the intercom switch and spoke two words hes here send him in walter dornberger said and neufeld waved drucker past him and into the commandants sanctum walter dornberger was in his late sixties bald but still erect and vigorous hed been in the artillery during the first world war and in charge of peenemunde since before the start of world war ii he knew as much about rockets and space flight as any man alive heil himmler drucker said and shot out his arm in the party salute that had also become the army salute reporting as ordered sir heil general dornberger returned though his answering salute was more nearly a wave close the door behind you drucker and then take a seat yes sir drucker said and obeyed he tried to look brisk and capable andmost of allinnocent he wondered if he was innocent if he wasnt looking as if he were became all the more urgent he tried to sound innocent too asking whats up sir a letter mentioning your name in unusual circumstances came to me dornberger shoved a piece of paper across the desk at him tell me what you think of this if youd be so kind even before drucker picked it up he knew what it would be and it was a denunciation from the pen of gunther grillparzer maybe grillparzer hadnt believed he was an ss man after all or maybe he had and decided to get him in trouble with the wehrmacht i should have killed him when i had the chance drucker thought him and his girlfriend too well general dornberger asked when drucker set the paper down again well what sir drucker answered if you want my head on a bloody platter this gives you the excuse to take it if you dont throw it in the trash can where it belongs and lets go about our business dornberger tapped the letter with a nicotinestained fingernail so you deny these accusations then of course i deny them drucker exclaimed only a man who wanted to commit suicide would admit to them hed been brought up to fear god and tell the truth the second sentence was nothing but the truth and he feared the gestapo too this fellow includes some circumstantial details the commandant at peenemunde observed if he wasnt there if this didnt happen as he says how could he make them up i have done a little checking this colonel jager was supposed to have been arrested somehow he wasntsomehow he escaped apparently to poland its believed he died there is it drucker fought the chill of fright that ran through him dornberger didnt want his head on a platter the commandant had already proved that but he was a conscientious man or maybe just a good engineerhe wanted to get to the bottom of things drucker had never heard what had happened to his regimental commander after the lady flier from the red air force took him away yes it is general dornberger tapped gunther grillparzers letter once more i ask you again hanswhat about this what do i say when the pointynosed ss men come around here and start asking me the questions im asking you now that was a fair questionmore than a fair question if dornberger wanted to be able to protect him drucker thought fast as he had in the hallway outside grillparzers flat in weimar sir he said its pretty plain somebody in the ss doesnt like me isnt it the way they went after my wife yes dornberger said nodding drucker didnt tell himdrucker wouldnt tell anybody not to his dying daythat kathe truly did have a jewish grandmother whoeverd found that out had been right even if drucker and dornberger between them had managed to quash the investigation the commandant went on you are suggesting this is another hoax yes sir drucker answered one way to put all sorts of details in a letter is to just make them up the ss knows my service record it knows the names of the men i served with this letter makes it sound like grillparzer was as much a murderer as i was do you think anybody who really did something like that would give you or the blackshirts the whole story a pointa distinct point general dornberger said drucker nodded doing his best to look as well as sound convincing he was convinced gunther grillparzer wouldnt be in that weimar flat any more if he or the gestapo came knocking the exgunner would probably have shed his alias and his girlfriend too though friedli had been worth hanging on to nothing though was worth the risk of kicking your life away at the end of a pianowire noose after some highly ingenious men spent a long time making you wish you were dead dornberger paused to light a cigar he aimed it at drucker as if it were a pistol you realize that if your enemy in the ss wants you badly enough he will simply come and take you away regardless of anything i can do yes sir i understand that drucker said he knew he sounded worriedhe was worried but anyone with a powerful enemy in the ss had every right to be worried more than a generation of german history proved as much all right then general dornberger picked up grillparzers letter folded it in thirds as it had been in the envelope and then slowly and methodically tore it to pieces i think we will be able to carry on on that basis you understand that neufeld has also seen this i would have expected that yes sir drucker said nodding but sir major neufeld wouldnt tell his granny her own name if she happened to ask him for it dornberger chuckled coughed and chuckled some more i wont say youre wrong i will say thats one of the reasons hes so useful to me if your unfriend has sent copies of this letter to people besides mewhich it makes sense that he would dowe shall try to deal with them as youve suggested he took another puff on the cigar then set it in an ashtray exhaling smoke he went on you are dismissed lieutenant colonel drucker sprang to his feet and saluted heil himmler he said as he had when he came in for once the words were not automatic he wondered what he was doing hailing the man who along with heading the reich also headed the outfit that had tried to execute kathe the outfit that had done its best to get him drummed out of the wehrmacht the outfit that would no doubt take another shot at him now thanks to gunther grillparzer but that couldnt be helped as long as he lived in the greater german reich he had to conform to its outward usages he made a smart aboutturn and strode out of general dornbergers office in the antechamber major neufelds face revealed nothing but dyspepsia drucker nodded to him and walked out he was just leaving the administrative center when a black mercedes pulled to a halt in front of it a couple of gestapo men got out of it and hurried into the building they took no special notice of him but he would have bet reichsmarks against pfennigs they hadnt come to peenemunde on any other business to hell with you grillparzer you son of a bitch drucker thought if you drag me down ill take you with me he knew the alias under which the expanzer gunner had been living in weimar if the gestapo couldnt track the bastard with that much to go on the boys in the black shirts werent worth much as drucker walked away from the administration building he wondered if the loudspeakers would blare out his name again the ss had wanted his scalp ever since he managed to get kathe out of their clutches if dornberger couldnt convince them to leave him alone what would he do then take out his pistol and go down fighting take it out and kill himself so he wouldnt suffer whatever the blackshirts wanted to inflict on him if he did either of those things how would he avenge himself on gunther grillparzer and what would happen to his family afterwards but if he didnt do it would that save his wife and children and what horrid indignities would be waiting for him the loudspeakers kept quiet drucker stayed where he could keep an eye on that black mercedes after about fortyfive minutes the gestapo men came out of the administrative center and got back into the car by the way they slammed the doors they werent happy with the world the mercedes leaped away with a screech of tires almost flattening a couple of enlisted men whod presumed to try to cross the road the soldiers sprang out of the way in the nick of time drucker watched it go with the same savage joy hed known when he stuck a pistol in grillparzers face before then he hadnt felt that particular delight since taking out a lizard panzer during the fighting somebodyd tried to ruin him tried and failed that was how things were supposed to work but things didnt work that way often enough whistling drucker went into the officers club ordered a shot of schnapps and knocked it back with great relish the fellow behind the bar a young blond corporal straight out of a recruiting poster grinned at him something good must have happened to you sir he said oh you might say so you just might say so drucker agreed let me have another one why dont you theres nothing in the world to match the feeling you get when somebody shoots at you and misses you know that if you say so sir the bartender answered im sorry but i havent seen combat myself though polite puzzlement was on his face what sort of combat would drucker have seen lately but drucker knewand combat it was even without a literal shot being fired dont be sorry son he said count yourself lucky i wish i could say the same thing germans monique dutourd snarled as she walked up to her brother in the jardin puget a few blocks south of marseilles old harbor not far away sweaty kids booted a football toward one sides goal dont start talking yet pierre warned he looked around to make sure no one else in the park was taking any notice of him then pulled from his pocket a gadget plainly not of earthly manufacture only after waving it at her and examining the lights that glowed and flickered at one end did he nod all right the boches have not planted any ears on you germans monique said again even the usual scornful french nickname for them didnt let her get rid of enough anger to be satisfying only by calling them exactly what they were could she vent even part of the loathing shed come to feel for the occupiers to her intense annoyance her older brother chuckled you just went about your business as long as they didnt bother you too much its only after they start annoying you personally that you discover youve hated them all along eh oh shut up damn you monique said pierre had been content to let her think for twenty years that he was dead she saw little point wasting politeness on him this is business if we can get the lizards to rub out dieter kuhn i get him off my back and you get him off your belly pierre broke in which almost made monique turn on her heel and stalk out of the park he went on well neither of those things would be so bad nice of you to say so monique glared she was sick to death of kuhn on her belly and inside her and in her mouth but it wasnt her death she wanted it was the sturmbannfuhrer s she lusted for that as she would never lust for the nazi alive pierre waggled a finger at her he was sadeyed and plump not at all the young poilu whod gone off to fight the reich in not that she was a little girl any more either he said you have to understand i dont hate the germans just because theyre germans i do business with quite a few of them and i make a nice piece of change off them too monique tossed her head never mind the advertisements dammit we both want this one dead and we want it done so we cant be blamed you have the connections with the lizards to arrange it and she broke off and what her brother prompted unwillingly she went on and since he comes to my flat every couple of nights we have a place where the lizards can lie in wait ah pierre said you want him to die happy i comprehend i want him to die dead monique ground out i dont care how he wont stay happy by god i suppose not pierre said with the air of a man making a sizable concession he sat down on a wooden bench with rusty iron arm rests monique stood there hands on hips in his own way her brother could be almost as infuriating as dieter kuhn pierre continued well i will see what i can do when will the nazi be at your flat again tonight monique grimaced having to admit that kuhn came there at all was humiliating enough having to admit that she knew his schedule was somehow worse but she did and could hardly pretend otherwise reluctantly she answered no he was there last night and that means he isnt likely to be back till tomorrow and then a couple of days after that and so on nice regular fellow eh pierre chuckled monique wanted to hit him in that moment she wouldnt have minded seeing him dead but then he said all right my little sister ill pass the word along and who knows it could be that one day before too long someone scaly will be waiting for your german when he comes outside hes not my german and you can go straight to hell if you call him that again monique said she didnt have to worry about keeping pierre sweet he had his own good reasons for wanting kuhn dead that let monique take a certain savage pleasure in turning her back on him and stamping past the oleanders that screened the traffic noise and out of the jardin puget she would have taken even more pleasure if she hadnt heard pierre laughing as she stalked away since she didnt have to entertain dieter kuhn that evening she actually managed to get some research done reading latin especially the abbreviationfilled latin of her inscriptions helped ease some of her fury scholars would be poring over these texts a thousand years from now long long after she and dieter kuhn were both dead thinking in those terms gave her a sense of proportion she bared her teeth in something that wasnt a smile with any luck at all a thousand years from now dieter kuhn would be dead a great deal longer than she was outliving him is the best revenge she thought but she shook her head a moment later revenge was the best revenge when he knocked on her door a night later she was almost eager to see him hed brought along a bottle of red wine too he didnt try to make himself hateful to her he could only have succeeded though by leaving her alone he didnt feel like doing that as usual she endured his attentions without enjoying them as usual that bothered him not in the least men she thought shed known a couple of frenchmen whod cared for her pleasure as little as dieter kuhn did but she hadnt had to go to bed with them and shed stopped going to bed with them as soon as she realized what sort of men they were the german didnt give her that choice monique didnt mind drinking his wine having him spend a few reichsmarks was revenge of a sort even if only of the tiniest sort it turned out to be pretty good wine too and if she got a little drunk if her thinking got a little blurry so much the better well my dear kuhn said as he buttoned the fly to his trousers i must be off i will see you again day after tomorrow i think i am not your dear monique thought she hadnt got so blurry as to be confused about that there wasnt enough wine in the world to leave her confused about that with any luck at all ill never see you again except it could be your bleeding corpse yes i suppose you will she answered aloud and gave him a sweet smile au revoir au revoir the ss man answered and he smiled too you see you are coming to care for me after all i knew you would even if it took a while monique didnt say anything to that she couldnt not unless she cared to give the game away she did manage another smile it was a smile of gloating anticipation but dieter kuhn didnt need to know that he finished dressing smugly kissed her even more smugly fondled her and at last headed for the door monique still naked stayed in the bedroom that was what she always did when kuhn left if she did anything different tonight she might rouse his suspicions the last thing she wanted was to rouse kuhn in any way he turned the knob hinges creaked as the door swung open back in the bedroom monique hugged herself in glee she didnt know it would be tonight but she hoped she even prayed a burst of gunfire shattered the quiet of the street outside gunfire and a scream gott im himmel dieter kuhn exclaimed still in german he went on that was a lizard weapon or im a jew he slammed the door shut behind him and ran down the hall no monique said shaking her head back and forth no no no she had a horrible feeling she knew what had happened the race had as much trouble telling human beings apart as people did telling one lizard from another if the wouldbe assassin had been told to kill whoever came out of the block of flats at suchandsuch a time and if some luckless fellow had chosen just that time to go out for a stroll or a glass of wine if that had happened the fellows blood was on her hands a couple of minutes later someone pounded on her door kuhn she thought and then dammit she threw on a nightgown and went to open the door the ss man pushed past her and into the flat i need to use your telephone he said what happened monique asked though she feared she knew only too well someone just shot a man to death outside this building with a lizard automatic rifle kuhn answered merde alors if i had gone out a couple of minutes sooner that could have been me he was dialing the telephone as he replied and began speaking into it in german too fast and excited for monique to follow more than one word in three quel dommage she said distantly if the ss man heard her she thought he would think she meant it was a pity the other fellow had got shot not that he himself hadnt after a couple of minutes kuhn hung up he turned back to her they are on their way he said returning to french as long as you have some clothes on come downstairs with me and see if you can identify the body the fellow may live here if we know who he is we may be able to find out why someone with a lizard weaponmaybe even a lizardwanted him dead monique gulped do i have to she asked she knew perfectly well why the poor fellow out there on the street was dead because of her and because the drugdealing lizard whod shot him didnt know what the devil he was doing seeing the result of her failed revenge was the last thing she wanted but dieter kuhn as she knew all too well didnt care what she wanted come on he repeated and grabbed her by the arm he wasnt the typical hulking german by his looks and compact wiry build he might more readily have been french but he was much stronger than monique when he dragged her along with him she had no choice but to come a little crowd of the curious and the ghoulish had gathered around the corpse on the sidewalk just in front of moniques block of flats blood black in the moonlight streamed down into the gutter a man had a startling amount of blood in him monique could smell it and the latrine stench that had come when the dead mans bowels let go sirens yowled in the distance rapidly coming closer kuhn took a little flashlight off his belt and shone it in the dead mans face do you know him he asked yes monique answered trying not to look at the wound that had torn away one side of his jaw thats ferdinand bonnard he livesliveddownstairs from me on the second floor he never bothered anyone that i heard of and i killed him as sure as if id pulled the trigger myself she wondered if shed be sick kuhn wrote the name in a little notebook he fished from a trouser pocket bonnard eh and what did he do he sold fish in a little shop on the rue de refuge not far from the harbor monique answered as a couple of ss vehicles squealed to a stop and uniformed germans spilled out of them everyone but monique suddenly found urgent business elsewhere dealt with fishermen did he maybe he was a smuggler too kuhn said and started talking to his nazi colleagues he might have forgotten about monique but when she started to go back inside the apartment building kuhn shook his head noyou will come with us to the palais de justice and answer more questions she must have looked as horrified as she felt for he added it will not be as bad as it was last time you have my word of honor and it wasntquite once he started getting used to it rance auerbach discovered cape towns district six wasnt such a bad place after all yes he had to treat negroes as if they were as good as anybody else he even had to take orders from them every now and then that wasnt easy for a texan but after he leaped the hurdle he started having a pretty fair time everybody in district six black and white and colored a distinction between fullblooded blacks and halfbreeds the usa didnt bother drawing and indian was hustling as hard as he or she could some people had honest work some work that wasnt so honest a lot of people had both kinds of jobs and ran like maniacs from long before the sun rose over table mountain till long after it set in the south atlantic rance couldnt have run like a maniac even if hed wanted to getting up and down the stairs to the flat he and penny summers shared was plenty to leave him sore and gasping when he shuffled along the streets near the apartment building where he lived kids of all colors laughed at his shuffling gait they called him stumpy maybe because of his stick maybe just because of the way he walked he didnt care what they called him kids back in the states had thought he walked funny too hell even he thought he walked funny but he could get to the boomslang saloon a couple of blocks from his apartment building and most of the time that was as far as he wanted to go boomslang he found meant tree snake and one particular and particularly poisonous kind of tree snake at that considering some of the rotgut the place served up he could understand how it got its name but it was close it was cheap and the crowd despite being of all colors was as lively and interesting as any hed ever found in a bar to his surprise he found he was interesting to the boomslangs other patrons his american accent made him exotic to both whites and blacks so did his ruined voice when people discovered hed been wounded fighting the lizards he won respect for courage if not for sense but when they found out how hed wound up in south africa he won interest one evening somewhat elevated from a few hours at the saloon he came home and told penny half the people in this goddamn country are either in the gingersmuggling business or want to be if you listen to em talk his girlfriend threw back her head and laughed you just figured that out rance hell sweetheart if idve wanted to i couldve gotten back into business long since but ive been taking it easy you know what i mean you auerbach felt the whiskey singing in him it didnt make him stupid but it did make him care less about what he said since when did you ever believe in taking it easy penny summers turned red you really want to know since those damn nazis pointed every gun in the world right at my head and carted you and me off to that jail in marseille thats when she shuddered and then after the lizards got us back they couldve locked us up in their own jail and thrown away the key so im not real hot to give em another shot at doing that thanks but no thanks auerbach stared of all the things hed expected penny cautious was among the last you mean you like living like this his wave took in the cramped little flat if he hadnt been careful he would have barked his knuckles on the wall like it hell no penny answered like it better than a nice warm cozy cell with nothing but lizards to look at for the rest of my days hell yes ill be damned he said wonderingly they really did put the fear of god in you didnt they she walked up to him and set her hands on his shoulders it wasnt the prelude to a kiss as hed hoped at first it might be listen to me she said as serious as hed ever heard her listen to me good we caused those scaly bastards a lot of trouble i mean a lot of trouble if you dont think theyre keeping an eye on us to make sure were good little boys and girls youre smack out of your mind want to bet against me how much have you got auerbach thought about it he thought slower than he should have but still thought pretty straight when he was done he shook his head even though it made his ruined shoulder ache nope thatd be like raising with a pair of fives against a guy whos got four diamonds showing now penny did kiss him a peck on the lips that had nothing to do with lust and everything to do with gratitude see rance she said i knew you werent dumb only about you he answered which made her laugh though he hadnt been more than half joking he sighed and went on but if you listen to them half the guys in the boomslang have sold the lizards a taste one time or another penny laughed again how much have you had to drink babe must be a hell of a lot if youre dumb enough to believe what a bunch of barflies say and even if they have sold some poor damn lizard a taste or two so what thats nickelanddime stuff if i ever do start playing the game down here it wont be for nickels and dimes and you can bet your bottom dollar on that if you get in trouble you want to get in a whole lot of troublethats what youre telling me now rance nodded that did sound like the penny summers hed known for the past twentyodd years penny you could say a lot about her but she never did things by halves she knew it too i stiffed my pals for plenty before i came running back to you she said if i ever take a shot at it again ill do it onceonce and then its off to tahiti or one of those other little islands the free french run free france was a joke but a useful joke the japanese empire could have run the french off their south pacific islands so could the usa so could the lizards flying out of australia nobody bothered neutral ground where nobody asked a whole lot of questions was too useful to everyone i could go for that rance agreed the ginger he and penny had run down into mexico should have got them a stash that would have taken them to tahiti auerbach liked the notion of island girls not overburdened with clothes or prudery but things hadnt worked out the way theyd had in mind and so penny said ill tell you one more time sugar you wont find anything that could head us toward free france there in the goddamn boomslang and if you do find it in the boomslang its dollars to doughnuts somebodys trying to set us up you want to be a sucker go ahead but leave me out okay okay auerbach said and then he yawned lets go to bed how do you mean that penny asked damned if i know he answered meet me in the bedroom and well both find out five minutes later two sets of snores rose from the bed a couple of evenings afterwards rance and penny went to the boomslang together she didnt go with him all the time but then she wasnt in constant pain either when she did come into the saloon she always drew admiring glances not just from whites but from blacks as well that was one more thing auerbach had had to get used to in a hurry here those kinds of looks from negroes in texas might have touched off a lynching bee he gathered the same thing had been true in south africa before the lizards came it wasnt true any more rance drank scotch that had never been within five thousand miles of scotland penny contented herself with a lion lager a barmaid took one of the other regulars upstairs dont even think about it buster penny murmured i wont rance promised shes homely penny snorted after a while a big broadshouldered black fellow whom auerbach knew only as frederickemphatically not as fredcame over and sat down beside him it is the ginger man he said in a rumbling bass his smile was broad and friendly too broad and friendly to be convincing rance had never quite figured that out which meant he stayed wary where frederick was concerned the black man inclined his head to penny and this is the ginger lady his musical accent made the question less offensive than it might have been otherwise penny tossed her head theres plenty of ginger in me pal she said but im spoken for she put a hand on rances arm in a way rance was annoyed that she thought she needed to say such a thing especially to a negro in another way he was relieved he wouldnt have wanted to tangle with frederick even if hed had two good arms and two good legs with things as they were the black man could have broken him in half without working up a sweat but frederick shook his head no no no he said not that kind of ginger dear lady the kind that makes the lizards dance ixnay rance muttered to penny south african english was different enough from the kind hed grown up with that he didnt worry about fredericks knowing what that meant penny nodded slightly but leaned forward so she could see frederick around rance and said yeah ive done that but so what if i hadnt done it i wouldnt have ended up here and so im not going to do it any more if the negro was a plant if the lizards were looking to get rance and penny in more trouble that would put sugar in their gas tank but all frederick said was no doubt you are wise still though do you not miss the excitement of never knowing when things might turn interesting damn him auerbach thought hed made a shrewd guess there penny liked living on the edge once upon a time rance had known that feeling too before penny could answer he said you lose excitement in a hurry the first time somebody puts a couple of bullets through you yeah penny said if she sounded a little disappointed then she did that was all tahiti remained temptingto her and to auerbach bothbut only if the potential gain made the risk worthwhile and she was dead right about that being unlikely for any deal made in a noaccount district six saloon frederick spoke a sentence in whatever african language hed grown up with then translated it into english who is a hunter after the lion bites he beamed you see we are not so very different you people from a far land and me maybe not auerbach said he didnt want to start a brawl a couple of bullets had ruined his taste for that too penny nodded which eased his mind she was still looking for her big chance she just didnt think shed find it here and damned if frederick wasnt doing the exact same thing with a sigh full of longing he said if only i could find enough ginger and the right lizards all my worries would be over yeah penny said that same longing in her voice hell of a big if rance said and hoped she was listening to him engine rumbling jonathan yeagers elderly ford came to a stop in front of karens house he killed the engine jumped out of the car and hurried toward the door summer nights could be chilly in southern california but that wasnt the only or even the main reason he wore his tshirt striped with the fleetlords body paint karens parents were nice peoplefor old fogies he added to himself as he did whenever the thought occurred to himbut they werent the sort of folks who took bare chests for granted he rang the doorbell a moment later the door opened hello jonathan said karens father a burly man whose own red hair was going gray come on in shell be ready in two shakes i promise okay mr culpepper thanks jonathan said he looked around the living room the culpeppers didnt have so many books as his family did but nobody he knew had as many books as his family did would you like a coke jonathan mrs culpepper asked coming out of the kitchen she was a blonde herself but karen looked more like her than like her husband as far as jonathan was concerned that was all to the good but he shook his head now no thanks karen and i will get our sodas and popcorn and candy at the movie karen came into the front room just then hi she said brightly and wrinkled her nose at jonathan she switched to the language of the race saying i greet you exalted fleetlord and dropped into the posture of respect then laughing she straightened up again her own body paint said she was a senior mechanized combat vehicle driver her halter top didnt hide much of itdidnt hide any in fact because shed continued the pattern on the fabric in washable paint her parents looked at each other jonathan saw them roll their eyes they didnt take the race for granted the way karen and he did well even his own folks didnt do that but they knew how important the race was the culpeppers didnt seem to get that either or to want to get it have fun at the movie mrs culpepper said dont get back too late mr culpepper added but his voice didnt have a growl in it the way it had when karen and jonathan first started dating he approved of jonathan as much as any middleaged man could approve of the lout going out with his precious daughter as soon as the car got moving east up compton boulevard karen turned to jonathan and said okay now youre going to tell me why youre so hot to see the battle of chicago i didnt think war movies were your taste of ginger by her tone if war movies were his taste of ginger she was wondering whether shed made a mistake by having anything to do with him but jonathan answered sure ill tell you its because my dad and mom were in the battle of chicago or at least the first part of it their ship got shot up when it took them and everybody else who was working on our explosivemetal bomb out of chicago when it looked like the lizards would break in oh karen thought about it then nodded okay i guess i can put up with it for that but it wont be much like what really happened you know of course it wontits a movie jonathan stopped at the light at vermont waited for a couple of southbound cars to go by and turned right to follow them on the radio a fellow with a soft drawl shouted above twanging electric guitars jonathans parents found modern music raucousall the more reason for him to like it he drove with his left hand for a couple of seconds so he could poke karen in the ribs with his right forefinger as she squeaked he went on and dont tell me youre just putting up with it either not when youll be drooling all over everything every time james dean shows upand since hes the star hell show up most of the time she made a face at him like you wont be leering at that french chippie whatever her name isyou know the one who keeps trying to fall out of her clothes all the time what was she doing in the battle of chicago decorating it jonathan suggested karen poked him in the ribs for that which made him swerve the car and almost nail a station wagon in the next lane the fellow in the station wagon sent him a dirty look jonathan gave karen one too and added you were the one who said it wouldnt be much like what really happened i didnt mean like that karen said they kept teasing each other till they got to the vermont drivein a little past artesia houses were thin that far south some of the little farms and orchards and nurseries that had been there since before the war still survived the drivein movie theater made a raucous addition to the air of rural charm jonathan chose a parking space well away from the snack bar though a good many closer to it were open karen raised an eyebrowshe knew what he had in mind aside from watching the movie she stuck out her tongue at him but didnt say anything if she had said something he might have moved the car as things were he said ill be right back and headed off to bring back a cardboard carton full of grease and salt and chocolate and fizzy caffeinated water and other nutrients essential to human life when he got back he found that karen had mounted the little speaker on the window of the front driversside door she was waiting in the back seat and opened the rear door for him so he wouldnt have to put down the carton and maybe spill all the goodies they grinned at each other as they started eating milk duds she hadnt come along with him just to watch the movie either they didnt do anything but grin not yet cars were still coming in the glare of headlights blasting into their faces every few seconds jonathan didnt even put his arm around her theyd have plenty of time for that later by luckand also by jonathans strategic choice of parking spacenobody parked close to the ford he looked out at the white lines painted on the asphalt as if hed never expected such a thing how about that he said yeah how about that karen did her best to sound sternthat was one of the rules of the gamebut a giggle lurked somewhere down at the bottom of her voice theyd been going out for a good long while now sure enough she knew what he had in mind and he knew she knew and had it on her mind too it wasnt as if theyd just started discovering each other theyd made a goodsized dent in the big bags of popcorn when the screen lit and music blared out of the tinny speaker an announcers voice followed here are scenes from our coming attractions now jonathan slipped his arm around karens shoulder her flesh was warm and smooth under his hand she slid closer to himcarefully so as not to disturb the surviving food and what was left of the sodas one of the coming features had dinosaurs that looked remarkably like overgrown lizards tearing up the landscape one was a tearjerking love story and one had red skelton and bing crosby wisecracking strutting their stuff and outwitting real lizards one of whom jonathan thought he recognized left and right my father would like that one karen said with a sigh uhhuh jonathan said so would mine even if he spent half the time telling everybody else in the car with him what all was wrong with it how are mickey and donald karen asked as the cartoon came ona rascally rabbit who eluded lizards and bumbling human hunters at every turn growing like weeds he answered eating us out of house and home cliches were safest when he talked about the hatchlings his father surely wished he wouldnt talk about them at all but hadnt ordered him not to do it he tried not to betray the trust hed earned adding they keep learning things all the time too seemed safe enough and now our feature presentation the announcer boomed karen snuggled closer to jonathan he let his hand close on the smooth skin of her shoulder rather than just resting there quite involuntarily he took a deep breath he had to remind himself they werent in a hurry for one thing it was a threehour movie spaceships filled the enormous screen thats terrific trick photography karen said no its notits real lizard newsreel footage ive seen it before jonathan answered i wonder how much mgm had to pay the race to use it they watched the movie for a while though the view from the backseat wasnt so good as it would have been from up front jonathan soon discovered the film was even hokier than hed feared just from things his folks had said he soon found half a dozen absurdities but some of the battle sequences looked very gritty and realistic they were newsreel footage too humanfilmed blackandwhite footage turned into color with the help of computers watching how the director cut back and forth from them to the actors and the story he was shooting himself kept jonathan half interested for a while james dean aside karen hadnt much cared to begin with before long they found other things to do jonathan untied the bow that held her little halter top on it was so small nobody coming by in the dark would notice whether she was wearing it anyhow and you did the body paint under there too he exclaimed karen smiled at him i thought you might find that out she answered as he caressed her she turned toward him he kissed her then lowered his face to her breasts she sighed and pressed him to her they sank down onto the seat together neither of them had the nerve to go all the way in the drivein but jonathans hand glided along her thighs and then dived under the waistband of her shorts and inside her panties he kissed her breasts and her mouth as he rubbed her his lips were pressed against hers when she let out a little mewling cry a couple of minutes later hed made sure he would be kissing her just then he knew she got noisy at such times sit up she said she unzipped his fly reached in and pulled him out his breath came ragged her touch seemed sweeter than ever as she stroked him and then instead of finishing him with her hands the way she usually did she bent over him and took him in her mouth shed never done that before he was astonished at how good it felt she didnt have to do it very long eitherhe exploded almost instantly karen pulled back wheezing and gulping and choking a little too she grabbed a napkin from the cardboard carton and wiped at her chin sorry she told him you caught me by surprise you caught me by surprise too jonathan was amazed the whole drivein couldnt hear his thudding heart what made you decide to do that whatever it was he hoped it would make her decide to do it again i dont know her eyes sparkled with mischief but my mother did tell us to have a good time remember their laughter came closer to disturbing the people a few spaces over than anything else theyd done like any tosevite kassquit used metabolic water to cool herself she used a lot of it aboard her starship which was of course kept at the temperature the race found comfortable never having known any other she took that temperature for granted intellectually she knew it was warmer than the mean down on tosev but that meant little to her it was the temperature she was used to sweating of course made her unique on the starship the very idea disgusted most males and females of the race because it disgusted them it disgusted kassquit too she wished she could pant as they did but that wasnt how her kind had evolved so she was stuck with being clammy a lot of the time shed also noticed that she put forth more metabolic water when stressed she felt stressed now as stressed as she ever had in her life she was expecting another telephone call from the wild big ugly named sam yeager this time at ttomalss urging she was going to leave the video on if you are going to serve as a link between the race and the tosevites you cannot fear to look at them or to have them look at you her mentor had said truth shed answered for a truth it obviously was and sam yeager was what passed for an expert on the race among the tosevites shed seen as much from his comments on the electronic networkand even from his gaining access to the network in the first place but sweat poured off her now her heart pounded in her chest she wished shed never agreed to this she wished she could hide she wished she could flee she wished the video unit in the computer terminal would malfunction she wished something would happen to the tosevite so his call couldnt come through none of those wishes none of the prayers she breathed to spirits of emperors past came true at precisely the appointed time her screen lit she muttered a worried curse under her breathhad the spirits of emperors past forsaken her because she was so irrevocably a big ugly herself her internal torment did not show on her face nothing much showed on her face she knew that set her apart from other tosevites as much as sweating set her apart from the race but she didnt want tosevites perceiving her thoughts and feelings anyhow i greet you sam yeager she said and then stopped in surprise for not one but two tosevite faces peered out of the screen at her i greet you superior female one of the big uglies said his skin had wrinkles in it that almost made him look scaled he had yellowish gray hair on his head and wore cloth wrappings i am sam yeager i also present to you my hatchling here his name is jonathan yeager i greet you superior female the other big ugly said he spoke a little less fluently than his father but kassquit had no trouble understanding him she eyed him in some surprise like her he shaved his head and like her he wore body paint rather than wrappingsat least on as much of him as she could see i greet you jonathan yeager she replied doing her best to say the name as sam yeager had are you truly a missile radar technician no superior female he answered still speaking the language of the race slowly and carefully the corners of his mouth turned upward that kassquit had learned was an expression of amiability he went on i wear the body paint for decoration and amusement no more i see kassquit said though not at all sure she did she continued and i greet you sam yeager you are surely senior to your hatchling so i am remiss in making my greetings out of order i apologize do not fret about it i am not offended sam yeager replied i am not such an easy fellow to offend i brought my hatchling along with me so you could see that we also have bridges between the race and the tosevites you are such a bridge yourself i am given to understand kassquit said yes that is also a truth sam yeager agreed we have realized the race is going to be on tosev for a long time to come that means we are going to have to deal with it one way or another and besides he glanced over to jonathan yeager like kassquit he had to turn his whole head to do it he couldnt just flick one eye turret toward the other tosevite in the screen far more than his words that motion reminded her she was his biological kin besides he is ignorant enough to think the race is a whole lot of fun was that an insult kassquit looked toward sam yeagers hatchling the corners of jonathan yeagers mouth turned up again truth he said and added an emphatic cough what sort of truth kassquit asked bewildered that you are ignorant he will never admit that sam yeager said with a barking tosevite laugh another insult evidently not for jonathan yeager laughed too laughed and said notruth that things having to do with the race are fun fun kassquit chewed on the word she knew what it meant of course but shed never thought of applying it to the race or the way the race lived more bewildered than ever she asked why good question sam yeager said cheerfully i never have been able to figure it out myself then he waved one of his handsone of his fleshy softskinned hands so like hersback and forth palm out i do not intend you to take that seriously you never intend anyone to take anything you say seriously jonathan yeager said and both big uglies laughed then the younger one turned his face back toward kassquit he too had to move his whole head kassquit watched in fascination the wild tosevites took such motions utterly for granted while shed never failed to feel selfconscious about them but then they all used those motions while she was the only individual she knew who did jonathan yeager went on of course the race is fun it is new and exciting and fascinating is it any wonder that i think as l do alien kassquit thought she might share biology with these big ugliesevery move they made reminded her she did share biology with thembut she would never have put new and exciting and fascinating all in the same sentence i do not understand she confessed do not worry about it sam yeager said it is a wonder that my hatchling thinks at all let alone that he thinks in any particular way thank you jonathan yeager said with an emphatic cough obviously intended to mean he was doing anything but thanking the older tosevite no male of the race would have used the cough that way but kassquit understood it so did sam yeager who started laughing again he said a lot of tosevite males and females of about my hatchlings age feel the same way about the race as he does the race is new on tosev which to many big uglies automatically makes it exciting and fascinating and the race is powerful that makes it exciting and fascinating too kassquit understood the connection between power and fascination that connection had helped make the rabotevs and hallessi into contented citizens of the empire it would she hoped help do the same for the big uglies the connection between novelty and fascination still eluded her so did another connection why would tosevitesshe didnt want to call big uglies big uglies even if sam yeager casually used the termbe so interested in the race when you are constantly concerned with reproduction which matters to the race only during the mating season i am sorry superior female but i did not follow all of that jonathan yeager said i did i will translate sam yeager said turning to his hatchling he spoke in their own languageenglish kassquit had learned it was called jonathan yeager coughed and flushed his change in color was easily visible on the monitor sam yeager returned to the language of the race i think you embarrassed him partly because at his age he is constantly concerned with reproductionthe younger yeager let out another indignant wordless squawk which the older one ignoredand partly because it is not our usual custom to talk so frankly about reproductive matters with strangers why not kassquit was confused again if they concern you all the time why do you not talk about them all the time and why did you yourself talk about them with me in our last conversation those are good questions sam yeager admitted as for the second i guess i was taken by surprise when i found out you were a tosevite like me for the first i do not have an answer as good as i might like one reason is that we mate in private i suppose another is that we usually form mating pairs and try to make those pairings permanent mating outside a pair is liable to destroy it why kassquit asked again because it shows a lack of trust inside the pair sam yeager answered since the race raised you you probably would not understand maybe i do kassquit said slowly you are speaking of a competition for attention are you not she remembered how jealous shed been of felless when the female of the race began taking away ttomalss attention which shed largely had to herself till the colonization fleet arrived yes that is exactly what i am speaking of sam yeager replied perceptive of you to gasp it when you have not known it yourself you think not do you kassquit said this proves only that you do not know everything there is to know she did not hide her bitterness part of her didnt want to show it to a couple of wild big uglies the rest didnt care about the embarrassment in that after all when would she see them or deal with them again who else that she knew would ever see them or deal with them and showing someone anyone that bitterness was such a relief sam yeager bared his teeth in the tosevite expression of amiability i never said i did know everything superior female i have spent a lot of years having it proved to me that i do not but i know i am ignorant which puts me ahead of some of the males and females who think they are smart you speak in paradoxes i see kassquit answered which for some reason made the big ugly laugh again annoyed kassquit said i must go for i have an appointment farewell abruptly she broke the connection after a moment she sighed in relief it was over but then she stood up and stood taller and straighter than usual no small pride filled her she had given as good as shed got she was sure of that she had seen the wild big uglies facetoface and she had prevailed as sam yeager and his son left the races consulate in los angeles and headed for his car he turned to jonathan and asked well what did you think of that it was pretty strange dad jonathan answered and sam could hardly disagree his son went on it was interesting too i guess i got to practice the language some more thats always good you spoke well and you look a lot more like a lizard than i do too yeager said thats one of the big reasons i brought you along to give her somebody who might look halfway familiar to deal with maybe it helped some i hope so he shook his head that poor kid listening to her seeing her makes me feel terrible about what were doing to mickey and donald her face is like liu meis jonathan said as they got to the car it doesnt show anything nope sam agreed sliding behind the wheel i guess what they say is you have to learn how to use expressions when youre a baby or else you dont since the lizards faces dont move much the kids they took couldnt do that he glanced over at his son were you just looking at her face jonathan coughed and spluttered a little but rallied fast ive seen lots of bare tits before dad theyre not such a big deal for me as they would have been for you when you were my age and that was undoubtedly true sam sighed as he started the engine having em out in the open so much takes away some of the thrill i think he said his son looked at him as if hed started speaking some language much stranger than that of the race so he was to jonathan he was speaking the language of the nostalgic oldtimer a tongue the young would never understand proving as much jonathan changed the subject she seems pretty smart he said yeah she does sam nodded as he got on the southbound freeway for the ride back to gardena that probably helps her i bet shed be a lot crazier if she were stupid she didnt seem all that crazy to me his son said she acts more like a lizard than a person yeah but heck half my friends do that he chuckled so did sam yeager but he shook his head while he did it theres a difference your friends are acting as you said hed been married to barbara for quite a while and most of the time he automatically kept his grammar clean but kassquit isntacting i mean the race is all she knows as best i can tell were the first big uglies shes ever seen facetoface were at least as strange to her as she is to us he watched jonathan think about that and slowly nod no ordinary person would have come out and talked about uh reproduction like that well it would have been surprising anyhow sam said but she thinks about it the way the lizards would she cant help thattheyve taught her everything she knows he took a hand off the wheel to remove his uniform caphed gone to the consulate in full regaliaand scratch his head still shes not made the way they are she cant even be as old as you are jonathan if shes like anybody else your age shes going to get urges i wonder what she does about them what can she do up there by herself jonathan asked what anybody by himself or by herself can do sam raised an eyebrow sooner or later you find out it doesnt grow hair on the palm of your hand that made jonathan turn red and clam up for the rest of the drive back home sam used the quiet to do some thinking of his own not only seeing kassquit but also listening to her trying so hard to be something she couldnt be did bring on guilt about mickey and donald no matter how hard he and his family tried to raise them up as people they would never be human beings any more than kassquit could really be a lizard and what would happen when they met lizards as they surely would one day would they be as confused and dismayed as kassquit had been at the prospect of talking with a couple of genuine human beings probably he didnt see how they would be able to help it it wasnt fair they hadnt asked to be hatched in an incubator on his service porch but nobody human or lizard had any say about where he got his start in life mickey and donald would have to make the best of it they could as did everybody else on four worlds and sam and his family would have to help he hoped hed stay around to help being fiftyseven had a way of putting that kind of thought in his mind he was in pretty good shape for his age but every time he shaved in the morning the first glance in the mirror reminded him he wouldnt be here forever barbara could take over for him if he went too soon somehow contemplating his own death was easier than thinking about hers and jonathan and whomever jonathan married he hoped that would be karen she was a good kid and she and jonathan had been thick as thieves lately after a moment he shook his head back to business he muttered business was getting a summary of the conversation jonathan and he had had with kassquit down on paper and adding his impressions to it he was glad hed talked with his son it helped him clarify his own thoughts he had to use the humanmade computer to draft his report with the one hed got from the lizards he couldnt print in english but was stuck with the language of the race kassquit might have found a report in the lizards language interesting but it wouldnt have amused his superiors when he finished the report and pressed the key that would print it a glorified electric typewriter hammered into life the printer hooked up to the lizardbuilt computer was a lot more elegant using powdered carbon and a skelkwank light to form the characters and images it produced you needed a powerful magnifier to tell its output was made up of tiny dots and didnt come from a typewriter or even from set type he read through the report made a couple of small corrections in ink and set it aside the printer kept humming till he turned it off he started to turn off the computer too but changed his mind instead he hooked himself up to the us network he hadnt tried visiting the archive that stored signals traffic from the night the colonization fleet was attacked for quite a while the more he learned about that the better his chances of nailing the culprit and passing what he knew on to the lizards theyll never figure out whether it was the nazis or the russians not on their own they wont he thought the lizards were less naive than they had been when they came to earth but humans long used to cheating one another still had little trouble deceiving them and because the lizards werent human they often missed clues that would have been obvious to a person there we go sam muttered as the name of the archive appeared on his screen he waited for the table of contents to come up below it so he could find exactly which transcripts would be most useful to him the list took its own sweet time appearing compared to the races machine this one was slow slow instead of the contents list he got a blank dark screen pale letters announced connection broken please try again you cheap piece of junk he snarled and whacked the side of the case that held the screen that didnt change the message of course it did go a little way toward easing his annoyance the lizards computer worked all the time the machine made in the usa broke down if he looked at it sideways but he was a stubborn man he wouldnt have spent eighteen years riding trains and buses through every corner of the bush leagues if he hadnt been stubborn he wouldnt have risen to lieutenant colonel either not when hed joined the army as a thirtyfiveyearold private with full upper and lower dentures and he wouldnt have got so far with the lizards either and so even though he kept swearing under his breath he patiently reconnected the computer to the network and navigated toward that archive again this time he didnt even get the archival name before he lost his connection he scowled and stared at the dark screen with the now familiar message on it junk he repeated but now he sounded less sure whether the fault lay inside his computer maybe the chain connecting him to that distant archiveactually he didnt know how distant it was only that it existedhad some rusty links in it he wondered if he ought to report the problem he didnt wonder for long though while his security clearance was high enough to give him access to that archive he had no formal needtoknow nobody above him would be happy to find out hed been snooping around in things that were formally none of his business the powers that be would frown all the harder because hed already established a reputation for snooping hell with it he said and this time he did turn off the computer maybe the simplest explanation was that somebody somewhere had made a tidy profit selling the us governmentor would it be the phone company some lousy wiring he was making himself a bologna sandwich hed got sick of ham when a car stopped in front of the house the sound of the closing door made him look up from pickles and mayonnaise a young man hed never seen before was walking across the lawn toward the front porch another one sat in the car waiting the one coming up to the house had his right hand in the pocket of his blue jeans after somebody had taken some potshots at the house that triggered an alarm bell in sam he hurried to the hutch in the front room and pulled out his barbara came into the front room from the direction of the bedroom shed spotted the guy too and was going to find out what he wanted when she saw the automatic in sams hands her eyes opened enormously wide he used it to motion her away up on the porch came the stranger before he could knock sam opened the front door and stuck the in his face take that hand out of your pocket real nice and slow he said pleasantly and then over his shoulder honey call the cops sure pop anything you say the young man answered youve got the persuader there all right but his hand moved swiftly not slowly and had a pistol in it as it cleared his pocket he must have thought yeager would hesitate long enough to let him shoot first it was the last mistake he ever made the jerked against sams wrist as he fired the young man went down he wouldnt get up again either not after taking one between the eyes at pointblank range he kept jerking and twitching but that was only because his body didnt know he was dead yet tires screaming the car in which hed come roared away barbara and jonathan came dashing out at the sound of the shot thank god barbara said when she saw sam standing she turned away from the corpse on the porch christ i havent seen anything like that since the fighting the police are on the way good ill wait for em right here sam said they arrived a couple of minutes later lights flashing siren yowling what the hell happened here one of them asked though he was talking more about why than about whatthat was obvious somebody shot at this house from the street last year sergeant yeager answered he explained what hed seen and what hed done finishing he tried to draw on me and i shot him his pal took off as soon as i did okay lieutenant colonel ive got your side of it said the sergeant whod been taking notes he turned to his partner see just what the guy was holding clyde right the other cop used his handkerchief to pick up the weapon it was a nearly identical to sams clyde looked up at yeager he was loaded for bear all right lucky you were too he glanced over at the sergeant if this isnt selfdefense i dont know what the devil it is a hell of a mess on this guys porch the sergeant said he looked back to yeager no charges i can see lieutenant colonel like clyde says this one looks openandshut but dont leave townwere going to have about a million questions for you maybe more once we find out who this character is and what he had in mind if i get orders to go ill have to follow them yeager said ive got to report this to my superiors too if you do have to leave let us know where youre going and how long youll be there the police sergeant said and if i was your co id give you a medal if you didnt do what needed doing you wouldnt be able to report to him now thats for damn sure he raised an eyebrow you think this guy had anything to do with the shots last year damned if i know sam answered maybe well be able to find out ttomalss was happily busy not only did he have endless work to do on his stint in the reich a stint that had only seemed endless but his long experiment with kassquit had entered a new and fascinating phase now that you have made the acquaintance of these tosevites through electronic messages and by telephone would you be interested in meeting them in person he asked no superior sir kassquit answered at once or at least not yet his tosevite hatchling perched awkwardly on the chair across the desk from his own not only was it the wrong shape for her posterior but it was also too small ttomalss remembered when she could hardly even climb up into ithe remembered when shed hardly been able to do anything but suck up nutrient fluid make horrid excretions and yowl he had to remind himself she wasnt like that any more she was these days startlingly far from foolish still she needed guiding i have reviewed the recording of your conversation with these two big uglies he saidthis recording had been made with her knowledge and consent for their kind they do indeed seem remarkably sophisticated about the race this makes sense since the senior male named yeager is one of their experts on us if you are ever to meet tosevites not under our rule they seem good candidates i understand that superior sir kassquit said but i am not yet ready to endure such a meeting even talking with them by telephone was most disturbing more than i expected it to be why ttomalss asked he was recording this conversation too why superior sir yes kassquit was ever more her own person these days she gave the counter question a fine sardonic edge it was disturbing to talk to beings who look like me it was also disturbing to talk to beings who think nothing like me to have both sets of circumstances combined was more than doubly disturbing i assure you i see ttomalss said and after a little intellectual effort he did i suppose hatchlings of the race raised by the big uglies if there were such unfortunates would be disturbed by their first meeting with true males and females of their own species yes i suppose they would kassquit agreed if there were any such i would be interested in talking with them if we had some language in common it would be intriguing to learn whether their experiences paralleled mine here now ttomalss looked at her with alarm and dismay she didnt usually speak of herself as being apart from the race even though she was contact with the wild big uglies truly had disturbed her he did his best to reassure her this is a circumstance unlikely to arise the tosevites lack the patience needed to carry out such a longterm project after hed spoken he wondered if he was right the big uglies might be impatient but they owned boundless curiosity if they could somehow get their hands on eggs but unlike tosevites he didnt show his thoughts on his face kassquit could have no notion of what went through his mind her own thoughts were taking a different trajectory it would not happen for some years at any rate they could not have even attempted to raise hatchlings until the colonization fleet arrived as i say there is no evidence none that they have attempted to do such a thing ttomalss replied now shall we withdraw from hypotheticals and return to what can in fact be established as you wish superior sir unlike an independent big ugly kassquit had learned proper subordination ttomalss asked her under what circumstances might you eventually agree to a direct meeting with these big uglies i need further conversations with them kassquit answered only then will i be able to decide if i want to take that step not unreasonable ttomalss admitted now that he thought on it he was not altogether sure he wanted to risk her either she had never been exposed to or immunized against tosevite diseases there were many of those and the race was not well equipped to combat them losing kassquit would be a devastating setback i think i may need further conversations with our physicians before permitting the meeting too i must plan with all possible forethought certainly kassquit said what other course to take ttomalss did not reply not to a question obviously rhetorical had he been a big ugly though his features would have twisted themselves into the expression that showed amiability you are not altogether a tosevite he thought my teachingthe race teachinghas made you far less headstrong than you would be otherwise what has succeeded with you can succeed with your whole species kassquit said may i go now superior sir yes of course ttomalss answered i thank you for your efforts in this matter you must now determine whether you are willing to attempt a physical meeting with these big uglies and i must determine how dangerous to your health such a meeting might be after kassquit had left his compartment the senior researcher permitted himself a long sigh of relief he was very glad kassquit had declined his offer to get her a wild male tosevite with whom she could relieve the tensions of her continuous sexual drive he had not considered the possible medical consequences of such a meeting before he made the offer had she accepted he would have felt dutybound to carry it out had she fallen ill on account of anything so trivial as sexuality he would never have forgiven himself he went through the recording of her conversation with the big uglies again the younger tosevite named yeager particularly fascinated him as far as appearance went he might almost have hatched from the same egg as kassquit but his accent and his limited understanding made it plain he was only a wild tosevite ttomalss knew there were big uglies who imitated the race every way they could that encouraged him as far as he was concerned it marked a step toward assimilation he had seen no such tosevites in the reich the leaders there having evidently come to the same conclusion had banned body paint and shaved heads in the territory they held considering what passed for justice in that territory ttomalss found it unsurprising that few tosevites there dared flout the law though the younger big ugly was more interesting to look at ttomalss slowly realized the older one was much more interesting to hear like jonathan yeager sam yeager spoke the language of the race with a curious accent and with odd turns of phrase but listening to him ttomalss found that he didor at least couldthink like a male of the race the senior researcher wondered if he understood big uglies anywhere near as well as the older yeager understood the race he was honest enough to admit that he didnt know he himself was capablehe didnt denigrate his own abilitiesbut the tosevite seemed inspired how he wondered could a big ugly have prepared himself to become an expert on another intelligent species when his kind hadnt known there were any other intelligent species to meet if he ever conversed with the elder yeager he would have to ask that question he was contemplating other questions when the telephone hissed hed been forming a clever thought it disappeared that made him hiss in annoyance resignedly he said senior researcher ttomalss speakingi greet you and i greet youyou who have escaped from the reich said felless whose image overlay the now muted views of kassquit and the two big uglies named yeager you have no idea how lucky you are you are mistaken superior female ttomalss answered with an emphatic cough i know exactly how lucky i am spirits of emperors past grant that you soon find yourself able to make a similar escape felless cast down her eyes in a miserable voice she said it shall not be done she sighed you transgressed against the deutsche and were ordered out of the reich while i transgressed against our own kind and was ordered to stay in this accursed place where is the justice in that transgressed against our ttomalss began but his confusion quickly faded they caught you with your tongue in the ginger jar did they you might say so felless said bitterly veffani and most of a team of senior officials from cairo mated with me when i was summoned to a meeting in the ambassadors office just after i had tasted now there was a scandal to keep the embassy buzzing for a long time ttomalss had to work to keep from laughing in felless face that would be crueltempting but cruelafter shed disgraced herself i do not understand why you were ordered to stay there he said as punishment she snapped i was hoping you would have a sympathetic hearing diaphragm but i see that is too much to ask for i am lucky enough not to have acquired the ginger habit he said and it is a less urgent matter with me since i am a male unfair felless exclaimed i did not ask to release pheromones after tasting i wish i would not i also wish i were not going to lay another clutch of eggs but wishes are pointless are they not ttomalss remembered the extravagant wishes hed made while liu han held him in captivity no not always he said they can help keep hope alive and hope matters most when things look worst hope felless said my only hope is to get away from this dreadful place and that is what i cannot do she paused no i take that back my other hope is to be able to get more ginger before my present supply runs out that at least i expect i will be able to accomplish her image disappeared from the screen ttomalss stared for a little while at the soundless pictures of the two wild big uglies and of kassquit with a sigh he ended the playback of that recording too he couldnt concentrate on it poor felless for all her expertise she hadnt adapted well to tosev shed expected it to be far more like home than it really was if shed stayed aboard a starship or gone to one of the new towns on the island continent or on the main continental mass she might have done well enough but her field of specialization involved dealing with the alien natives of tosev who had proved far more alien than the race could possibly have imagined before setting out from home well i know all about that ttomalss thought he knew it in more intimate detail than hed ever imagined thanks to his captivity in china and thanks to his raising kassquit one way or another everyone in the conquest fleet had learned the lessons with which the males and females of the colonization fleet were still grappling the colonists didnt want to adapt there were so many of them they didnt have to adapt to the same degree as had the males of the conquest fleet they have it easy ttomalss thought we did the real work and they do not appreciate it he wondered if the older generation of the big uglies ever had such thoughts about their dealings with the race and if the younger ones were as ungrateful as the males and females of the colonization fleet he doubted it atvar studied a map of the regions of tosev the race ruled some parts of it were a tranquil yellowgreen others angry red still others in between he turned to pshing his adjutant fascinating how little correlation there is between this map and the one reflecting active rebellion he observed truth exalted fleetlord pshing agreed the subregions of the main continental mass known as china and india accept veneration of the spirits of emperors past almost without complaint as do large stretches of the region known as africa yet china and india still seethe with political strife while africa is largely tranquil intriguing so it is atvar pointed to another section of the map yet the southern part of the lesser continental mass is afire with resentment against us because of this measure and that had also been one of the areas where our administration was least difficult and annoying it is a puzzlement we do not yet understand everything we should about the big uglies pshing said a world i have discovered since our arrival here is a very large place to get to know in detail that is indeed a truth the fleetlords emphatic cough told how much of a truth he thought it was he followed the cough with a sigh and of course there is this central region of the main continental mass where rebellion and resistance to veneration of the spirits of emperors past skitter side by side pshing also sighed such a pity too because this region really is among the most homelike on the whole planet i have actually come to enjoy cairos climate it could easily be that of a temperate region back on home now if only the tosevites were temperate expect temperance from a big ugly and you are doomed to disappointment atvar said his mouth came open and he waggled his lower jaw from side to side in a wry laugh expect anything from a big ugly and you are doomed to disappointment what have we had on tosev but one surprise after another nothing his adjutant replied we can only hope we have also succeeded in giving the tosevites a few surprises he turned one eye turret back toward the map i truly do wonder what accounts for the differences in response to our edict part of it i suppose springs from the differences in local superstition atvar said but the role these differences play still baffles me the followers of the jewish superstition for instance have always been well disposed to us but they are among those who most strongly resist venerating spirits of emperors past they bombard me with petitions and memorials even moishe russie does nothing but complain about it i know exalted fleetlord pshing said i have shielded you from several of his calls too have you well i thank you atvar said so many of the big uglies are so passionately convinced of their own correctness they are willing to die sometimes eager to die to maintain it this is one of the things that makes them such a delight to govern as you must be aware as if to underscore his words the tosevite howling that was the call to prayer of the muslim superstition floated through the open windows of his officeexcept during the worst of the rioting when he needed the armor glass as protection against assassins he saw no point to closing those windows against the fine mild air of cairo here and there spatters of gunfire accompanied the howling no the locals were not reconciled to paying a tax for the privilege of keeping their foolish beliefs with rational beings lowering the tax as we did would also have lowered the resentment he grumbled with big uglies before he could go on fulminating the telephone started making a racket at atvars gesture pshing answered it no sooner had the callers image appeared on the screen than the adjutant assumed the posture of respect saying i greet you exalted fleetlord and i greet you pshing reffet said but i need to speak with your principal at onceat once do you hear me one moment please pshing replied and muted the sound still down in the posture of respect he asked atvar what is your pleasure exalted fleetlord speaking with his opposite number from the colonization fleet was not exactly atvars pleasure but it was sometimes necessary maybe this would be one of those times he strode up to the telephone touched the sound control and said i greet you reffet how now how now indeed reffet returned how many more males and females from the colonization fleet will face assault and perhaps assassination because of your efforts to tax tosevite superstitions no atvar did not care for the fleetlord from the colonization fleet not even a little bit with a certain sardonic relish he replied you have complained because we did not in your view do enough to bring tosev into the empire now that we are taking a step to do exactly that you are complaining again you cannot have it on both forks of the tongue at once answer my question and spare me the rhetoric if you would be so kind reffet said we are suffering can you not perceive that unimpressed atvar answered my own males the males of the conquest fleet are suffering more i remind you they are the ones who actually have to enforce the new edict and who face the dangers inherent in doing so colonists if they are prudent should not be at great risk they do need to remember that big uglies even in areas we rule are not fully acclimated to us are in other words wild beasts reffet said sarcastic in his own right or would be wild beasts did they not have the cleverness of intelligent beings and either you do not know what you are talking about in respect to relative danger or you have not heard of the latest tosevite outrage word of which just reached me atvar knew a sinking feeling in the middle of his gut hed known that feeling too many times on tosev he kept hoping not to have it again and kept being disappointed i have not heard the latest he admitted you had better tell me tell you i shall reffet said one of the new towns in this region of the main continental mass the one near the attacked desalination plantsan image on the screen showed the area known as the arabian peninsulahas just suffered a devastating attack a tosevite drove a large truck loaded with explosives into the center of the place and touched them off killing himself and an undetermined but large number of males and females physical damage is also extensive by the emperor atvar said and cast down his eyes no i had not yet heard the only thing i will say in aid of this is that it is cursedly difficult to thwart an individual willing to pay with his own life to accomplish some goal this is not the least of the problems we face in attempting to consolidate our control on this world for the big uglies are far more willing to resort to such behavior than any other species we know they are no doubt especially willing to resort to it when you incite them reffet said as he spoke words crawled across the bottom of the screen informing atvar of the bombing incident all over again atvar read them with one eye while looking at reffet with the other a detail caught the attention of the fleetlord of the conquest fleet how did this big ugly manage to drive his vehicle into the center of the new town without being searched the inhabitants must have assumed he was there to deliver something or perform a service reffet answered one does not commonly believe a big ugly in a truck is come on a mission of murder in that part of tosev with the present stresses why not atvar asked the males of the conquest fleet cannot do everything for you reffet a checkpoint outside the town might have saved the colonists much sorrow colonists are not soldiers reffet said colonists can certainly be police atvar answered and we have already begun to discuss the need for colonists to become soldiers the males of the conquest fleet cannot carry the whole burden forever before all that long we shall grow old and die if the race has no soldiers left after that who will keep the big uglies from eating us up if we have a permanent soldiers time on this world how can we be a proper part of the empire reffet returned the meaning of the empire is that we have soldiers only in emergencies and for conquests when is it not an emergency on tosev atvar asked a question for which reffet could have no good answer before the empire unified home it always had soldiers for it always needed them that seems to be true on this world as well you may regret iti certainly regret it but can you deny it colonists will scream if you seek to make some of them into soldiers the fleetlord of the colonization fleet said can you deny that how loud are they screaming because of those killed or wounded in the new town atvar asked reffet sighed this is not the world they were told to anticipate when they went into cold sleep back on home many of them are still having difficulty adjusting to that i understand for i am still having difficulty adjusting to it myself really i never would have noticed atvar said it sounded like praise reffet knew it wasnt he glared at atvar the fleetlord of the conquest fleet went on colonists can deal with tosev as they imagined it to be or they can deal with it as it is i know which of those courses is likely to produce more satisfactory results i wish more colonists would come to the same conclusion rather than screaming because things are not as they would prefer that is unfair reffet said we have labored long and hard to establish ourselves on this planet since our arrival here you do not give us enough credit for it and you do not give us enough credit for all the laboryes and all the dying toowe of the conquest fleet did so you would have a world you could colonize even in part atvar replied all we get is blame who back on home would have thought the big uglies would have either trucks or explosives to load aboard them and yet you colonists shout abuse at us for botching the war you still cannot see how lucky we were to come away with a draw my males and females are not meant to be soldiers reffet said stubbornly are they then meant to be victims atvar inquired that seems to be the only other choice i grieve that this terrorist assault against them succeeded they will have to play a part if they want to keep others from succeeding you ask too much reffet said you give too little atvar retorted in perfect mutual loathing they both broke the connection at the same time as strahas driver pulled to a halt in front of the house ristin and ullhass shared the big ugly said well shiplord it seems as though you will have your chance to talk to sam yeager here instead of having to go all the way to gardena why do you say that straha peered through the windows in the front part of the house he did not see yeager or any other tosevite the driver barked laughter because that is his automobile there parked just in front of us oh straha felt foolish he had never noticed what sort of motorcar yeager drove all he had noticed about american motorcars was that they came in far more varieties than seemed necessary he undid his safety belt and opened the door will you come in and join us ullhass asked that you be included in the invitation if you so desired i thank you but no the big ugly answered for one thing i do not much care for crowds whether of the race or of tosevites and for another i can do a better job of protecting you from out here than from in there i am assuming you will be in less danger from guests than from uninvited strangers i believe that is a valid assumption yes straha said if it is not i have more and more diverse difficulties than i would have thought i shall return in due course i hope you will not be bored waiting for me it is my duty the driver said enjoy yourself shiplord straha slammed the car door shut and headed for the house he intended to do just that ullhass and ristin always had good alcohol and plenty of ginger they also had interesting guests no matter what the driver thought because they were only smallscale traitors the race had long since forgiven them males and females from the land under the races control could visit here without opprobrium where they would have caused a scandal by coming to see straha at the doorway ullhass folded himself into the posture of respect i greet you shiplord he said as deferential as if straha still commanded the th emperor yower i am always pleased when you honor my home by your presence i thank you for inviting me straha replied on the whole that was true these gatherings were as close as he could come to the society of his own kind and if ullhass like ristin chose to wear redwhiteandblue body paint that showed he was a us prisoner of war in place of the proper markings of the race well hed been doing that for a long time now and straha could overlook if not forgive it come in come in ullhass urged and stood aside to let straha do just that you have been here beforeyou will know where we keep the alcohol and the herb and the food help yourself to anything you think will please you we are also doing some outdoor cooking in back of the house with meats both from tosev and from home sure enough odors of smoke and of hot meat reached strahas scent receptors the smells are intriguing indeed he said i must be careful not to slobber on your floor ullhass laughed straha went into the kitchen and poured himself some rumlike most of the race he had no use for whiskey he loaded a small plate with greek olives and salted nuts and potato chips then went out through the open sliding glass door into the back yard sam yeager stood out there offering helpful advice to ristin who was cremating meat on a grill above a charcoal fire i greet you shiplord yeager said to straha and raised his glass in a tosevite salute good to see you how can you stand to drink that stuff straha askedyeagers glass did hold whiskey what is it good for but removing paint the big ugly sipped the nasty stuff removing troubles he answered and sipped again that startled a laugh out of straha who took a drink of rum himself well but why not remove troubles with something that tastes good he asked i like the way whiskey tastes just fine yeager answered i have spent a lot of time getting used to it and i see no point in wasting the accomplishment that made straha laugh too he enjoyed yeagers offcenter way of looking at the world have it as you will then he said every beffel goes to its own hole or so the saying has it befflem yes yeagers head bobbed up and down all of your animals here now some of them smell very tasty he pointed back to the grill on which ristin was cooking but others do you know about the rabbits in australia shiplord i know what rabbits are those hopping furry creatures with long flaps of skin channeling sound to their hearing diaphragms straha answered yeager nodded once more straha continued and i know of australia because it is one of our principal centers of colonizationnot that i will ever get to see as much of course for a moment his bitterness at exile showed through but i confess i do not know of any connection between rabbits and australia until a little more than a hundred years ago there were no rabbits in australia the tosevite told him none used to live there the settlers brought them because they were new because they had no natural enemies to speak of they spread all over australia and became great pests your animals from home are liable to do the same thing on big stretches of tosev ah i see your concern straha replied after another sip of rum he shrugged i do not know what to say about this i do not know that there is anything to be said about it your settlers i presume brought their animals with them and transformed the ecology of the areas in which they settled till it suited them better our colonists are doing the same thing here on tosev did you expect them to do otherwise if you want to know the truth shiplord i did not think much about it one way or the other sam yeager said i do not think any tosevites thought much about it till the colonization fleet came now reports from all over tosev are beginning to reach me i do not know how big a problem your animals will turn out to be but i think they will be a problem i would not be surprised if you were rightfrom a tosevite point of view of course straha said to the race these animals are a convenience not a problem as if to prove what a convenience the races domesticated animals could be ristin chose that moment to shoutin englishcome and get it straha let out a small snort of dismay he knew ristin and ullhass had taken on as many tosevite ways as they could but a call like that offended his sense of dignity he was not so offended however as to keep from taking chunks of azwaca still sizzling from their time above the coals sam yeager did the same unlike strahas driver he showed no reluctance about trying the races foods after his first bite he waved to get ristins attention and spoke in english thats pretty damn good glad you like it the former infantrymale answered again in the same tongue sure enough he was nothing but a big ugly with scales and eye turrets but he did have good food straha tried the ssefenji next a grainier tougher meat then azwaca and less sweet to the tongue he didnt like it so well but it too was a taste of home and it turned out to go very well with cashews straha walked back into the house to get some more nuts and filled up his glass of rum while he was there he glanced out the kitchen window there sat his driver in the motorcar looking as best straha could tell bored but the big ugly was in fact alert straha had never known him when he wasnt alert seeing straha in the window he waved and saluted not many tosevites could have recognized the exshiplord from such a brief glance but he did straha waved back in grudging but genuine respect then he headed outside once more for another helping of ssefenji ribs he caught sam yeagers eye again and how is the tosevite raised by the race he asked well enough yeager answered my hatchling and i spoke with her again not so long ago and with video this time she would be a very attractive female did she not shave off all her hairand were her face more lively of course attractive how could you judge over the telephone before yeager could answer straha did it for him never mind i forgot that you big uglies judge such matters as much by sight as by odor more by sight i would say yeager answered our females are the same in judging a males mating display but with males it is a matter of scent straha looked for a way to change the subject when not incited by pheromones he did not care to discuss matters pertaining to mating having seen his driver put a new thought in his mind are you aware that you have made enemies by poking your snout into places where it is not welcome i quote someone in a position to know whereof he speaks i bet i can guess who he is too yeager said straha neither confirmed nor denied that the big uglys laugh was harsh yes shiplord you might say i am aware of that you just might i killed a man last week to keep him from killing me by the emperor straha exclaimed i did not know that why did he want to do such a thing he is too dead to ask and his pal escaped yeager answered i wish i knew straha studied him has this incident any connection to the big uglies who fired shots at your home last year when the chinese females and i were visiting i do not know that either and i wish i did sam yeager said as a matter of fact i was wondering if you ever found out anything more about those big uglies myself personally no straha replied assassination is a tactic the race seldom employs my driver is of the opinion that the chinese females were the likeliest targets for the big uglies he is also of the opinion that you may have been a target yourself this due to your snoutpoking tendencies he is is he yeagers mobile mouth narrowed till he seemed to have hardly more in the way of lips than a male of the race your driver has all sorts of interesting opinions one of these days i may have to sit down with him for a good long talk i might learn a few things on the other fork of the tongue you might not straha told him he is not in the habit of revealing a great deal i for one am certain he knows a great deal more than he says that does not sound much like a big ugly sam yeager remarked and now his mouth stretched wide to show amusement but his expression quickly became more nearly neutral it does sound like a particular kind of big uglyone in the business of intelligence for instance are you surprised at that straha felt an exiles odd sort of pride i am an intelligence resource of some value to your notempire well so you are shiplord you sam yeager began but straha stopped listening just then as had happened before at ullhass and ristins gatherings a female from the colonization fleet must have decided to try a taste of ginger which was legal here in the united states as soon as her pheromones floated outside straha along with the rest of the males in the back yard lost interest in everything else he hurried into the house hoping for a chance to mate when mordechai anielewicz came up to the door of his flat he heard shouting inside he sighed as he raised his hand to knock on the door both miriam and david were old enough to have strong opinions of their own these days and young enough to be passionately certain their opinions were the only right and proper ones those of their parents being idiotic by assumption no wonder life sometimes got noisy he knocked as he did so he cocked his head to one side and listened one eyebrow rose this wasnt miriam or david arguing with his wife this was heinrich and he sounded even more passionate than either of his older siblings was in the habit of doing not only was he the youngest he was also usually the sunniest what could have made him as david anielewicz opened the door mordechai heard a squeak it wasnt a squeak from hinges that wanted oiling it was much too friendly and endearing for that he didnt anielewicz exclaimed he sure did his older son answered he brought it home about an hour ago mothers been trying to make him get rid of it ever since no sooner had anielewicz shut the door than heinrich doing an excellent impersonation of a tornado dashed up to him shouting she said i could keep him she said if i got one i could keep him she said father and now i did and now she wont let me tears streaked the tornados cheeksmostly mordechai judged tears of fury take it easy he said well talk about it back inside the flat the beffel squeaked again it sounded as if it wanted to stay but whowho human anywaycould know how a beffel was supposed to sound his wife strode into the short entry hall a moment later it was getting crowded in there but no one seemed to want to move away that thing that horrible thing has got to go bertha declared its not horrible heinrich said the beffel let out yet another squeak it didnt sound like a horrible thing it sounded like a squeeze toy heinrich went on and you said that if i caught one i could keep him you did you did but i didnt think youd really go and do it his mother said that doesnt matter anielewicz said bertha looked appalled mordechai knew he would hear moremuch moreabout this later but he went on you didnt have to make the promise but you did now id say youve got to keep it heinrich started dancing there wasnt room for that in the narrow hallway but he did it anyhow i can keep him i can keep him i can keep him he sang anielewicz took him by the shoulder and forcibly stopped the dance you can keep him he agreed ignoring the dismay that still hadnt left his wifes face you can keep him as long as you take care of him and as long as he doesnt cause trouble if he makes horrible messes or if he starts biting people out he goes on his ear befflem didnt have ears but that had nothing to do with anything i promise father heinrichs face shone you have to keep your promise just like mother has to keep hers mordechai said and his son nodded eagerly he went on and even if you do the beffel goes if he turns out to be a nuisance his younger son nodded again he wont i know he wont a biblical prophet listening to the word of god could have spoken no more certainly squeak mordechai chuckled he couldnt help himself well let me have a look at this fabulous beast come on heinrich grabbed his arm hes great youll see he led mordechai into the front room the beffel was under the coffee table one of its eye turrets swiveled toward anielewicz and his son it squeaked and trotted toward them heinrich beamed there you see it likes people maybe it does at that anielewicz crouched down and held out his hand to the beffel as he might have to give a strange dog or cat the chance to smell him he was much more ready to jerk that hand back in a hurry than he would have been with a dog or a cat though but the beffel acted as friendly as it sounded after one more of those ridiculous squeaks it stuck out its tongue at him the end of the long forked organ amazingly like a lizards brushed the back of his hand the beffel cocked its head to one side as if trying to decide what to make of something unfamiliar then with yet another squeak it butted anielewiczs leg with its head you see heinrich said you see he likes you pancer likes you pancer eh mordechai raised an eyebrow youre going to call him tank in polish sure his son replied why not with scales all over him hes armored like a tank all right youve got all the answers it seems in an experimental sort of way anielewicz scratched the beffels head what do you think of that pancer he likes this better heinrich said and rubbed the beffel under the chin the beffel put its head up so he could rub it more easily its tail thumped the carpet if it wasnt enjoying itself it put on a mighty fine act maybe heinrich really did have all the answers how did you find out it likes that mordechai asked i dont know his son sounded impatient i just did thats all he rubbed pancer some more in ecstasy the beffel rolled over onto its back heinrich scratched its belly whose scales were a couple of shades paler than those on its back it wriggled around and let out several more preposterous squeaks david watched all this in fascination bertha with an expression that said she was a long way from reconciled to having the creature in the flat miriam chose that moment to come home from her music lesson pancer squeaked at her too she didnt squeak she squawked she squawked even louder when she found out the beffel would be staying oh mother how could you she cried and retreated to her room the beffel started to follow her heinrich held on to it that was one of the wiser things hed done in his young life anielewicz asked since you magically know all about this creature do you happen to know what it eats i gave it some salted herrings heinrich answered it liked them fine i bet itll eat chicken too i wouldnt be surprised mordechai admitted all right well feed it like a pet and see how things go he remembered the first beffel hed seen and what it had been doing when he saw it if that doesnt work we can start giving it the neighbors cats his wife said one more thing if we find out that it belongs to some particular lizard who wants it back well give it back to him wed do the same thing if we took in a stray cat or dog heinrich sent a look of appeal to anielewicz but mordechai only nodded your mothers right thats fair and if bertha had sounded a little too hopeful such a thing might happen then she had that was all pancer ate boiled beef with enthusiasm the beffel wouldnt touch carrots but ate potatoes with the same almost thoughtful air it had had after licking mordechai as if it wasnt sure what to make of them but would give them the benefit of the doubt having eaten the little scaly creature prowled around under the diningroom table toward the end of supper miriam squealed and sprang up out of her chair it licked my ankle she said in a high shrill voice this is not the end of the world anielewicz told her sit down and finish eating she didnt you dont care she burst out you dont care at all weve got this ugly horrible lizardy thing in here and you think its funny she stormed off to her room again the rest of the meal passed in silence punctuated by occasional squeaks to berthas obvious disappointment no lizard posted a notice offering a reward for the return of a missing beffel mordechai wondered if the beast had got lost in lodz or if it had wandered into the city from one of the new lizard settlements to the east from what hed seen of the other one in the alley befflem were more than able to take care of themselves as one day followed another he got used to having pancer around heinrich was in heaven and didnt even mind changing the cat box the beffel quickly learned to use david liked the creature too even bertha stopped complaining about it only miriam stayed unhappy anielewicz had trouble understanding why she did it was as goodnatured a pet as anyone could have wanted its ugly she said the one time he asked her about it and said no more he gave up the beffel didnt strike him as ugly but he didnt think anything he said along those lines would make her change her mind a couple of nights after that heinrich shook him out of a sound sleep father i think theres a fire in the building the boy said urgently pancer woke me up hes never done that before i was going to be mad at him but then i smelled smoke anielewicz smelled it too bertha was sitting up beside him get out to the fire escape he told her take heinrich with you and pancer heinrich said ive got him right here and pancer mordechai agreed ill get the other children davids already getting miriam heinrich said which made anielewicz feel useless and inefficient but he didnt just smell smoke he could see flames nowthey were burning through the door go on then both of youand pancer he said and ran up the hall to make sure david and miriam were coming they were he had to stop abruptly to keep from running into them come on he said weve got to get out of here berthas feet and heinrichs were already rattling on the cast iron of the fire escape mordechai shoved his older son and daughter out onto the escape ahead of him he hurried after them flames were starting to lick across the carpet and the smoke was getting thick as he stepped out of the flat he paused a moment sniffing along with the smoke he smelled something else something familiar something he didnt expect to smell inside the block of flats after a heartbeats worth of puzzlement he recognized it gottenyu he exclaimed thats gasoline he didnt know if anyone heard him his familyand other people in the block of flatswere hurrying down the iron stairs they let down the last leg of the stairway with a screech of unoiled metal and reached the street more people spilled out the front door but cries and shrieks from above warned that not everyone who lived in the building would be able to get out a clanging announced the arrival of the fire engine which had to come from only a couple of blocks up lutomierska street the firemen started playing water on the blazing building mordechai turned to bertha and said that fire didnt just happen somebody set it he explained what hed smelled and what it had to mean vey iz mir his wife exclaimed who would do such a thing well i dont know he answered but whoever tried to shoot me not so long ago is a pretty good guess id say and id also say the mamzer whoever he is doesnt care how many other people he kills as long as he gets me in the flickering light of the flames berthas eyes were wide with horror as she nodded heinrich meanwhile rounded on miriam if it hadnt been for pancer we might never have woken up at all he said and thrust the beffel in miriams face after a moments hesitation she bent down and gave it a quick kiss on the snout pancer squeaked nesseref was glad she had her tsiongi he was better company than a lot of the males and females she knew he didnt argue with her he didnt try to get her to taste ginger so he could mate with her he didnt give her stupid orders he lived contentedly in her apartment and enjoyed going for walks when she took him out shed named him orbit partly because she was a shuttlecraft pilot partly because he had at first liked to walk around her on his leash if she gave him the chance little by little she was training him out of that unfortunate habit pretty soon orbit would be as fine a companion on the street as he was in the apartmentwith a couple of other exceptions one of those exceptions was as ancient as the history of domestication back on home ever more befflem roamed the streets of the new town outside jezow whenever orbit saw one of them the tsiongi seemed to think he was dutybound to try to kill the little squeaking beast as often as not the befflem were ready to squabble too that nesseref could have dealt with the race had been dealing with squabbling tsiongyu and befflem since before civilization hatched from the egg of barbarism she had more trouble with orbits encounters with tosevite flying creatures she supposed she could hardly blame the tsiongi the little feathered beasts were so slow and awkward on the ground they looked as if they ought to be the easiest prey imaginable and so joyously orbit would rush at themand they would fly away the tsiongi would leap at them miss and then turn an indignant eye turret toward nesseref as if to say they are not supposed to be able to do that to orbit the unexpected abilities of the birds were as confusing and demoralizing as the unexpected abilities of the big uglies had been to the males of the conquest fleet once one of the gray feathered creatures with green heads waited so long before taking to the air that orbits leap after it was even higher and more awkward than usual though no more successful the tsiongi crashed back to the pavement with a piteous screech as the disgruntled beast picked itself up a male called does he think he is going to learn to fly too his mouth gaped wide he plainly enjoyed his own wit nesseref didnt he has a better chance of learning to fly than you do of learning to be funny she snapped well pardon me for existing the male said i did not know the emperor had come to tosev there are no doubt a great many things you did not know nesseref said acidly by the evidence you have shown so far you demonstrate this every time you speak she and the male were eyeing each others body paint before they exchanged more insults the male was only a dataentry clerk nesseref outranked him if he tried coming back at her again she was ready to blister his hearing diaphragms he must have seen as much he turned and skittered away orbit kept on trying to catch birds so did the other tsiongyu nesseref saw in her walk along the streets of the new town noting that made the shuttlecraft pilot feel better though it did nothing for her pet and then as she was heading back toward her apartment building a beffel trotted past with one of those plump gray birds in its mouth orbit saw the beffeland the prize the beffel had the prize the tsiongi hadnt been able to getan instant before nesseref did that instant was all orbit needed the tsiongi streaked after the beffel and catching nesseref by surprise jerked the leash out of her hand no come back she shouted and ran after orbit the tsiongi unfortunately ran faster than she did tsiongyu also ran faster than befflem the beffel looking back with one eye turret saw orbit gaining on it hoping to distract its pursuer it spat out its prey the ploy worked the beffel dashed away as orbit stopped in front of the feathered tosevite creature and stuck out his tongue to find out what it smelled like before devouring it only then did the tsiongi discover the beffel had seized the bird without killing it with a flutter of wings the bird though hurt managed to get into the air and fly off orbit snapped at it but missed even though its flight was as slow and awkward as that of a badly damaged killercraft before the tsiongi could go after it nesseref came dashing up and grabbed the end of the leash no she said once more when orbit tried to break loose this time because she had hold of the leash orbit had to listen to her nesseref scolded the tsiongi all the way back to the apartment building that probably didnt do much good as far as orbit was concerned he was going to keep right on chasing befflem and trying to catch birds but it did make the shuttlecraft pilot feel better when she got into the apartment building she discovered the days mail had come she didnt expect much most things where time mattered came electronically instead but some of the local shops advertised themselves on paper and shed already found a couple of good bargains by paying attention to their flyers maybe she would be lucky again today along with the brightcolored printed sheets her box held a plain white envelope of peculiar size the paper was strange too of coarser manufacture than shed ever seen before when she turned it over she understood for it had her address written not only in the language of the race but also in the funnylooking characters the local big uglies used something had been pasted in one corner of the envelope a small picture of a tosevite in a lorry partly obscured by a rubber stamp with more tosevite characters nesseref needed a moment to remember that was how the big uglies showed theyd paid a required postage fee why would a tosevite want to write me she asked orbit if the tsiongi knew he wasnt talking his experience with all things tosevite had been less than happy nesseref scratched him below his hearing diaphragm well lets go up and find out once shed closed the door to the apartment behind her she opened the envelopeawkwardly because it wasnt made quite like the ones the race used she tore the letter inside but not badly after she got it unfolded she turned both eye turrets to the page i greet you superior female she read mordechai anielewicz here i do not often try to write your language so i am sure this will have many mistakes i am sorry and i hope you will excuse them she had already noted and discounted a couple of misspellings and some strange turns of phrase and had dismissed themshe couldnt have written anielewiczs language at all he went on the reason i am writing to you is that i want you to find for me whatever sort of treat a beffel might like most my hatchling brought one home and it may have saved our lives because it woke him when a fire started in the building where i lived we lost our goods but otherwise escaped without harm we are very grateful to the beffel as you will understand nesseref turned one eye turret toward orbit the tsiongi had gone to rest on the couch it is a good thing you do not understand what is in this letter she said orbit fortunately didnt understand that either whatever you find please mail it to me at my new address anielewicz wrote here it is in characters a tosevite postal delivery male will understand you have only to copy them hed printed the characters very plainly nesseref thought she could imitate them well enough to let a big ugly make sense of themor she could scan them into her computer and print them out her tosevite friend finished let me know what this costs and l will arrange to pay you back exchange between the big uglies and the race was often problematical that didnt matter though not here nesseref wouldnt have expected repayment from a male or female of the race for such a favor and saw no reason to expect it from anielewicz either she went to the computer and wrote i greet you i am glad to be able to greet you how strange that an animal from home should have saved you from the fire how did it start that question loomed large in her mind the races buildings were nearly fireproof and were equipped with extinguishing systems in case a blaze did somehow break out shed seen though that the big uglies didnt build to anything like the same standards with this letter i will send a cloth animal full of ssrissp seeds she continued befflem like the scent very much you need not pay me back it is my pleasure i am glad you are safe you write my language well that was an overstatement but she had been able to understand him after printing the letter she scrawled her name below it how strange she said to orbit one of the tsiongis eye turrets turned toward her he knew she was talking to him but not why she explained who would have thought a big ugly would take charge of a beffel orbit rolled onto his back and stuck his feet in the air maybe he followed more than she thought for every line of his body said that he cared nothing for befflemor for big uglies either hed always ignored the rubbish collectors and other tosevites he sometimes saw on the streets of the new town even so nesseref went on and who would have thought a beffel couldor wouldsave a tosevites life still on his back the tsiongi opened his mouth in an enormous yawn he probably would have been just as well pleased to learn that a lot of big uglies had burned so long as that meant the beffel went up in flames with them nesseref understood the attitude but didnt sympathize with it the next day after she got back from the shuttlecraft base not far outside the new town she visited the pet store where shed bought orbit when she chose a ssrisspseed animal the female who ran the place remarked i hope you know that tsiongyu care nothing for these toys of course i know that nesseref said indignantly do you think i hatched out of my eggshell yesterday this is not for meit is for a friend who has a beffel does that meet with your approval superior female nesseref was in fact of far higher rank than the other female but the petshop proprietor seemed to have trouble recognizing sarcasm she answered i suppose you can get one if you really want to thank you so much nesseref said my friend by the way is a tosevite he likes his beffel very much a big ugly with a beffel the other female stared in undisguised horror what is this world coming to she meant it as a rhetorical question but nesseref answered it anyhow something no one on home expecteda true blending of the race and the tosevites i do not like it the other female said firmly although nesseref wasnt so sure she liked it either she said it may just turn out to be interesting david goldfarb thought the canadian shipping line that ran the liberty hot springs might have changed the ships name after acquiring her from the usa but no one had bothered he asked a sailor about it one day as the ship steamed west across the atlantic no we wouldnt do that the fellow answered hadnt been for the americans wed be bowing down to the emperor five times a day too or whatever it is the lizards do he sounded like an american himself at least to goldfarbs ear the raf officerno the exraf officer he reminded himselfcould gauge the home region and status of anyone from the british isles just by listening to him for a couple of minutes but american accents only put him in mind of evenings at the cinema and all yanks seemed to him to talk the same way but when he remarked that the sailor sounded like an american screen actor the fellow laughed at him you can tell the difference once you learn how he said we say zed and shedule the same as you do in england on the other side of the border they say zee and skedule and when they go through a door they go owt he exaggerated the pronunciationbut we go oat now that you tell me i can hear the difference goldfarb admitted but i wouldnt have noticed otherwise the canadian shrugged was that rueful resigned amused something of all three goldfarb wasnt sure the sailor said getting harder and harder for us to tell differences these days since the fighting stopped weve looked more and more south to the usa and less and less across the ocean to england meaning no offense pal but youve had other things on your mind than us i know goldfarb said bitterly britains looking south more and more these days toosouth across the channel to the greater german reich the uk is turning into a pack of little nazis because its next door to the big ones yes its a shame the sailor said he sounded sympathetic but distantwhat happened to the united kingdom didnt matter much to him and the reich wasnt the biggest danger loose in the world and hadnt been for a long time next to the lizards who cared about germans and next to the sailors duties he didnt care much about keeping a passenger entertained oh he was polite he tipped his cap as he went on his way but go on his way he did leaving goldfarb alone on the deck of the liberty hot springs with the atlantic all around him the only long sea voyages hed made before were to poland and back during the fighting when hed rescued his cousin moishe russie from a lizard gaol hed gone by submarine then and hadnt had muchhadnt had anychance to look out traveling from liverpool to belfast for his last raf posting hadnt been the same either for hed hardly gone out of sight of land now now for the first time in his life he got a sense of how truly vast the ocean was the ship didnt seem to move on it nothing came up over the western horizon nothing vanished below the eastern horizon from what his senses told him the liberty hot springs might sail on forever without seeing land again goldfarb wondered if it was the same out in space airplanes were different he knew about them the sense of motion was never absent in them neither was the sense that the journey which by the nature of things could last only hours would soon end traveling across the solar system as the lewis and clark had done or from star to star as the lizards did those were wider oceans than the liberty hot springs was meant to sail a couple of other sailors hurried past him intent on business of their own on this ship passengers were an afterthought on a liner they wouldnt have been but goldfarb wouldnt have been able to afford passage across the atlantic on a liner serving his country all his adult life hadnt made him rich he wondered what serving his country all his adult life had got him in some small ways hed helped make sure britain wouldnt be occupied by the germans or the lizards but he doubted that would have changed much had he stayed in londons east end instead of volunteering for the raf of course if hed played along with the ginger smugglers in the raf he might well be on his way toward getting rich now but that wasnt why hed joined he might not know many things but he was certain of that some sort of bird flew by the ship pointing to it a passing sailor said land in a couple of days really goldfarb said and the canadian nodded goldfarb felt foolish he knew when the journey had started and how long it was supposed to last and shouldnt have needed the bird to remind him when they would approach canada using it as a sign took him back to the days before steam engines back even to the days before chronometers when accurately gauging a ships position was impossible and such portents really mattered naomi came up from below and looked around seeing goldfarb she waved and made her way over to him shed always been very fair in the moderately rough seas theyd met earlier in the journey shed gone pale as skimmed milk she didnt have a whole lot of color now either come to that wont be too much longer david said and spoke of the bird as if it and not the steady thud of the ships engine meant they would be coming to canada soon naomi accepted the news in the spirit with which hed offered it danken gott dafur she said its seemed like forever a voyage that had been timeless in one sense for goldfarb had been timeless in a very different sense for her she gathered herself and went on the children will be disappointed yes theyve had a fine time goldfarb agreed they wont want to get off the ship when we get to montreal naomi rolled her eyes if i have to ill drag them off she said who would have thought my children would turn out to be good sailors she sounded as if theyd betrayed her by not getting sick when the liberty hot springs reached canadian waters goldfarb got another surprise the scale of the country the gulf of st lawrence protected from the greater sea by newfoundland and the headland of nova scotia was impressive but nothing had prepared him for the st lawrence river itself he had trouble seeing both banks at the same time when the ship first entered it where gulf stopped and river began seemed very much a matter of opinion even when it eventually narrowed it remained aweinspiringly large there must be as much water going through here as there is in all the rivers in england put together goldfarb remarked to a sailor oh more than that the canadian said smugly and fighting against the st lawrences fierce current the liberty hot springs took two and a half days to get to montreal after entering the river that journey alone was about as far as it was from the isle of wight in southern england to the orkneys off the northern coast of scotlandbut it took in only a small bite of the vastness that was canada goldfarbs notions of scale got revised again only montreal itself failed to overwhelm him it was a fairsized city sure enough but to a man born and raised in london that was all it was britain might be small but it had plenty of people when longshoremen tied the ship up at a quay he gave a long sigh of relief were here he said to naomi we can start over now lets not be so happy till we get through customs his wife answered shed been a refugee before fleeing the reich if that wasnt enough to ingrain pessimism in someone goldfarb didnt know what would be but he said well our papers are in order so we shouldnt have any trouble as she had up on deck a few days before his wife rolled her eyes clutching papers and suitcases and children he and naomi went over the gangplank off the ship and onto canadian soil hed wondered if in montreal he would have to deal with officials who spoke french but the fellow to whose post he came wore a name badge that said v williams and used english of the same sort as the sailors on the liberty hot springs so you are immigrating to our country eh he said examining passports and immigration forms yes sir a lifetime in the raf had taught goldfarb the shortest answers were the best reason for leaving great britain williams asked too many people getting too chummy with himmler goldfarb said dryly whatever williams had expected by way of reply that wasnt it he was about goldfarbs age he might well have seen action against the germans himself er yes he said and scribbled a note on the form in front of him so your claim would involve political liberties then we dont often see that from the mother country naomi said you will see more of it i think as england comes closer to the reich it could be so maam the immigration officer said and wrote another note he turned back to david now thenwhat skills do you bring to canada im just retired from the raf goldfarb answered i served since and ive been working with radars all that time ill gladly pass along anything i happen to know that you dont and ill be looking for civilian work in electronics or at an airport i see williams turned away and shuffled through some papers he pulled one out read it and nodded i thought your name was familiar youre the fellow who was involved in that gingersmuggling mess last year arent you yes thats me goldfarb answered with a sinking feeling his old chum jerome jones had managed to clear away the obstacles to his emigration from britain what obstacles had basil roundbush and his pals managed to throw up against his immigration into canada williams tapped the eraser end of his pencil against his front teeth you and your family are to be permitted into the country he said still eyeing that sheet of paper you are to be permitted entry but you are also to be transported to ottawa for a thorough interrogation until that interrogation is completed to the satisfaction of the authorities you are to remain under the authority of the canadian government what precisely does that mean goldfarb asked i should have known this wouldnt be easy gevalt naomi knew it wouldnt be easy what it says more or less the immigration officer answered you are not free to settle until this process is finalized he sounded every inch a bureaucrat voice brittle naomi asked and how long is that likely to take williams spread his hands im sorry but i havent the least idea thats not my bailiwick at all im afraid yes he was a bureaucrat all right were prisoners then david goldfarb said not prisonersnot exactly anyhow williams answered but not free either the immigration officer nodded no not free glen johnson peered out through the spacious glass canopy of his hot rod that was the name that seemed to have stuck on the little auxiliary rockets the crew of the lewis and clark used to go exploring in the neighborhood of ceres he had radar and an instrument suite almost as complete as the one aboard peregrine but the mark one eyeball was still his instrument of first choice just for a moment he glanced toward the shrunken sun it showed only a tiny disk barely a third the size it would have from earths orbit lots of pieces of rock in the neighborhood looked bigger he watched the rocks and he watched the radar screen at the moment he was out ahead of ceres and moving away from it most of what he had to worry about was stuff he was approaching hed have to be more careful on the return trip when hed be swimming against the tide so to speak hot rods were built to take it but he didnt want to put that to the test from the back seat lucy vegetti said that dark one over to the left looks like it ought to be interesting the one that looks like a squash i mean to johnson it looked like just another floating chunk of rock with a long axis of perhaps a quarter of a mile he shrugged youre the mineralogist he said and used the hot rods attitude jets to turn toward the little asteroid what do you hope well find there iron with luck she answered he chuckled here i am alone with a pretty girlall the women on the lewis and clark looked good to him by now even the sour assistant dietitianand all she wants to do is talk about rocks this is work lucy said well so it is johnson glanced to the radar screen he grunted in surprise looked out the canopy and grunted again what the devil he said is something wrong lucy vegetti asked i dunno he looked down at the radar screen again the instruments are reporting something my eyes arent seeing he scratched his chin as far as i can tell the sets behaving the way its supposed to whats that mean she asked either its misbehaving in a way i dont know about or else my eyes need rewiring he answered lucy laughed but he wasnt kidding or not very much he didnt like it when what his eyes saw didnt match what the radar saw if the instrument was wrong it needed fixing if it wasnt wrong he rubbed his eyes not that that would do a whole lot of good if you dont mind im going to try to find out whats going on he said no offense but your rock isnt going anywhere go ahead lucy vegetti said though she had to know hed asked her permission only as a matter of form ever so cautiously johnson goosed the hot rod toward what the radar insisted was there but his eyes denied and then after a bit they stopped denying it will you look at that he said softly will you just look at that somethings getting in the way of the stars he pointed to show lucy what he meant she nodded so it is i see it now that youve shown it to me but i didnt before what do you suppose it could be i dont know but i intend to find out as peregrine had back in earth orbit the hot rod mounted twincaliber machine guns he had teeth he didnt know if hed need to use them but knowing they were there helped reassure him he slowed the hot rods accelerationwhatever this thing was it didnt seem to be under acceleration itself no wonder we couldnt see it before lucy breathed as they got closer and the mystery object covered more and more of the sky its all painted flat black it sure is johnson agreed and thats a better flat black than anything we could turn out which means the mineralogist finished the sentence for him which means the lizards have sent something out to take a look at what were up to when the hot rod got within a couple of hundred yards of the spacecraft johnson stopped its progress and peered through binoculars from that range he could see the sun sparkling off lenses here and there and could also make out antennas aimed back toward earthmuch smaller and more compact than those the lewis and clark carried what are you going to do about it lucy asked johnsons first impulse was to cut loose with the machine guns the hot rod carried he didnt act on that impulse pulling a sour face he answered im going to ask brigadier general healey what he wants me to do he didnt like healey not even slightly the commandant of the lewis and clark had hauled him aboard for the crime of excess curiosity a crime that had just missed being a capital offense he had no trouble raising the lewis and clark he would have been astonished and alarmed if he had but convincing the radioman he really did need to talk to the commandant took a couple of minutes at last healey said go ahead johnson whats on your mind his suspicions about the pilot had eased but hadnt gone away johnson got the idea healeys suspicions never went away well he was going to feed one that had nothing to do with him sir he answered ive found a lizard spy ship he explained how that had happened when he was done healey let out along clearly audible sigh i dont suppose we ought to be surprised the commandant said at last the scaly sons of bitches have to be wondering what were up to out here shall i shoot it up sir johnson asked that would give em a good poke in the eye turret to his surprise healey said no for one thing we dont know if this is the only machine theyve sent out theyre suspendersandbelt critters so odds are it isnt and if you do theyll know whats happened to it we dont want to give them any excuse to start a war out here because odds are wed lose it hold fire have you got that yes sir hold fire johnson agreed what do i do then just wave to the lizards and go on about my business thats exactly what you do healey answered if youd opened up on it without asking for orders i would have been very unhappy with you you did the right thing reporting in maybe he sounded surprised johnson had done the right thing maybe the radio speaker in the hot rod was just on the tinny side maybe but johnson wouldnt have bet on it he asked sir can we operate in a fishbowl its not a question of can johnson brigadier general healey answered its a question of must as i said we shouldnt be surprised the lizards are conducting reconnaissance out here in their shoes i would well just have to learn to live with it have to learn to work around it maybe well even be able to learn to take advantage of it johnson wondered if his superior had gone out of his mind then he realized that lizard spaceship he was next to wasnt just taking pictures of what the lewis and clark and its crew were up to it also had to be monitoring the radio frequencies people used maybe healey was trying to put a bug in the lizards earsor would have been if theyd had ears if that was what he was up to johnson would play along yes sir he said enthusiastically they can look as much as they please but they wont be able to figure out everything thats going on brigadier general healey chuckled an alien sound from his lips that wouldnt be so bad would it no sir johnson said i wouldnt mind at all behind him lucy vegetti snickered he turned around and gave her a severe look she laughed at him mouthing you cant act for beans anything else healey barked when johnson said there wasnt the commandant broke the connection that was in character for him where the chuckle hadnt beenhadnt even come close so we just go on about our business lucy asked that wont be so easy not for some of the things well need to do sooner or later johnson shrugged his belt held him in his seat hed spent his adult life in the service he knew how to evaluate military problems yes and no he said if you know the other guy is watching you can make sure he only sees what you want him to see and sometimes you can lead him around by the nose whats really bad is when hes watching and you dont know hes there thats when he can find out stuff that hurts you bad i can see how it would be the mineralogist sounded thoughtful you make it seem so logical every trade has its own tricks doesnt it well sure johnson answered surprised she needed to ask if we hadnt had some notion of what we were doing wed all be singing the lizard national anthem every time we went to the ballpark she laughed now theres a picture for you but do you know what some of the lizard pows who ended up settling in the states like playing baseball i saw them on the tv news once they looked pretty good too ive heard that johnson said i never saw film of them playing though more important to worry about what theyre doing out here lucy said and whatever it is theyll have a harder time doing it because you were on the ball congratulations thanks he said in some confusion he wasnt used to praise for what he did if he carried out his assignments he was doing what his superiors expected of him and so didnt particularly deserve praise and if he didnt carry them out he got raked over the coals that was the way things worked after a moment he added i never would have spotted it if you hadnt sent me out this way so i guess you deserve half the credit ill tell general healey so too they spent the next little while wrangling goodnaturedly about who deserved what each trying to say the other should get it finally lucy vegetti said the only reason we did come out here was to get a look at that asteroid shaped like a zucchini can we still get over there johnson checked the gauges for the main tank and the maneuvering jets then nodded sure no trouble at all he chuckled now i cant stop halfway there and say im sorry sweetheart but we just ran out of gas on this little country road in the middle of nowhere they were in the middle of nowhere all right far more so than they could have been anyplace on earth the very idea of a road country or otherwise was absurd here lucy said i didnt figure you for that kind of guy anyway glen youre not shy if youve got something on your mind ive got something on my mind all right he said maybe ive got something on mine too she answered maybe we could even find outafter we give this asteroid the onceover and after we get back to the lewis and clark sure johnson agreed and swung the nose of the hot rod away from the lizard spy craft and toward the asteroid that interested lucy vyacheslav molotov had disliked dealing with germans longer than hed disliked dealing with lizards on a personal level he disliked dealing with germans more too he made allowances for the lizards they were honestly alien and often were ignorant of the way things were supposed to work on earth the germans had no such excuses but they could make themselves more difficult than the lizards any day of the week paul schmidt the german ambassador to moscow was a case in point schmidt was not a bad fellow skilled in languageshed started out as an english interpreterhe spoke good russian even if he did always leave the verb at the end of the sentence in the germanic fashion but he had to take orders from himmler which meant his inherent decency couldnt count for much molotov glared at him over the tops of his reading glasses surely you do not expect me to take this proposition seriously he said we could do it schmidt said between us we could split poland as neatly as we did in oh yes that was splendid molotov said schmidt recognized sarcasm more readily than a lizard would and had the grace to flush molotov drove the point home anyhow the half of poland the reich seized gave it a perfect springboard for the invasion of the soviet union a year and a half later how long would we have to wait for your panzers this time not very unless i miss my guess reichs chancellor himmler is prepared to offer an ironclad guarantee of the integrity of soviet territory after this joint undertaking the german ambassador told him he didnt laugh in schmidts face why he didnt he couldnt have said some vestige of bourgeois politesse perhaps in view of past history the soviet union is not prepared to accept german guarantees he said schmidt looked wounded like any nazi he thought a wave of the hand sufficed to relegate history to the rubbish bin a miracle the americans havent gone nazi molotov thought but schmidt said surely you cannot say you like having the aliens on your western border i do not molotov admitted the german ambassador brighteneduntil molotov added but i vastly prefer them to the reich they form a useful buffer and what do you suppose they would do if we were rash enough to fall on their colony in poland they would not sit quiet i assure you i think they might schmidt said and then qualified that by adding reichs chancellor himmler thinks they might they have no adjoining territory once lost poland would be difficult for them to regain what could they do but acquiesce to the fait accompli drop nuclear weapons on the soviet union and the reich till both countries glow for the next thousand years molotov answered in my considered opinion that is exactly what they would do at such an outrageous provocation chancellor himmler believes otherwise schmidt said this time he didnt say anything about what he believed molotov nodded to himself hed pegged the ambassador for an intelligent man he might present himmlers proposal as part of his duty but that didnt mean he thought it was a good idea if chancellor himmler believes otherwise he is welcome to launch this attack against poland by himself the soviet leader said if he succeeds he is welcome to all the spoils i will congratulate him i will also begin fortifying our western frontier more strongly than ever our two great nations have cooperated before first in rectifying the frontiers of eastern europe in and then in the struggle against the lizards schmidt said smoothly what we have done once we can do again we have also fought each other to the death in the interval between those times molotov said icily when your predecessor count schulenberg announced that your nation had wantonly invaded mine i asked him do you believe that we deserved this he had no answer i do not believe you have an answer either he had never had a worse moment in his life than when the german envoy announced the start of hostilities on june stalin had never thought that day would come which meant no one under stalin had dared think it might come had the lizards not landed who could guess which of the two giants in europe would have been left standing when the fighting was done schmidt did his best as his masters in berlin would have wanted him to do voice still smooth he said that was twenty years ago comrade general secretary times change both of our governments view the race as the greatest menace facing humanity these days would you not agree the race is the greatest enemy facing humanity yes i would agree with that molotov shot out a forefinger to point at the german ambassador but the reich is without a doubt the greatest menace to the peaceloving people of the soviet union chancellor himmler does not think the soviet union is the greatest menace to the reich paul schmidt told him that is why he invited you to share in his own destruction molotov broke in do you know what would likely happen even if the reich and the ussr did succeed in wresting poland from the race you have expressed your view on the matter with great clarity schmidt said molotov shook his head the view i expressed was as you say mine if anything it was also unduly optimistic if we ousted the lizards from poland they might conclude we were drawing ahead of them technically do you know what they might do if they came to that conclusion respect us fear us schmidt answered he might be a decent enough fellow he might be a clever fellow but nazi ideology had corroded his thought processes sure enough too bad molotov thought they might indeed do those things he said aloud most especially they might fear us and if they fear us enough their ambassador here in moscow has made it clear that they will seek to destroy us altogether so we cannot possibly become a menace to the empire as a whole has not the lizard ambassador in nuremberg conveyed a similar message to your leaders if he has i am not aware of it schmidt looked thoughtful an unusual expression to find on a germans face here molotov believed him regardless of the warnings the race might have given the nazi bigwigs they were unlikely to take them seriously in their arrogance the leaders of the reich like so many spoiled children still thought they could do whatever they wanted simply because they wanted to do it unlike spoiled children though they could wreck the world if they tried schmidt licked his lips i think i had better send that message back to nuremberg with some urgency if it has already been communicated to my superiors it will do no harm if it has not it may do some good i hope so molotov said considering the adventurism your government has displayed up to this point though i would not bet any sizable sum on that however perhaps you had better go attend to it at onceunless that is you have any less reckless proposals to lay on the table before me i have made the proposal i came here to make schmidt said he rose bowed and took his leave molotovs secretary looked into the office your next appointment comrade general secretary is i dont care who it is molotov said i need to consult the foreign commissar have comrade gromyko come here at once but its marshal zhukov the secretary wailed i dont care molotov repeated though he cared very much but he had to do this for the safety of the country give him my regrets say the matter is urgent and tell him i will see him as soon as it is convenient go on pyotr maksimovich he wont eat you though if he is unhappy enough he may eat me by the look on the secretarys face he was thinking the same thing but he said very well comrade general secretary and disappeared molotov might not be more powerful than zhukovhe feared he wasntbut he could still tell his secretary what to do silently he cursed lavrenti beria if the nkvd chief hadnt tried to overthrow him he wouldnt be beholden to the red army now but zhukov didnt choose to eat molotov at least not then and gromyko got to the soviet leaders office inside ten minutes without preamble the foreign commissar said and what has gone wrong now molotov appreciated gromykos style not least because it came so close to matching his own i will tell you what has gone wrong andrei andreyevich he said and recounted the exchange hed just had with paul schmidt bozhemoi gromyko exclaimed when he was through the fascists are serious about this i would say so yes unless they are merely trying to lure us to our own destruction molotov answered but surely even the nazis could not reckon us so naive my question for you is how do we respond beyond rejecting the proposal one obvious thing we could do is tell the lizards what the reich has in mind gromyko said we could indeed do that whether we should is one of the things i wanted to ask you molotov said the question of course is whether the lizards would believe us we and the germans spend a good deal of time spreading misinformation about each other that could prove a nuisance now so it could the foreign commissar agreed but i think that in this case the effort would be worthwhile the nazis are surely contemplating the use of nuclear weapons here they could not hope to conquer poland without them this is not a trivial matter no indeed molotov replied i warned schmidt about what queek has told me that the race may seek to exterminate mankind if we present a large enough danger to them and how did he respond gromyko inquired with surprise molotov answered but who can truly say what goes on inside a germans head who can truly say if anything goes on in a germans head your view is that we should inform the race yes i think so gromyko replied i think we should also be conspicuous about not moving troops into areas near lizardheld poland they must not think we are trying to deceive them and preparing our own surprise attack a distinct point and one i shall have to raise with marshal zhukov molotov said and if he fusses i will ask him how well prepared he is for a nuclear exchange with the lizards with a little luck i may be able to begin to exert a little control over the red army after all he nodded to gromyko the foreign commissar nodded back and even managed something of a smile he probably knew what was on molotovs mind i really do not see why you require my presence here superior sir felless said to veffani as the motorcar that carried them pulled up in front of the residence the notemperor of the greater german reich used as his own the races ambassador to the reich turned an eye turret toward her because he is a tosevite veffani answered because you are alleged to be an expert on tosevites i want your views on what he says and on how he says it and you want to continue punishing me for the incident in your conference room felless added veffani was unabashed yes i do as a matter of fact count yourself lucky that i let you remove the green bands denoting punishment i do not wish to advertise your disgrace to the deutsche now come with me the matter over which we visit the deutsch notemperor is or at least has the possibility of being of considerable importance it shall be done felless said miserably and got out of the heated motorcar and into the chilly atmosphere that passed for summer in nuremberg up the stairs she went the notemperors residence like most official architecture in the capital of the reich was on a scale designed to dwarf even big uglies to make them feel insignificant when measured against the power of their leaders it trivialized males and females of the race even more effectively so did the immensely tall deutsch sentries at the head of the stairs a shorter unarmed big ugly stood between the sentries i greet you he said in the language of the race and favored veffani with the posture of respect and your colleague is senior researcher felless veffani answered very well the deutsch male said and inclined his head to felless i am johannes stark senior researcher i shall interpret for you with the reichs chancellor he will be able to see you shortly he should see me now veffani said this is the time set for our appointment the meeting he is currently attending is running long the big ugly said delay is an insult felless said stark shrugged come with me i will take you to an antechamber where you can make yourselves comfortable felless doubted she would be able to make herself comfortable in any tosevite building and she proved right the chamber was chilly the seats in it were made for big uglies not for the race a servant did come in with refreshments but they tasted nasty felless endured what choice had she after what seemed like forever the big ugly named stark returned and said the reichs chancellor will see you now please follow me the big ugly named himmler sat behind a desk so large a starship might have landed on it on one wall of his office was an enormous hooked and tilted cross the emblem of his faction on the other wall hung an equally enormous portrait of another tosevite this one with the hair on his upper lip cut in a pattern different from the one himmler chose felless gathered that was his predecessor as notemperor of the reich against all that immensity himmler himself seemed strangely shrunken even for a big ugly he was unprepossessing with a round flat softfleshed face with corrective lenses in front of his immobile eyes he spoke in the guttural language the deutsche used among themselves johannes stark translated the reichs chancellor greets you and inquires why you have requested this meeting i greet him as well veffani said i asked to see him to warn him and to warn this whole notempire against taking any course that would jeopardize the longstanding truce on tosev stark translated that too felless wished she had some ginger it would have made time pass more quickly of course it would also have made veffani mate with her on the spot which might have entertained the tosevites but would not have advanced diplomacy listening to himmler and the interpreter drone on in their own language made it hard for her to care at least she wouldnt have been bored himmler said on behalf of the reich i must tell you that i have no idea what you are talking about on behalf of the race i must tell you that that had better be so veffani answered any movement against poland any attack on poland will lead at once to the harshest and most stringent retaliation i deny that the greater german reich intends any attack on poland himmler said do you deny proposing to the sssr a joint attack on poland your two notempires to divide the region between you veffani asked of course i do the big ugly replied felless spoke up but you would deny it whether it was true or not because it is in your interest to do so why should the race take your denials seriously behind the corrective lenses himmlers eyes swung her way she had dealt with him before but not often only now did she get the strong impression that his stare said he wished she were dead and also that he wished he could arrange her death considering the policies of the reich he doubtless meant that literally had she been subject to his whimsy she would have been terrified even as things were that measuring gaze disturbed her i repeat i deny it himmler said and i speak the truth when i tell you this his features moved very little as he spoke for a big ugly he showed scant visible expression do you also deny troop movements toward the frontier between the reich and poland have taken place veffani demanded i do not deny that there have been such movements no himmler said i deny that there is anything in the least aggressive about them however the wehrmacht and the waffenss conduct exercises as best suits them they would be well advisedvery well advisedto conduct them elsewhere in the reich veffani said you cannot give me orders himmler said the reich is a sovereign and independent notempire i am not giving you orders i am giving you a warning veffani said here is another one if you attack poland the race will destroy you if you attack the reich we will also destroy you himmler said we can wreck this world and we will do it he means what he says superior sir felless whispered to veffani the ideology of this factionperhaps of all the deutscheis full of images of battle destroying both sides i also mean what i say veffani answered he swung his eye turrets back toward the tosevite leader that does not matter if we are destroyed to ensure your destruction we shall pay the price it would be the end for you do you not understand that himmler said no it would not veffani made the negative hand gesture it would be a setback for us it would be an end for us on this world but the empire would continue on its other three worlds for you tosevites though it would indeed be the end please carry that thought in your mind at all times if we could reach your other worlds you would regret this arrogance and insolence himmler said that time may come and sooner than you think the better the chance you have of reaching our other worlds the likelier it is that we will find it necessary to destroy you first felless said indeed himmler wished her dead he said we are the master race and not to be trifled with we crossed the space between the stars to come to tosev veffani said you cannot match that who then are the masters felless thoughthopedthat would make himmler lose his temper she had read of the spectacular rages that would seize the notemperors predecessor and had viewed video of a couple of them even across species lines they were appalling in their intensity and ferocity but the present reichs chancellor seldom seemed to get very excited about anything through his interpreter he answered you have a much longer history than we do we had almost caught you by the time you came here we are closer now than we were then before long we shall surpass you if this is not the mark of the master race what is his certainty was in its way as frightening as his predecessors volcanic wrath and he raised good points alarming points where would the tosevites be in a few hundred years all over the empire was the thought that sprang into felless mind and if they came to home or to rabotev or halless they would come as conquerors the thought chilled her worse than the weather on tosev but veffani said have you not listened to a word i told you if you are on the point of becoming a menace to the empire as a whole rather than merely to this planet we will destroy you and ourselves here rather than allowing that to happen to felless dismay himmler yawned by the time you perceive the threat you will not be able to destroy it we will have gone too far ahead of you by then you of the race had best bear that in mind and behave accordingly your time is passing away ours is coming before veffani could speak felless did then the best thing we could do would be to destroy you now while you cannot hope to prevent us from doing it that got through to the big ugly himmler fixed her with a glare that warned he did know rages like his predecessors even if he didnt show them on the outside he said if you try we shall have our vengeance on you and yet despite your knowledge of the ruin that would fall on your notempire you planned an attack against the race veffani said you need to consider very carefully the likely consequences of your actions i have already denied your allegations himmler said i deny them again but his tone when he spoke his own language carried no conviction and neither did the interpreters in the language of the race see that your denial becomes and remains a truth veffani said rising from the uncomfortable tosevite chair he assumed the posture of respect then straightened i bid you farewell he left the reichs chancellors office felless following him will he listen felless asked when they had returned to the comfortably heated motorcar and begun the return journey to the races embassy who can say you are the expert on big uglies veffani replied which was disingenuous having come to this world with the conquest fleet he had more experience with tosevites than she did but then he went on you did well there senior researcher your remarks to me were germane and while you irked himmler you did so without attempting to be deliberately inflammatory i thank you superior sir felless answered what point to being inflammatory you would not let me leave even if i were high time you begin to realize such things veffani said in what sounded more like approval than anything shed heard from him since disgracing herself with him and the visiting males from cairo maybe his measured praise should have made her pleased at doing her duties well to a degree it did but thinking about her disgrace also made her think about how much she wanted another taste of ginger i greet you gorppet waved to a female walking down a baghdad street toward one of the markets that had recently been declared safe for the race once more how would you like a taste of ginger he felt like mating even though it wasnt the proper season here and there in baghdad females had been tasting ginger he could smell the pheromones not strongly enough to drive him into a frenzy but enough to leave an itch at the back of his mind almost like the itch he had for ginger maybe that was the way big uglies worked all the time whether it was or not though it wasnt the way the female worked i do not use that illegal herb she declared and went on her way with her tailstump quivering in indignation a pestilence take her betvoss muttered he raised his voice and called your pheromones probably stink anyhow the females tailstump quivered harder but she did not turn back gorppet laughed there you go this time he was glad to see betvoss disagreeable because the other males venom wasnt aimed at him betvoss said i hope the big uglies in the marketplace cheat her out of all her money so do i gorppet said his eye turrets hadnt once stopped their wary swiveling even while he was talking to the female he wasnt sure how much good it would do swaddled in robes as they were the local big uglies had little trouble concealing weapons still i would rather patrol the marketplace than collect coins at a house of superstition he used an emphatic cough truth betvoss used another one that is one duty i too am just as well pleased to escape here in the marketplace at least i am a moving target that made gorppet laugh again then he wondered why he was laughing betvoss had probably spoken a truth gorppet said the other thing being on the edge of wanting to mate all the time does to me is it makes me mean i want to claw something or bite something or shoot something plenty of big uglies around betvoss said go ahead i will not mind none of your other squadmales will mind he lowered his voice a little of course that could be ginger talking too and he was right again twice in one day gorppet thought who would have imagined it wanting to taste ginger made a maleor a femalejumpy and when a male tasted ginger he did things before he finished thinking about them which also led to trouble biting a big ugly or even shooting one felt tempting right now after the riots and uprisings hed helped quell after the hatred the local tosevites showed whenever they had to pay to enter their houses of superstition he wished he could go off somewhere that had no tosevites for a little whilesay for the next couple of hundred years a mechanized combat vehicle moved slowly and carefully through the market square it had speakers mounted above it through the speakers came the recorded voice of a tosevite his voice boomed forth in the local language come reverence the spirits of emperors past next offering of reverence in one hours time come reverence the spirits be ready gorppet warned the males in his squad the warning was hardly necessary whenever the big uglies heard the recording they pelted the combat vehicle with rocks and fruit and rotten eggs sometimes they did worse than that sometimes they started shooting that didnt happen so often as it had though not when the race hit back so hard i wonder where the big ugly who made that recording is hiding gorppet said if his fellow tosevites ever find out who he is his life expectancy is about as long as an azwaca ribs at a feast what i wonder is why we bother with the combat vehicle betvoss said how many big uglies come to reverence the spirits of emperors past in this part of the world how many of them live to come give reverence more than once some gorppet said not many not enough but our superiors say we have to keep trying no sooner were the words out of his mouth than the radio on his belt hissed for attention report to the shrine to the spirits of emperors past said the male on the other end of the line we have heard there may be disturbances above and beyond the ordinary there today it shall be done superior sir gorppet said resignedly and passed the order on to his squad we have to keep trying he repeated waste of time betvoss grumbled liable to be a waste of us too but he obeyed gorppet as gorppet had obeyed the dispatching officer gorppet wondered what would have happened had he told that officer he was sick of big uglies and would sooner go to australia he sighed either he needed another taste of ginger or his wits were addling from all the tastes hed already had the shrine for giving reverence to the spirits of emperors past was a bit of home dropped down not far from the center of baghdad a plain cube of a building looking achingly familiar against the masonry and mud brick of local tosevite architecture but the razorwire perimeter around the building did not come from home it was an effort to keep hostile big uglies far enough away so they couldnt use truly large weapons against the building despite what betvoss had said a few tosevites had passed through the perimeter and were heading toward the shrine when the squad got there many more though crowded up against the wire aiming curses and abuse and occasional bits of offal at those who presumed to follow the ways of the empire instead of their own preposterous superstition it was in fact a pretty typical day i wonder what the males heard to make them think there would be extra trouble here gorppet said for all we know it may be a drill betvoss said they like to keep us half addled all the time it could be gorppet agreed but though he didnt waste time arguing with betvoss he doubted it a lot of males had come from all over baghdad and were prowling along the perimeter it didnt have the feeling of a drill though gorppet supposed that could have been intentional on the part of the officers whod called it he watched not only the males from the conquest fleet but also the big uglies he wanted to have every chance he could of shooting first if this wasnt a drillor even if it was and things got out of hand his squadmales were doing the same all these cursed tosevites look alike betvoss complained not alike exactly gorppet said but certainly similar males of the race had always had trouble telling one tosevite from another that male with the gray hair growing out of his face for instance looked a good deal like the badly wanted preacher named khomeini but how likely was he to be the fearsome big ugly male in fact gorppet stopped that male looked very much indeed like khomeini gorppet had a photograph of khomeini with him he examined it then turned an eye turret toward the male no he thought impossible but the higherups had had a warning of trouble and so he hissed to his squadmalesnot a hiss with words in it in case any nearby big uglies understood the races language but one to draw their attention once he had it he gathered the males together so he could speak in a low voice by the emperor i think that fellow there in the black robe with the white head rag is the accursed khomeini we are going to seize him we are going to hustle him into the shrine we are going to shoot any tosevite who tries to stop us have you got that what if that is not the fearsome khomeini betvoss asked then our superiors will turn him loose gorppet answered but if it is we are all heroes every one of us and we do the race a great service by stopping his poison now come on back me after making sure he had a round in the chamber of his rifle and the safety off he hurried up to the graywhiskered big ugly in arabic he said you are under arrest come with me what the tufts of hair above the tosevites eyes were still black they leaped upward a sign of surprise or alarm i have done nothing you will be questioned if you have done nothing you will be freed gorppet went back to the language of the race seize himand then on to the entranceway before the big ugly could move the squad of soldiers swarmed over him though he was bigger than any of them together they hustled him toward the guarded entry a couple of tosevites whod been with him shouted and made as if to try to rescue him but gorppet and the other males pointed their rifles at them and they fell back what is this asked a trooper at the entranceway i think it is khomeini gorppet answered which made the other males eye turrets jerk in surprise we will find out this building is secure not so considering what it is and where it is it had better be the trooper said everyone in this city wants to destroy it but it is the most secure building here gorppet waited to hear no more come on you he said in arabic and gestured to the males in his squad to get the big ugly moving again as they hurried him down the covered way toward the shrine cries of fury rang out among the tosevites beyond the razorwire barriers they made gorppet begin to hope he really had seized khomeini would the tosevites have got so excited for anyone less the shrine gorppet discovered had an armored door in spite of that peace flowed through him when he walked in and saw the tiny holographic images of all the emperors who had reigned since the unification of home the interior was home or felt like it and the presence of a few tosevites didnt change that a male came hurrying up to the squad you should not enter this place bearing weapons he said as if to a halftrained hatchling we would not have superior sir did i not believe this big ugly here to be the agitator named khomeini gorppet replied as it had at the entrance to the perimeter around the shrine that name worked wonders several males came hurrying forward they took charge of the tosevite very much as an afterthought one of them added you soldiers wait here while we attempt to identify this fellow it shall be done superior sir gorppet said his eye turrets flicked from one emperors image to another so many emperors to enfold and cherish his spirit when it finally left his body and then the males came back far more excited than they should have been inside the shrine it is one of them exclaimed we were almost certain ourselves and then one of our tosevite converts positively identified him for us it is khomeini awe of a new and different sort washed over gorppet hed never been a hero before nor thought he wanted to be now he discovered it wasnt so bad over the weeks since fleeing from peking liu han had discovered how much shed forgotten about farming and about farming villages since leaving her own village near hankow what shed forgotten mostly involved two things how uncomfortable village life was and how much work it involved shed thought she remembered but she was wrong memory had failed to warn her about how exhausted she would be staggering home from the fields at sunset every evening maybe that was because they grew wheat and barley and millet in these northern lands not the rice that had sprung up in the paddies around her old village maybe but she doubted it more had to do with memorys being like opium and blurring how bad things had been and more still was her being twice as old as she had been back then things she could have done easily in those days left her stiff and sore and aching now living in a strawroofed stone hut didnt help her recover she and liu mei had more space to themselves than theyd enjoyed back in the peking rooming houses in which theyd lived but that was the only advantage she could see a dirt floor meant everything was filthy all the time the well was far away the water that came from it was unpurified too it had given her a flux of the bowels and had given her daughter a nastier one but worse than all that was the feeling of emptiness of disconnectedness she had ever since shed come to peking shed been at the center of the revolutionary struggle against the imperialist scaly devils news from all over the city from all over china from all over the world had flowed in to her now she heard nothing but village gossip one other thing her memory had failed to hold was how boring and picayune village gossip was to her annoyance nieh hoting seemed to drop into the narrow world of the village as if hed never seen peking a day in his life he was older than she and came from a wealthier family than she did but he fit right in and she didnt he laughed at her when she complained you have lived among the bourgeoisie too long he said a little reeducation will do you good oh yes it will be splendidif i live through it liu han answered i dont want my bones to end up here where nobody knows or cares who i am and i certainly dont want liu mei to have to stay here for the rest of her life to tend to my grave she would be buried here even more than i was i dont think you need to worry about that nieh said when things calm down well be moving on well get in touch with the others who got out of peking too and with the ones who werent in peking at all and well start up the struggle again we dont need to hurry the dialectic is certain the dialectic is certain liu han repeated she believed that as shed believed in the endless gods and spirits of the countryside back when she was nothing but a peasant but the gods and spirits of the countryside had failed against both the japanese and the little scaly devils and the dialectic however much she believed in it did not seem to be holding its own against the little devils she said what was in her heart losing peking hurt of course it did nieh said the peoples liberation army has been hurt before though and worse than this chiang and the kuomintang reactionaries thought theyd destroyed us a generation ago but we made the long march and kept fighting and we will keep fighting here too till we win however long it takes however long it takes liu han repeated that too she saw time stretching out as a river before her a river longer than the yangtze where along that river lay the port named red victory was there such a port at all or did the river of time just flow into the sea called forever she wondered if shed live long enough to find out she didnt share the conceit with nieh hoting he might accuse her of trying to set up as a poet that she could deal with but he might also accuse her of defeatism an altogether more serious business next morning just before sunrise a motorcar rolled into the village music both chinesestyle and the raucous noise the little scaly devils enjoyed blared from the speakers mounted on top of the car a mans voicea recording liu han realized after a momentcalled out come see how much we are all alike little scaly devils and human beings come see come see this is a new sort of propaganda liu mei observed spooning up the last of her barley porridge so it is liu han sipped tea then sighed i suppose wed better go find out what kind of new propaganda it is she set down her cup and stepped out of the hut where shed been living liu mei followed the motorcar liu han saw was of the scaly devils manufacture and was of a make she knew to be armored it carried several little devils with body armor and rifles and one who came out unarmed i greet you people of this village that one said speaking chinese as well as liu han had ever heard a little scaly devil do for too long your kind and mine have been enemies part of the reason we have fought i think is that we have believed we are more different than is so a very new sort of propaganda liu mei murmured liu han nodded the scaly devil reminded her of the fasttalking merchants of peking who all did their best to sell people things they neither wanted nor needed but what was this little devil selling he didnt leave her in suspense for long you chinese people reverence your ancestors he said is it not so here and there in the crowd that had gathered around the motorcar people nodded liu han found herself nodding too and made herself stop with a grimace of annoyance if only she hadnt been talking with nieh hoting the day before the scaly devil went on we too give reverence to the spirits of our emperors our emperors dead their spirits comfort us when we die they can comfort your spirits when you die if only you will also give them reverence while you are still living having thought of nieh liu han looked around for him there he was looking like a peasant who was starting to get old she caught his eyes one of his eyebrows rose a little shed known him a long time and understood what that meanthe was taking seriously what the scaly devil said we have big shrines in big cities the little devil went on but in a village like this we do not need a big shrine a small one will do we have one here he gestured to the armed scaly devils two of them opened the motorcars boot and took out what looked like a large polishedmetal headstone for a christian grave the little devil who spoke chinese said where is the village headman no one said anything no one came forward liu han took that as a good sign had the village headman admitted who he was his next step at collaboration might have been to tell the scaly devil communists were hiding there i mean no harm to anybody the scaly devil said when silence stretched he continued somebody anybody then please tell me where can we plant this shrine in the ground in the village without angering anyone we do not wish to cause anger our spirits and yours should be together liu han had never heard language like that from a little scaly devil it was good propaganda very good propaganda if theyd used propaganda like that from the moment they came to earth many more people would have been reconciled to their rule she stared around the crowd with worry in her eyes to her vast relief people still stood silent the little devil who spoke chinese gave a very humanlike shrug he said all right then if you do not tell me we will place it here near the edge of this little square as i say we do not mean to anger anyone i will also tell you one other thing we will know how you treat this shrine we will know if you offer to it you do not have to do that but we wish you would we will know if you harm it too if you do that we will come back and punish you you need to understand that he turned an eye turret to the males holding the shrine and spoke in his own language a couple of the males took the shrine over to one edge of the square where it would be visible but would not get in the way the one who spoke chinese had chosen well the other two planted the shrine in the ground then all the little scaly devils got back into the armored motorcar and drove away as soon as they were gone villagers crowded around liu han liu mei and nieh hoting you come from the city a woman said to liu han can it be true what the ugly scaly devil told us if we take down that piece of polished metal and smash it will the little devils know i dont know if they will but they might liu han admitted reluctantly they are very good at making tiny machines that tell them all sorts of things a man asked are they putting up one of these shrines in every village how can i know that am i in every village liu han knew she sounded irritable but she couldnt help it yes she felt cut off from the world here in a village without even a wireless set or a telegraph line and she was worried if the scaly devils had put up a shrine in one noaccount village they were surely putting up shrines in a lot of them if not in all another man said the scaly devils are strong their ancestors must be strong too how can it hurt if we burn paper goods in front of their shrine the way we do for our own ancestors maybe the spirits of the little devils will like us if we do that maybe they will help us if we do that you will be doing what the little devils want if you make offerings to the spirits of their dead liu han said listening she heard her daughter and nieh hoting saying the same thing saying it ever louder and more stridently but the villagers didnt listen if we do this the little devils are more likely to leave us alone one of them said before longeven before people went out to the fieldsautomobiles and big houses and liquor bottles and other offerings all made of paper went up in smoke before the metal shrine sick with defeat liu han went out to grub away weeds in the millet fields around the village she tore them from the ground with savage ferocity her ancestors got no offerings but the dead emperors did where was the justice in that and if the villagers made offerings to the dead emperors wouldnt that lead them toward accepting the little scaly devils as their rightful rulers the scaly devils had to think so or they wouldnt have come out with all these shrines they had a long history of oppressing and coopting peopleor rather other kinds of devilstheyd beaten in war liu han knew that the dialectic said the little devils were doomed progressive forces would overwhelm them but when liu han asked the millet waving gently in the breeze when she got no answer the millet would be there regardless of whether people or little scaly devils ruled the land cursing liu han got back to work these days the russies had to pay only a pound to admit the whole family into services on a friday night or saturday morning see it is cheaper now said one of the lizards collecting the fee at the door nothing to get upset about moishe russie went past the male without a word reuven younger was more inclined to argue it isnt right that we should have to pay anything he said people should be free to worship any way they please no one stops you the lizard answered in hissing hebrew you worship any way you please but if you do not go to the shrine to emperors past you have to pay that is all it is a small thing its wrong reuven insisted its wrong to block the door someone behind him called thats whats wrong muttering reuven went into the synagogue as usual he and his father sat together in the mens section as usual lately before services conversation centered on the worship tax someone asked has anybody actually gone to see what sort of shrine the lizards have for their emperors i would never even look somebody else said i wouldnt go to a church i wouldnt go to a mosque and i dont see how this is any different that drew several nods of agreement moishe russies among them but the man whod asked the question said the lizards never persecuted us the way christians and muslims have if it werent for the lizards a lot of us in this room would be dead if that isnt different what is it it isnt different enough insisted the other fellow whod spoken that started a fine almost talmudic discussion of degrees of difference and when different was different enough with the argument going on services seemed almost irrelevant and sure enough as soon as they were done the discussion picked up again confound it russie youre supposed to be able to fix tsuris like this somebody said to reuvens father why havent you gone and done it do you think i havent tried moishe russie said ive talked to the fleetlord and ive talked even more to his adjutant because atvar is sick of talking with me all i can tell you is the lizards arent going to change their minds about this does anybody actually go to the shrine they built here someone else asked ive seen some people do it reuven said a few christians a few muslims a few of us too disgraceful three men said the same thing at the same time i dont think the world will end reuven said i wouldnt care to do it myself though the world may not end if a few jews go to this shrine moishe russie said heavily but we havent got so many jews that we can afford to waste even a few reuven had a hard time disagreeing with that and then the next monday hed just got into his seat at the medical college when the lizard physician named shpaaka said you tosevites here are an elite you have the privilege of learning from us medical techniques far more sophisticated than any your own kind would have developed for many years to come is this not a truth it is truth superior sir reuven chorused along with the rest of the young men and women in his class i am glad you concede this shpaaka told them because you are an elite more is expected from you than from other tosevites is this not also a truth it is truth superior sir reuven repeated with his classmates he wondered what the lizard was getting at most days almost all days shpaaka simply started lecturing and heaven help the students who couldnt keep up today though he continued because you are privileged you also have responsibilities beyond the ordinary another truth is it not so another truth superior sir reuven said dutifully he wasnt the only one puzzled now half the class looked confused one of the responsibilities you have is to the race shpaaka said in learning our medicine you also learn our culture yet you do not participate in our culture as fully as we would like we are going to take steps to correct this unfortunate situation i realize we should have done this sooner but we have only just reached consensus on the point ourselves jane archibald caught reuvens eyenot hard because his gaze had a way of sliding toward her every so often anyhow what he talking about she mouthed reuven shrugged one shoulder he didnt know either a moment later shpaaka finally got around to the point because you are privileged to attend the moishe russie medical college and learn the races medical techniques we do not think it unjust that you should also learn more of the races way of doing things accordingly from this time forward you shall be required to attend the shrine in this city dedicated to the spirits of emperors past at least once every twenty days as a condition for attending this college shpaaka insisted on decorum in his lecture hall normally he had no trouble getting it and keeping it this was not a normal morning instead of holding up their hands and waiting to be recognized his human students shouted for attention reuven was as loud as any of them louder than most silence shpaaka said but he got no silence this is most unseemly he went on the racket just got louder he spoke again if there is no silence i shall end lectures for today and for as long as seems necessary are you more attached to the pursuit of knowledge or to your superstitions in answer to that reuven shouted loud enough to make himself heard through the din from his fellow students are you more attached to teaching your knowledge or to teaching your superstitions shpaaka drew back behind his lectern plainly affronted we teach the truth in all matters he declared how many spirits of emperors past have returned to tell you so reuven shot back have you ever seen one has anybody ever seen one you are impertinent shpaaka said he was right too and reuven wasnt the only one being impertinent eitherfar from it the lizard went on anyone refusing to give reverence to the spirits of emperors past shall not continue at this college i dismiss you all think on that he left the lecture hall but the clamor didnt die down behind him some of the students the ones without much religion of their own didnt care one way or the other others did care but cared more about what would happen to them if they were forced from the medical college reuven and the muslim students seemed most upset my father will kill me if i go home to baghdad without finishing my medical studies ibrahim nuqrashi said but if i bow before idols he will torture me and then kill meand i would not blame him for doing it there is no god but allah and muhammad is his prophet no one would kill reuven or torture him either if he went to the shrine the lizards had built here in jerusalem even so he couldnt imagine such a thing not for himself the nazis had wanted to kill his family and him for being jews he couldnt slough that off like a snake shedding its skin he made his way over toward jane archibald she nodded to him what are you going to do she asked seeming to understand his dilemma except it wasnt a dilemma not really im coming to say goodbye he answered im not going to stay i cant stay why not she askedno she didnt understand everything that was on his mind i mean its not as if you believe everything thats in the bible is it no of course not he answered he bit his lip he didnt know how to explain it not so it made rational sense it didnt make rational sense to him either not altogether he tried his best if i went to the lizards shrine id be letting down all the jews who came before me thats all jane cocked her head to one side studying him i almost feel i ought to be jealous i cant imagine taking the church of england so seriously so youll go to the shrine then reuven asked why not she said with a shrug if i dont believe in what i grew up with and i dont believe in this either wheres the difference that was perfectly logical part of reuven wished he could see things the same way part of him was relieved he hadnt got intimately involved with jane and part of hima bigger partwished he had he said good luck to you when he said no more she nodded as if hed passed a test or perhaps as if hed failed one she found another question for him what will your father say when be finds out about this i dont know he answered ill find out when he gets home tonight but i dont see how i can do it and even if i dont finish here i know more about medicine than anyone who just went to a human university jane nodded again then hugged him and kissed him which had to drive every male student in the class wild with envy ill miss you she said ill miss you a lot we might have now she shook her head oh whats the use none reuven said none at all he left the lecture hall he left the cube of a building that housed the medical college named for his father and he left the razorwire perimeter around the building one of the lizard sentries at the perimeter said it is not time for you tosevites to be leaving your classes oh yes it is reuven answered in the language of the race it is time for me in fact it is past time for me the sentry started to say something to that then shrugged and waved reuven out into the world beyond the perimeterthe real world he thought as he headed home his mother exclaimed in surprise when he walked in what are you doing here she demanded you should be in class he laughed a little at how much she sounded like the lizard but then he explained his mothers face got longer and longer as she listened after he finished she let out a long sigh you did the right thing i hope so he went into the kitchen took a bottle of plum brandy off a pantry shelf and poured himself a good dose he didnt usually do that in the middle of the day but it wasnt a usual day either your father will be proud of you rivka russie said i hope so reuven repeated he hefted the bottle of slivovitz his father wouldnt be proud of him if he drank himself blind which was what he felt like doing instead with a sigh he put the bottle away the twins also exclaimed when they got home from their school and discovered reuven there ahead of them he made his explanations all over again judith and esthers faces grew unwontedly serious by the time he was through and he explained one more time when his father came home no you cant do that moishe russie said gravely or you could but im glad you didnt till we see what else we can arrange how would you like to help me in my practice thank you father reuven let out a long sigh of relief that would be very good as good as staying at the college he didnt know he had his doubts in fact but it would do dammit i want another chance at him monique dutourd said in a savage whisper as she examined tomatoes in the greengrocers not right now lucie answered choosing one for herself if things change then yes certainly but we dont want to draw too much heat from the nazis down on our heads not for a bit easy for you to say you dont have to sleep with him monique knew she sounded bitter why not she damn well was no im sleeping with your brother lucies voice made the prospect sound extraordinarily nasty even though she and pierre dutourd were both on the dumpy side and getting the lizards to do things isnt so easy whether you know it or not they were very unhappy when they rubbed out that fishmonger not half so unhappy as i was monique said mournfully i had my hopes upand then the miserable fool started shooting too soon and im still stuck with kuhn lucie shrugged if you want to put arsenic in his wine i wont tell you not to do it but youre liable to get caught the advantage of the lizards is if they do the job you get away scot free so do you so does pierre monique put a tomato into her string bag the only reason kuhn started bothering me was to get at pierreand i didnt even know pierre was alive then only an american would expect life to be fair all the time lucie said it isnt as though the boches gave us no trouble that was undoubtedly true it didnt make monique feel any better it didnt keep dieter kuhn out of her bedroom either maybe i will put arsenic in his wine she said and after they arrest me for it and start working me over ill tell them it was your idea they already want to get their hands on me lucie said with a shrug giving them one more reason isnt so much of a much monique was tempted to throw a tomato at her but if she angered lucie her own brother might stop having anything to do with her what would she do then stay an ss mans unwilling mistress till the end of time that was intolerable i want to get away she cried loud enough to make the greengrocer look up from what he was readinga girlie magazine by the cover well then why dont you lucie said if you stay in your flat and let the nazi come over whenever he chooses and do whatever he wants why do you think you deserve anything in the way of sympathy again monique felt like hitting her what am i supposed to do sneak out of my flat throw away my position at the university and sell drugs with you in porte daix without waiting for an answer she took her vegetables up to the shopkeeper he gave her an unhappy look totting up what she owed made him put down the magazine she paid got her change and went out into the warm air of late summer the sun didnt stand so high in the sky as it had a couple of months before autumn was coming and then winter though winter in marseille wasnt the savage beast it was farther north monique was swinging aboard her bicycle when lucie came out too her brothers mistress said if you want to disappear pierre and i can arrange it its easier than you think as a matter of fact and if it gets that german out of your hair and out of your bed why not you must be crazy monique said ive spent my whole life training to be a roman historian now that i finally am i cant just throw that over if you say so dearie lucie answered but im damned if see why not she got on her own bicycle and pedaled away with a muttered curse monique rode back to her own block of flats no bloodstains remained to show where the luckless fish seller had been gunned down instead of sturmbannfuhrer dieter kuhn but she saw them in her minds eye but im damned if i can see why it wasnt him the words gnawed at her as she went upstairs they gnawed even more after kuhn paid her a visit that evening as usual he enjoyed himself and she didnt i wish you would leave me alone she said wearily as he was getting dressed to leave again he smiled at hera smile both sated and something else something less pleasant i know you do that is one of the things that keeps me coming back sweetheart bonne nuit he turned on his heel and walked out jackboots thumping on her carpet after he was gone she got up cleaned herself offthe bidet didnt seem nearly enoughput on a robe and tried to read some latin none of her inscriptions seemed to mean anything she fought them for a while then sighed scowled and gave up and went to bed she slept late the next morning it was sunday church bells clanged as she made her morning coffee along with a croissant and strawberry jam it made a good breakfast she lit a cigarette and sucked in harsh smoke a flat full of books a university position where promotion would be slow if it ever came at all a german lover she loathed this is what ive made of my life she thought and the notion was far harsher than the smoke she didnt want to go back into the bedroom even to dress it reminded her too much of dieter kuhns odious presence as soon as she had dressed she left and manhandled her bicycle down the stairs she couldnt stand staying cooped up in there wrestling with a dead language and with dead hopes off she rode away from her troubles away from marseille up into the hills back of the city that rose steeply from the mediterranean sea the germans had placed antiaircraftmissile batteries in those hills otherwise though she had a surprisingly easy time escaping from civilization presently she pulled off a dirt track and sat down on a flat yellow stone somewhere a long way off a dog barked skippers flitted from dandelion to thistle to clover if only i didnt have to go home monique thought here and there in the hills men scratched out a living from little farms others herded sheep and goats one of them is bound to be looking for a wife monique laughed at herself not going home was one thing spending the rest of her life as a peasant woman was something else again next to that even dieter kuhn looked less appalling didnt he monique didnt have to think about the german now she didnt have to think about anything she could lean back on the stone and close her eyes and let the sunshine turn the inside of her eyelids red she wasnt free she knew she wasnt but she could pretend to be at least for a little while a bee buzzing round her head made her open her eyes another bicyclist was coming up the dirt track toward her she frowned company was the last thing she wanted right now then she recognized the man on the bicycle she stood up how did you find me she demanded angrily her brother smiled as he stopped there are ways such as monique said hands on hips pierres smile got wider and more annoying she thought for a moment then she got angry for another reason you put some miserable lizard toy on my bicycle would i do such a thing her brothers amiability was revoltingly smug of course you would monique answered she looked at the bicycle that had betrayed her nowdid the germans do the same thing will that dog of a kuhn come pedaling up the road ten minutes from now if anything she would have expected the ss man to get out from marseille faster than her brother however much she despised dieter kuhn he was in far better shape than pierre i dont think so pierre still sounded smug i would know if they had would you monique didnt trust anyone any more i wonder why she thought remember the nazis are starting to be able to listen to your talk on the telephone even though you didnt think they could do that so are you sure the gadgets you have from the lizards areas good as they say to her surprise her brother looked thoughtful am i sure no im not sure but i have a pretty good notion with this one monique tossed her head no matter how good a notion he had she didnt particularly want him around she didnt want anyone around why else would she have come all the way out here all right then she said grudgingly what do you want you must want something i should resent that pierre said monique shrugged as if telling him to go ahead he laughed annoying her further and went on there you have me say your say then and leave me whats left of the day monday morning i have to be a scholar again pierre clicked his tongue between his teeth and monday night very likely you will have another visit from the fellow you love so well she spent the next minute or so cursing him one of the main reasons shed come up here was to forget about dieter kuhn for a little while it didnt seem she could even do that her brother waited till she ran down then said if you want to be rid of him for good you really should come down to the porte daix he wont bother you there i promise you that and you might be very useful to me i dont care whether im useful to you or not monique flared all i want is to be left alone i havent had much luck with that and its your fault he bowed more than a little scornfully no doubt you are right do you care about whether the boche comes to your bedroom tomorrow night damn you monique said if it werent for kuhnand it wouldnt have been for kuhn except for pierre all i want is to be left alone shed already said that saying it again underlined it in her own mind saying it again did nothing for pierre though you cant have that it might be nice if you could but you cant you can have the nazi up your twat or you can have the porte daix which will it be monique looked around for a rock there by her feet lay a good one just the size of her hand if she bounced it off her brothers head she might shut him up for good it wasnt so simple it couldnt be so simple if she stayed where she was that didnt just mean kuhn it meant her classes her research her friends at the universitynot that shed had time for them lately and her research had gone to hell shed thought that the night before as for her classes kuhn had got to know her through them so what did that leave her nothing which was exactly what her life had become how could it be worse down there in the porte daix one word and shed find out how it could be worse the past couple of years had taught her such things were always possible porte daix she said wearily if it was worse it was worse that was all at least shed escape dieter kuhn pierre beamed oh good i wont have to tell my friends to put all that stuff back into your flat she glared furiously he kept right on beaming little sister of mine i knew you would see sense when someone pointed it out to you did you monique said her brother nodded she asked another question did i pierre couldnt answer that one neither could she but shed find out nesseref bustled about making sure everything in her apartment was just the way she wanted it to be she didnt have guests all that often and these would be special shed even borrowed a couple of chairs for the occasion she swung an eye turret toward orbit the tsiongi wasnt too happy about being on a leash inside the apartment maybe shed be able to let him off later on but maybe she wouldnt she wouldnt know for a bit and didnt feel like taking chances very much a shuttlecraft pilots view of the world when the knock came she knew at once who it had to be no male or female of the race would have knocked so high on the door few males or females would have knocked at all most would have used the hisser set into the wall by the door frame but using the hisser required a fingerclaw and her guests had none she opened the door i greet you mordechai anielewicz she said come in and this is your hatchling i greet you nesseref the tosevite said yes this is my hatchling his name is heinrich he said something to the younger big ugly in their own language i greet you superior female heinrich anielewicz said in the language of the race i learn your speech in school he didnt speak very well even for a big ugly but she could understand him as she did with mordechai anielewiczs use of the races written language she made allowances speaking as if to a youngster of her own species she said i greet you heinrich anielewicz i am glad you are learning my speech i think it will be useful for you later in life i also think so heinrich said whether because he really did or because that was an easy way to answer nesseref did not know then the gaze of the small big uglyhe was just about nesserefs sizefell on orbit what is that he asked it is not a beffel nesseref laughed orbit would have been insulted had he understood no he is not a beffel the shuttlecraft pilot agreed he is called a tsiongi may i heinrich cast about for a way to say what he wanted he plainly didnt have much in the way of vocabulary but he managed may i be friends with it without waiting for a reply he started toward the tsiongi be careful nesseref said to him and to mordechai anielewicz as well i do not know how the tsiongi will react to tosevites coming up to him none of your species has ever done that before mordechai anielewicz followed his hatchling ready to snatch him back from danger the younger big ugly rather to nesserefs surprise did what a male or female of the race might have done he stretched out a hand toward the tsiongi to let the beast smell him orbits tongue shot out and brushed his fleshy little fingers the tsiongi let out a discontented hiss and deliberately turned away although nesseref didnt know all she might have about how tosevites reacted she would have bet that heinrich anielewicz was discontented too mordechai anielewicz spoke to his hatchling in their own language then he returned to the language of the race for nesserefs benefit i told him this animal might smell on him the odor of the beffel we have at home some of our own animals do not like the smell that others have either ah is that a truth how interesting nesseref saw no reason why things like that shouldnt be so but that they might be hadnt occurred to her in some ways then life on tosev and life on home are not so very different she turned her eye turrets toward heinrich anielewicz and how did you get a beffel of your own i find it in the street he answered then he started speaking his own language mordechai translated he says he gave it something to eat and it followed him home he says he likes it very much and you know how the beffel helped save us when the fire started yes i know that you wrote of it nesseref said what i find hard to imagine is having a fire starting in a building where males and females of your species live when i see this building i understand why you find it hard to imagine the larger anielewicz used an emphatic cough but our buildings are not like this and this fire was set on purpose to try to kill me or so i think he spoke quickly there doing his best to make sure his hatchling couldnt follow what he said he succeeded in that and in any case heinrich anielewicz seemed more interested in orbit than in nesseref the shuttlecraft pilot said you have vicious enemies truth mordechais shrug was much like one from a male of the race do you see why i would rather talk about befflem befflem heinrich understood that word what about befflem what interests me about befflem nesseref said is that they have so quickly begun to run wild here i hear this is true of several kinds of our animals we begin to make tosev into a world more like home through them heinrich didnt get all of that mordechai did he said for you this may be fine for us i do not think it is before nesseref could answer that the timer in the kitchen hissed ah good she said that means supper is ready i have made it from the meat of tosevite animals as you asked and made sure none of it was from the one you call pig i do not understand why you cannot eat other meats but i am not quarreling with you we jews can eat other meats but we may not mordechai anielewicz said it is one of the rules of our superstition is what the race calls it why have such rules nesseref asked do they not pose a nutritional hardship nor really or not very often mordechai answered they do help remind us that we are a special group of tosevites our belief is that the one who created the universe made us his chosen group nesseref had learned that all big uglies were on the prickly side when it came to their superstitions picking her words with care she asked chosen for what for disagreements with your neighbors mordechai anielewicz translated that into his own tongue he and heinrich both let out yips of barking tosevite laughter in the language of the race mordechai said it often seems so well you and your hatchling and i are not disagreeing nesseref said let us sit down and eat together i have alcohol for you if you would care for it afterwards we can talk more about these things good enough mordechai said can i do anything to help i do not think so nesseref said i have chairs for your kind and i also have your style of eating utensils let us use them now heinrich anielewicz went straight through the doorway into the eating area mordechai anielewicz had to duck his head to get through as hed had to duck his head to enter nesserefs apartment shed wondered if he would be able to stand straight inside the apartment but his head didnt quite brush the ceiling even so he said now i understand why the race calls us big uglies in a place made for the race i feel very large indeed he spoke in his own tongue to his hatchling who answered him in the same language the older tosevite translated heinrich says he thinks this place is just the right size for him it would be nesseref corrected herself for him it would be now when he is full grown it will seem cramped to him too here sit down both of you and i will bring the food and the alcohol only a little alcohol for my hatchling mordechai anielewicz said it is not our custom to let hatchlings become intoxicated nor ours nesseref agreed but a little will do no harm the elder anielewiczs head went up and down the tosevite gesture of agreement after a moment nesseref brought bowls of stew from the kitchen to the table nothing in the stew would offend mordechai and heinrichs sensibilities it was of the local meat called beef and had more vegetables in it than nesseref would have used had she been cooking for herself tosevites shed learned preferred more calories from carbohydrates and fewer from proteins and fats than did the race as everyone began to eat a problem developed mordechai anielewicz said superior female may we please have knives as well as forks and spoons some of these pieces are rather large for us it shall be done nesseref hurried back into the kitchen and returned with the utensils as she handed one to each of the tosevites she said you have my apologies i cut the meat and the vegetables in portions that would fit my mouth forgetting that yours are smaller no harm done mordechai anielewicz said we have creatures called snakes that can take very large bites but we tosevites cannot the big uglies smaller mouthparts didnt keep them from finishing the supper at about the same time as nesseref did is it enough she asked anxiously i do not know just how much you eat at a meal if you are still hungry plenty more is in the pot after the elder and younger spoke back and forth mordechai said my hatchling tells me he has had enough you gave him about what he would eat at home i would thank you for a little more if it is no trouble it is no trouble at all nesseref used an emphatic cough she brought the bigger big ugly another bowl of stew and also took a smaller second helping for herself to the growing hatchling she said you may play with the tsiongi while we finish if he will permit it please be careful though if he does not just watch him i do not want you bitten heinrich anielewicz followed that without need for translation i thank you superior female he said it shall be done he brought out the stock phrases more fluently than he spoke while trying to shape his own thoughts in the races language pushing back his chair he returned to the front room nesseref listened for sounds of alarm but none came mordechai anielewicz sipped at his alcohol he too seemed to be listening to make sure heinrich and orbit were getting on well when things had stayed quiet for a little while he said may i ask you a question superior female you may ask nesseref said i may not know the answer or i may know and be unable to tell you that depends on the question i understand the big ugly said here it is do you know how close the deutsche came to launching an attack on poland recently ah nesseref said no i do not know how close not for a certainty for that you would have to talk with the males of the conquest fleet i do know my shuttlecraft port was placed on heightened alert and that the alert was abandoned a few days later the race i would say judges any immediate danger past the race i would say is too optimistic anielewicz answered but i thank you for the information it confirms other things i have learned we may have been very lucky there nesseref asked a question of her own and if we had not been what would you have done with your explosivemetal bomb then she still didnt know if he had one but she thought he might do you know the tosevite story of samson in the uh house of superstition anielewicz asked when the shuttlecraft pilot made the negative hand gesture the big ugly said count yourself lucky he added an emphatic cough atvar turned an eye turret toward pshing with more than a little annoyance must i see the accursed tosevite now he said exalted fleetlord it is a scheduled appointment his adjutant answered having conceded these notempires their independence we seem to have little choice but to treat them as if we meant it i am painfully aware of that atvar answered if you will recall i recently suffered through a harangue from the american ambassador who seemed shocked we would presume to swing an eye turret in the direction of what his notempire is doing with its spaceship truculent arrogant maybe i should retire and let reffet see how he likes taking on this whole burden please do not do that exalted fleetlord pshing said earnestly you would leave us at the mercy of the colonists they still show little true understanding of the realities of tosev well there you have spoken a truth atvar said flattered but it is a temptation nonetheless i have done too much for too long kirel might manage as wellor as poorlyas i have in atvars opinion the thing most likely to limit kirels effectiveness was kirel himself he kept that to himself he would not cast aspersions on the senior shiplord of the conquest fleet to amuse his adjutant send in the deutsch ambassador he said the sooner i have heard his absurd outlandish complaints the sooner i can dispose of them it shall be done pshing went out into an antechamber and returned with a big ugly named ludwig bieberback atvar preferred dealing with bieberback to trying to deal with his predecessor ribbentrop this tosevite had some elementary understanding of the world around him he also spoke the language of the race going through interpreters had often been enough to give atvar the itch i greet you exalted fleetlord the deutsch male said now assuming the posture of respect and i greet you ambassador atvar replied please be seated he waved the big ugly to a chair made for his kind i thank you after bieberback had sat down he said exalted fleetlord i am here to protest the arrogant and highhanded way in which the races ambassador to the reich presumed to pass judgment on our movements of soldiers within our own territory he did so at my express order atvar said he had learned from painful experience that rudeness worked better with the deutsche than tact which they took for weakness if you try to attack poland we will smash you flat is that plain enough for you to understand we deny that the reich intended to do any such thing ludwig bieberback said we have a legitimate right of selfdefense and we were exercising it in a nonprovocative manner no you were not or i would not have had my warning delivered to you atvar said and we do not find your denials credible the reich has carried on a covert conflict with the race since the fighting stopped to have that break into open war would not surprise us in the least and you would not find us unprepared to take the harshest measures against your notempire this presumption of yours is intolerable bieberback said is it any wonder so many tosevites seek to be free of your rule nothing tosevites do is much of a wonder atvar said is it any wonder that the race has to keep both eye turrets toward all tosevite notempires at all times to make sure we are not treacherously assailed that is not how the race operates in practice bieberback answered a whine coming into his mushy voice in practice you persecute the reich more than all others put together you have spoken an untruth the fleetlord told him and if we do keep a particularly close watch on the reich it is because the reich has shown itself to be particularly untrustworthy now you have spoken an untruth ludwig bieberback said a discourtesy no one from the race except reffet would have presumed to offer atvar if we cannot live in peace we will have to see how else the deutsche can obtain their legitimate rights from you if you try to take what you imagine to be your legitimate rights by force you will discover how easy your notempire is to devastate atvar said what gives you the right to make such threats bieberback demanded the power to make them good atvar replied you and your notemperor would be wise to remember it bieberback rose and bowed the tosevite equivalent of assuming the posture of respect i think there is little point to continuing these discussions he said the reich will act in accordance to its interests yes the reich would be wise to do that atvar agreed it would also be wise to bear in mind that antagonizing the race is not in its interest antagonize the race enough and the reich will abruptly cease to be with another bow the big ugly said we shall defend ourselves against your aggression to the best of our ability good day without waiting for the fleetlords leave he walked out of the office atvar let out a long sigh pshing came in a moment later the fleetlord said we shall have to keep ourselves at increased alert against the reich plainly the deutsche have belligerent intentions shall i prepare orders to that effect pshing asked yes do so atvar answered so long as these big uglies see they cannot take us by surprise they are unlikely to attack us if we ignore them we put ourselves in danger truth exalted fleetlord pshing said i shall draft the orders for your approval very good atvar made the affirmative hand gesture and when you transmit them to the males of the conquest fleet in poland and in space do not do so over the channels with the greatest security his adjutant let out a startled hiss exalted fleetlord if i follow that order the deutsche are only too likely to intercept our transmission much as i hate to say it they are beginning to gain the technology required to defeat some of our less sophisticated scrambler circuits yes so i understand from some of the reports reaching us from the part of the reich known as france atvar replied in most circumstances this is a nuisanceworse than a nuisance in fact but here i want them to intercept the order i want them to know we are alerted to the possibility of unprovoked attack from them i want them to know that they will pay dearly if they make such an attack ah pshing assumed the posture of respect exalted fleetlord i congratulate you that is deviousness worthy of a big ugly i thank you atvar said even if the form of the compliment was not what he might have liked the deutsche will feel they have genuinely important information if they think they are stealing it from us if we give it to them on the other fork of the tongue they will think we want them to have it and so will discount it ah pshing repeated he turned an eye turret toward the fleetlord no one from the colonization fleet could possibly have such a deep understanding of the way big uglies think that was a compliment atvar could appreciate in full and i thank you once more he said by now we of the conquest fleet have more experience of the tosevites than anyone could want even so pshing said with an emphatic cough in aid of which have you yet decided what we ought to do with the rabblerouser named khomeini now that he is finally in our hands not yet atvar said by the emperor though having his hateful voice silenced is a relief he is far from the only fanatical agitator in this part of the main continental mass but he was among the most virulent and the most effective his followers are among the most virulent too even among those who follow the muslim superstition pshing said if he remains imprisoned they are liable to stop at nothing in their efforts to free him i am painfully aware of this atvar said we have to our sorrow seen too many such effortsand too many of them have succeeded i have made matters more difficult for the big uglies by ordering khomeini transferred to a prison in the southern region of the lesser continental mass the big uglies there speak a different language and follow the christian superstition so his influence among them should be much less than it would were we to have kept him incarcerated locally this also shows considerable understanding of tosevite psychology his adjutant remarked so it does but i cannot take full credit for it atvar said moishe russie suggested it to me this khomeini is almost as antithetical to the big uglies of the jewish superstition as he is to us so as against the deutsche russie was able to make the suggestion in good conscience excellent pshing said we do our best when we can turn the tosevites differences among themselves to our advantage the only trouble being too often they abandon those differences to unite against us atvar said they might even do that in the case of khomeini which is the main reason why i am considering ordering his execution both of pshings eye turrets swung sharply toward him exalted fleetlord he said as if wondering whether hed heard correctly atvar understood that the race had not used capital punishment since long before home was unified but he said this is a barbarous world and ruling itor ruling our portion of itrequires barbarous measures during the fighting did we not match the big uglies city for city with explosivemetal bombs but that was during the fighting pshing answered so it was atvar agreed but the fighting on tosev has never truly stopped it has only slowed he sighed unless it comes to a boil again and destroys this world it is liable to continue at this low level for generations to come if we do not adopt our methods to the ones widely used and understood here we will suffer more as a result but what shall we become if we do adapt our methods to those the big uglies use and understand pshing asked barbarized atvar did not flinch from the answer different from the males and females on the other worlds of the empire ginger contributes to such differences too as we know all too well he sighed once more perhaps over hundreds and over thousands of years we will become more like those we have left behind after a moment he sighed yet again even less happily and perhaps not too the frontier between lizardoccupied poland and the greater german reich was less than a hundred kilometers west of lodz mordechai anielewicz used bicycle trips to the frontier region to keep himself strongand to keep an eye on what the nazis might be up to as he neared the border he swung off the bicycle to rest and to try to rub the stiffness out of his legs he wasnt too sore the poison gas hed breathed all those years before sometimes dug its claws into him much harder than this it was hot but not too muggy sweat didnt cling as it might have on a lot of summer days he stood on top of a small hill from which he could peer west into germany even with field glasses which he didnt have he couldnt have seen a great deal no tanks rumbled toward the border from the west as they had in the only visible german soldiers were a couple of sentries pacing their routes one of them was smoking a cigarette a plume of smoke drifted after him in a way the calm was reassuring the wehrmacht didnt look ready to come charging toward lodz in another way though this land was wars home it was low and flat and greenideal country for panzers in front of the smoking sentry lay barbed wire thicker than either side had put down in the first world war concrete antitank obstacles stood among the thickets of barbed wire like great gray teeth more of them farther from the frontier worked to channel armored fighting vehicles to a handful of routes at which the german troops no doubt had heavy weapons aimed this side of the frontier the polish side was less ostentatiously fortified the nazis went in for large intimidating displays the race didnt more of the lizards installations were camouflaged or underground but mordechai knew how the race could fight and also knew both the poles and the jews would fight at the lizards side to keep the reich from returning to poland he raised his eyes and looked farther west past the immediate border region mist and distance blocked his gaze he wouldnt have been able to see the german rockets aimed at poland anyhowrockets tipped with explosivemetal bombs the jews and poles couldnt do anything about them anielewicz hoped the lizards could either by knocking down the german rockets or by sending so many into the reich as to leave it a lifeless wasteland with such gloomy thoughts in his mind he didnt hear the mechanized combat vehicle coming up behind him till it got very close it was much quieter than a humanmade machine of the same type would have been the lizards had had not a couple of decades but tens of thousands of years to refine their designs they were splendid engineers an engineering student himself back in the days before the world went mad anielewicz understood that but they moved in little steps not the great leaps people sometimes took the combat vehicle stopped at the top of the hill a lizardan officer by his body paintgot out and peered west as mordechai had been doing he had field glasses of odd design by human standards but perfectly adapted to the shape of his head and to his eye turrets after lowering the binoculars he turned one eye toward anielewicz what are you doing here he asked in fair polish looking at what the enemy may be up tothe same as you i suspect anielewicz answered in the language of the race if there is any trouble we will defend poland the lizard said also in his own language you need not concern yourself about it anielewicz laughed in the arrogant males face the lizard plainly startled drew back a pace anielewicz said we tosevites fought alongside you to expel the deutsche from this region theyd also helped the germans against the race in a nasty balancing act mordechai hoped never to have to try again not mentioning that he went on we will fight alongside you if the deutsche attack now if you do not understand that you must be very new to the region he almost laughed at the lizard again had the male been a human being he would have looked flabbergasted the race had less mobile features but the way the officer held himself proclaimed his astonishment he asked who are you to speak to me so my name is mordechai anielewicz anielewicz answered wondering if the lizard was so new to poland that that wouldnt mean anything to him but how could he be if he spoke polish and he wasnt ah the tosevite fighting leader he exclaimed no wonder you have an interest in the deutsche then no wonder at all anielewicz agreed dryly what i do wonder about is your foolish insistence before that tosevites were not fighters i hope you know better i hope your superiors know better i am sorry the lizard said a rare admission from his kind then he spoiled it i took you for an ordinary lazy big ugly not one of the less common sort thank you so much mordechai said are you sure you are a male of the race and not a male of the deutsche few germans could have been more open in their scorn for polish and jewish untermenschen but the lizard applied his scorn to the whole human race remember hes an ally anielewicz reminded himself of course i am sure the male said whatever he was he had no sense of humor and no sense of irony i am also sure that the deutsche will not dare attack us not after the warnings we have given them you may take this to your fighters and tell them to rest easy there have been warnings then mordechai asked and the lizard made the affirmative hand gesture that was news anielewicz hadnt heard beforeand as far as he was concerned good news he said the one thing i will tell you is that the deutsche can be treacherous all big uglies can be treacherous the male answered we have learned this to our sorrow ever since the conquest fleet came to tosev to him that obviously included anielewicz he had some reason for his suspicions too with luck he didnt know how much mordechai said we jews will fight with the race against the deutsche i know this this is good you will fight harder against the reich than you would against the sssr the lizard officer said but the poles while they will also fight for us against the reich might well fight harder against the sssr is this not a truth you will know your fellow tosevites better than i can you know them well enough or so it seems anielewicz saidthe lizard had a good grasp of local politics some of us reckon one side a worse enemy some the other we all have reasons we think good i know that the male let out a hiss of discontent this trying to deal with every tiny grouping of tosevites as if it were an empire has addled a good many of us it is but one way in which you are such a troublesome species i thank you anielewicz said straightfaced you thank me after his interrogative cough the lizard spread his hands to show more perplexity i do not understand never mind mordechai said resignedly is it a joke no the lizard wasnt able to tell he went on if it is i warn you to be careful otherwise one day the joke will be on you before anielewicz could come up with an answer for that the officer continued since you are who you are i suppose you have come to the border here to spy on the deutsche yes as a matter of fact i have mordechai saw no point in denying the obvious you may tell your superiors that you met me here and you may tell them that we jews are in the highest state of readiness with all our weapons we will resist the deutsche with every means at our disposalevery means as hed intended the male got his driftthis was indeed an alert clever lizard even if one without a sense of humor does that include explosivemetal weapons he asked i hope both you and the deutsche never have to find out anielewicz answered you may tell that to your superiors too after more than twenty years he didnt know whether the bomb the nazis had meant for lodz would work either he too hoped he would never have to find out most lizards would have kept on grilling him about the explosivemetal bomb this one didnt instead of pounding away at an area where he wouldnt get any answers he adroitly changed the subject pointing west he asked do you observe anything that in your opinion requires special vigilance on our part no mordechai admitted not altogether happily he laughed at himself i am not altogether sure whether coming to the border was a waste of time but i did it anyhow still you of the race can observe from high over the heads of the deutsche he pointed up into space you can see far more than i could hope to from this little hill but if you saw something you would be more likely to do so with full understanding the officer said we have been deceived before no doubt we shall be deceived again and again until such time as this world at last fully becomes part of the empire just when anielewicz began to think this lizard did understand people after all the male came out with something like that do you really believe the race will conquer the independent notempires yes the lizard answered for you tosevites a few years seem a long time over hundreds of years over thousands of years we are bound to prevail he spoke of the races triumph with the certainty a communist would have used to proclaim the victory of the proletariat or a nazi the dominance of the herrenvolk anielewicz said we may not think in the long terms as well as the race does but we also change more readily than the race does what will happen if before hundreds or thousands of years pass we go ahead of you you had better not the lizard replied this is under discussion among us and you had better not he sounded as if he were warning anielewicz in person why not the jewish fighting leader asked what will happen if we do the consensus among our leaders is we will destroy this entire planet the male said matteroffactly if you tosevites are a danger to the race here on tosev you are an annoyancea large annoyance but an annoyance nonetheless if you seem likely to be able to trouble the other worlds of the empire you are no longer an annoyance you are a danger a deadly danger we do not intend to let that happen he added an emphatic cough what about your colonists mordechai asked ice running through him not even the germans spoke so calmly of destruction hed seen before that lizards shrugged much as men did that would be most unfortunate we might have done very well on this world but the empire as a whole is more important humans would have had a hard time thinking so dispassionately anielewicz stared after the officer who got back into his vehicle as it clattered off mordechai looked east after it and then into the reich once more he shivered hed suddenly got a brandnew reason to worry about the germans gorppet bent into the posture of respect after so many years as a simple infantrymale superior sir i never expected to be promoted to officers rank you have earned it answered the officer sitting across the table from him by capturing khomeini you have earned not only the promotion not only the stated reward but almost anything else you desire for which i thank you superior sir gorppet knew hed have a harder time collecting on the promise than the officer did making it but he was going to try anyhow i have served in this region of the main continental mass since what is called the end of the fighting and i fought in the sssr before that i know your record the officerthe other officer gorppet thoughtsaid it does you credit and i thank you once more superior sir as far as gorppet was concerned his record showed he remained alive and intact only by a miracle having served in such hazardous posts what i would like most of all is a transfer to an area where the conditions are less intense i understand why you say this but could i not persuade you to ask for a different boon the officer said i knew it gorppet thought the other male went on your experience makes you extremely valuable here without it in fact you would hardly have been able to recognize and capture the wily khomeini no doubt that is a truth superior sir but i am beginning to feel i have used up about all the luck i ever had gorppet answered you asked what i wanted i told you are you telling me i may not have it the officer sighed and waggled his eye turrets in a way that suggested gorppet was asking for more than he had any right to expect the newly promoted trooper held his ground the officer sighed again he had not expected gorppet to request a transfer or to insist on getting it gorppet didnt care what the officer had expected he knew what he wanted if he had a chance for it he would grab with both hands with one more sigh the officer turned his swiveling chair half away from gorppet to use the computer gorppet turned his eye turrets toward the screen but he was too far away and at too bad an angle to be able to read anything on it and the officer did not speak to the machine but used the keyboard gorppets suspicions rose if the other male told him no posts elsewhere were available he would raise as big a fuss as he could he wished hed been wise enough to record this conversation he might well need the evidence to support his claims of promises denied but at last the officer turned back to him there is a position available in the extreme south of the main continental mass the male said unwillingly i will take it superior sir gorppet said at once get my acceptance into the computer if you would be so kind very well no the officer did not sound happy how much do you know about this place called south africa he asked as he clicked keys nothing whatsoever gorppet answered cheerfully but i am sure it cannot possibly be worse than basra and baghdad the climate is worse the officer warned as far as climate goes this is one of the best parts of tosev no doubt you are right superior sir gorppet saidopenly disagreeing with a superior did not do and the other male was right this area of tosev did have good weather still gorppet continued as far as the big uglies go though this is one of the worst parts of the planet i have had more than enough of them i doubt you will find the big uglies in south africa much of an improvement the officer said the ones with light skins hate and resent us for making the ones with dark skins who outnumber them their equals the ones with the dark skins hate and resent us because we do not let them massacre the ones with the light skins i am willing to take my chances with them dark and light gorppet said as long as they are not so fanatical as to kill themselves so they can harm us they are an improvement on the tosevites hereabouts he pushed things a little i very much look forward to receiving my transfer orders with a snorted hiss full of angry resignation the officer turned back to the computer although he kept one eye turret on gorppet as if afraid gorppet would steal something if he gave the machine all his attention after a little while a sheet of paper came out of the printer by the computer the officer thrust it at gorppet there is a flight from baghdad to cairo tomorrow you will be on it there is a flight from cairo to cape town the day after you will be on it too gorppet read the travel document to make sure it said what the officer told him it did hed stopped taking officers words on trust shortly after he started fighting in the sssr that was one of the reasons the spirits of emperors past hadnt yet greeted his spirit these orders however read as they were supposed to i thank you for your help superior sir he said though the officer had done everything he could to thwart him i will be on that flight tomorrow see that you are the other male said distantly as if he were doing his best to forget gorppet had ever stood before him i dismiss you gorppet went back to the barracks and packed his belongings that wasnt a hard job everything he ownedexcept for his new and much improved credit balancehe could sling on his back just for a moment he wondered if that was a fitting reward for having gone through so much danger he shrugged that wasnt the sort of question a soldiers training made him fit to answer he said his goodbyes to his squad he would miss some of them though not all if he ever thought of betvoss again it would be with annoyance he was at the airfield long before his aircraft would leave nothing must go wrong he thought and nothing did the flight took off on time had little turbulence and landed in cairo on time he got ground transport to a transient barracks to wait for his next flight the big uglies on the streets of this city might have come from baghdad a couple of them concealed by the crowd threw stones at the vehicle in which gorppet was riding does that happen very often he asked the driver only on days when the sun comes up in the morning the other male assured him they both laughed and spent the rest of the journey through the crowded streets swapping war stories more big uglies threw rocks at the vehicle that took gorppet back to the cairo airfield the next day you ought to teach them manners with your machine gun he told the male at the wheel of this machine orders are to hold our fire unless they start using firearms against us the driver answered with a resigned shrug if we started shooting at them for rocks we would have riots every day or else they might learn they are not supposed to do things like that gorppet said the driver shrugged again and did not reply gorppet outranked himnow gorppet outranked himbut he had to do as local authority told him to do no one fired at the vehicle gorppet carried his gear into the aircraft that would take him to this place called south africa he wondered what it would be like different from baghdad was what he wanted the officer back there had told him the big uglies in the new place were different that was good as far as he was concerned the officer had also told him the weather was different that wasnt so good but couldnt be helped after a winter in the sssr gorppet doubted anything less would unduly faze him peering out the window he saw the aircraft pass over terrain desolate even by the standards of home afterwards though endless lush green vegetation replaced the desert gorppet stared down at it in revolted fascination it seemed almost malignant in the aggressiveness of its growth only a few scattered river valleys and seasides back on home even came close to such fertility so much unrelieved green proved depressing gorppet fell asleep for a while when he woke again the jungle was behind him replaced by savanna country that gave way in turn to desert once more then to his surprise more fertile country replaced the wasteland the aircraft descended landed and came to a stop welcome to south africa the pilot said over the intercom to gorppet and to the males and females whod traveled with him you had better get out nothing but sea after this sea and the frozen continent around the south pole gorppet shouldered his sack and went down the ramp blackskinned big uglies had wheeled over to the aircraft hed seen few of that race up till now they looked different from the lighter tosevites but were no less ugly when they spoke he discovered he couldnt understand anything they said he sighed knowing what the big uglies back in basra and baghdad were talking about had helped keep him alive a couple of times he would have to see how many languages the local tosevites spoke and how hard they were to learn sack still shouldered he trudged toward the airfield terminal the weather was on the chilly side the officer back in baghdad hadnt lied about that but gorppet didnt see any frozen water on the ground and even the broad flat mountain to the east of the airfield and the nearby city was free of the nasty stuff it will not be too bad he told himself and hoped he was right in the terminal as hed expected was a reassignment station a female clerk turned one eye turret toward him how may i help you smallunit group leader she asked reading his very new very fresh body paint after giving his name and pay number gorppet continued reporting as ordered i need quarters and a duty assignment let me see whether your name has gone all the way through the system the female said she spoke to the computer and examined the screen after a moment she made the affirmative hand gesture yes we have you you are assigned to cape town as a matter of fact and where in this subregion is cape town gorppet asked this city here is cape town the clerk answered did you not study the area to which you would be transferred not very much gorppet admitted i got the order a couple of days ago and have spent my time since either traveling or staying in transit barracks no reason you could not have examined a terminal there the female clerk said primly i would have thought an officer would show more interest in the region to which he has been assigned that took gorppet by surprise he wasnt used to being an officer he wasnt used to thinking like an officer either as an infantrymale hed gone where he was ordered and hadnt worried about it past that fighting embarrassment he spoke gruffly well i am here now let me have a printout of my billet and assignment it shall be done the clerk said and handed him the paper he rapidly read the new orders city patrol is it i can do that i have been doing it for a long time and this is a relatively tranquil region is it the clerk said if you are coming from worse i sympathize with you she got very insulted when gorppet laughed at her ttomalss studied the report that had come up from the moishe russie medical college based on our present knowledge of tosevite physiology and of available immunizations the physician named shpaaka wrote it seems possible even probable that the specimen may after receiving the said immunizations safely interact with wild tosevites nothing in medicine however is so certain as it is in engineering with a discontented mutter ttomalss blanked the computer screen hed hoped for a definitive answer if the males down at the medical college couldnt give him one where would he get it nowhere was the obvious answer he recognized that shpaaka was doing the best he could psychological research was also less exact than engineering that still left ttomalss unhappy after more mutters he telephoned kassquit i greet you superior sir she said how are you this morning i am well thank you ttomalss answered and yourself very well she said and what is the occasion of this call she undoubtedly knew she could hardly help knowing that she asked had to mean she was unhappy about proceeding even so ttomalss explained the news hed got from the physician down on the surface of tosev he finished are you willing to undergo this series of immunizations so you are physically able to meet with wild big uglies i do not know superior sir kassquit replied what are the effects of the immunizations likely to be on me i do not suppose there will be very many effects ttomalss said why should there be there are no major effects to immunizations among the race i had most of mine in early hatchlinghood and scarcely remember them i see kassquit made the affirmative hand gesture to show she understood but then she said still these would not be immunizations from the race they would be immunizations from the big uglies for tosevite diseases the big uglies are less advanced than the race in a great many areas and i am certain medicine is one of them well no doubt that is a truth ttomalss admitted what he could hardly deny let me inquire of shpaaka when he gives me the answer i shall relay it to you he broke the connection on telephoning the physician he got a recorded message telling him shpaaka had gone to teach and would return his call as soon as possible his own computer had the same kind of programming which didnt make him any happier about being on the receiving end of it concealing annoyance over such things was part of good manners he recorded his message and settled into some other work while waiting for shpaaka to get back to him after what seemed forever but really wasnt the physician did call back i greet you senior researcher shpaaka said you asked an interesting question there i thank you senior physician ttomalss replied the question however does not come from me it comes from my tosevite ward who is of course most intimately concerned with it i see that certainly makes sense shpaaka said i had to do some research of my own before i could give the answer partly by asking big ugly students of their experience with immunizations partly having some of them consult tosevite medical texts so they could translate the data in those texts for me i thank you for your diligence ttomalss said and what conclusions did you reach that tosevite medicine like so much on this planet is primitive and sophisticated at the same time the physician told him the big uglies know how to stimulate the immune system to make it produce antibodies against various local diseases but do so by brute force without caring much about reducing symptoms from the immunizations some of them appear to be unpleasant though none has any longterm consequences worthy of note i see ttomalss repeated not altogether happily if the immunizations were likely to make kassquit sick would she want to go forward with them shpaaka said i tell you this senior researcher finding your answer has been one of the more pleasant enjoyable and interesting things i have had to do lately oh ttomalss said as he was plainly meant to do and why is that because the medical college has been cast into turmoil that is why the physician replied you may or may not know that some miserable individual who thought he was more clever than he really was devised the brilliant plan of making the big uglies pay for the privilege of exercising their superstitions which has provoked disorder over wide stretches of tosev yes i do recall that ttomalss said in faintly strangled tones shpaakas sarcasm stung fortunately the other male didnt know he was talking to the originator of the plan he scorned you do good shpaaka said well someone then decided on the converse for the medical college that no one who failed to give reverence to the spirits of emperors past would be allowed to continue what no one anticipated however was that many big ugliesincluding some of the most able students and even including the hatchling of the big ugly for whom the medical college was namedwould be so attached to their superstitions that they would withdraw instead of doing what we required of them that is unfortunate both for them and for relations between the race and their species ttomalss said shpaaka made the affirmative hand gesture it is also unfortunate for the tosevites these halftrained individuals will eventually treat they would have done far better by choosing to stay ttomalss hadnt thought about infirm big uglies hed seen plenty in chinarather fewer in the reich where the standards of medicine if not high were higher well it cannot be helped he said after a brief pause oh it could be shpaaka said all we have to do is rescind the idiotic policy we are now following but i do not expect that and i shall not take up any more of your time advocating it good day to you good day ttomalss answered but he was talking to a blank screen the physician had already gone he thought about telephoning kassquit with the news but decided to wait and take a meal with her at the refectory so he could pass it along in person among the race males and females had a harder time saying no in person than they did over the telephone ttomalss idly wondered if the same held true among the big ugliesthose of them who had telephones that is eventually the race would get around to researching such things he doubted the time would come while he remained alive though at the next meal he put shpaakas opinion to kassquit how do you feel about the notion of bodily discomfort he asked i really do not know she answered i have known very little bodily discomfort in my life here the notion of illness seems strange to me you are fortunatefar more fortunate than the big uglies down on the surface of tosev ttomalss said you have never been exposed to the microorganisms that cause disease among them and those of the race do not seem to find you appetizing if i were to meet with wild big uglies i would need these immunizations would i not kassquit asked i would strongly recommend that you have them at any rate ttomalss said i would not wish to see you fall ill as a result of such a meeting and i certainly would not wish you to die not after l have put so much hard work into raising you up to this point kassquit might have plucked that thought right out of his head she said yes it would be inconvenient to you if i died in the middle of your research would it not after a moment she added it would also be most inconvenient to me she used an emphatic cough of course it would ttomalss said uncomfortably if you do decide to meet with these wild tosevites in person you would be wise to receive these immunizations first you very much want me to meet with them is that not so without waiting for ttomalss reply kassquit gave one herself it must be so why else would you have gone to all the trouble of raising me she sighed well if i am going to be an experimental animal i had best be a good one is that not a truth superior sir she waved a hand at the refectory full of males and females for all your efforts and for all mine i can never fully fit in here can i perhaps not fully but as much as a rabotev or a hallessi ttomalss spoke with care as kassquit reached maturity so did her sense of judgment she proved that by making the negative hand gesture i believe you are mistaken superior sir from all i have been able to learnand i have done my best to learn all i could since the matter so urgently concerns methe hallessi and rabotevs are far more like the race than tosevites are would you agree with that or not i would have to agree ttomalss said wishing he could do anything but yet knowing he would forfeit her confidence forever if he lied but i would also have to tell you that when the day comes when all tosevites are as acculturated to the ways of the empire as you are now the race will have no difficulty in ruling this planet may it be so kassquit said and you need me to help you make it so is that not also a truth you know it is ttomalss answered you have known it ever since you grew old enough to understand such things kassquit sighed again truth superior sir i have known that and the best way for me to make it so is for me to begin meeting with big uglies in person you have wanted me to do so since my first telephone conversation with sam yeager and you were surely planning such a thing even before the big ugly precipitated matters can you truthfully tell me i am mistaken no ttomalss said i cannot tell you that but i can tell you i have not tried to force you onto this course and i shall not do so if you do not wish it it shall not be done for which i thank youbut it needs to be done does it not kassquit asked bleakly again she did not wait for ttomalss to reply but answered her own question it does indeed need to be done very well superior sir i shall do it there in the crowded refectory ttomalss rose from his seat and assumed the posture of respect before kassquit his tosevite ward exclaimed in surprise so did a good many males and females who also stared and pointed he didnt care as far as he was concerned what hed done was altogether appropriate as he rose once more he said i thank you you are welcome kassquit answered you may give whatever orders are necessary to begin the immunization process i shall do that ttomalss said hed almost answered it shall be done kassquit was not his superior somehow though shed made him feel as if she were he wondered how shed managed to do that in her life aboard the races starship kassquit had known little bodily discomfort oh shed had her share of bumps and bruises and cutsmore than her share as she saw things for her skin was softer and more vulnerable than the scaly hides of the racebut none of them had been bad and since her body reached maturity shed also had to deal with the cyclic nature of tosevite female physiology it made her resent her originsthe race certainly had no such problemsbut with the passage of time shed grown resigned to it these immunizations brought a whole different order of unpleasantness one of them raised a nasty pustule on her arm up till then her knowledge of infections had been purely theoretical for a while as the afflicted region swelled and hurt she wondered if her immune system could cope with the microorganisms from the planet on which her kind had evolved but after a few days the pustule did scab over even though the scar it left behind looked as if it was liable to be permanent other injections proved almost as unpleasant as that one they made her arm or her buttock sore for a couple of days at a time some of them raised her body temperature as her immune system fought the germs that stimulated it shed never known fever before and didnt enjoy the feeling of lassitude and stupidity it brought as a physician readied yet another hypodermic she asked by the emperor how many diseases are there down on tosev a great many the male answered casting down his eyes for a moment even more than there are on home by all indicationsor perhaps it is just that the big uglies can cure or prevent so few of them this one is called cholera i believe it is not an illness you would want to have and that is a truth he used an emphatic cough this immunization does not confer perfect resistance to the causative organism but it is the best the tosevites can do now you will give me your arm it shall be done kassquit said with a sigh she did not flinch as the needle penetrated her there that was very easy the physician said swabbing the injection site with a disinfectant it was in fact easier than it would have been with a male or female of the race here your thin skin is an advantage how nice kassquit said distantly she did not want to be different from the race with all her heart she wished she could be a female like any other she knew what such wishes were worth but couldnt help making them except for the one that had raised the pustule the injection for the disease called cholera proved the most unpleasant kassquit had endured she enjoyed neither the pain nor the fever they seemed to take forever to ebb if the disease was worse than the treatment that guarded against it it had to be very nasty indeed sam yeager telephoned kassquit while she was recovering from the immunization not feeling up to dealing with the big ugly she refused the call before long he sent her a message over the computer network i hope i have done nothing to cause offense that was polite enough to require a polite answer no she replied it is only that i have not felt well lately i am sorry to hear it he wrote back promptly i did not think it would be easy for you to get sick up there away from all the germs of tosev i hope you get better soon i have been free of the germs of tosev kassquit answered that is the cause of my present discomfort i am being immunized against them and some of the immunizations have unpleasant aftereffects again sam yeager wrote back almost at once he had to be sitting by his computer as kassquit was sitting by hers are you getting immunized so you can meet big uglies in person he asked if you are i hope that my hatchling and i are two of the big uglies you will want to meet we certainly want to meet you he used the conventional symbol that represented an emphatic cough despite its breezily informal syntax kassquit studied that message with considerable respect wild big ugly sam yeager might be but he was anything but a fool yes that is why i am being immunized kassquit told him her artificial fingerclaws clicking on the keyboard and yes you and your hatchling are two of the tosevites i am interested in meeting sam yeagers hatchling jonathan yeager intrigued her no end she had never seen anyone who resembled her so closely living as she did among the race she had never imagined that anyone could resemble her so closely he even shaved his head and wore body paint it was as if he and she were two ends of the same bridge reaching toward the middle to form what if this world has a future as part of the empire she thought its future will be as whatever forms in the middle of that bridge once more sam yeager wasted no time in replying we very much look forward to it superior female he wrote shall we start setting up arrangements with the race part of kassquitprobably the larger partdreaded the idea the rest though the rest was intrigued and she agreed with ttomalss that such a meeting would bring advantage to the race and so in spite of a sigh she answered yes you may do that and i will do the same i do not know how long the negotiations will take too long sam yeager predicted kassquit laughed you are intolerant of bureaucracy she observed i hope so the wild big ugly wrote which made kassquit laugh again sam yeager went on bureaucracy is like spice in food a little makes food taste good because it does too many males and females think a lot will make the food taste even better but cooking does not improve that way and neither does bureaucracy some regulation is necessary kassquit wrote she had known nothing but regulation throughout her life i said as much sam yeager answered but when does some become too much tosevites have been arguing that question for as long as we have been civilized we still are i suppose the race is too no not really kassquit keyed the characters one by one i have never heard such a discussion among the race we have for the most part the amount of regulation that suits us i do not know whether to congratulate the race or offer my sympathy the tosevite responded and as for you you are with the race but not of it the way hatchlings of the race would be if big uglies raised them i would like to meet such hatchlings if there were any kassquit wrote i have thought about that very possibility though i do not suppose it is likely even if it were such hatchlings would still be very small so they would sam yeager replied and i have another question for youeven if you did meet these hatchlings when they were grown what language would you speak with them why the language of the race of course kassquit wrote but she deleted the words instead of sending them the big ugly had thought of something she hadnt if his kind were raising hatchlings of the race to be as much like tosevites as possible they would naturally teach them some tosevite tongue kassquit had trouble imagining males and females of the race who didnt know their own language but it made sense that such hatchlings wouldnt and why not she was a big ugly by blood but spoke not a word of any tosevite tongue what she did transmit was i see that you have done a good deal of thinking on these matters do i understand that you have been dealing with the race since the conquest fleet came to tosev yes the tosevite answered in fact i was interested in nontosevite intelligences even before the conquest fleet got here kassquit studied the words on the screen sam yeager wrote the language of the race well but not as a male of the race would have every so often the syntax of his own language showed through that was what had first made her suspect he was a big ugly did his message mean what it looked to mean or had he somehow garbled it kassquit decided she had to ask how could you have known of nontosevite intelligences before the conquest fleet came she wrote big uglies had no space travel of their own up till that time no we had no space travel sam yeager agreed but we wrote a lot of fiction about what it might be like if tosevites met all different kinds of intelligent creatures i used to enjoy that kind of fiction but i never thought it would come true till the day the race shot up the railroad train i was riding how strange kassquit spoke the words aloud and startled herself with the sound of her own voice the more she learned about the species of which she was genetically a part the more alien it seemed to her she wrote such things would never have occurred to the race before spaceflight so i gather sam yeager replied we speculate more than the race does or so it seems is that good or bad kassquit wrote yes the unadorned word made her stare after a moment in a separate message sam yeager went on sometimes differences are not better or worse sometimes they are just different the race does things one way big uglies do things a different wayor sometimes a lot of different ways because we are more various than the race if it hadnt been for that variability kassquit knew the race would easily have conquered tosev the majority of the planets inhabitants the majority of the regions of its land surface had fallen to the conquest fleet with relatively little trouble but the minority the minority had given and continued to give the race enormous difficulties before kassquit could find a way to put any of that into words samyeager wrote i have to leave nowtime for my evening meal i will be in touch by message and by telephoneif you care to talk with meand i hope to see you in person before too long goodbye goodbye kassquit answered she got up from her seat in front of the computer took off the artificial fingerclaws one by one and set them in a storage drawer near the keyboard it wasnt time for her evening meal or anywhere close to it all the ships in the conquest fleetand now in the colonization fleet tookept the same time independent of where in their orbit around tosev they happened to be intellectually kassquit understood how time on the surface of a world was tied to its suns apparent position but it had never mattered to her she hoped she would hear from sam yeager again soon such hope surprised her she remembered how frightened shed been at first of the idea of communicating with a wild big ugly but he looked at the world in a way so different from the race he gave her something new and different to think about in almost every message not even ttomalss did that and sam yeager just because he was a big ugly knew her and knew her reactions or some of them better than even ttomalss could in some ways kassquit suspected sam yeager knew her better than she knew herself she made the negative hand gesture no he knows what i would be were i an ordinary big ugly but wasnt she some of that anyhow she shrugged helplessly how was she supposed to know reuven russie had thought he knew a good deal about medicine his father was a doctor after all hed had the benefit of insight and training no one starting from scratch could hope to equal and hed attended the moishe russie medical college learning things from the race that human physicians wouldnt have discovered for themselves for generations if that didnt prepare him for practice what could after his first few hectic weeks of working with his father he began to wonder if anything could have prepared him for the actual work of medicine moishe russie laughed when he complained about that laughed and remarked the christians say baptism by total immersion thats what youre going through dont i know it reuven said the medicine itself isnt all that different from what i thought it would be the diagnostic tests work the same way and the results are pretty clear even if the lab you use isnt as good as the one attached to the college isnt it moishe russies eyebrows rose in surprise not even close reuven told him of course the technicians are only human he didnt realize how disparaging that sounded till hed already said it now his fathers laugh held a wry edge youd better get used to dealing with human beings son we mostly do the best we can you know yes i do reuven said he glanced around his fathers office where they were talking it was a perfectly fine place with palm trees swaying in the breeze just outside the window with moishe russies diplomas one of them in the language of the race in frames on the wall with shelves full of reference books with a gleaming microscope perched on a corner of the desk and yet to reuvens eyes it was as if hed fallen back through time a century maybe even two the plaster on the walls was uneven and rough it was at home too but he noticed it more here because he contrasted it to the smooth walls of the moishe russie medical college the microscope seemed hopelessly primitive next to the instruments hed used there and books he enjoyed reading books for entertainment but electronics were much better for finding information in a hurry his father had access to some electronics but didnt display them where his patients could see them he didnt seem to want people to know he used such things that was part of the problem reuven had been having in adjusting pretending to know less than he did the other part lay in the patients themselves he burst out what do i do about the little old men who come in every other week when theres nothing wrong with them what i want to do is boot them out on the street but i dont suppose i can no not really moishe russie agreed oh you could but it wouldnt do you much good theyd come back anyhow either that or theyd go bother some other doctor instead ive been looking over the files reuven said looks like weve got some patients other doctors have run off im sure we do his father said nodding and they have some of ours tooi try to be patient but im not job sometimes all the little old men and women really want is for someone to tell them dont worry youre really all right andhe grinned at reuvenyoure a hero to a lot of them you know reuven shrugged in some embarrassment yes i do know i dont think its worth making a fuss over i know you dont but you have to remember you grew up here in jerusalem not in warsaw or minsk or berlin moishe russie said being a jew is easy here it wasnt so easy back in europe believe me and a jew who walks away from something important so he doesnt have to go worship the spirits of emperors pasthe used the language of the race for the phrasedeserves to have people notice if we had advertisements you could use it in them genuine jewish doctor i mean reuven answered but it doesnt make me any smarter if it does anything it makes me stupider his father shook his head it may make you a little more ignorant but not stupider and it makes you honest thats important for a doctor reuven snorted if i were honest id tell those people to geh kak afen yam well you cant be a hundred percent honest all the time moishe russie chuckled but then sobered and the other thing to remember is you cant take anything for granted just the other day i found a lump in mrs berkowitzs breast shes been coming in here three four times a year for the past ten years and i never noticed anything worse than varicose veins wrong with her up till then but you have to be careful all right reuven said by the unhappy expression on his fathers face he suspected that moishe russie wished hed found the lump sooner knowing his father hed probably been kicking himself ever since he did discover it reuven continued and it feels strange to have a chaperone of some sort in the room whenever i examine a woman even if shes older than the pyramids you have to be careful his father repeated this time in a different tone of voice i know a couple of men who ruined their careers because they werent why take chances when you dont have to i dont reuven answered knowing his father would land on him like an avalanche if he did it still seems like something out of the middle ages though maybe it is but that doesnt mean its not real moishe russie said our arab colleagues have a harder time with it than we do sometimes they cant touch their female patients at all they have to do the best they can by asking questions if theyre lucky they get to ask the woman if theyre not they have to ask her husband yes i know about that reuven said theres a fellow named nuqrashi who resigned from the college about the same time i did hes back in baghdad now i suppose getting his practice going i wonder if hes having those kinds of troubles worse troubles than those in baghdad nowadays his father said sometimes they spill over here too if i never hear anybody shouting allahu akbar again i wont be sorry moishe russies eyes went far away not long after we first came to palestine i tried to help a wounded arab woman in the streets of jerusalem and an arab man thought i was going to violate her he did change his mind when he realized what i was doing i will say that what happened to her reuven asked his father looked bleak she bled to death torn femoral artery i think before reuven could answer that the receptionist tapped on the door and said dr russieyoung dr russie i meanchaim katz is here for his appointment hes complaining about his cough again thanks yetta reuven got to his feet as he started for the examination room he glanced back at his father who was lighting a cigarette in disapproving tones he said katz would do a lot better if he didnt smoke like a chimney as a matter of fact youd do better too moishe russie looked innocent id do better if katz didnt smoke i dont see that he inhaled the end of the cigarette glowed red funny reuven said though he thought it was anything but you know what the lizards have found out about what tobacco does to your lungs they think were meshuggeh for using the stuff among other reasons they think were meshuggeh his father breathed out smoke as he spoke he looked at the cigarette between his index and middle fingers then shrugged yes theyve found out all sorts of nasty stuff about tobacco what they havent found is how to make somebody quit using the stuff once hes got started he raised an eyebrow they havent figured out how to make themselves stop using ginger either that struck reuven as more rationalization than reasoned defense but he didnt have time to arguenot that arguing was likely to make his father stub out that cigarette and never smoke another one all he said was you cant be having as much fun with tobacco as the lizards do with ginger moishe russie laughed in the examination room chaim katz was working a cigarette down to a tiny butt and coughing between puffs he was about sixty stocky bald with a gray mustache and tufts of gray hair sprouting from his ears hello doctor he said and coughed again hello reuven pointed to an ashtray will you please put that out and take off your shirt i want to listen to your chest he reached for his stethoscope which hung beside his fathers even as he set the ends in his ears be knew he wouldnt be hearing everything he might the race had electronically amplified models he didnt need anything fancy though to dislike what he heard in chaim katzs chest he marveled that the older man got any air into his lungs at all wheezes and hisses and little whistling noises filled his ears nu katz said when he put the stethoscope away i want you to make an appointment with dr eisenberg for a chest x ray reuven told him back at the medical college he could have sent the man for an x ray then and there and learned the results in a few minutes unfortunately things werent so simple here when i see the film ill have a better idea of where we stand ill find out whether youve got a carcinoma in there or just a running start on emphysema thatll be expensive katz complained reuven said how expensive is being sick mr katz youve had this cough for a while now we need to find out whats going on in there the stocky little man made a sour face but finally nodded he put on his shirt buttoned it and pulled out the pack of cigarettes in the breast pocket reuven pointed to them youll probably get some relief if you can give those up they dont call them coffin nails for nothing chaim katz looked at the cigarettesa harsh turkish blendas if just consciously noticing he was holding them he stuck one in his mouth and lit it before answering i like em he took a drag then continued all right ill talk to eisenberg tell your old man hello for me out he went leaving a trail of smoke behind with a sigh reuven ducked into his own officesmaller and a good deal starker than his fathersand wrote up the results of the examination he was just finishing when the telephone rang he looked at it in mild surprise his father got most of the calls miss archibald for you yetta said put her through reuven said at once and then switched from hebrew to english hullo jane how are you so you still remember me even though i escaped do you remember me well enough to let me take you to supper tomorrow night why not she said and laughed reuven grinned enormously though she couldnt see that she continued after all youre a man of money now with your own practice and such since youve got it why shouldnt you spend it on me had he thought she meant that in a golddigging way he would have hung up on her instead he laughed too only goes to show you havent had a practice of your own yet how are things back there he still longed for news even after severing himself from the medical college about what youd expect jane answered the lizards keep muttering about tosevite superstitions she dropped into the language of the race for the last two words i dont think they expected nearly so many people to resign too bad reuven said with more than a little relish even after all these years they dont understand just how stubborn we are well i know how stubborn you are jane said im still willing to go out to supper with you what time do you think youll be by the dormitory about seven reuven suggested when jane didnt say no he went on see you then and hung up maybe if he was stubborn enough shed be willing to do more than go out to supper with him maybe not too but he could hardly wait to find out every time sam yeager went to little rock the new capital of the united states seemed to have grown it also seemed as gawky as jonathan had during the years when he was shooting up like a weed he thought the presidents residencethe papers called it the gray house in memory of the white house that was these days slightly radioactive ruinslacked the classic dignity of its predecessor people said it was more comfortable to live in though and he supposed that counted too posters on the telephone poles outside the gray house shouted reelect warren amp stassen they were printed in red white and blue the democrats posters were black and gold humphrey for president was their message along with a picture of the beaky strongchinned governor of minnesota yeager had nothing much against hubert humphrey or joe kennedy jr but didnt intend to vote for them president warren was a known quantity at sams stage of life he approved of known quantities a receptionist at the front entrance to the residence nodded politely to him as he came up may i help you lieutenant colonel she asked yes maam yeager gave his name adding i have an eleven oclock appointment with the president she checked the book in front of her then looked carefully at the identification card he showed her when she was satisfied his image matched his face she nodded again go to the waiting room sir hell be with you as soon as he finishes with the russian foreign commissar thanks yeager said and grinned in bemusement as he headed down the hall the russian foreign commissar then him hed never expected to be mentioned in the same breath with such luminaries not back in the days when he was bouncing around the mid to lower minor leagues then his idea of big shots was fellows whod had a cup of coffee in the majors before dropping down again he grinned once more when he got to the waiting room one of the things set out for people along with look and us news and interspecies report to read was the sporting news the los angeles browns were two days away from squaring off with the phillies in the world series his heart favored the browns if hed had to put money on the series though he would have bet on the phils i might have made it to the big time as a coach he thought i might have if i had i might have been standing in the firstbase box two days from now instead he was sitting here waiting to talk with the president of the united states it wasnt what hed had in mind as a younger man but it wasnt so bad either out came andrei gromyko he didnt look happy but he had the sort of face that wasnt made for looking happy good day he said to yeager in excellent english he strode out of the room without waiting for a reply in his wake a flunky in an expensive suit emerged from president warrens office he gave sam a smile wide enough to make up for the one he hadnt got from the russian it also made him want to check to be sure his wallet was still in his hip pocket the flunky said the president will see you in a few minutes he wants to finish writing up his notes first okay by me sam answeredas if warren needed his permission to do some work before summoning him he returned to the sporting news like budweiser beer it had survived the lizard occupation of st louis he almost went past the necrology listing for peter daniels whod caught briefly for the cardinals before the first world war then his eyes snapped back peter daniels more commonly known as mutt had been his manager at decatur in the iii league when the lizards invaded the usa and had gone into the army with him so mutt had made it to almost eighty that wasnt a bad run not a bad run at all sam hoped hed be able to match it here came the flunky again the president will see you now lieutenant colonel thanks yeager got to his feet walking into the office and saluted his commander in chief reporting as ordered sir sit down yeager earl warren didnt believe in wasting time we have a couple of things to talk about today yes sir sam sat a houseman brought in coffee on a silver tray when the president took a cup yeager did too president warren picked up a fat manila folder your reports on the lizard hatchlingsmickey and donald i like thathave been fascinating ive enjoyed reading them not only for what they tell me about lizard development but also for the way theyre written you could have been published i think had you chosen to try to go in that direction maybe mr president and thanks but i hope youll excuse me for saying that i have my doubts sam answered he added i was also smart enough to marry a good editor she makes me sound better than i would otherwise a good editor can do that warren agreed a bad one but back to business in many ways these two hatchlings seem to be progressing far faster than human children would they sure are sir yeager nodded he almost added an emphatic cough but wasnt sure the president would understand of course theyre bornuh hatchedable to run and grab onto things that gives them a big head start but they understand faster than babies do the way puppies or kittens would but they arent shortlived as dogs and cats are president warren said oh no sir they live as long as we do probably longer yeager eyed the president with respect warren saw the implications of things the only thing they dont do is they dont talk they understand hand signals theyre even starting to understand expressions which is funny because they dont have any of their own to speak of but no words yet nothing even really close a lot of babies are just starting to say mama and dada at nine or ten months the president pointed out his stern face softened its been a while but i remember i know sir but there isnt anything in the noises they make thats even close to dada or mama sam answered the one thing i will say is that there are more humansounding noises in the babbling than there were when they first came out of their eggs theyre listening to people but they arent ready to start talking to people yet weve got a ways to go before that happens all right lieutenant colonel you sound as if youre doing a splendid job there warren said and all that is in accordance with what youve been able to learn about hatchlings from the lizards isnt it oh yes sir it sure is yeager said ive had to be careful about that though you made it clear we dont want them finding out what were up to there he didnt mention the hypothetical hed offered to kassquit he wished he hadnt done it but too late now it may turn out to be a smaller problem than we believed at first the president replied that brings me to the next thing on the agenda your upcoming meeting with thishe opened the folder and flipped through it to find the name he neededthis kassquit yes thats right sir sam nodded oddly relieved to find warren thinking about her too turns out the lizards did unto us before we had the chance to do unto them kassquit is for them what mickey and donald will be for us in twenty years or so shes been raised as a lizard she wishes she were a lizard but shes stuck with a human beings body yes the president flipped through more pages ive read your reports on your conversations with her with great interesteven if you were less than perfectly discreet considering what you just said now no warren didnt miss much but he didnt make an issue of it continuing do you think theres any chance of teaching her she really is a human being and ought to be loyal to mankind instead of the race no mr president yeager spoke decisively shes a naturalized citizen of the empire you might say were just the old country to her and shed no more choose us over them than most americans would choose germany or norway or what have you over the usa especially if they came here as tiny babies shes made her choiceor had it made for her by the way she was brought up your point is well taken warren said i still judge the meeting worthwhile and im glad you and your son are going forward with it even if we have no hope of turning her we can learn a lot from her he went back to the manila folder which apparently held copies of all of sams reports for quite some time nowyou raised another interesting point here this note about the possibility of the lizards domestic animals making themselves more at home on earth than we wish they would i got to thinking about rabbits in australia sam answered there are other cases too starlings for instance there werent any starlings in america seventyfive years ago somebody turned loose a few dozen of them in new york city in and now theyre all over the country the year before i was born warren said musingly i see we may have a problem here i dont see what to do about it though we can hardly go to war with the race over the equivalents of dogs and cows and goats i wouldnt think so sir yeager agreed but these creatures are liable to damage big chunks of the world from the reports that have come in from certain areasour desert southwest among themthat may already be starting to happen the president replied as i say it may be a problem and it may well get worse but not all problems have neat tidy solutions however much we wish they would i used to think they did yeager said the older i get though the more it looks as if youre right youve had some problems of your own president warren observed if you werent fast with a pistol i suspect id be talking with someone else right now somebody tried to take a shot at me sure enough sam shrugged i still dont have the faintest idea why one thing you keep doing lieutenant colonel is looking into matters that arent really any of your concern warren answered ive had to mention this to you before if you didnt you might not have had such difficulties sam yeager started to say something then stopped and studied the president was warren trying to tell him something was it what it sounded like had that punk tried to punch his ticket because hed shown he was too interested in the space station that became the lewis and clark or in the data store that held information about the night the colonization fleet was attacked this is the united states he thought things like that dont happen heredo they they cant happen here can they do you understand what im telling you the president asked sounding like the kindly concerned grandfather he also looked like yes sir im afraid i do sam said he wished he hadnt put it like that but that did him as much good as wishing he hadnt swung at a curve down in the dirt nothing to be afraid of president warren said easily youre doing a wonderful job ive said so all along keep right on doing it and everything will be fine he closed the manila folder an obvious gesture of dismissal yeager got to his feet okay sir ill do that he said but as he turned to go he knew damn well it wasnt okay and he knew something else it wouldnt matter for beans come november but hed just changed his mind hed vote for hubert humphrey anyway when the telephone rang straha answered it in the language of the race i greet you he enjoyed the confused splutters that commonly caused among big uglies most of them hung up without further ado he also enjoyed that this time though he got an answer in the same tongue and i greet you shiplord sam yeager here how are you today i thank youi am well straha said i telephoned your home the other day but learned you were out of the city i have returned the tosevite said straha thought he sounded unhappy but had trouble figuring out why any male should have been glad to complete a mission and come home once more in that the big uglies were similar to the race or maybe straha thought i am simply misreading his tone although he had lived among the big uglies since defecting from the conquest fleet he did not always accurately gauge their emotions he felt no small pride at reading them as well as he did his diligence had in most instances overcome billions of years of separate evolution and what do you want from me today he asked he assumed yeager wanted something few if any big uglies were in the habit of calling him simply to pass the time of day as a defector he understood that he was likelier to be a source of information than a friend and yet among the tosevites sam yeager was as close to a friend as he had he sighed sadly even though he despised selfpity i was just wondering if anything new about kassquit had bounced off your hearing diaphragms yeager said you remember the big ugly being raised as a female of the race of course straha said though he was glad sam yeager had reminded him who kassquit was i regret to have to tell you i have heard nothing too bad yeager said anything i can find out would help a lot if we can work things out with the race my hatchling and i will be going up into space to meet her the more we know the better off we will be if i hear anything of interest you may rest assured i will inform you of it straha said but i cannot tell you what i do not know truth yeager admitted it would make things a lot easier if you could well i thank you for your time he shifted into english for two wordsso longand hung up not altogether by chancevery likely not at all by chancestrahas driver strolled into the kitchen a moment later that was sam yeager wasnt it he asked yes straha answered shortly what did he want the driver asked straha turned both eye turrets toward him why are you so curious whenever yeager calls he asked in return the driver folded his arms across his chest and replied my job is being curious your job is giving me the answers i need was his unspoken corollary and by the rules under which straha had to live the driver was right with a sigh he said he was making inquiries about kassquit unlike the exshiplord his driver didnt need to be reminded who that was oh the female tosevite up in space he relaxed all right no problem there that roused straha to indignation if you big uglies have problems with your finest expert on the race my opinion is that you have severe problems indeed as usual he failed to irk his driver the fellow shifted into the language of the race to drive home his point shiplord you were one of the best officers the conquest fleet had that did not mean you always got on well with your colleagues if you had you and i would not be talking like this now would we it seems unlikely straha admitted very well i see what you mean but if yeager is as great a nuisance to his colleagues as i was to mine he is a very considerable nuisance indeed he spoke in tones of fond reminiscence if he hadnt made atvars blood boil it wasnt for lack of effort his driver said he is and used an emphatic cough i see straha said slowly hed known yeager had occasional trouble with the american authorities but hadnt really believed they were of that magnitude no wonder i sometimes feel as if he and i were hatched from the same egg he thought kassquit though is legitimate business for him the driver said he should stick to legitimate business he would do better if he did with that he turned on his heel and strode away arrogant eggaddled but straha cursed the driver only mentally and even then the curse broke down half formed the big ugly was anything but addled and the exshiplord knew it indeed his effortless competence was one of the most oppressive things about him when the driver had gone round the corner straha opened a drawer took out a vial of ginger poured some into the palm of his hand and tasted even as pleasure surged through him he carefully put the vial back and closed the drawer the driver knew he tasted of course the driver got ginger for him but he did not like to taste in front of the big ugly he treated the tosevite as he would have treated one of his own aides no highranking officer cared to do something unseemly while his subordinates were watching tasting ginger of course was legal under the laws of the united states but those laws mattered only so much to straha he lived under them yes but they werent his the whole snoutcounting process by which the big uglies in the usa chose their lawmakers had never failed to strike him as absurd emotionally he still adhered to the regulations of the conquest fleet and under them tasting ginger was a punishable offense with the herb blazing in him he followed the driver out to the front room the big ugly had just settled down with a magazine and seemed somewhat surprised to have to deal with straha again so soon can i help you with something shiplord he asked yes straha answered you can tell me whose snout you intend to choose in the upcoming snoutcounting for the leader of your notempire oh i think ill vote to reelect president warren the driver answered in english straha didnt blame him for shifting languages the big uglies tongue was better suited to discussing this strange quadrennial rite of theirs the exshiplord also used english and why is that well the countrys doing okay or better than okay the tosevite said warrens made sure were strong and i like the way hes handled relations with the race we have a saying dont change horses in midstream so i figure staying with the man weve got is probably the best way to go that sounded cautious and conservative it might almost have been a male of the race speaking not a big ugly as a tosevite might have stuck out his index finger straha stuck out his tongue suppose warren loses though suppose more american tosevites choose the snout of this other male this humpty humphrey his driver corrected his sigh sounded like the sigh of a male of the race then they do thats all then humphrey becomes president and we all hope he does as good a job as warren did id support him id follow his orders id have to but you would still think all the time that this other male the one you have leading you now would be able to do the job better straha persisted yes i probably would the driver said then why would you follow humphrey straha took care to pronounce the name correctly because more people would have voted for him than for warren the big ugly replied weve been over this before shiplord with us the government is more important than the names of the people in the top slots things go on any which way madness straha said with conviction what would happen if some large number of american tosevites decided they did not like the way the snoutcountinguh the electionturned out and refused to obey the male who was chosen to his surprise the driver answered we had that happen once as a matter of fact it was just over a hundred years ago oh and what was the result straha asked it was called the civil war the driver said you may have noticed some of the anniversary celebrations weve been having straha made the negative hand gesture lots of things went on around him that he didnt notice with a shrug the driver went on well whether youve noticed or not the war caused so much damage that weve never come close to having another one over an election so big uglies could learn from history straha wouldnt have bet on it the tosevites were most adept technically had they not been this planet would be a firmly held part of the empire but theyd been doing their best to destroy one another when the conquest fleet arrived straha wondered what would have happened if the race had waited another couple of hundred years before sending out the conquest fleet the big uglies had already been working on explosivemetal bombs maybe they would have committed suicide or maybe straha thought unhappily not a single ship from the conquest fleet would have managed to land on tosev the ginger was leaving him so was the euphoria it had brought imagining the race ambushed by fearsome big uglies came easy at such times it had come too close to happening as things were is there anything else shiplord the driver returned to the language of the race a sure sign he considered the conversation on snoutcounting at an end no nothing else straha answered you may return to your reading what publication have you got there by the way the driver hesitated straha knew hed hit a nerve he thought he knew what kind of nerve hed hit too sure enough when the driver showed him the magazine he found it to be one featuring female big uglies divested of most of the cloth wrappings they customarily used i do not mind your titillating your mating urge if that does not interfere with your other duties and it does not seem to straha said despite that reassurance the driver closed the magazine and would not open it again while straha was in the room he was as embarrassed about openly indulging his sexuality as straha was about tasting ginger in front of him while different in so many ways big uglies and the race shared some odd things straha said never mind i will leave you in privacy and i will not hold it against you that you are so reluctant to extend me the same privilege shiplord my job is to keep you safe first and happy second the driver answered it is much harder for me to keep you safe if i do not know where you are and what you are doing but it would be much easier for you to keep me happy under those circumstances straha said the driver only shrugged he had his priorities hed spelled them out for the exshiplord and straha like it or not was stuck with them one more delight of exile arguing with heinrich himmler hadnt got felless tossed out of the reich from that she reluctantly concluded nothing she would do would get her expelled the proper attitude under those circumstances was to buckle down and do her job in nuremberg as well as she could felless cared very little for the proper attitude she was gloomily certain she could do her job here without an error for the next hundred years and veffani would still refuse to transfer her to a starship or even to a different tosevite notempire and she could not appeal to cairo for relief from such highhanded treatment not after several leading officials from the races administrative center on tosev had mated with her in the ambassadors conference chamber among the big uglies mating created bonds of affection among the race all it seemed to create was resentment especially when it was an outofseason gingerinduced mating felless sighed just what she didnt want a reason to wish she were a tosevite what she did want was another taste of ginger the craving gnawed at her like an itch deep under her scales that she couldnt hope to scratch she had several tastes waiting in her desk the battle she fought wasnt to keep from tasting it was to wait till she had the best chance of going long enough after her taste to keep from exciting males with her pheromones when she left her office it was also a losing battle her eye turrets kept sliding away from the monitor and toward the desk drawer where shed hidden the ginger you are nothing but an addict dependent on a miserable tosevite herb she told herself severely that should have shamed her back when shed first started tasting it had shamed her it didnt any more now she knew it was nothing but a statement of fact like her eye turrets the chair swiveled before she quite knew what shed done she turned the chair away from the computer table and toward the desk shed just started to rise when the telephone circuitry inside the computer hissed for attention she turned back with a hiss of her own one that mixed frustration and relief i greet you she said and then when she saw veffanis image on the screen i greet you superior sir and i greet you senior researcher the ambassador to the reich replied come to my office immediately it shall be done felless said and switched off if she was busy she could keep her mindor some of her mindoff her craving had veffani waited a little longer before calling she would have created fresh scandal by poking her nose outside her office maybe the call was a test if it was she would pass it shed passed other similar tests before if she passed enough of them odds were it still wouldnt matter veffani had made it all too clear he wouldnt let her go no matter what she did as she had on that disastrous day when the ambassador summoned her after shed tasted she walked by slomikk in the hall the science officer turned an eye turret in her direction no doubt wondering whether mating pheromones would reach his scent receptors in a moment when they didnt he kept on walking felless felt as if shed won an obscure victory pheromones didnt matter to veffanis secretary a female from the colonization fleet even so after felless previous fiasco the female was wary i trust there will be no problem when you go in to see him she said none felless said and walked past the secretary too fast for her to get in any more digs veffani turned an eye turret toward her i greet you senior researcher you are commendably prompt i thank you ambassador felless fought to hold her temper nothing she did here would get her a commendation and she knew it only too well how may i serve the race when veffani didnt answer right away hope began to rise in her if the ambassador didnt like what she had to say maybe it would do her some good at last he said as you no doubt know you were reckoned the colonization fleets leading expert on alien races when your fleet set out from home felless made the affirmative gesture yes superior sir i did not know then how much of my training would be useless here on tosev this world has surprised all of us veffani said which was an undoubted truth the point i am trying to make however is that fleetlord reffet still reckons you a leading expert on the big uglies no matter how little you deserve that recognition when compared to various males from the conquest fleet now hope did surge hot and strong in felless being a fleetlord himself reffet could cancel out atvar and the males from the conquest fleeteven veffani he could provided he wanted to badly enough felless had to fight to keep a quiver from her voice as she asked what does the exalted fleetlord require of me i cannot tell you because no one has informed me veffani didnt sound very happy to tell her that he went on the fleetlords representative a certain faparz will be coming down by shuttlecraft to inform you personally he is due to arrive this evening by shuttlecraft felless knew she sounded surprised but the ambassador could scarcely blame her for that no matter what else he blamed her for why does he not communicate by telephone or electronic message that i can answer veffani replied the accursed deutsch tosevites are becoming altogether too good at reading and decoding our signals and they are not the only ones are they do i not recall your telling me an american big ugly succeeded for some time in masquerading as a male of the race on the computer network yes superior sir that is correct felless knew another stab of jealousy about ttomalssone that for a change had nothing to do with his escape from the reich his project involving the tosevite hatchling kept paying handsome dividends felless might have thought of doing such a thing herself but ttomalss having come with the conquest fleet had an enormous head start on her as he did in all matters tosevite she forced her thoughts back to the matter directly in front of her then whatever message faparz bears is one where security is an important concern i should think so yes veffani answered my i offer you a word of advice senior researcher i rather think i know what you are about to say felless replied duty requires me to say it anyhow it wasnt just duty either veffani looked as if he was enjoying himself do not taste ginger between now and then faparz is not a big ugly male and you will not win favor with him because he has mated with you the reverse is likelier to be true believe me superior sir i understand that felless said stiffly she would crave ginger and this evening felt a long way off but the ambassador was undoubtedly right even if he took too much pleasure in rubbing her snout in her own disgrace for your sake i hope you do he said now i would just as soon see your punishment continue in my opinion you deserve it you will prove that if you humiliate yourself with the representative of the fleetlord of the colonization fleet as well as with those from the conquest fleet felless did her best to hide her resentment part of which sprang from veffanis being right the ambassador went on i dismiss you i thank you superior sir felless did not in fact feel in the least thankful but even big uglies recognized how hypocrisy lubricated social wheels she hurried away before veffani found any more pungent advice for her as was her habit she retreated to her office that proved a mistake her eye turrets kept going back to the drawer where she kept her precious vials of ginger but fleeing the office would have meant mingling with the rest of the embassy staff most of whom where members of the conquest fleet and most of whom had no more use for her than did veffani except when ive been tasting ginger she thought they have a use for me then but not one that makes them like me or respect me any more afterwards all that made perfect sense in her mind but shed been on the point of tasting when veffani summoned her to his office no matter what made sense in her mind her body craved ginger it let her know it craved ginger too and in no uncertain terms every moment seemed an eternity she wanted to call veffani back and ask him when in the evening faparz was scheduled to arrive but made herself hold back the ambassador would surely understand why she made such a call would understand and would scorn her more than ever she was trembling with the desperate urge to taste when the intercom unit connected to her door hissed for attention enter she called and the male waiting in the corridor did come in i greet you senior researcher faparz said the body paint on one side of his torso and one arm was plainer than felless that on his other side was as colorful and ornate as anyone on or near tosev possessed i greet you fleetlords adjutant felless replied veffani hadnt told her reffet was sending his adjutant and felless hadnt expected it maybe the ambassador hadnt known but maybe hed been hoping she would taste and would end up in trouble because of it well she hadnt pride helped fight her desire for the tosevite herbhelped a little anyway how may i serve the commander of the colonization fleet we are seeking to make colonization more effective and to spread safely over broader areas of tosev faparz replied your insights into this process will be valuable and most appreciated i shall of course do whatever i can to aid this worthy effort felless said one thing that occurs to me is using animals native to home to make portions of tosev more homelike this is i gather already beginning to occur informally systematizing it could yield good results i agree faparz said this notion has already been proposed and is likely to be implemented felless hid her disappointment but reffets adjutant went on that is the sort of idea we are seeking that you can find such a scheme on the spur of the moment shows you are likely to be valuable to the project spirits of emperors past look kindly on you for your praise felless exclaimed then her own spirits grew gloomy almost as if ginger were ebbing from her system but i must tell you fleetlords adjutant that removing me from the reich may prove difficult ambassador veffani has formed a grudge against me and desires that i stay here to work among big uglies i am aware of the nature of this ah grudge faparz said primly and felless spirits tumbled down into her toeclaws then reffets aide continued still i believe we may accommodate the ambassador while still involving you some of this research is being conducted at a consular site that while within the boundaries of the reich is relatively close to territory the race rules and the climate there is certainly more salubrious than in this miserable cold dank misty place if you are offering me a new assignment superior sir i gladly accept felless had to swallow an emphatic cough that would have shown how glad she really was now she felt almost as if shed had the taste of ginger shed forgone waiting for faparz wherever heand reffetsent her it couldnt possibly be worse than nuremberg of that she had not a doubt in the world not a doubt in the whole wide empire lieutenant colonel johannes drucker floated weightless in kathe the reusable upper stage of the a that had blasted him into orbit from peenemunde he was glad to be a couple of hundred kilometers above the weather even more glad than usual fogs rolling in off the baltic had twice delayed his launch here in space he still felt like a man serving his country down on the ground he had trouble feeling like anything but a man his country was trying to get gently he patted the instrument panel a lot of fliers named their upper stages for wives or girlfriends how many though named them for wives or girlfriends who were or might be a quarter part jew well no one had tried making him change the name that was something a small something since the ss had had to give kathe back to him perhaps the official thinking was that she couldnt really have had any jewish blood at all or perhaps the powers that be simply hadnt noticed till now and a technician with a can of paint would be waiting when drucker came down he didnt want to think about that he didnt want to think about anything of the sort instead he looked outward somewhere out there in the asteroid belt past the orbit of mars the americans aboard the lewis and clark were doing what drucker didnt know neither did anyone else in the greater german reich what he did know was that he was enormously jealous of the americans theyd gone out there in a real spacecraft not just an overgrown roman candle like the one hed ridden into orbit we should have done that he muttered germany had been ahead of the usa in rocketry during the fighting against the lizards it struck him as unconscionable that the reich s lead had been frittered away his gaze grew hungry as hungry as those of the wolves that had once prowled around peenemunde the americans had taken a long step toward building a real starship if the reich had such ships the lizards would be shaking in the boots they didnt wear if the reich had starships they would be vengeance weapons and the race had to know it the radio crackled to life spaceship of the deutsche acknowledge this transmission at once it was of course a lizard talking no human being would have been so arrogant no human nation could have afforded to be so arrogant to the greater german reich but the race could however strong the reich was the race was stronger every trip into space rubbed druckers nose in that unpalatable fact acknowledging he said shortly using the language of the race himself some of the lizards with whom he dealt were decent enough sorts with them he went through the polite i greet you s to the ones who only snapped at him he snapped in return your orbit is acceptable the lizard told him the lizard would have been not just arrogant but furious had his orbit been anything else you so relieve my mind drucker responded that was sarcasm and truth commingled weapons were tracking him now they would have been ready to go after kathe had an unannounced orbital change made the race nervous see that you stay where you ought to be the lizard said out drucker chuckled not even a chance to get the last word he chuckled again probably a female of the race the real kathe had she heard that slur on womankind would have snorted and stuck an elbow in his ribs he probably would have deserved it too he glanced down at earth below he was sweeping along above the western pacific a nasty storm was building there with outlying tendrils of cloud already stretching out over japan and reaching toward china the reich the americans and the race all sold meteorological photos to countries without satellites of their own back when drucker was a child people had been at the mercy of the weather they still were but to a lesser degree they couldnt change it but at least they had some idea of what was on the way that made a difference down toward the equator kathe flew at better than kilometers an hour the velocity sounded enormous but wasnt enough to escape earth orbit let alone travel from star to star that bothered drucker more than usual he wanted to go out farther into the solar system wanted to and couldnt some german spacecraft had gone to mars but he hadnt been aboard any of them and they were only rockets hardly more potent than the a that had lifted him into orbit calling the german spacecraft calling the german spacecraft another peremptory signal but this one in german and one he was glad to answer kathe here with drucker aboard he said how goes it hermann goring well enough the radio operator aboard the german space station replied and with you not too bad drucker said and when do you take off and start rampaging through outer space would day after tomorrow suit you the radioman laughed so did drucker up above them some lizard listening to their transmission would probably have started tearing out his hair if only hed had any to tear day after tomorrow wouldnt suit me at all drucker said because then i couldnt be aboard when you left and i want to go traveling i dont blame you the radio operator said the frontier is out this way if the americans are going to explore it we had better do the same not just the americans drucker said and said no more the lizards already knew the reich mistrusted them for that matter the mistrust ran both ways no doubt with good reason drucker wondered just how soon the hermann goring really would be leaving earth orbit for something more worthwhile sooner than it would have if the americans hadnt lit a fire under the reich s space programhe was sure of that he was also sure the race would be horrified to have not one but two earthly nations on the way toward genuine spacecraft a little later he passed about twenty kilometers below the german space station through zeiss field glasses it seemed almost close enough to touch the job of converting it to a spaceship was going much more smoothly than it had for the americans but theyd kept what they were up to a secret while the reich was making no bones about what it had in mind if the lizards didnt like it they could start a war such was himmlers attitude anyhow the swastikas painted on the space station were big enough to be easily visible straining his eyes drucker imagined he could read gorings name above them but he really couldnt or not quite he chuckled a little down on earth the late reichsmarschall was a bad joke the luftwaffe moribund and subservient to the wehrmacht and the ss but gorings name would go traveling farther than the pudgy drugaddled founder of the german air force could ever have imagined and the lizards couldntor at least theyd better nottry to forbid a german spacecraft from going where an american one had already gone that would mean trouble big trouble it might even mean war back when hed been driving a panzer against the lizards drucker would have given his left nut to control the kind of firepower he had at his fingertips now hed been so outgunned then and he was outgunned up here too he sighed the lizards had more and better weapons odds were they would for a long time to come but the reich could hurt them that was the essence of german foreign policy and he johannes drucker could hurt them with his nucleartipped missiles he hoped he wouldnt have to they would surely blow him out of the sky the instant after he launched the one thing he didnt think theyd do was try to blow him out of the sky before he could launch theyd attacked earth without provocation but hadnt staged any unprovoked assaults since the fighting ended maybe that made them more trustworthy than human beings maybe it just made them more naive drucker never had figured that out his radio crackled into life relay ship hoth to spacecraft kathe urgent acknowledge acknowledging drucker said was ist los hoth the relay ship down in the south atlantic kept spacecraft in touch with the reich even when they were out of direct radio range all the spacefaring human powers used relay ships the lizards with their worldbestriding lands didnt have to urgent news bulletin the radio operator down below answered go ahead drucker did his best to hide the alarm that surged through him but surely his superiors wouldnt order him into battle with a news bulletin would they plainly reading from text in front of him the radio operator said radio nuremberg has announced the death of heinrich himmler chancellor of the greater german reich the chancellor on duty to his last breath suffered a coronary thrombosis while working on state papers no date for services celebrating his life has yet been set nor has a successor been named gott im himmel drucker whispered things would be hopping down in nuremberg now even more than hitler before him himmler had stayed strong because he let no one around him have any strength nor has a successor been named was liable to cover some vicious infighting in the days to come have you got that kathe the radioman asked ive got it drucker said this is liable to be the safest place i could find he thought he almost said it aloud but thought better of that and then the fellow down below said it for him staying a few thousand kilometers away when the big boys squabble isnt so bad eh thats the truth sure enough drucker answered well i dont give orders all i do is take them whoever the new fuhrer is hell tell me what to do and ill do it thats the way things work without a doubt someone aboard the hoth was recording every word he said without a doubt the gestapo would be listening to make sure he sounded properly loyal to the reich and to its fuhrer whoever that turned out to be drucker knew as much he was no fool he also knew his loyalty was liable to be suspect that meant he had to be especially careful to say all the right things and the radioman aboard the hoth said thats how we all feel of course our loyalty is to the state not to any one man he said all the right things too and drucker made a point of agreeing with him thats how it is all right thats how it has to be as he flew along as the signal from the hoth faded he wondered who would take over for the late unlamented at least by him heinrich himmler the ss would naturally have a candidate so would the wehrmacht and joseph goebbels passed over when hitler died would want another try at ruling the reich there might be others drucker did his best not to pay attention to politics maybe that was a mistake more and more these days politics kept paying attention to him his orbit swept him up toward the reich by the time his tour ended everything was likely to be over vyacheslav molotov felt harassed that was not the least common feeling hed ever had especially after marshal zhukov rescued him while smashing berias coup every american presidential election made him nervous too the prospect of dealing with a new man every four years was enough to make anybody nervous when that man could start a nuclear war just by giving an order but warren seemed likely to beat humphrey which would give molotov a breathing space before he had to start getting nervous about the usa again now though himmler had had to go and die molotov thought that most inconsiderate of the nazi leader himmler had been a bastard no doubt about it but on the whole the recent aborted lunge at poland aside hed been a predictable bastard who would manage to throw his fundament into the seat hed occupied what sort of madman will i have to deal with next was how molotov phrased the question in his mind american presidential candidates at least spelled out what they had in mind before taking office you could plan for a man like that even if he looked likely to be unfortunate but the only qualification for fuhrer that molotov could see was a quick sharp knife he did not dwell on how a german politico might view the process of succession in the ussr he took his own country his own system for granted his secretary looked into the office comrade general secretary the foreign commissar is here for his ten oclock appointment as usual molotov glanced at the clock on the wall gromyko was precisely on time he always was few soviet officials imitated him despite two generations of soviet discipline most russians seemed constitutionally unable to take the notion of precise time seriously send him in pyotr maksimovich molotov said gromyko craggy features impassive as usual strode past the secretary and into the office he leaned across the desk to shake hands with molotov good day vyacheslav mikhailovich he said and to you andrei andreyevich molotov replied he waved gromyko to a chair they both lit cigarettes molotovs russianstyle in a long paper holder gromykos an american brand after a couple of puffs molotov said you will no doubt have a good notion of why i want to see you what ever gave you that idea gromyko had a good deadpan all right its not as if the reich were of any great concern to us no of course not molotov wouldnt let the foreign commissar win the palm for irony without a fight why for the past generation germany has scarcely mattered to us at all even so gromyko stretched out an arm to tap his cigarette into an ashtray on molotovs desk after another drag on the cigarette his manner changed i wonder what we do have to look forward to that is the reason i asked to speak with you molotov replied you will be flying off to nuremberg for the state funeral day after tomorrow i await your impressions of the potential german leaders goebbels we know gromyko said and molotov nodded the foreign commissar went on manstein we also know he is the likeliest of the generals to come to the top by all accounts an able man molotov nodded again zhukov respects him he said by his tone by his expression no one would have known how much having to acknowledge zhukovs opinion pained him as you say he too is a known quantity but the ss officials under himmler gromykos voice trailed away he stubbed out the cigarette and lit another one yes they are the trouble molotov agreed none of them has been able to show what he can do for himmler has held power there firmly in his own hands if one of them can grab it who knows in which direction he might go it could be worse gromyko said molotov raised an eyebrow the foreign commissar explained the lizards might have landed a few days earlier then perhaps the british would not have assassinated heydrich after pondering that molotov discovered he had to nod yes you are rightalthough i doubt heydrich would have waited for himmler to die of natural causes before making his bid for the top spot go on to nuremberg then andrei andreyevich learn what you can and report back to me very well comrade general secretary gromykos shaggy eyebrows twitched i do hope the nazis can keep from starting their civil war until himmlers funeral is over yes that would be good wouldnt it after a moment molotov realized the foreign commissar hadnt been joking he glanced at the smoke spiraling up from his own cigarette which he hadnt crushed quite well enough do you really think it will come to that i hope not gromyko answered but in the reich there is only one way to tell who is the stronger by conflict when hitler died himmler was inarguably the strongest man left who is strongest now is not so clear which makes struggles over the succession more likely you could be right molotov said guile and intrigue had got him the top spot in the soviet union after stalin died he wondered who would succeed him and how the question wasnt idlefar from it now he did think about similarities between the ussr and the greater german reich his own country had no more formal system for succession than did germany berias failed coup had rubbed everyones nose in that the failed coup had also made it all too likely that molotovs successor would be marshal zhukov a distinctly unappetizing prospect for an apparatchik smoking yet another cigarette gromyko left the office molotov lit a new one from his own packet the americans and the lizards both claimed tobacco cut years off your life having already passed his threescore and ten molotov found that hard to believe if tobacco was poisonous wouldnt it have killed him by now in any case he was inclined to doubt claims from the race or from the usa on general principles he could have watched himmlers funeral on television in these days of relay satellites news went around the world as soon as it happened he didnt watch he knew the nazis were good at melodramatic spectacle as far as he was concerned their rule depended in no small measure on keeping the masses mystified through spectacle so they would have no chance to contemplate either their oppression or rising against it and when gromyko returned from the german capital molotov asked no questions about the last rites for the dead fuhrer instead he came straight to the point who is in charge in nuremberg vyacheslav mikhailovich i do not precisely know gromyko sounded troubled at the admission i dont think the germans know either that is not good molotov said with what he judged considerable understatement where no one is in charge anything can happen it wasnt a proverb but it sounded like one gromyko accepted it as if it were what they have in place now is something they call the committee of eight it has soldiers on it and ss functionaries and nazi party officials and a couple of goebbels men too scornfully molotov clicked his tongue between his teeth all that means is that they are putting off the bloodletting till someone is ready to start it of course gromyko agreed no veteran of communist party infighting could fail to recognize such portents now we have an interesting question molotov said do we prod the germans while they are weak and confused or do we leave them severely alone till they sort themselves out if we prod them we may gain advantages we could not have managed against himmler the foreign commissar spoke in musing tones on the other hand we may only succeed in uniting the members of this committee against us or in bringing one of them to the top molotov nodded gromyko had laid out the alternatives as neatly as a geometry teacher proving a theorem on the blackboard if we leave them alone they are likely to stay disorganized longer than they would otherwise but so what if we gain nothing from their disorganization in that case at least we do not run the risk of conflict with them gromyko said conflict with them is inevitable there molotov knew he was on firm ideological grounds but ideology or no ideology he temporized with the weapons they and we have conflict with them is also liable to be suicidal yes gromyko said and then greatly daring this is a problem i fear neither marx nor lenin anticipated possibly not molotov said the admission made him as nervous as if he were the pope airing doubts about the trinity he backed away from it but if we cannot rely on marx and lenin on whom can we rely lenin extended marxs doctrine into areas on which marx did not speak the foreign commissar replied it is up to us to extend marxistleninist thought into the new areas that have come to light over the past forty years i suppose so again molotov thought of the pope we cannot say we are changing the doctrine of courseonly strengthening it how had the papacy dealt with the theory of evolution carefully was the answer that sprang to mind of course gromyko echoed that was what stalin said too it gave him the excuse he needed to do whatever he pleasednot that he needed much of an excuse to go and do that no molotov agreed stalin was more than ten years dead now but his shadow lingered over everyone whod ever had anything to do with him molotov had never been shy about ordering executions but he knew he lacked stalins relentless ruthlessness in a way that knowledge made him feel inadequate as if he were a son conscious of not being quite the man his father was gromyko said have you yet decided what we ought to do given the changed conditions inside the reich stalin would have decided on the spur of the moment he would have followed through on whatever he decided too followed through to the hilt he might not have been right all the timemolotov knew only too well he hadnt been right all the timebut hed always been sure sometimes being sure counted for as much as being right sometimes it counted for more than being right if you were sure if you could make other people sure you might easily end up right even when youd been wrong before molotov also knew he lacked that kind of decisiveness he said we can try prodding at romania and finland and see how they reactand how the reich reacts if the fascists puppet states show weakness that will be a sign the reich itself is on the way to the ashheap of history to which the dialectic consigns it gromyko considered then nodded good enough i think comrade general secretary and if the germans show they are still alert in spite of this collective leadership we can pull back at little risk to ourselves yes molotov permitted himself a small cold smile of anticipation just so and it will be pleasant to pay them back in their own coin for the troubles they continue to cause us in the ukraine that will make nikita sergeyevich happy too he dismissed gromyko then spent the next twenty minutes wondering whether he wanted to make khrushchev happy or not as the airliner droned on toward kitty hawk jonathan yeager turned to his father and asked do you think mom is up to taking care of what needs taking care of till we get back he didnt want to mention mickey and donald his father nodded approval that he hadnt then answered shell do finebecause she has to he grinned she put up with you when you were a baby so she ought to be able to manage the other hearing about himself as a baby never failed to embarrass jonathan he changed the subject four more years for president warren eh sure enough his father said i thought hed win i didnt think hed take thirtynine states he didnt look so happy that warren had taken thirtynine states either neither did i said jonathan who knew his father had soured on the president but didnt know why he clicked his tongue between his teeth i wish the election had come a couple of months later then i could have voted too having to wait till he was almost twentyfive to help pick a president struck him as dreadfully unfair he tried to make the best of it one vote wouldnt have mattered much this time around anyhow no but you never can tell when it will his father said as for that youre lucky when i was your age i was living somewhere different every year i never put down enough roots to be able to register and vote so i never did not till after the fighting stopped and i settled down with your mother jonathan hadnt thought about that lord his father had been an old man by the time he finally got the chance to vote before jonathan could say anything about it the pilot announced theyd be landing soon this was jonathans first flight his father took airplanes for granted so he did his best to do the same it wasnt easy watching the ground rush up feeling the jounce as the plane hit the runway and youll be going into space in a couple of days he thought if youre getting excited about airplanes what will you do when you blast off a trim captain halfway between his age and his fathers took charge of them when they got off the plane the captain gave jonathans shaved a head a couple of glances but didnt say anything the officer drove through drizzle to a barracks the quarters the two yeagers got struck jonathan as spartan his father accepted them with the air of a man whod known worse sometimes jonathan wondered what all his old man had been through in the days before hed reached the scene himself his father didnt talk about that much when they went to the mess hall some of the soldiers there also gave jonathans shiny skull and casual civilian clothes odd looks he ignored them he wished he could have ignored the food you could eat as much as you wanted but he couldnt see why anybody would want to eat any of it along with his father he spent the time till he went into space getting lectured about everything that could go wrong and what to do if anything did the short answer seemed to be if anything fails you probably die the long answers were more complicated but they added up to the same thing people did die going into space he thought about that as he boarded the upper stage with redtail painted on its nose he didnt think about it for long though at not quite twentyone he didnt really believe he could die going to pay a call on the lizards eh said the pilot a navy lieutenant commander named jacobson ill get you there and ill bring you home againas long as we dont blow up if we do itll be over in a hurry jonathans father said plenty of worse ways to go believe you me oh yeah the navy man glanced over at jonathan first time l ever took up a guy dressed like a lizard ill tell you that jonathan knew his dad would defend him if he didnt speak up for himself but he figured he was old enough to do that even if he hadnt hit twentyone yet one of the reasons im going up is that i dress this way its supposed to set their minds at ease i guess youd say he still kept quiet about kassquit the lieutenant commander didnt need to know about her okay kid jacobson said youre on the manifest so youre going strap in good there i know your old mans done this before but you havent have you no sir jonathan tried not to be nervous as he settled himself on the foampadded seat he didnt know how much good the safety harness would do but he fastened it been a while for me his father said but i know id rather go up there in just body paint and shorts than in my uniform here the race likes it hot thats what ive heard jacobson said well get as comfy as you can because weve got an hour to kill now waiting for launch time that hour seemed to jonathan to stretch endlessly at last though the countdown hallowed by endless books and films reached zero the rocket motor roared to life beneath him all at once it felt as if three or four guys had piled onto his chest hed had that happen in football games but here the guys didnt get up they couldntthey were him his own body weight multiplied by acceleration though it was only a matter of minutes the time felt as long as the hours wait before blastoff beside him his father forced out a sentence a word at a time watch that first stepits a lulu you all right dad jonathan asked wheezed actually he wasnt having too much trouble with the acceleration but his fatherheck his father was practically an old man ill manage sam yeager answered i reckon i was born to hang before jonathan could answer that he stopped weighing several hundred pounds in fact as the rockets cut off he stopped weighing anything at all he discovered another reason for his safety harness to keep him from floating all over the redtail s cramped little cabin he also discovered his stomach was trying to climb up his gullet hand over hand gulping he did his best to get it back where it belonged lieutenant commander jacobson recognized that gulp airsick bag to your right he said grab it if you need it grab it before you need it if you please ill try jonathan said weakly he found the bag but discovered he didnt have to clap it over his mouth at least not right away the pilot meanwhile was talking in the language of the race and getting answers from the lizards every so often hed use the redtail s motors to change course a little jonathan was too sunk in misery to pay much attention his father was also quiet and thoughtful we dock at the central hub of the lizard ship jacobson said after a while they spin most of their vessels for artificial gravity but the axis stays weightless of course again jonathan didnt much care the ship the redtail approached looked big enough to have respectable gravity just from its own mass clanks and bangs announced contact very neat his father said very smooth it hadnt felt smooth to him but he had no standards of comparison ill be waiting for you when the lizards bring you back jacobson said have fun by his snort he found that unlikely when the hatch opened it revealed a couple of lizards floating in a corridor the two tosevites for the interview will come with us one of them said jonathan undid his harness and pushed himself toward the lizards he flew as easily as if in a dream but in a dream he wouldnt have been fighting nausea his father followed him sure enough it was hot and dry in the spaceship as hot and dry as it got in la with the devil winds blowing little by little as jonathan and his father followed the lizards outward from the hub weight or a semblance of it returned by the time they got to the second deck out they were walking not floating jonathan approved his stomach approved even more the curved horizon of each deck seemed as surreal as something out of an escher painting but bodily wellbeing made him willing to forgive a lot at last when his weight felt about the way it should have the lizard guides stopped using stairs and led his father and him along a corridor to a chamber with an open doorway the female kassquit awaits within he said we thank you jonathans father replied in the language of the race he dropped back into english for jonathan lets do it okay dad jonathan said also in english you go in firstthats how they do things he was pleased he remembered some of what hed learned right his father squared his shoulders and entered the chamber as jonathan followed his father went back to the language of the race i greet you superior female i am sam yeager here with me is my hatchling jonathan yeager i greet you superior female jonathan echoed he had to work to hold his voice steady but thought he managed hed known kassquit would be naked but knowing and experiencing were two different things especially since she wasnt just naked but shaved not only her head but on all of her body i greet you she said she took her nudity altogether for granted her face showed nothing of what she thought how strange to make the acquaintance of my own biological kind at last she pointed to the body paint on jonathans chest i see you are now wearing the marking of a psychological researchers assistant yes jonathan answered it is a true marking for i assist my father here he tried to eye her paint without eyeing her breasts it is not much different from yours it is an accurate marking kassquit said but it is not a true marking for the race did not give it to you she was as fussily precise as any real lizard jonathan had ever met his father asked how do you feel about meeting real big uglies at last sore kassquit replied at once jonathan was wondering whether hed understood her correctly when she went on i had to be immunized against many tosevite diseases before taking the risk of physical contact ah sam yeager said yes you wrote to me about that i respect your courage i hope we bring you no diseases so do i kassquit said i have never known illness and have no desire to make its acquaintance jonathan gaped he couldnt help himself shed never been sick a day in her life that hardly seemed possible he wondered what his father was thinkinghis father whod almost died in the influenza epidemic of and who complained these days that colds hung on a lot longer than they had when he was younger not wanting to contemplate his fathers mortality he wondered if mickey and donald would grow up diseasefree too because they wouldnt meet any adult lizards he also wondered how many diseases lizards had they had doctorshe knew that much kassquit said and what do you big uglies think of me you are an attractive young female jonathans father answered jonathan would have agreed with that his generation was a lot more relaxed about showing skin than his old mans had been but not so altogether oblivious about its even being an issue as kassquit was he had to work to keep his eyes on her face not her breasts or the shaved place between her legs his father went on the biggest differences between you and a wild big ugly are that you shave all your hair and that your face does not move much your hatchling also shaves his hair kassquit said uhnot as much of it as you do jonathan said and felt his face heat in a way that had nothing to do with the temperature of the chamber i try to look like a member of the race so do iwith rather more reason than you kassquit could be tart when she chose she went on as for my face my caregiver ttomalss speculates that i needed to see moving faces when newly hatched to learn to move mine as wild tosevites do since his face cannot move i never acquired the art myself i do not miss it she shrugged her breasts were so small and firm they hardly jiggled jonathan couldnt help noticing that his father asked from what you know of life down on tosev what do you miss about it nothing kassquit used an emphatic cough except genetically i am not of your kind but that is a large exception jonathans father said it means you can never be fully of the race either what is it like staying forever betwixt and between what was going on behind kassquits impassive mask jonathan couldnt tell at last she said i was made to be a bridge between my kind and big uglies she pointed at jonathan heyour hatchlingis a bridge between your kind and the race so are you sam yeageror should i say regeya we reach from opposite sides toward each other to the race you are a big ugly too jonathans father pointed out kassquit shrugged again i am of the empire you are not males and females of the race rabotevs hallessithey are my kind you are not look in a mirror jonathan suggested then try to say that see if it is truth for the first time kassquit raised her voice this interview is over she said sharply with another emphatic cough she strode out of the chamber through a side door jonathan hadnt noticed till she used it he glanced over at his father wondering if hed horribly botched things only when his dad winked back at him did he relaxa little if ottawa wasnt the end of the line you could see it from there so thought david goldfarb at any rate as he and his family stayed and stayed and stayed at the detention center for immigrants about whom the canadians werent certain people whod come in after the goldfarbs had already gone on their way but the authorities remained dissatisfied with him he was dissatisfied with them too and with their country ottawa lay six degrees of latitude south of london ten degrees south of belfast but as drifted toward he thought hed chosen to emigrate to siberia hed never known such cold as he found every time he stuck his nose outdoors schoolchildren learned about what the gulf stream did for britains climate but hed never had to think about it outside of school till now how long naomi asked one day after the children had gone to sleep how long can they keep us like this inin purgatory is that the word thats the word all right goldfarb told his wife it was all things considered not the worst of purgatoriesthe flat where theyd been installed was bigger and boasted more amenities than the one theyd had in married officers quarters back in belfast still i just wish theyd let me get on with my life dammit hed wished that since summer it hadnt happened yet can your friend jones do nothing about this she asked if he could i think he would have by now goldfarb answered gloomily its not that i havent written him you know trouble is i havent just got friends in high places ive got enemies there tootoo bloody many of them were here naomi said i will thank god for that there is no canadian fascist party and i will thank god for that too canada looks to the usa not to the reich i have been through pogroms once in my life once is too often i know he said believe me i know i went to poland during the fighting remember and i saw marseille and what was left of the synagogue there but you didnt see how things turned naomi told him when i was a little girl in germany before hitler having a different religion wasnt anything specialwell not too special anyhow and things everything changed i dont want our children to go through that and my family got out before the worst her laugh was shaky if we hadnt got out before the worst we wouldnt have got out at all that wont happen here goldfarb said thats something whenever i feel the walls closing in around me i remind myself we got out of britain sooner or later they have to get sick of holding us here and turn us loose he wondered if he was whistling in the dark hed been saying the same thing for months now and it hadnt happened yet before naomi could answer the telephone jangled in the front room ill get it she said her side of the bed was closer to the door who could be calling at this hour flannel nightgown swirling around her she hurried away goldfarb came up with several possibilities none of them pleasant his wife returned a moment later its for yousomeone from the rcaf at half past ten goldfarb raised an eyebrow someone calling to harass me more likely well i can always hang up on the blighter he got out of bed and went to the telephone goldfarb here his voice was hard with suspicion whoever was on the other end of the line sounded more like an englishman than a canadian to goldfarbs unpracticed ear canadians however much they pointed out the differences in accent still sounded like yanks youre the goldfarb who used to mess about with radars isnt that right yes thats me goldfarb agreed whos this he didnt get a straight answer hed grown resigned to not getting straight answers you have an appointment at the defense ministry at eleven tomorrow youd do well to show up fifteen or twenty minutes early who is this goldfarb repeated this time he not only got no answer but the line went dead he scratched his head as he hung up the telephone who was it naomi asked when he came back to bed hanged if i know he answered and gave her the abbreviated conversation are you going to do what he told you she asked when hed finished i dont know that either he admitted not very happily fellow might have been trying to set me up he saw in his minds eye a couple of gunmen waiting outside the defense ministry but they could be waiting as easily at eleven oclock as at a quarter till he sighed i suppose i will i dont see how things could get any worse if i do now though he turned out the light on the nightstand now im going to bed and when he left the next morning he left early enough to get to the defense ministry building near the ottawa river well before the time scheduled for his latest round of grilling frigid air smote his face and burned in his lungs as soon as he left the block of flats where hed been quartered he turned up his greatcoat collar to protect some of his face from the ghastly weather but the garment hadnt really been made to stand up against a russianstyle winter had he been going more than half a dozen blocks up sussex drive he would have tried to flag a taxi but he might have stood there waiting for oneand incidentally freezinglonger than the walk would take him ottawa was a national capital but it was nowhere near so richly supplied with cabs as london or belfast either even the tenminute walk showed him many other differences between the capital of the country hed left and that of the country that wasnt sure it wanted him as a part of it most of ottawa was laid out on a sensible grid pattern and all of it to goldfarbs eye was new no pubs dating back to the fifteenth centuryand some looking as if they hadnt been swept up sincehere it was less than a hundred years since victoria had chosen this towntill then a little lumbering villageas the capital of the new dominion of canada everything dated since then and most since the turn of the century off to the west on parliament hill by the ottawa river stood the splendid buildings where the canadian government deliberated they werent in goldfarbs no doubt prejudiced opinion a patch on the houses of parliament in london but they did stand out from the square boxes that dominated the citys architecture the defense ministry was one of those boxes it replaced what had probably been a more imposing structure till the lizards bombed it during the fighting ottawa hadnt suffered too badly then nor for that matter had most of canada just as the winter weather was too chilly to suit goldfarbs overcoat it was also too chilly to suit the race the usa had taken a worse beating a sentry in a uniform about halfway between us and british styles took goldfarbs name at the entrance after checking it against a list he nodded yes sir he said theyll want you in room go to the west wing then take the stairs or the elevator thanks goldfarb said reminded anew he was in a foreign country back home someone would have urged him onto the lift but back home too many people would have urged him to a very warm clime indeed because of who his ancestors were he hadnt been to room before and had to wander the corridors for a little while before he found it when he went through the door with the frostedglass window with on it he found himself in an antechamber a fellow in rcaf uniform a few years older than he sat there leafing through a magazine the officer looked up then got to his feet a smile on his face goldfarb isnt it he said sticking out his hand yes sir goldfarb said the mans rank badges proclaimed him a colonel which still struck goldfarb as odd the canadians had gone their own way on air force ranks a few years before there were more urgent things he didnt know though such as why this bloke recognized him im afraid i cant quite he stopped and took a second longer look at the officer his jaw dropped george bagnall by god good to see you sir he pumped the proffered hand with enthusiasm thats right bagnall said smiling more widely he was goodlooking in the horsey british way and had the proper accent too only slightly diluted by however long hed spent in canada been a while since you shoved one of your bloody radars into the lanc i was flight officer for hasnt it you might say so yes sir goldfarb answered you were in russia after that werent you we met in a dover pub some of the stories you were telling would make anybodys knees knock and you joined the infantry when the lizards invaded england bagnall said so youve got stories of your own but thats all water over the dam rather more to the point here i was in russia with a certainoften very certainchap by the name of jerome jones something unfamiliar ran through goldfarbs spirit after a moment he recognized it hope he wondered if he ought to let himself feel it disappointment he knew would only hurt more now but he couldnt help asking so youre in touch with jones are you sir i wasnt bagnall answered hadnt been for years i came over to this side of the atlantic in i could see the writing on the wall even then come to think of it i was on one of the first shipsmaybe the first shipcarrying heavy water from germanoccupied norway to england though i hadnt the faintest notion what heavy water was in those days so i knew the reich and the uk were getting friendly and i didnt like it worth a damn who did goldfarb said but the trouble was altogether too many people did he made himself stick to the business at hand you werent in touch with jones you said but you are now thats right george bagnall nodded he hunted me down wrote me about the trouble youd been having with the ginger smugglers and about how theyd bollixed up your trip over here that was hope by god nothing else could produce such a pounding in the chest such a lump in the throat but despite hope asking the question that wanted asking took every ounce of courage goldfarb had can you can you do anything about it sir possibly just possibly bagnall said with such maddening english reserve that goldfarb wasnt sure whether to take him literally or to think things were in the bag then he went on youre here to see colonel mcwilliams arent you thats right david said you know him possibly just possibly bagnall repeated but this time he couldnt keep the smile from sneaking back he was best man at my wedding and i was a groomsman at hishis brother was best man for him god bless jerome jones david goldfarb murmured hed intended it for a joke but it came out sounding quite reverent bagnall chuckled i hope gods listeninghe probably doesnt hear that very often but now lets go have a word with freddy shall we he steered goldfarb toward colonel mcwilliams office and goldfarb was glad to let himself be steered rance auerbach shook his finger at penny summers youre getting itchy he said i can feel you getting itchy goddammit its summertime down here and youre looking to make a deal youre sweating to make a deal any old kind of deal of course im sweating penny took off her straw hat and fanned herself with it its hot outside not so bad auerbach said its a dry kind of heat more like la than fort worth he coughed which hurt and which also brought him back to what hed been saying youre not going to distract me you want to make a deal with youknowwho for youknowwhat he wished he could have been more specific than that butwhen he remembered tohe operated on the assumption that the lizards were likely to be listening in on whatever penny and he said in their apartment so did she she exclaimed id never do any such thing ive learned my lesson lizards often missed the tone in human conversations any lizard monitoring this one though would have to be extraordinarily tonedeaf to miss the obvious fact that penny was lying through her teeth rance didnt miss it his rasping laugh turned into a rasping cough that felt as if it were going to tear his chest apart from the inside out one day maybe it would then hed stop hurting serves you right penny said which showed him how much sympathy he was likely to get from her bring me a beer will you he asked and she went and got him a lion lager from the icebox and one for herself too he took a long pull at his it helped cool the fire inside him then he lit a cigarette that started it up again but he didnt care he offered penny the packthe packet they called it here in cape town she took one leaning forward to light it from his after a couple of puffs she said you know i wouldnt do anything stupid like that rance he laughed theres a hot one youd do anything you thought you could get away with who wouldnt penny said but if i dont think i can get away with it im not going to try it right well yeah rance admitted trouble is you always think youre going to get away with it if you were right all the damn time wed still be in texas or more likely in tahiti she gave him a dirty look i didnt hear you telling me not to run that ginger down into mexico i didnt see you staying back in texas when i did it neither if you had youd still be in that apartment by your lonesome pouring your life down a bottle one day at a time maybe he said though he knew damn well she wasnt wrong so im here instead if i hadnt been along youd probably still be in a lizard jail of course if i hadnt been around youd probably be dead now but you dont think about that not any more you dont pennys scowl got fiercer all right ive screwed some up before but i really dont see what can go wrong this time rance laughed againhe laughed till it hurt again which didnt take long so theres nothing going on and theres nothing that can go wrong with whatever is going on i like that ill go to hell if i dont god damn you she said furiously you werent supposed to know anything about it they were both barely remembering the microphones they figured the lizards had hidden in the apartment if they were remembering at all thats what the gal whos cheating on her husband always says too and she never thinks hes going to find out auerbach said he didnt have the energy to get as mad as she was just remember if your boat springs a leak down here i drown too and i dont feel like drowning so youd better level with me he could tell what was going on behind her blazing blue eyes she was deciding whether to stay where she was and talk or walk out the door and never come back rather to his surprise she kept on talking to him even if what she had to say didnt directly bear on the argument come on down to the boomslang she said we can hash it out there okay he answered and limped over to pick up his stick he didnt feel like hobbling to the tavern but he didnt feel like having the lizards listen in on an argument about smuggling ginger either even with the cane his bad leg gave him hell as he went downstairs and kept on barking when he got down onto the sidewalk it would do worse when he had to go back upstairs and he knew it something to look forward to he thought a lizard patrol was coming up the street toward him the male in charge was even newer in town than he and penny were auerbach waved there were good lizards and bad lizards same as there were good people and bad people and this male seemed to be a pretty good egg i greet you gorppet rance called in the language of the race and i greet you rance auerbach the lizard said you are easy to recognize because of the way you walk he waved too and then led the patrol past rance and away along the street as soon as the lizards were out of earshot penny said if you know gorppet what are you getting your bowels in an uproar about over this ginger deal hes not the kind of lizard whod rat on us anybody can see that youre cooking up a deal with him rance said and penny nodded he stopped in his tracks standing still hurt marginally less than walking before he said anything more he paused to think penny wasnt wrong gorppet struck him as a lizard whod done a lot and seen a lot and wouldnt blab any of it still hes not that highranking if he makes a deal with you can he hold up his end of it has he got the cash you mean penny asked and rance nodded she said you dont have to be a general to be a bigtime ginger smuggler sweetie a lot of the big ones are just clerks they dont buy the stuff with their salariesthey buy it with what they make selling it to their buddies okay auerbach said after more thought i guess that makes sense but gorppet doesnt strike me as the type whod do a lot of tasting didnt he get transferred down here on account of hes some kind of hero yeah but that doesnt mean he hasnt been tasting for yearsi asked him penny said you would rance thought she went on he hasnt been in the selling end of the business till now though youre right about that part of what he got for being a hero along with this transfer and his promotion was a hell of a big reward for catching some arab or other can he turn it into any kind of cash we can use rance inquired we huh penny said and he felt foolish she let him down easy by answering the question its not that hard here in south africa you know everything turns into gold if you work it a little she was right about that he couldnt deny it only trouble with gold he said slowly is that its heavy if weve got to leave town in a hurry its heavy yeah but it doesnt take up much space penny replied all of a sudden she grabbed him and kissed him a little black kid walking past smoking a cigarette giggled around it she took no notice when she was done with the kiss she said and now youre starting to sound like somebody who might be interested in this deal after all who me auerbach looked back over his shoulder as if penny might be talking to somebody else she made as if to hit him in the head he ducked then winced when his shoulder twinged i dont know what the devil gave you that idea cant fool mei know you too well penny said since that was probably true he didnt answer she went on we can do iti know we can and when we do tahiti here we come not for the first time rance thought of warm moist tropical breezes and warm moist native girls but his longago west point days made him also think of logistics how do we get there from here either way we go its through lizardheld territory they sent us down here to be good little boys and girls remember theyre liable not to want to let us loose again if weve got the cash to get to free france and live there well have the cash to pay off whoever we need to pay off to get us the hell out of here penny said and rance could hardly deny that was oddson to be true she continued come on lets get over to the boomslang ive got to talk to frederick alarm bells clanged in auerbachs mind what do you need to talk to him about he didnt like frederick much not least because he thought the negro might like penny a little too well she set her hands on her hips ive got to get the ginger from somebody dont i she said patiently fredericks got ginger but he doesnt have the connections with the lizards for anything more than nickelanddime deals i damn well do fredericks got connections with the local tough guys though rance said or i figure he does anyhow he probably would have woke up dead one morning if he didnt hows he going to like you pulling off a big score on his home turf hell get enough to keep him sweetplenty for everybody penny said rance honey thisll work it will her confidence was infectiousand rance didnt feel like living in south africa for the rest of his life it might be better than a lizard jail but it wasnt a patch on the states okay he said lets go to the boomslang he wondered how much trouble he was getting into hed find out he was all too sure of that penny kissed him again nobody on the street snickered this time you wont be sorry she promised im sorry already rance said which wasnt quite true but wasnt quite a lie either frederick wasnt in the saloon when rance and penny went inside that surprised him from everything hed seen frederick damn near lived in the boomslang but sure enough the big black man breezed in before theyd got very far into their drinks he sat down beside them as if he expected to talk business and so he probably didpenny must have started setting up this deal a while ago so we go forward he said we go forward rance answered before penny could say anything as soon as you convince us youre not going to sell us out to the lizards or try to do us in and keep all the loot for yourself frederick laughed as if those were the funniest ideas in the world auerbach didnt find them so amusing frederick might be greedy for cash or he might want to screw them over because they were white but then the negro started to talk he had a good line rance had to admit as much the longer he listened the more convinced he gotand the more he wondered how big a fool he was being this time no one in the village where liu han liu mei and nieh ho ting had taken refuge dared destroy the altar to the spirits of emperors past the little scaly devils had set up at the edge of the square despite protests from the three communists the villagers went right on burning offerings in front of the altar as if it commemorated their ancestors and not forwardslung creatures with eye turrets they are ignorant they are superstitious liu mei complained to her mother they are peasants liu han answered living in peking you never really understood what the countryside is like now youre finding out living in peking shed forgotten how abysmally ignorant the bulk of the chinese people were too returning to a village reminded her in a hurry we have to instruct them liu mei said either that or we have to get out of here liu han said unhappily we probably should have already the little devils are learning to use propaganda better and better before too long the peasants in this villageand the peasants in too many villages all through chinawill take sacrificing to the spirits of the little devils dead emperors as much for granted as they do sacrificing to the spirits of their own ancestors it will help turn them into contented subjects what can we do liu mei demanded how can we start a counterpropaganda campaign it was a good question it was in fact the perfect question liu han wished she had the perfect answer for it she wished she had any answer this side of flight for itand how much good would flight do if other villages were like this one she didnt and knew as much if the lizards punish villages that harm the altars no one will harm altars she said burning paper goods in front of them seems too cheap and easy to be very bothersome but it enslaves liu mei said and liu han nodded her daughter went on how do we know the little scaly devils really are watching those altars the way they say they are we dont liu han admitted but they could be doing it and who has the nerve to take a chance someone should liu mei insisted someone should yesbut not you liu han said youre all i have left in the world the little devils already took you away from me once and they tore my heart in two when they did i couldnt stand it if they took you again reproof in her voice liu mei said the revolutionary cause is more important than any one person liu mei had been around revolutionary rhetoric all her life she took it seriouslyas seriously as the scaly devils took their spirits of emperors past liu han took revolutionary rhetoric seriously too but not quite in the same way she was willing to fight for the communist cause but she didnt care to be a martyr for it maybe that was because shed come to the party as an adult she believed its teachings but she didnt believe in them the way she believed in the ghosts and spirits about whom shed learned in childhood liu mei did liu han didnt say any of that liu mei would have ignored it what liu han did say was what happens to people matters too i probably wouldnt have become a revolutionary if the little scaly devils hadnt kidnapped you even if you hadnt the cause would go on liu meis logic was perfectand perfectly irritating i think it has gone on better with me in it liu han said yes she could hear the anger in her own voice and for a wonder liu mei heard it too well maybe it has she said and walked out of the hut the two of them shared staring after her liu han stayed where she was on the kang the raised hearth where she spent as much time as she could during the winter shed been in the north more than twenty years now and never had got used to the wretched weather the wind off the mongolian desert blew hot and dusty in the summer and sent blizzard after blizzard down on the countryside in winter if liu mei wanted to stamp through snow that was her business she took it as much for granted as she did revolutionary fervor after growing up near hankow liu han didnt she wondered what liu mei was doing out there glaring at the memorial tablet the scaly devils had set up more than likely liu han bit her lip her daughter wasnt going to listen to her she could feel that in her bones what would happen when liu mei took a hatchet to the tablet or smashed it with a rock or did whatever else she was thinking of doing maybe nothing maybe the little devils were bluffing their propaganda was better these days than it had beenmaybe they were paying more attention to their chinese running dogs but maybe they werent bluffing the spirits of emperors past played a big role in their ideological system liu mei didnt understand that she thought superstitions were unimportant because they were false she didnt understand the power they could hold over peoplesand scaly devilsminds would she listen to nieh hoting if he told her the same things liu han had been telling her unfortunately liu han doubted it liu mei would do whatever she would do she lacked the almost blind respect for her elders liu han had had at the same age that lack of filial piety sprang from revolutionary rhetoric too most of the time liu han applauded it it made liu mei freer than she had been this once liu han would have been contentwould have been delightedwith a little oldfashioned blind obedience that evening liu mai carried the chamber pot out to dump it in the snow she was gone longer than liu han thought she should have been liu han craned her neck listening for smashing noises none came but she didnt rest easy the next morning she went out herself to make sure the memorial tablet was still there when she saw it she breathed a long foggy sigh of relief she said nothing of that to her daughter silence seemed wiser less than a week later she bitterly regretted that silence excited exclamations in the village square brought her out of her hut hastily fastening the toggles of her quilted cottonstuffed jacket sure enough it was just as shed feared someone had overturned and wrecked the memorial tablet eee the village headman squealed looking about ready to tear his hair he rounded on liu han and nieh hoting if the scaly devils come down on us it will be your fault yours do you hear me i dont think the scaly devils will do one thing liu han said much more calmly than she felt standing in front of his own hut nieh nodded the headman subsided having important communists in his village had taught him there were authorities greater than his all liu han could do was hope shed been right that she did for the villages sake and her own and most of all her daughters she didnt know liu mei had destroyed the memorial tablet but couldnt think who else might have she didnt want to ask her daughter either for fear interrogators might tear the truth from her if she knew it the day passed quietly so did the night in the morning helicopters that looked like flying tadpoles came thuttering toward the village from the east from the direction of fallen peking they landed in the frozen snowcovered fields little scaly devils looking miserably cold got out of them almost all the little devils carried weapons liu hans heart sank one of the little devils an unarmed one spoke chinese let everyone assemble he shouted a crime has been committed here a vile crime and justice shall be done on the criminals how do you even know who the criminals are someone shouted you werent here you didnt see we were not here the scaly devil agreed but we did see he set down a machine hed been carrying liu han had seen its like in peking the little devils used them to display images this will show us who the criminal was the little scaly devil declared sticking a clawed forefinger into a control on the side of the machine as liu han had expected a threedimensional image sprang to life above the device several of the villagers exclaimed even though they lived close to peking theyd never seen never imagined such a thing theyd probably never even seen a humanmade motion picture liu han kept hoping some other villager had decided to wreck the memorial tablet no such luck there came liu mei advancing on the tablet with a pickaxe handle in her hand and smashing it till it abruptly stopped recording she must have done that during the night but the image was as clear as if it were daylight numbly liu han waited for the little scaly devils to seize her daughter or perhaps to shoot her down on the spot but the one who spoke chinese said now you will tell us who this person is and tell us immediately they have as much trouble knowing one person from another as we do with them liu han thought hope surged in her it grew even higher when no one gathered there in the snowy square said a word then the scaly devil said you will tell us who this person is and nothing bad will happen to this village yes his kind were learning ruthlessness but still no one spoke some of the little devils hefted their weapons others examined the crowd doing their best to identify the person in the recording which kept repeating over and over they didnt seem to be having any luck though some of the villagers started to laugh at them the little scaly devil who spoke chinese said you tell us who this person is and you take everything this person has they were indeed learning there was always someone someone full of greed who would pounce on an offer like that and sure enough someone pointed at liu mei and shouted she did it shes the one shes a red little scaly devils skittered forward to seize liu mei liu han vowed a horrible revenge on the traitor maybe he also thought of that for he kept right on pointing and theres her mother and theres her mothers comrade theyre both reds too if he could remove the communist presence from the village maybe he could escape vengeance more scaly devils aimed their rifles at liu han numbly she stuck her hands in the air a little devil frisked her and found a pistol in her pocket that raised a fresh alarm the scaly devils tied her hands behind her back and served her daughter and nieh hoting the same way then they marched them back toward their helicopters i was captured once before liu han thought eventually i got away i can do it again she didnt know if she would but she could she was sure of it because of that she didnt give way to despair however tempted she might have been something will turn up but as she climbed into the helicopter she couldnt imagine what glen johnson grimly pedaled away on one of the lewis and clark s exercise bicycles sweat flew off him and floated in little nasty drops in the exercise room his wasnt the only sweat floating around in the chamber either several other crewmen and women also exercised there in spite of the ventilation currents that also eventually got rid of the sweat the place smelled like a locker room right after a big game after what seemed like forever an alarm chimed panting johnson eased upon the pedals his heart pounded in his chest it usually took things easy in weightlessness and resented having to go back and work for a living but hed keep on living longer if it did so he exercised besides hed get in trouble with the powers that be if he didnt he unhooked the belt that held him onto the bike the rest of the people in the chamber were doing the same one of the troubles with strenuous exercise was that it made him look at a sweaty tousled woman and not think of anything except how tired he was lucy vegetti the sweaty tousled woman in question was looking at him too he wondered what that meant and hoped to find out some time when his interest wasnt quite so academic but the mineralogist after wiping her face on her sleeve told him at least some of what was on her mind i heard last night that somebody had spotted another lizard spy ship news to me johnson answered people were gliding out of the chamber to change and sponge off in the two adjoining smaller rooms one for men the other for women in five minutes another shift of exercisers would mount the bikes lucy looked worried how are we supposed to do what we came out here to do if the race keeps spying on us shed asked the same question when she and johnson discovered the first lizard spy craft he shrugged weve got to do it if we dont we might as well pack up and go home she shook her head no that would be worse than not trying at all it would be giving up it would tell the lizards theyre stronger than we are well they are stronger than we are johnson said if they werent we wouldnt have to worry about any of this folderol reluctantly he pushed off toward his changing room adding see you over his shoulder see you lucy said johnson sighed he hadnt seen as much of her as he would have liked she kept him thinking she was or could be interested but things had gone no further than that she didnt tease that wasnt her style but she was cautious as a pilot johnson approved of cautionin moderate doses as a man he wished lucyd never heard of it but by the rules that had shaped up aboard the lewis and clark the choice was all hers a damp sponge made a poor substitute for a hot shower but it was what he had after hed cleaned up and put on a fresh pair of coveralls he was about to go to his cubicle and either read or grab a little sack time when the intercom blared to life lieutenant colonel johnson report to the commandants office immediately lieutenant colonel glen johnson report to the commandants office immediately oh shit johnson muttered under his breath what have i done now or what does that ironassed son of a bitch think ive done now he got no answer from the intercom he hadnt expected one he wished brigadier general healey had yelled for him a couple of minutes earlier then in good conscience he could have reported to the commandant all sweaty and rank from his exercise period he wondered if healey kept close enough tabs on his schedule to know when hed have sponged off he wouldnt have been surprised healey seemed to know everything that happened aboard the lewis and clark as soon as it happened sometimes even before it happened alone among the officers on the spaceship the commandant boasted an adjutant reporting as ordered johnson told him he half expected the spruce captain to make him cool his heels for half an hour before admitting him to healeys august presence hurry up and wait had been an old army rule in the days of julius caesar it was older now but no less true but captain guilloux said go on in sir the commandant is expecting you since healey had summoned him that wasnt the biggest surprise in the world but johnson just nodded said thanks and glided past guilloux and through the door into the commandants office saluting he repeated what hed told the adjutant reporting as ordered sir yes as usual healey looked like a bulldog who wanted to take a bite out of somebody hed wanted to take a bite out of johnson when the pilot came aboardeither take a bite out of him or boot him out the air lock one he still wasnt happy with johnson not even close but johnson wasnt his biggest worry his next words showed what was how would you like to stick a finger in one of the lizards eye turrets he couldnt mean it literallyso far as johnson knew there were no live lizards within a couple of a hundred million miles but what he likely did mean wasnt hard to figure out have we got permission from little rock to blast their spy ship to hell and gone sir no healey looked as if having to give that answer made him want to bite too but we have got permission to explore the possibility of covering the damn thing with blackpainted plastic sheeting or aluminum foil or anything else we can spare thatll make it harder for them to monitor us johnson nodded ive heard theres a second ship in the neighborhood too before he could say anything else brigadier general healey pounced where did you hear that and from whom its not supposed to be public news johnson stoodor rather floatedmute he wasnt about to rat on lucy vegetti even if she hadnt given him a tumble yet healey made a sour face never mind then what you heard is true we can only hope there arent any others we havent found yes sir johnson considered well if thats so how much trouble can we give them blind em sure but can we jam their radar and their radio receivers if we cant is throwing a sack over them worth the trouble well get into for doing it now healey turned the full power of that highwattage glare on him if youre yellow lieutenant colonel i can find somebody else for the job sir as far as im concerned you can go to the devil johnson said evenly healey looked as if hed just got a punch in the nose unless johnson missed his guess nobodyd told the commandant anything like that in a hell of a long time he wished hed said something worse goddamn military discipline he thought alter a couple of deep angry breaths healey growled you are insubordinate maybe so sir johnson replied but all i was trying to do was figure the angles and you went and called me a coward youve got my war record sir if that doesnt tell you different i dont know what would brigadier general healey kept on glaring johnson floated in place one hand securing him to the chair bolted to the floor in front of the commandants desk the chair in which hed be sitting if there were gravity or a semblance of it when he didnt buckle or beg for mercy healey said very well let it go but it wasnt forgotten every line of his face declared how unforgotten it was trying to get back to business johnson asked sir is it worth it to do whatever we can to those ships if we dont destroy them if it is send me ill go as yet we are still evaluating that healey said gruffly not all the variables are known well of course we cant know ahead of time what the lizards will do if johnsons voice trailed away healeys face had changed hed missed something and the commandant was silently laughing at him on account of it and after a moment he realized what it was oh do we know if these ships are armed sir thats one of the things were interested in finding out the commandant answered deadpan yes sir johnson said just as deadpan so healey was thinking about turning him into a guinea pig eh that didnt surprise him not even a little bit when do you want me to go out and which one do you want me to visit we havent prepared the covering material yet healey said when we doand if we decide toyou will be informed until then dismissed after saluting johnson launched himself out of the commandants office he glided straight past captain guilloux then used the handholds in the corridor to pull himself back to his tiny cubicle the only thing his bunk and the straps securing him to it did that a stretch of empty air couldnt was to make sure he didnt bump up against anything while sleeping he kept waiting for the order to climb into a hot rod and go blind one of the lizards spy ships the order kept on not coming he didnt want to ask brigadier general healey why it didnt come after a week or so he broached the subject to walter stone in an oblique way stone nodded i know what youre talking about i dont think you have to worry very much i wasnt worried johnson said which would do for a lie till a better one came along i was curious though ill say that sure you were stone grinned at him there in the privacy of the lewis and clark s control room johnson grinned back the spaceships chief pilot had been through the mill even if he was an army air force man and not a marine he knew the feeling of going out on a mission from which you didnt expect to come back he went on you dont know this officially because i dont know it officially but we got uh discouraged from going on with that oh yeah johnson leaned forward in his seat im all ears thats not what healey thinkshe figures youre all mouth and brass balls stone answered with a chuckle anyway this is all scuttlebutt and you havent heard it from me solemnly johnson crossed his heart which made the numberone pilot laugh out loud what i heard is we did a dry run with a hot rod under radio control whoever was in charge of the beast inched it up to the spy ship and when it got close enough yeah johnson said what happened then stone had hooked him sure as if hed been telling a hell of a dirty joke then the damn thingthe spy ship not the hot rodbroke radio silence or thats what they say stone told him it sent out a recorded message in the lizards language something like you come any closer or do anything cute and we count it as an act of war and so they backed up the hot rod and sent it home and nobodys said a word about it since is that a fact johnson said damned if i know stone answered but its what ive heard no wonder healey isnt sending for me johnson thought then something else crossed his mind im damn glad i didnt open up on the lousy thing jonathan yeager sprawled across his bed working on the chemistry notes and problems hed missed because hed gone into space karen sat in the desk chair a couple of feet away the bedroom door remained decorously open that was a house rule now that hed finally turned twentyone jonathan had proposed to his folks that they change it theyd proposed to him that he keep his mouth shut as long as he lived under their roof he pointed to a stretch of karens notes he had trouble following what was dr cobb saying about stoichiometry here karen pulled the chair closer and bent over to see what he was talking about her red hair tickled his ear oh that she said a little sheepishly i didnt quite get that myself he sighed okay ill ask after lecture tomorrow he made motions that would have implied tearing his hair if hed had any hair to tear i dont think im ever going to get all caught up and i was only gone a week what was it like karen asked shed been asking that ever since he got back from kitty hawk hed tried several different ways of explaining but none of them satisfied heror him really after some thought he took another shot at it youve read edgar rice burroughs right when karen nodded he went on you know how the apes raised tarzan but he still turned out to be a man pretty much like other men she nodded again jonathan said well it was nothing like that i mean nothing at all kassquit looks like a person but she doesnt act like a person she acts just like a lizard my dad was right he laughed a little that wasnt something he said every day we just play at being lizards shes not playing she wishes she had scalesyou can tell karen nodded again this time thoughtfully i can see that i guess she paused then found a different question or maybe a different version of the same one how did it feel talking about important things with a woman who wasnt wearing any clothes was that what shed been getting at all along jonathan answered for me it felt funny at first kassquit didnt even think about it and i tried not to noticeyou know what i mean hed tried he hadnt succeeded too well not wanting to admit as much he added i think it flustered my dad worse than it did me thats how it works for people that old she agreed with careless cruelty jonathan felt hed passed an obscure test hed been attracted to liu mei when she visited los angeles so now karen was nervous about every female he met here he thought she was wasting worry ucla boasted tons of pretty girls all of them far more accessible and far more like him than one raised by aliens whod spent her whole life on a starship interesting nowkassquit was certainly interesting fascinating even but attractive hed seen all of her every bit she was no more shy of herself than a lizard was he shook his head no he didnt think so what karen asked before jonathan could answer one of the lizard hatchlings skittered down the hall he stopped in the doorway his eye turrets swinging from jonathan to karen and back again they lingered longer on karen not because the hatchling found her attractivea really preposterous notionbut because he saw her less often jonathan waved hello donald he called donald waved back he and mickey had got good at gestures though the sounds they made were nothing but hissing babbles i greet you karen called to him in the language of the race he stared at her as if hed never heard such noises before and except from himself and mickey he hadnt dont do that jonathan told karen my dad would go through the roof if he heard you were supposed to raise them like people not like lizards when they learn to talk theyll learn english okay im sorry karen said i knew that but i forgot when i see a lizard i want to talk lizard talk mickey and donald wont be lizards any more than kassquit is really a person jonathan said then he paused still and all i think theres a little part of her that wants to be a person even if she doesnt know how karen didnt want him talking about kassquit any more she made a point of changing the subject she made a literal point pointing at donald she said he sure is getting big i know jonathan said he and mickey are an awful lot bigger than human oneyearolds would be his mother would have flayed him if hed said mickey and him however he said it it was true the baby lizards werent babies any more not to look at they werent theyd grown almost as if inflated by co cartridges and were closer in size to adult lizards than to what theyd been when they came out of their eggs liu mei never learned to smile neither did kassquit jonathan thought i wonder what sorts of things mickey and donald will never be able to do because were raising them instead of lizards he didnt know he couldnt know and he didnt feel like broaching the subject to karen not when she plainly didnt want him thinking about liu mei or kassquit after another wave donald scurried back up the hall karen said i wonder why they grow so much faster than people do dad says its because they take care of themselves so much more than human babies do jonathan answered if youre on your own the bigger you are the fewer the things that can eat you and the more things you can eat that sounds like it makes pretty good sense karen said jonathan automatically turned that like to as if in his mind karen was lucky enough not to have parents who got up in arms over grammar with a grin he said yeah i know but its liable to be true anyhow karen started to nod then noticed what hed said and made a face he made one back at her with the air of somebody granting a great concession he went on the things dad says usually make pretty good sense i know karen said youre so lucky at least your parents know were living in the twentieth century my folks think were still back in horseandbuggy days or if they dont think so they wish we were jonathan didnt reckon himself particularly lucky in his choice of parents very few people his age did but that never crossed his mind he thought mr and mrs culpepper were pretty nice but he didnt have to try to live with them pretty soon he wouldnt have to try to live with his own folks either part of him eagerly looked forward to that the rest of him wanted to stay right here in the bedroom where hed lived so long if he did stay he couldnt very well share the bedroom with karen that was the best argument he could think of for leaving the nest his mother looked in on them you kids are working hard she said would you like some cookies and a couple of cokes to keep you going okay jonathan said sure mrs yeager thanks karen said the look jonathans mother sent him said what she wouldnt say in words that he had no manners but his girlfriend did getting away from looks like that was another good reason for striking out on his own chocolatechip cookies and sodas eased his annoyance were he living by himself hed have had to get up and fetch them himself if i were married i could ask my wife to bring them he thought he glanced over at karen looking at her made him think of some of marriages other obvious advantages too that she might ask him to fetch cokes and cookies didnt cross his mind while jonathan and karen were eating cookies mickey came into the room he watched them in fascination before he and donald were allowed to go outside their room they hadnt seen the yeagers eating for all jonathan knew they might have thought they were the only ones who did they knew better now theyd also had to learn that grabbing whatever they wanted off peoples plates was against the rules that had produced some interesting and lively scenes now they were goodmost of the time anyhow mickey was good more often than donald his eye turrets followed a cookie from the paper plate on the bed by jonathan to jonathans mouth watching karen snickered you ought to put sunglasses on him and give him a little tin cup she said ill do better than that jonathan snapped his fingers the signal his family had worked out after trial and error to let the little lizards know they could come up and have some of the food a human was eating mickey advanced hand outstretched jonathan held out a cookie mickey took it with surprising delicacy then delicacy forgotten he stuffed it into his mouth jonathan waited to see how he liked it lizards were more carnivorous than people and mickey and donald were as emphatic as any human babies or toddlers about rejecting things they didnt care for but mickey after a couple of meditative smacks gave a gulp and the cookie was gone he pointed to the paper plate then rubbed his belly karen giggled hes saying he wants some more he sure is and hes not trying to steal it either good boy mickey jonathan held out another cookie you want this mickeys head went up and down in an unmistakable nod hes really learning karen said the lizards use a hand gesture when they mean yes he doesnt know what the lizards do though jonathan said he just knows what we do thats the idea he gave mickey another cookie this one disappeared without meditation mickey rubbed his belly again jonathan laughed youre going to get fat you give him one karen okay she said that way you get to keep more of yours huh see im on to you but she held out a cookie here mickey its all right you can have it mickey hesitated he was shier than donald and neither hatchling was as used to karen as he was to the yeagers but the lure of chocolate chips seduced mickey as it had so many before him he skittered forward snatched the cookie out of karens hand and then scuttled away so she couldnt grab him you like that karen said as he devoured the prize i bet you do you want another one i bet you do mickey stood there eye turrets riveted on the cookie in her hand come on you want it dont you mickey opened his mouth that alarmed jonathan was the hatchling going to take the cookie that way hed mostly outgrown such behaviorand jonathan didnt want him biting karen but instead of going forward mickey stood there he quivered a little as if from intense mental effort at last he made a sound esss jesus jonathan said softly he sprang to his feet give him the cookie karen he just said yes he hurried past her im going to get my folks if hes started talking they need to know about it the motorcar pulled to a halt in front of a house not much different from the one in which straha lived by now the exshiplord had grown used to stucco homes painted in bland pastels with swaths of grass in front of them they seemed to be the local tosevites ideal hed never been able to figure out whytaking care of grass struck him as a waste of both time and waterbut it was so here we are his driver said you may have a more interesting time than you expect why straha asked do you think someone will start shooting at the house as happened on an earlier visit to sam yeager no that is not what i meant the driver answered if that happens i will do my best to see that no harm comes to you but the surprise i had in mind is not likely to be dangerous what is it then straha demanded his driver smiled if i told you shiplord it would not be a surprise any more go on the yeagers will be waiting for you and who knows you may not be surprised at all who knows straha said irritably i may one day have a driver who does not enjoy annoying me the driver laughed a loud braying tosevite laugh which annoyed straha more than ever he got out of the motorcar and slammed the door that only made the driver laugh louder tailstump quivering with irritation he couldnt hide straha went up onto the front porch and rang the bell he could hear it chime inside the house he never had liked bells he thought hisses the proper way to gain attention but this was not his world not his species if the american big uglies liked bells and pastel stucco and grass he had to accommodate himself to them not the other way round the door opened there stood barbara yeager she briefly bent into the posture of respect i greet you shiplord she said in the language of the race how are you fine thanks straha answered in english and you we are also well sam yeagers mate answered she shifted to english too sam strahas here im coming hon yeager called straha listened with mingled amusement and perplexity despite having lived so long among the big uglies he didntby the nature of things he couldntfully understand the way their family relationships worked neither the race the rabotevs nor the hallessi had anything similar so that was hardly surprising the former shiplord found endearments like the one yeager had used particularly hard to fathom they struck him as informal honorifics a contradiction in terms if ever there was one but the big uglies didnt seem to find it a contradiction they used them all the time sam yeager came into the front room i greet you shiplord he said as his mate had before i hope things are not too bad no not too straha answered with sam yeager he stuck to his own language more than with any other big ugly even his driver he felt as if he were talking with another male of the race that i hope things are not too bad proved how well yeager understood his predicament any other tosevite would have said i hope things are good things werent good they couldnt be not in exile they could be not too bad come on into the kitchen then yeager said i have a new kind of salami you might want to try i have rum and vodkaand bourbon for barbara and me and i have ginger if you care for a taste i shall gladly try the salami straha said if you pour me the glass of rum i expect it will manage to empty itself but i shall decline the ginger thank you whatever suits you sam yeager said turning and walking through the front room and dining room toward the kitchen his mate and straha followed over his shoulder yeager went on shiplord you had better know by now that i do not mind if you taste ginger any more than i mind if you drink alcohol no prohibition here the second word of the last sentence came out in english by yeagers chuckle it was a joke straha didnt get it prohibition he echoed confused when i was young the united states tried to prohibit the drinking of alcohol yeager explained it did not work too many tosevites like alcohol too well i wonder if that will happen with the race and ginger addicted to the tosevite herb though he was straha said i hope not i can drink a little alcohol and have my mood slightly altered or i can drink more for greater changes ginger is not like that if i taste ginger i will enjoy the lift it gives me and i will suffer the depression afterwards i have far less control with it than i do with alcohol and the same holds true for other tasters all right yeager said that makes better sense than a lot of things i have heard once in the kitchen he got out glasses poured rum into strahas and put ice and whiskey into the ones for his mate and himself he raised his in salute mud in your eye that was in english too the race also used informal toasts after drinking to yeagers straha returned one may your toeclaws tingle yeager drank to that then started slicing salami straha went on i never have understood why you big uglies do not freeze up what with all the ice you use he had been teasing the yeagers about that for a long time we like it barbara said if you are too ignorant to appreciate it that only leaves more for us we have no reason to like ice straha said if this planet did not have so much snow and ice we would have had a better chance of conquering it of course if i had been made fleetlord instead of failing in my effort to overthrow atvar we would also have had a better chance of conquering it after more than twenty tosevite years he seldom let his bitterness show so openly sam yeager said we big uglies are glad you failed then here see how you like this he gave straha a plate full of salami slices after trying one the exshiplord said it is certainly salty enough some of the tosevite spices i enjoy while others are harsh on my tongue he turned an eye turret toward the wrapper in which the salami had come he found english spelling a masterpiece of inefficiency even by tosevite standards but he could read the language well enough hebrew national he asked hebrew has to do with the big uglies called jews is it not so is this salami brought into the united states from regions the race rules no we have plenty of jews here too yeager told him this salami is made only with beef jews are not supposed to eat pork one more superstition i shall never understand straha said yeager shrugged i am not a jew so i cannot say i understand it either but they follow it back in the days before the empire unified homelong before the empire unified homemales and females of the race had held such preposterous beliefs theyd all been subsumed in the simple elegance of reverencing the spirits of emperors past only scholars knew any details of the ancient beliefs but here on tosev the big uglies had developed a formidable civilization while keeping their bizarre hodgepodge of superstitions it was a puzzlement before straha could remark on what a puzzlement it was he heard a loud thump from down the hall and then another what was that he asked that sam yeager said that was a research project what kind of research project goes thump straha asked a noisy one the big ugly answered which was no answer at all after yet another thump yeager added a very noisy one straha was about to insist on some sort of real explanation when he got one not from sam yeager but again from down the hall though they came only faintly as if through a door the hisses and squawks he heard were unmistakable you have other males or females of the race here he exclaimed are they prisoners he cocked his head to one side listening intently try as he would he could make out no words then he realized there were no words to make out hatchlings you have hatchlings sam and barbara yeager looked at each other that was much more obvious among big uglies than in the race for the tosevites had to turn their whole heads in english barbara yeager said i told you we should have put them out in the garage yeah you did sam answered in the same language but the neighbors might have seen them when we moved them and that would have been worse he swung back toward straha the shiplord here hes a soldier he knows how to keep secrets his tone implied that straha had better know how to keep secrets straha hardly noticed he was still too astonished how did you get hold of hatchlings he asked why did you get hold of hatchlings sam yeager regathered his composure and returned to the language of the race i cannot tell you how we got the eggs for i do not know myself you understand that shiplord what i do not know i cannot betray why so we can raise them as big uglies or see how close they can come to being like us just for a moment straha felt as if he were a shiplord of the race once more to have his own kind raised by these tosevite barbarians never to know their own heritage it is an outrage he shouted tailstump quivering with fury maybe it is yeager said which surprised him the big ugly went on but if it is how is it anything different from what you have done with kassquit but these are ours straha said automatically even he realized that wasnt a good enough answer some of the blind anger that had filled him began to seep away he was glad he hadnt tasted ginger if he had he probably would have bitten and clawed first and talked later if at all we are free we are independent we have as much right to do this as you do sam yeager said logically he was right but logic still had a hard time penetrating you have robbed them of their heritage straha burst out maybe yeager said but maybe not too we have had them a little more than two of your years and they are already starting to talk what straha stared that is impossible it is a truth sam yeager said and the exshiplord found him impossible to disbelieve another realization exploded within straha his driver had known about this all along hed known and never said a word no not quite never now some of the things hed said that hadnt made sense to straha did straha wondered what he could do to take revenge on the big ugly nothing came to mind not right away but something would something would he was sure of that this is all quite astonishing he said at last i would sooner you had not learned yeager said but they got too boisterous he ruefully spread his hands and you understand security so it is not so bad was he trying to convince himself probably yes i understand security straha agreed but his thoughts were far away he knew he would need something approaching a miracle to get back into atvars good graces and be allowed to rejoin the race reporting a couple of hatchlings kidnapped by the big uglies would that be enough he didnt know he couldnt knowbut it was worth thinking about gorppet wasnt so sure hed been smart in coming to south africa after all it was a lot more easygoing than his longtime former posting that was certain of course that would have been true of anywhere the race ruled but the weather as far as he was concerned left a lot to be desired in what was allegedly summer in this hemisphere it was tolerable he supposed but what would winter be like not goodhe was sure of that he hoped it wouldnt be as bad as the sssr the males stationed here said it wouldnt but gorppet had learned the hard way not to trust what others said without testing it he sighed as he tramped through the streets of cape towns district six however atrocious the big uglies in the district known as iraq had been hed enjoyed the weather there every so often hed even felt hot he didnt think he would do that here black and brown and pinkishtan big uglies filled the streets around him they chattered in several languages he didnt understand learning arabic had come in handy in iraq but did him no good here even this script was different from the one theyd used there he hadnt been able to read arabic writing but hed got used to the way it looked these angular characters seemed wrong somehow he paused at a street corner more motorized vehicles were on the streets here than in basra or baghdadmany more driven by big uglies more bicycles were on the road too they were ingenious contraptions and made individual tosevites into little missiles a male big ugly came up to the corner at a slow limp leaning on a stick i greet you gorppet he said speaking the language of the race with a thick accent and i greet you rance auerbach gorppet replied how are you today bad auerbach answered as he usually did he used an emphatic cough and then several that showed nothing but infirmity very bad that hurts i believe it it sounds as if it should gorppet said a wound from the fighting you told me that is right auerbach nodded one of your miserable friends put a couple of bullets in me and i have never been the same since he shrugged and some of your friends may limp on account of bullets i put in them back then that is how things were i only wish the male would have missed me i can understand that gorppet liked rance auerbach liked him better than hed expected to like any big ugly auerbach was able to greet him and deal with him without rancor in spite of what had happened during the fighting gorppet thought he himself would have been able to do the same with the soviet tosevites hed faced then theyd all been doing what theyd been told to do and doing it as best they could how could you hate anyone whod only been doing his best auerbach said come on let us go to the boomslang penny and frederick will be waiting for us all right gorppet said i will listen to what all of you have to say he paused then added i am less sure i would listen to the others if you were not with them me auerbach said and gorppet knew hed startled the big ugly why me penny found you of all of us involved in the deal i am the least gorppet made the negative hand gesture no you are mistaken i understand you in ways i do not understand the female and the blackskinned male we have been through many of the same things you and i it gives us something of a bond maybe auerbach didnt sound convinced but gorppet wanted to convince him it is a truth he said earnestly did you never feel back in those days that you had more likenesses to the males you fought than to your own high officers and to the tosevites who were not fighting rance auerbach stopped walking so abruptly gorppet took a couple of paces before realizing the big ugly wasnt with him any more the male turned an eye turret back toward auerbach hoarsely the tosevite said i had that feeling more times than i could count i did not know it worked the other way well it did gorppet said we were sent here to a world about which as it turned out we knew less than nothing we were told conquering it would be easy a walk in the sand we were told all sorts of things not one of them turned out to be truth is it any wonder that we were not always happy with those who led us and those who sent us forth no wonder at all auerbach said with another emphatic cough this time he managed not to add any involuntary coughs of his own when he and gorppet walked into the boomslang together the place got very quiet all at once it was a dangerous sort of quiet having come from basra and baghdad gorppet knew that sort of quiet all too well he let a finger slide toward the safety on his rifle if anyone wanted trouble he was ready to give plenty but then the black male named frederick spoke in one of the local languages and everybody else relaxed i greet you he called to gorppet from the table he shared with the female with gaudy yellow hair his accent was different from hers and auerbachs more musical comehave something to drink and we shall talk good enough gorppet said the chair in which he sat was made for tosevite posteriors but he had survived such seats before and knew he could again i do not want that nasty brown stuff you two are drinking therethe alcohol straight from the fruit tastes better to me wine penny summers called to the big ugly who served drinks and gorppet sipped from the glass with something not too far removed from enjoyment rance auerbach had some of the vile brownish liquor the big uglies seemed to enjoy so much after hed finished it and waved to the tosevite behind the bar for a refill he said now down to business down to business gorppet answered you have ginger i want it if you can get it for me i will pay you what it is worth and make it back by selling what i do not keep to taste for myself as much ginger as i could ever want he thought he wasnt sure there was that much ginger on all of tosev but he intended to find out the reward hed got for capturing khomeini had included a credit transfer as well as a promotion what was money for if not for spending it is not quite so simple frederick said we have to be certain you are not a decoy for the race in theory i understand this gorppet said making the affirmative gesture in practice it is absurd i want the ginger for myself and my comrades and friends if i were a decoy the males handling me would take the herb they would get it all and leave me with nothing i want more than nothing so you say penny remarked we have to be sure we can believe you the race does not like tosevites who sell ginger it does not like males of the race or females either who buy it gorppet pointed out we all run risks here rance auerbach spoke up in a local language gorppet understood not a word he was saying he returned to the language of the race i told them i think you are worth trustingand i thought they were addled when this scheme began to take shape i thank you gorppet said i also do not believe you are tools of the race aiming to entrap me i should hope not exclaimed the female with the yellow hair the race has entrapped us before but we would never entrap anyone for the race gorppet wondered if she was protesting too much what would his superiors do to him if they found out hed spent his reward to buy ginger nothing pleasanthe was sure of that but how could they do anything worse than demoting him to simple infantrymale and sending him back to baghdad for the rest of his days as far as he was concerned they couldnt and but for a minor difference in rank how was that different from what he would have been doing had he not recognized the fanatic called khomeini simpleit wasnt and so gamble he thought why not if you lose you only go back to what you were beforethe race does not have so many trained infantrymales that it can afford to imprison one for a crime that has nothing to do with combat effectiveness and if the gamble pays off it will make what your superiors paid you look like nothing but the money you would use to buy a narration to make the time pass by hed never really thought about being rich before what infantrymale did none that had any senseexcept the few sharp fellows whod got into the ginger trade early on but if the chance for riches came his way was he fool enough not to turn his eye turrets toward it if we do this he said slowly how do you want to be paid i have heard it is difficult for tosevites to use our credit though i know there are ways around this oh yes there are ways the darkskinned male called frederick said the other two big uglies made the head motion that was their equivalent of the affirmative hand gesture frederick went on but we do not want your credits we want gold he spoke the word with as much reverence as khomeini gave to his imaginary big ugly beyond the sky and by the way rance auerbach and penny summers said truth in a sort of crooning whine they were as reverent as the other tosevite gorppet understood that the tosevite economy was far less computerized than that of the race money wasnt just an abstract concept here it was often a real thing traded at a standard rate of value for other real things and gold was the principal medium of exchange here i think that can be done gorppet said i know a male tosevite who will take your credit and give you gold for it frederick said not so fast gorppet told him first let us settle on a price in credit then let us settle on a rate of exchange between credit and gold and then let me make my own quiet inquiries and see if i can find a dealer with a better rate than your friend this is not a good way to do business frederick protested it shows no trust there is no trust gorppet stressed that with an emphatic cough there is only business business that deals in lots of ginger and money is dangerous to begin with in the middle and at the end anyone who thinks different came from his eggshell addled frederick started to say something moreprobably another protest but rance auerbach spoke first this is also truth if we get through this dealing without trying to kill one another we shall be ahead of the game he swung his head toward frederick in his rasping ruined voice he went on this is what we all have to think my share of what we get here is enough do you understand what i am telling you you could try for all penny and i could try for all gorppet here could try for all someone might win but more likely everyone would lose i understand frederick said in that musical accent of his have i been anything but a proper partner not yet auerbach answered no not yet gorppet made the affirmative gesture to show he agreed with auerbach but betrayal was not in your interest before now i hope it still is not it had better not be rance auerbach didnt like the pistol he was carrying after the heavy solidity of an army this cheap little revolver felt like a toy but it was what hed been able to get his hands on and it was a damn sight better than nothing he nodded to penny ready sweetheart you bet she said and pulled her own out of her purse to show she understood what he meant inside their apartmentthe apartment that with luck theyd never see again after tonightshe said no more theyd never been able to prove the lizards listened to them but they didnt want to take any chances either lets see what happens then auerbach stubbed out a cigarette and immediately lit another one his mouth would have been dry even without the harsh smoke he felt like a man going into combat and this might be threesided combathe and penny had one interest gorppet another and frederick yet another his eyes slid over to penny it might even turn into foursided combat if she decided to doublecross him would she he didnt think so but the idea that she might wouldnt leave his mind shed had her eye on the main chance for a long time now if she decided she wanted all the loot she might be planning to doublecross him with frederick too rance didnt really think she was but he didnt ignore the possibility either his army days had taught him to evaluate all the contingencies out they went rance fought his way down the stairs once he got outside the very chirps of the insects reminded him he was a long way from home if this went through hed still be a long way from home but hed be someplace he wanted to be not where the lizards dumped him if it didnt go through shoot first babe he told penny dont wait if you think you might be in trouble chances are youre already there i gotcha she said sounding as if shed come out of a gangster movie shed been through these deals before he knew and every one of them outside the law but this one was further outside than mostand she didnt have any hired muscle along except for him he snorted and fought back a cough hired muscle that could hardly walk without a cane if it came to rough stuff the home team was in trouble they walked through the narrow winding streets of district six this late at night rance worried less about being a white man in a largely black part of town hanover street and a few of the other main drags were well lit away from them though it was too dark and gloomy for anybody to tell whether he and penny were white black or green music that sounded like us jazz with something different something african mixed in blared out of a little holeinthewall club a black woman leaning against the wall stepped out and spoke to rance in her own language he didnt understand a word of it then the woman noticed he already had a companion she said something else he didnt understand that either but it sounded scornful he and penny kept walking the woman went back and leaned against the wall again waiting for someone else to come along a couple of blocks later screams floated down from an upper floor of a rickety block of flats auerbach tried to make a joke of it somebody teaching his wife to behave you try teaching me like that big boy and youll eat your dinner through a straw for the next year on account of ill break your jaw penny said and she didnt sound as if she were joking at all after about half an hour they came to the little park where gold and ginger would change hands everything seemed quiet and peaceful rance trusted neither peace nor quiet stay well back of me he said if anything goes wrong and we get separated we try and meet on the docks okay i know what were supposed to do penny told him you hold up your end ill hold up mine and we hope everybody else holds up his yeah we hope rance said bleakly he glanced at his glowing watch dial five to one they were early a hiss came out of the darkness followed by more hisses that were words in the language of the race i greet you rance auerbach gorppet rance stood very still he knew the lizards had gadgets that let them see in the dark human soldiersmaybe human cops tooalso had them these days but he didnt and somehow hadnt expected the male to be using one it felt like cheating who else would know your name the lizard asked to which he had no good answer gorppet went on i have the payment ready now we await the tosevites with the herb they will be here auerbach said the deal cannot go on without all of us that wasnt strictly true which worried him the deal couldnt have got started without penny and him but they werent essential any more if the others wanted to take them out he didnt worry too much about gorppet lizards generally played straight but he didnt trust frederick any farther than he could throw him i greet you my friends frederick in rances opinion spoke the lizards language with a funny accent i have some of what we need you brave male you have the rest of what we need let us now make the exchange he didnt say a word about rance and penny having anything they needed that bothered auerbach set gold in the scales against gratitude and figuring out which one weighed more wasnt tough now penny walked past auerbach gold didnt take up much room but it was heavy with a bad shoulder and a bad leg he couldnt carry so much if she got their share of the loot and ran off what could he do about it not much he didnt like that either penny ate drank and breathed trouble she might try to run off as much for the hell of it as anything else i have males covering me gorppet warned so rance wasnt the only imperfectly trusting soul here i have males covering me frederick said as if he took the idea altogether for granted and i have males covering me penny said auerbach looked around to see if hed grown a twinor even better quintuplets no such luck though he knew that too damn well the exchange gorppet said rance peered through the darkness he could hardly see a thing now frederick said and the gloating triumph in his voice made rance realize he was going to try to hijack all the gold rance filled his ruined lungs to shout a warning and another shout came from the edge of the park a shout in an african language a shot followed it and then another and then a stuttering roar of gunfire screams rang out not just from human throats but from those of the race surrender a lizard called his voice amplified you cannot escape by then rance was already on the ground rolling toward cover old reflexes took over modified only by the need to hang on to his cane bullets snarled not far enough above his head who says we cannot escape frederick shouted we shall smash you he shouted again rifles barked submachine guns chattered he had to have brought a young army with him by the volume of fire his men were laying down he had the lizards outnumbered and very nearly outgunned he wouldnt have brought so many if he hadnt intended to cut rance and penny out of the deal to say nothing of punching their tickets for good and hed probably intended to rub out gorppet and whatever pals the lizard had along too having that patrol come into the park just when it did looked to have been good luck for everybody but the black man and auerbach wasted no pity on him what they had now was a nasty threecornered gunfight with rance in the middle of it he shouted pennys name but his best shout wasnt very loud and noise filled the air she didnt hear himor if she did if she shouted back he couldnt hear her he crawled toward her or toward where he thought she was muzzle flashes sparked here and there putting him in mind of giant malignant lightning bugsor of the fight in colorado where hed got himself ruined hed never thought he would wind up in anything like that again he wished to jesus he hadnt somebody ran toward himor maybe just toward the gold everyone human would be making a beeline for that all the lizards would be rushing toward the ginger either to taste it or to grab it as evidence getting himself in deeper was the last thing he wanted to do but penny was there somewhere and hed been trained never to let the folks on his side down the running figure was about to run over him he rose up onto his elbows and fired a round from his with a soft grunt the man toppled his weapon clattered to the ground right in front of rance who grabbed it his hands told him at once what he had a sten gun about as cheap a way to kill lots of people in a hurry as humanity had ever made he stuffed the pistol into a trouser pocket for a backup weapon the submachine gun suited him a lot better now rance that was penny not very far away he crawled toward her one of his hands went into a pool of something warm and sticky he exclaimed in disgust and jerked the hand away rance im here he answered and then get down goddammit what was she doing still breathing if she didnt have the sense to hit the deck when bullets started flying another burst of gunfire from off to the right underscored his words that was the direction from which gorppet and his pals had come they were making their getaway now and doing a good professional job of it he wondered if theyd been able to nab the ginger before they started out of the fighting jesus christ penny said this time sounding as if she was on the ground you still alive hon yeah i think so auerbach answered wheres the gold wheres frederick the african worried him more than the lizards did the lizards played by their own rules frederick was liable to do anything to anybody freds dead or i think so anyway penny said i sure to god shot himi know that doublecrossing son of a you told him rance but he didnt want to listen gorppets worth a dozen of the likes of him yeah but auerbach remembered penny had got herself in trouble by doublecrossing her pals in a ginger deal and wheres the gold he repeated more urgently this time oh the gold penny laughed then switched to the language of the race i have it here or some of it how much can you carry i do not know rance said in the same languagegood security but i can find out and that is a truth suits me fine penny said reverting to english here she pushed something at rance it wasnt a very big package but it weighed as much as a child he grinned lets see if we can slide out of here he said without getting killed i mean yeah thats the best way penny surprised him with a kiss he wondered if they could make it as long as fredericks pals and the lizards kept a nomansland between them they had a chance he also wondered how he would lug the gold and his cane and the sten gun wishing for another pair of hands he set off to do his best atvar turned one eye turret from the computer screen toward his adjutant well this is a shame and a disgrace and a firstclass botch he remarked to what do you refer exalted fleetlord pshing asked he approached the computer terminal oh the report on the unfortunate incident down at the southern end of the main continental mass yes the unfortunate incident atvars emphatic cough said just how unfortunate an incident he thought it was when we discover a deal for ginger in progress it is generally desirable to capture the guilty parties the herb and whatever was being exchanged for it would you not agree his tone warned pshing he had better agree truth exalted fleetlord he said atvar pointed to the screen by this report did we do any of those things in this incident did we accomplish even one of them no exalted fleetlord pshing said unhappily no atvar agreed no no is the operative word indeed it is no suspects or none to speak ofonly hired guns no ginger no goldit was supposed to be gold i gather two males killed three wounded and who can say how many big uglies we have had a great many fiascoes in the fight against ginger but this one is worse than most what can we do pshing asked that was indeed the question it had been the question ever since the race discovered what ginger did to males and had even more urgently been the question since the race discovered what ginger did to females no one had found an answer yet atvar wondered if anyone ever would not about to admit that to his adjutant he said one thing we can do is make sure we do not disgrace ourselves in this fashion again yes pshing used the affirmative gesture have you any specific orders to achieve that end exalted fleetlord specific orders atvar glared at pshing wondering how to reply to that hed been giving very specific orders against ginger ever since it became a problem it remained a problem and was a worse problem now that the colonization fleet was here even in cairo even at this administrative center that had once been a tosevite hotel females sometimes tasted ginger atvar would get a distant whiffor sometimes a notsodistant whiffof pheromones and thoughts of mating would go through his mind addling him and rendering him all but useless as far as work went for annoyingly long stretches of time he wondered if that was what big uglies were like all the time forever distracted by their own sexuality if it was how did they ever manage to get anything done mating was good enough in the proper season but thinking about it all the time was definitely more trouble than it was worth he also realized he hadnt answered pshings question specific orders he repeated for this case yes every effort is to be made to track down the members of the race and the big uglies responsible for this horrendous crime and all are to be punished with maximum severity when apprehended it shall be done pshing said it would have been done in any case but it shall be done with all the more vigor now it had better be atvar snarled he went back to the report after a moment he snarled again this time in raw fury the tosevites involved in this crime or some of them are believed to be the ones we resettled in that area after their failure to help us as fully as they should have in marseille this is how they repay our forbearance they must be punishedoh indeed they must their involvement is not proved pshing said it is only that they have not been seen or overheard by monitoring devices in their apartment since the gun battle took place where have they gone where could they have gone atvar raged they are paleskinned big uglies they cannot find it easy to hide in a land where most have dark skins that is one reason we sent them to this particular portion of the territory we control his adjutant spoke consolingly we are bound to find them soon we had better atvar said and our own males involved in gun battles against each other disgraceful the criminals could even have been females pshing said why so they could atvar said that had not occurred to me but they handled weapons as if they were familiar with them which makes it more likely they were males from the conquest fleet were you not due to discuss with fleetlord reffet plans for the training of the colonists to aid the conquest fleet pshing asked yes i was had atvar been a big ugly his face would have assumed some preposterous expression he was sure of that fortunately though he didnt have to show so much of what he thought what he did show was bad enough pshing drew back a pace but atvar knew it needed doing however little he relished it i had better take care of it he said though he would sooner have faced a surgeons scalpel without anesthesia he made the call consoled by the thought that reffet would be as unhappy to talk with him as he was to talk with the fleetlord from the colonization fleet in a matter of moments reffets image stared at him out of the screen what is it now atvar the other fleetlord demanded i think you know atvar replied i know what you will ask for yes reffet said what i do not know is how i can hope to build a successful colony here on tosev if you take my males and females from their productive tasks and turn them into soldiers by his tone he had nothing but contempt for the males of them soldiers time atvars tailstump quivered with fury i do not know how you can hope to build a successful colony if the big uglies kill your males and females they should not be able to reffet snapped well they can they can do a great many things we did not anticipate atvar said high time you finally figured that out in fact he paused all at once much more cheerful is it not a truth that we obtain many more manufactured goods from tosevite factories than we anticipated of course it is a truth reffet said we did not anticipate the big uglies having any factories at all does this not mean then that there are surplus workers from the colonization fleet who could be turned into soldiers without greatly disrupting the colonization effort had atvar been a beffel he would have squeaked with joy reffet paused before answering from which atvar concluded the other fleetlord hadnt thought about that and neither had his advisors maybe they hadnt wanted to think about it since doing so would have made them reexamine the way they looked at the colonists and at life on tosev refusing to look at the unpleasant was a more common failing of big uglies than of the race but males and females from home were not altogether immune at last reffet said this proposal may have some merit if you think you can shape what is liable to be unpromising material into soldiers we can do that atvar said we shall have to do that since it is the material we have available i guarantee we can send us the malessend us the females tooand we shall make soldiers of them we have been through the training of a soldiers time we can duplicate it here you guarantee it on the strength of no evidence reffet said merely on your unsupported word you expect me to turn over to you males and females by the thousands you have been dealing with big uglies too long atvar you think like one yourself somehow atvar kept his temper under his command voice tight with the rage he was holding in he said well if you will not turn them over what brilliant idea for their use do you have your notion may perhaps have some merit reffet spoke with the air of a male granting a large concession i propose establishing a committee to study the matter and see howand ifthat notion might be implemented once we examine all possible factors impacting the proposal we can make an informed decision on whether to go forward such is the way of the race he sounded as if he thought atvar needed reminding he was probably right about that atvar had got used to the headlong pace of life on tosev splendid reffetsplendid indeed he said letting out the sarcasm hed held in its eggshell till then and your magnificent committee will no doubt bring in its recommendations about the time the last male of the conquest fleet dies of old age i am afraid that will be rather late especially given the recent threats from the deutsche how long do you think our colonies can stay safe without soldiers to defend them i will tell you what i think reffet snapped i think you see the males of the conquest fleet dying out and hope to gain power over some part of the colonization fleet so you will not fade into obscurity with their passing eventually atvar said you will review this conversation and realize what an addled cloaca you have been through the whole of it when that time comes i shall be glad to speak to you until then however i have no such desire he broke the connection and felt like breaking the monitor too he does not understand pshing said up in reffets spaceship the other fleetlords adjutant was doubtless saying the same thing about atvar atvar didnt care what males or females from the colonization fleet thought of course he does not we do not fully understand the big uglies or the entire situation on tosev and we have been here a great deal longer than the colonists but they know everythingand if for some reason you do not believe me you have only to ask them what will you do about recruiting soldiers from the colonization fleet pshing asked i think you are correct that a committee would be impossibly slow i know i am correct about that atvar said what shall i do he thought then began to laugh one thing i shall do at once is begin to accept volunteers for training reffet cannot possibly object and i think there may be a fair number of colonists who would sooner do something with themselves than sit around in their apartments watching videos all day i hope you are right exalted fleetlord pshing said i think that a reasonable calculation myself will you truly include females as well as males among these new soldiers why not atvar said females and males mix in almost every aspect of the races life it was only for the convenience of avoiding mating issues that the conquest fleet was made allmale those will arise nowand will be worse thanks to the accursed tosevite herbbut i think we will manage quite well accepting females also means we have a larger group of potential recruits we need them and we shall get them it is as simple as that atvar hadnt the slightest doubt he was right as day followed day monique dutourd discovered she had lived her whole life in marseille without knowing half her city maybe more when she told that to pierre her older brother laughed at her you kept up the familys petit bourgeois respectability too well he said you wouldnt have wanted to have much to do with the black market or anything of that sort everybody does a little monique said one has to to live without the black market especially in the days not long after the fighting the whole city would have starved the way the boches stole everything in sight everybody does a little pierre echoed laughing still but you never approved did you little sister and now whether you approve or not youre part of it is it really so bad looking at the flat in which he lived the flat in which she occupied a spare room these days monique had a hard time saying no the flat was far larger and far airier than the one from which shed escaped and it held every sort of electronic gadget mostly lizardmade under the sun more modern conveniences than people could even imagine still how do you stand living like a hunted animal all the time she burst out her brother looked back at her for once without a hint of irony on his plump pouchy features id sooner live as a hunted animal than as one in a cage where the keeper could reach in and pet meor do anything else he wantedwhenever he chose that held enough truth to sting but monique said im still in a cage only now its yours and not the ss mans you can go back any time you please pierre said easily if you would rather do what he wants than what i want go right ahead id sooner do what i want monique said shed said that a good many times to anyone who might listen it hadnt done her much good and didnt seem likely to do her much good this time either and so it didnt her brother at least didnt laugh at her any more voice serious now he answered if that is what you would rather have you need to make yourself strong enough to be able to get it no one will give it to you you have to take it monique clenched her fists till her nails bit into her flesh you talk like you just came back from the revival of the triumph of the will i saw it he said which made her glare harder than ever since hed come back into her life shed never been able to faze him he went on its marvelous propaganda even the lizards say so they study it to see how to make people do what they want if its good enough for them why shouldnt it be good enough for me before monique could answer someone knocked on the front door pierre didnt just open it instead he checked a little television screen connected to an even littler camera hooked up to look out on the front hall he nodded to himself yes those are the lizards im expecting turning to monique he said why dont you go shopping for a couple of hours spend as much of my money as you want ive got some business to take care of here by his tone he was as convinced he had the right to send her away as dieter kuhn was that he had the right to tell her to take off her clothes and lie down on the bed one fine day and it wouldnt be long shed have something pointed to say about that but it wouldnt be today she grabbed her handbag and left the flat as soon as the lizards outside had come in except for the clothes the people wore porte daix always made her think of algiers as much as france it reminded her of the unity the mediterranean had known during roman times and even later professor pirennes famous thesis said the rise of first muhammad and then charlemagne had set the two sides of the sea moving in different directions scholars of moniques generation worked to refute pirenne but she not a medievalist herself thought he made good points a walk through this part of marseille certainly supported his views of the way history worked streets here were short and winding and narrowmost too narrow for automobiles quite a few too narrow for anyone but a madman to try on a bicycle but plenty of madmen were loose monique had to flatten herself against brick or stone walls every few steps to keep from getting flattened as they whizzed past shops and taverns and eateries were tiny and most of them did as much business out on the street as back in the buildings that supposedly housed them a tinker sat on a chair a cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth as he soldered a patch onto a cracked iron pot that might almost have dated back to roman days his legs stuck out into the street so that monique had to step over them he moved the pot and patted his lap here sweetheart you can have a seat if you care to you can solder your fly shut if you care to monique told him and your mouth to go with it bristling she strode on behind her the tinker laughed and without any undue haste went back to work in the course of the three blocks that lay between pierres flat and the local market square she heard several dialects of french german spanish or was it catalan italian english and the language of the race spoken by both men and lizards people changed tongues more readily than they changed trousers as a scholaras a former scholar she reminded herselfshe wished she could go back and forth from one language to another as readily as did some of these traders and tapmen and smugglers as always the market was packed some merchants had stalls their families had held for generations others guided pushcarts through the crowds shouting abuse and lashing out to keep people from getting too many free samples of their cooked squid or lemon tarts or brass rings polished till they looked like gold but sure to start a finger turning green in a week if you were rash enough to buy one monique hung on to her purse with both hands plenty of thieves in the market square were a lot less subtle than the ones who sold rings no sooner had that thought crossed her mind than a german soldier in fieldgray let out a guttural bellow of fury at discovering his pocket picked the fingersmith was sure to be long gone even if he hadnt been monique saw no police french or german anywhere some of the lizards who skittered through the largely human crowd were as much at home here as any people monique would have guessed they were males from the conquest fleet veterans who understood people as well as any lizard could and were liable to be up to something shady themselves then there were the lizard tourists they were as obvious and as obnoxious as any travelers from an englishspeaking land they all carried video cameras and photographed everything that moved and everything that didnt monique kept her head down she was wearing a new bouffant hairdo and makeup far more garish than she would have daredor even wantedto use while teaching at the university but she didnt care to be recognized if she showed up on some lizards pictures she wondered how many of the hissing tourists were spies for the race a moment later she wondered how many were spies for the nazis ginger from what shed seen was a great corrupter she wished her brother had never got into the trade even if it had made him rich if he hadnt she wouldnt have needed to have anything to do with the nazis either one of the lizards one with fairly fancy body paint bumped up against her it spoke in its own language im sorry but i dont understand monique said in french along with her own tongue she had latin she had greek she had german and english and some italian but very little classical scholarship was conducted in the language of the race to her surprise the lizard handed her a card printed in pretty good french it read you may already be a winner to find out if you are come to the consulate of the race rue de trois rois many valuable prizes what kind of winner she asked what kind of prizes the lizard tapped the card with a fingerclaw and said something else in its own language evidently it knew no more french than she did of its language it reached out and tapped the card again as if certain the little rectangle held all the answers i dont have the faintest idea what youre trying to tell me monique said with a shrug the lizard shrugged too in what seemed to her a sad way then it vanished into the crowd monique stared at the card her first impulse was to crumple it up and let it fall to the ground to be trampled underfoot the lizards consulate was bound to be the most intently spiedupon building in marseille if she ever wanted to remake the acquaintance of dieter kuhn that struck her as the way to go about it all she wanted for kuhn was a horrible death far away from her but from somewhere that miserable lizard had come up with magic words you may already be a winner was the race running a contest the way rival laundrysoap makers did when business got slow laundrysoap makers sold soap what were the lizards selling she had no idea but the very notion of the lizards selling anything piqued her curiosity many valuable prizes it sounded more like something americans would say than anything the lizards were likely to do what would a lizard think a valuable prize was just how valuable a prize would it be valuable enough to let her get away from her brother as shed got away from dieter kuhn were there any prizes that valuable she didnt know but she wanted to find out she wondered if she could manage it she started to let the card dropshe knew where the consulate wasbut then hesitated maybe she would need it she looked at it again by what she could see any french printing house could have done up such cards by the tens of thousands but she didnt know what she couldnt see thoughtfully she dropped the card into her handbag if i get the chance maybe i will go over there she wondered how many cards the lizard was giving out and how many lizards were giving out cards if she did go to the rue de trois rois would she find half of marseille there ahead of her and would the valuable prize turn out to be aluminum pans or something else every bit as banal she knew she shouldnt leave the porte daix for any reason if she was safe anywhere in marseille this was the place the germans came in here yes but they came in to buy and sell not to raid and plunder they didnt know a half or even a quarter of what went on under their noses and the lizard authorities didnt know half of what went on under their snouts either or pierre wouldnt have thrown her out so he could meet with those two shady scaly characters lady you going to stand there till you grow roots somebody demanded in loud irritable tones im sorry monique said though she wasnt not really she moved and the annoyed man pushed past her then she sank into abstracted study once more what were the lizards doing did she dare to find out on the other hand did she dare not to find out felless looked down from a thirdstory window at the crowd that had gathered in front of the races consulate in marseille the male who stood beside her was a researcher from the conquest fleet named kazzop save that these big uglies have black hair this puts me in mind of a tosevite work of fiction called the redheaded league he said tosevite literary allusions leave me uninterested felless said the question is will this accomplish what we desire we have certainly stimulated the big uglies superior female kazzop said i do not think the deutsche or the francais have the least idea how to control this swarm of tosevites in that case they will start brutalizing them soon felless predicted it is not what you had in mind for this experiment but does seem to be the standard tosevite procedure in case of insecurity truth kazzop said of course the deutsch tosevites need little excuse for brutalizing the francais in any case they rule them more through forcing fear than through promoting affection i suppose it is because they only conquered this province of their notempire shortly before the conquest fleet arrived felless said it strikes me as counterproductive but a great deal the deutsche do strikes me as counterproductive so this would be nothing out of the ordinary there indeed it would not kazzop said we had better go down there and get things under way or else the deutsche will disperse that crowd before we can get any use out of it i suppose so felless said unhappily this wasnt her project shed been brought here at the bidding of others just as shed been sent to nuremberg she remained inside the borders of the greater german reich here though she had at least a chance to escape the disgrace that had hovered over her in the capital that should have made her more enthusiastic about cooperating to a point it did but only to a point she had to keep coming out of her office and working not only with big uglies but also with females and males of the race working with big uglies was merely annoying though less so than it had been in nuremberg working with females of her own kind was innocuous working with males of her own kind she hated because it meant she dared not taste ginger she wanted a taste how she wanted a taste as she never had before she understood what addiction meant she would crave ginger even on her deathbed regardless of whether she had another taste between now and then she knew that if only she could get a couple of days doing research and data correlation inside the cubicle theyd given her maybe that would be long enough to let her taste and to let her raging pheromones subside afterwards and maybe she would taste and taste and then humiliate herself with the males who coupled with her after she emerged from the cubicle shed done that before shed done it more than once in fact she was all too likely to do it again she still wanted a taste down on the ground floor males had cordoned off all the passages leading away from the front entrance others stood in front of those cordonedoff passages with weapons in hand to make sure no snoopy big uglies went down them in spite of the barricades boxes full of prizes stood in back of tables just behind the closed front doors felless sighed i am not ideally suited for this task she said because i speak neither the deutsch language nor that of the local francais which i understand is different quite different kazzop said but do not let it worry you most of us have at least some knowledge of one or both of these languages while you are part of the project proper your most important role will be data analysis it is simply that we lack the personnel to restrict you to analysis alone senior researcher with a martyred sigh felless said i understand had she been doing only analysis she could have tasted to her hearts content nothing on tosev except ginger came close to contenting her heart kazzop now kazzop sounded happy and excited about what he was doing felless envied him his enthusiasm they took seats side by side then turned on the card readers in front of them she set a sheet of paper by hers when amber lights showed the machines were ready kazzop turned to the males at the door and said let them in tell them they must stay in two neat lines or we cannot proceed it shall be done superior sir one of the males answered and swung the doors open the big uglies outside roared he and his comrades shouted in the local language in came the tosevites more or less in two lines the first of them came up to thrust his card at fellessshe knew he was a male for he let the hair on his upper lip grow she took the card from him and stuck it into the reader a number showed on the screen a zero she touched the message printed beside the zero on the sheet of paper shed set next to the reader in the local language it read sorry you did not win anything today please try again by the way the big ugly stared she wondered for a moment if he could read at all then he let loose a torrent of what sounded like abuse felless was suddenly glad she knew no francais the tosevite stomped away still loudly complaining up came another big ugly a female her card showed a one on the reader felless turned and grabbed a skelkwank light disk player which she handed to the tosevite she got a wave in return as the big ugly carried away her prize more tosevites trooped up one after another those who won nothing complained loudly about it even though none of the cards had promised anyone a prize males and females of the race would have done better at remembering that most of the big uglies who did win got disk players some got portable computers a few got goodsized cash awardshalf a years pay for the average tosevite just as those whod failed were more abusive than members of the race would have been so the winners were more excited hidden cameras recorded all their responses and then a female big ugly gave felless her card it showed a four the only four among the cards the race had given out felless turned to kazzop here is the biggest winner of them all she said oh good he answered now i get to play with my bells and whistles as if i were a tosevite advertiser he turned on a raucous recording full of truly appalling noises felless winced kazzop laughed at her remarking i have come to like the big uglies and the noises they enjoy so i gather felless said coldly you have come to like them altogether too well if you want my view of the matter it could be superior female it could be kazzop sounded cheerful but lookall the big uglies in line and all the big uglies still waiting outside know she is the biggest winner see how excited and envious they are felless still had trouble reading tosevite expressions she was willing to believe kazzop though interpret for me if you will she said and he made the affirmative gesture tell the tosevite congratulations and ask her name kazzop spoke in the language of the francais the big ugly answered in what sounded like the same tongue she says thank you and that her name is monique he told felless just monique felless was puzzled do they not usually have two names after more conversation kazzop said she seems reluctant to give her family name she also seems reluctant to give reasons for her reluctance she is more curious about what she has won that for once was a reaction felless completely understood well go ahead and tell her felless said seeing how a couple of them have reacted to money she will probably come to pieces when she learns she was won a home here with as many modern conveniences as we can include in itsomething worth far more than our cash awards oh without a doubt kazzop said the recording of her reaction should be both instructive and entertaining he shifted from the language of the race to that of the local big uglies felless waited for the tosevite to shriek and burst into hysterics one of the males whod won money had tried to caress her with his lips she understood it was a gesture of affection among big uglies but the idea almost left her physically ill she hoped this tosevite would not try anything like that to her relief the female big ugly didnt indeed the tosevite hardly showed any emotion at all for a moment when she did speak it was in quiet measured tones kazzop was the one who jerked in astonishment what is going on felless asked him shethe femalesays she cannot accept the prize kazzop sounded as if he couldnt believe the sounds impinging on his hearing diaphragms she asks if we can make a substitution for it you had not planned to do anything of the sort felless said i realize that dealing with big uglies takes unusual flexibility but still find out why she does not want the prize as offered yes that is worth knowing it shall be done kazzop spoke in the local language the big uglys reply sounded hesitant to felless kazzop said she is not altogether forthcoming i gather that such a prize might draw too much notice from the deutsch authorities ah if i were a local big ugly i would not want the deutsch authorities noticing me either felless shuddered at some of the things the deutsche had done does she perhaps follow thewhat is it called the jewish superstition that is it i will not even ask her that kazzop said if she follows it she will lie in any case the deutsche have exterminated most of their jews by now more likely she is a smuggler or other criminalbut she would be unlikely to admit anything of that sort either i wonder if she smuggles ginger felless spoke in musing tones so musing that kazzop sent her a sharp look she wished shed kept quiet sure enough her reputation had preceded her to marseille the big ugly female spoke again this time without waiting for anyone to speak to her she is angry that we have something grand to give her that she cannot take kazzop said she wants to know if we can substitute the cash value for the house this is your project felless said were it mine though i would tell her no i intend to kazzop said doing anything else would exceed my budget he paused then stuck out his tongue to show hed had an idea i will offer her a second prize instead he spoke in the language of the francais the tosevite female replied with considerable warmth what does she say felless asked that we are cheats but that she has no choice but to let herself be cheated kazzop said she accepts with bitterness and anger felless felt a certain sympathy toward the female that was the way shed gone to work in nuremberg after disgracing herself she handed the big ugly the sheaf of printed papers that passed for currency in the greater german reich the tosevite stuffed them into her carrying pouch and hurried away kazzop sighed that was not what i expected but the unexpected also offers valuable insights truth felless said a little scaly devil came up to liu hans hut in the prison camp and spoke to her in bad chinese you come now for the most part the little devils had ignored her since capturing her in the village not far from peking she wished they would have gone on ignoring her since they hadnt she sighed and got to her feet it shall be done she said where are you taking her liu mei asked from atop the kang on which she huddled to get a little warmth not for you to know the scaly devil spoke in chinese even though shed used his language he gestured with his rifle at liu han you come i am coming she said wearily where are you taking me you come you see the scaly devil jerked the business end of his rifle again liu han sighed and left the hut even though she was wearing a quilted cotton jacket the cold the kang held at bay smote with full force when she went outside the little scaly devil let out an unhappy hiss he liked the winter weather even less than she did old dirty snow crunched under her feetand under his he plainly wanted to skitter ahead to annoy him liu han walked as slowly as he would let her maybe he would get frostbitten or catch chest fever she didnt know if little scaly devils could catch chest fever but she hoped so the camp was depressingly large the scaly devils were doing their best to hold china down some of the people theyd scooped up were communists like liu han others kuomintang reactionaries still others men and women of no particular party whom theyd seized more or less at random they didnt even try to keep the communists and kuomintang followers from one anothers throatstheir theory seemed to be that if the humans quarreled among themselves they wouldnt have to do so much work partly because of that the party and the kuomintang did their best to keep a truce going here this building the scaly devil pointed again this time not with his rifle but with his tongue the building toward which he directed liu han stood near the prison camps razorwire perimeter it was not the building where most interrogations were conducted that one lay closer to the center of the camp some of the interrogators were the little devils human running dogs that building had an attached infirmary and a sinister reputation liu han had been there a couple of times no one had done anything too dreadful to her but she was relieved to be going somewhere else even though this building had machine guns mounted on it she thought it was only an administrative center shed never heard of anyone being tortured there when she went inside she opened her jacket and then took it off the place was heated to the scaly devils standard of comfort which meant shed gone from winter to hottest summer in a couple of steps the scaly devil whod fetched her from her hut sighed with pleasure another little devil took charge of her you are the tosevite liu han he asked in his own language knowing she could use it yes superior sir she answered good you will come with me he said liu han did to a chamber that contained nothing but a stool a television camera and a monitor another scaly devil looked out of the monitor presumably seeing her televised image you may sit on the stool her guide told her the little devil with the rifle positioned himself in the doorway to make sure she didnt do anything else her guide folded himself into the posture of respect before the little devil in the monitor saying here is the tosevite female called liu han senior researcher yes i see her that little devil replied he raised his eye turrets so that he seemed to look right at liu han when he spoke again it was in halting chinese you remember me liu han im sorry but i dont she replied in the same language as far as she was concerned one little scaly devil looked very much like another he shrugged just as if he were a person and returned to his own tongue i would not have recognized you either but we spent a lot of time making each other unhappy during the fighting my name is ttomalss i greet you she said not wanting to acknowledge the pang of fear that ran through her the advantage is yours now i did not kill you when i had the chance that was as close as she would come to begging for mercy she bit down on the inside of her lower lip she hoped that was as close as she would come to begging for mercy if ttomalss wanted vengeance for being captured and imprisoned and threatened what could she do to stop him at the moment he seemed mild enough he asked is your hatchlingliu mei was the name you gave her not so well yes liu han answered then she returned to chinese for a sentence she couldnt say in the scaly devils language she never did learn how to smile though you had her too long for that i suppose i did ttomalss said i encountered this same problem with a tosevite hatching i succeeded in raising after you released me i believe it lacks a solution at least for tosevites raised by the race our faces are not mobile enough to give your hatchlings the cues they need to form expressions so you did finally manage to steal another tosevite hatchling liu han said too bad i had hoped i frightened you enough when i captured you to keep you from trying that again somewhere a tosevite female mourns as i mourned when you took liu mei away from me the race needs to conduct this research ttomalss said we must learn how tosevites and the race can get along we must learn what tosevites raised as citizens of the empire are like i know you disapprove but the work is important to usand to everyone on tosev how would you like it if some of us stole your hatchlings from you and tried to raise them as tosevites liu han asked that is what you have done to us you could never do such a thing ttomalss told her you would never do such a thing a project like the one i have undertaken requires far more patience than the usual big ugly has in him liu han wanted to set up a project to steal eggs from the little scaly devils and raise the chicksor whatever one called newly hatched little devilsas if they were human beings she had no idea how to go about it and the little devils had learned a good deal about security since their early days in china so she couldnt get in touch with anyone outside the prison camp anyhow but the urge to take ttomalss down a peg burned in her anyhow as things were she could only say i think you are mistaken i do not ttomalss said calmly liu han glared at him despite what shed done to him years before he had the little devils arrogance in full measure still things could have been worse as long as he was talking with her about hatchlings he wasnt interrogating her about the party of themselves the scaly devils did not go in for painful questioning but now they had chinese stooges who did if they gave her to them when i first studied you i did not think you would rise to become a power in the resistance against the race hereabouts ttomalss said your goals are not admirable but you have shown great strength of character in trying to achieve them i think freedom is admirable liu han said if you do not that is your misfortune not mine there is only one proper place for all the subregions of this planet under the administration of the race ttomalss said in the course of time those subregions will take their proper place freedom is good for the race but not for the big uglies liu han jeered that is what you are saying but ttomalss made the negative hand gesture you misunderstand you tosevites always misunderstand when the conquest is complete tosev will be as free as home as free as rabotev as free as halless you will be contented subjects of the emperor as we are he swung his eye turrets down toward the surface of the desk at which he sat a gesture of respect for the ruler among the little scaly devils i take it back liu han said you do not think freedom is good for anyone even your own kind too much freedom is not good for anyone ttomalss said even your own faction would agree with that seeing how it punishes tosevites who disagree with it in any way this is a revolutionary situation liu han said the communist party is at war with you of course we have to weed out traitors ttomalss let his mouth fall open he was laughing at her i do not believe you i do not even think you believe yourself your faction rules the notempire called the sssr and kills off members regardless of whether they show allegiance to any other power or not you do not understand liu han said but ttomalss understood too well he was liu han recalled a student of the human race in his own fashion liu han had seen purges were sometimes necessary not only to get rid of traitors but also to keep up the energy enthusiasm and alertness of people who didnt get purged do i not the little scaly devil said perhaps you will enlighten me then in his own language he had a fine sarcastic turn of phrase nettled liu han started to answer him in great detail but she bit down on the words before they passed her lips she had seen many years before that ttomalss was a clever little devil he wasnt arguing abstracts with her here he was trying to anger her to make her say things before she thought about them and hed come within a hairsbreadth of succeeding what she did say after checking herself was i have nothing to tell you no too bad the little scaly devil said shall we see whether you have anything to tell me after you watch your hatchling tormented in front of you your strong feelings for your blood kin can be a source of weakness for you you see as well as a source of strength or perhaps the hatchling should watch your interrogation which do you think would produce the better results i have nothing to tell you liu han repeated though she had to force the words out through lips numb with fear one of the things the little scaly devils had learned from mankind was frightfulness just after coming to china they would never have made such a threat and yet ttomalss said in musing tones you did not physically torment me when i was in your power though you could have done so and whether you believe me or not i tried to do my best by your hatching the best i could do at any rate given my limitations because of that ordering the two of you subjected to torment would be unpleasant a little scaly devil with a conscience liu han would not have counted on finding such a bourgeois affectation among the scaly devils but having found it she was more than willing to take advantage of it you are an honorable opponent she said though what was honor but another bourgeois affectation i wish i could say the same of your faction ttomalss replied since acquiring a hatchling to raise i have not been involved with affairs in this subregion you will understand but i did review the record before making arrangements for this interview assassinations sabotage they are the weapons of the weak against the strong liu han said the race is strong if we had landcruisers and explosivemetal bombs we would use them insteadbelieve me we would oh i do believe you ttomalss said you need have no doubt about that the question now remaining is how to make sure you and your hatchling and your male companion can do the race no further harm no matter how hot the chamber was a chill ran through liu han she knew what the party would do under such circumstances liquidation was the word that sprang to mind the little scaly devils had not been in the habit of executing their opponents but they grew more ruthless as time went by that was the dialectic in action too though not in a way that worked to liu hans advantage she stood mute waiting to hear her fate in the end she didnt ttomalss said those who administer the subregion will make the decision there they can take their time no point in haste as long as you are securely confined if i am asked for my input i will tell them that you could have done worse to me than you did thank you for that much liu han said instead of answering ttomalss broke the connection the screen liu han was facing went dark her hopes were dark too the guard gestured with his rifle she pulled on her jacket once more as she followed him out of the building it would be cold out there in the camp she wondered if she would spend the rest of her life behind razor wire find polaris sam yeager muttered peering into the northern sky when he did find the north star he aimed the polar axis of the little refractor barbara had bought him for christmas toward it that would let the equatorial mount follow the stars with only one slowmotion control loosening the tension screws on the rightascension and declination axes he swung the scope itself toward jupiter which glowed yellowwhite in the southwestern sky he sighted along the tube then peered through the finder scope attached to it when he spotted the planet in the finders field he grunted in satisfaction and fumbling a little in the dark tightened the screws so the gears in the slowmotion controls would mesh the knob for the rightascension control was by the telescopes focusing mechanism that for the declination control on a flexible cable using them both he brought jupiter to the meeting point of the finders crosshairs that done he peered into the eyepiece of the main telescopeand there was jupiter fifty times life size he fiddled with the focus he could see three of the four galilean satellites and could also see the cloud bands girdling the planet he thought about switching to an eyepiece with a shorter focal length for a closer look but decided not to bother with only a inch objective lens he wouldnt see that much more hed learned that light grasp was really more important than magnifying power instead he swung the scope toward mars a bloodred star in the east when he found it it looked like a tiny copper coinonly about a third as wide as jupiterin the lowpower eyepiece now he did choose the mm orthoscopic instead of the mm kellnerhe wanted to see everything he possibly could mars got bigger and brighter day by day it was nearing opposition when it would be closest to earth and best suited for observing even at power he couldnt see much the bright polar cap and a dark patch on the red he thought was syrtis major he couldnt see the craters that pocked the planets surface they werent beyond just the reach of his little amateurs instrument no earthbased telescope could make them out he chuckled under his breath no canals either no thoats no fourarmed green men swinging swords no nothing the lizards thought hysterically funny the mars that people like percival lowell and edgar rice burroughs had imagined so did yeagernow when he was a kid though hed devoured burroughs tales of barsoom after hed looked at mars long enough to suit him he turned on a flashlight whose plastic bulb cover hed painted red with barbaras nail polishred light didnt hurt night vision he chuckled again thinking of all the things hed learned in the couple of months since hed got the scope for a present who would have thought idve found myself a hobby at my age he said hed bought himself a nortons star atlas to find out what he could see now that he had the telescope he ran his finger down the listing of double stars gamma leonis he muttered and then nodded the star was bright enough to be easy to spotnot very far from mars at the moment in factand its components were far enough apart for his little refractor to be able to split them a couple of minutes later he softly clapped his hands together there they were the brighter of the pair golden the somewhat dimmer companion a dull red a handsome one he thought taking a pen from his breast pocket he put a check by leonis in the nortons little by little he was learning the greek alphabet one more thing hed never thought hed do that bright moving light in the northern sky was a plane coming in for a landing at los angeles international airport airplane lights coming straight at him had once tricked him into thinking hed discovered a couple of supernovas he knew better now he glanced toward the back of the house the room mickey and donald used was quiet and dark theyd gone to sleep jonathan was still up studying he had had the courtesy to pull down the shade that golden glow didnt bother sams night vision much where raw light from the overhead lamp would have yeager sighed hed hoped jonathan might get interested in astronomy too but no such luck oh the kid had come out and peered through the telescope a couple of times but what he saw didnt excite him sam could tell when jonathan thought of heavenly bodies he didnt think of jupiter or gamma leonishe thought of karen or possibly kassquit i was like that myself once upon a time sam thought he remembered some of the cheap sporting houses hed visited in his minorleague dayscheap because a guy in the bush leagues couldnt afford any better and because a lot of the towns he went through didnt boast any better if he ever found out jonathan was doing anything along those lines hed tan the kids hide for him he recognized his own hypocrisy and didnt feel like doing anything about it do as i say not as i do he clicked on the red light again to check what other double stars he could look for as long as he was out here n hydraea pair of stars of just about sixth magnitude separated by a bit more than nine seconds of arcwas easily within the capacity of his telescope he swung it south from leo splitting n hydrae wouldnt particularly challenge the scope finding it though would challenge him together its stars added up to one fifthmagnitude object in other words it was invisible to the naked eye in the streetlightsaturated sky of los angeles he would have to find a brighter nearby star he could see and then either starhop with the finder or use his setting circles to bring n hydrae into view he decided to starhop setting circles still seemed like black magic to him taking the telescope out to the middle of the back yard so he could see over the eucalyptus tree next door that helped spoil the view to the southeast he realigned the polar axis on polaris then found the battered rectangle of stars that formed the main part of the constellation corvus and then went south and east from the crow toward his target checking his path with the star atlas each step of the way and there by god was the star that had to be n hydrae he turned off the flashlight and worked the slowmotion controls to center it on the finders crosshairs hed just turned away from the finder and bent his head toward the main telescopes eyepiece when a noise from off to one side made him look up someone was scrambling over the fence that separated yeagers yard from the one behind it sam straightened he wished he had his but it was back in the house the intrudera mandropped down into the yard and trotted toward the house he didnt see sam who was partly screened by a lemon tree hed planted a few years before and plainly the intruder wasnt looking for trouble he came past the tree as if he had business to take care of and wanted to get it over with as fast as he could something that wasnt a gun glistened in his right hand hello there yeager said the other fellow stopped as dead as if hed been turned to stone sams darkadapted eyes had no trouble seeing how astonished he looked yeager didnt waste more than an instant on his expression though he took advantage of the frozen surprise hed created and jumped the intruder he got in a left to the face and a right to the belly that made the stranger double up the other fellow tried to fight back after that but never got the chance one of the things the army had taught sam was that fighting fair wasted time and was liable to get you into trouble as soon as he saw the opening he kicked the intruder in the crotch the fellow let out a horrible shriek and dropped the thing hed been holding it was a bottle and it smashed when it hit the grass the stink of gasoline filled yeagers nostrils christ he burst out thats a fucking molotov cocktail just winning the fight suddenly wasnt enough any more the intruder was down on the grass writhing and clutching at himself sam kicked him again this time in the face he groaned and went limp jonathan yeager shouted he stood there in the back yard his heart pounding im too old for this he thought mutt daniels had said that when they went into combat against the lizards sam was as old now as mutt had been then he understood how his exmanager had felt jonathan he yelled again a moment later the back door opened the porch light came on whats up dad jonathan asked blinking against the glare sam pointed to the man hed beaten this son of a bitch was going to try and burn our house down he said barbara would have wanted him to say try to burn right this second he didnt care what his wife would have wanted dont just stand there goddammit throw me some twine so i can tie him and then call the cops right the porch light gleamed off jonathans shaved scalp he went back into the kitchen found a ball of twinegood solid stuff not kite stringand threw it to sam then he disappeared again yeager heard him talking on the phone and to barbara they both came out to see what was going on by then sam had the intruders hands tied behind him and his ankles bound together the mans eyes were open when the police got there jesus christ yeager a cop said looking at the fragments of glass and sniffing the gasoline somebody out there doesnt like you much does he doesnt look that way sam answered now that youve got this guy maybe you can find out who hope so the gardena policeman said lets get him into proper handcuffsgotta look right when we take him to the station you know okay by me yeager said give me a call when you know something will you i want to get to the bottom of this he shook his head i dont know why anybodyd have it in for me but somebody sure does yeah while his partner covered him the cop cut the twine with which sam had bound the intruder and handcuffed him instead then he hauled him to his feet come on pal weve got some talking to do he led him out to the squad car yeager collapsed the legs to the telescope tripod and brought the instrument inside its a good thing you were out there barbara said shivering even though she was wearing a warm housecoat otherwise dont remind me sam stowed the scope on the service porchthe same spot mickey and donalds incubator had once occupied then he poured himself a stiff belt of bourbon after hed downed it he poured another one that let him get some sleep when the gardena police didnt call him for two days he called them sorry sir said the lieutenant to whom his call was passed i can only tell you two things that fellow didnt tell us anything much but we didnt have him long the fbi took charge of him yesterday morning did they sam said nobody tells me anythingthey havent called me for a statement yet either give me their number will you yes sir the police lieutenant said its klondike thanks yeager wrote it down hung up and dialed it when he got the los angeles fbi headquarters he explained who he was and what he wanted to know im sorry sir the fellow on the other end of the line didnt sound sorry he sounded bored im not allowed to release any information on the phone im sure you understand why okay sam suppressed a sigh bureaucrats he thought hed complained about them to kassquit if i come down there and show you who i am will somebody please tell me what the hells going on i dont know anything about that sir the fbi man said and hung up on him when yeager drove downtown he did it in full uniform hoping to overawe the flunkies that workedto a point he got kicked up to a senior inspector named odonohue the irishman looked him over inspected his id and said all i can tell you lieutenant colonel is that weve flown this fellow to little rock for more questioning christ sam said who the hell is he anyway and why wont anybody tell me anything were still trying to find out sir odonohue answered when we do im sure youll be contacted are you i wish i were yeager got to his feet all i see is that im getting the runaround and i wish to hell i knew why odonohue just looked at him and didnt say a word after perhaps half a minute yeager put on his hat and walked out he wondered if anyone would call him nobody did would you believe ttomalss said there are actually times when i wish i were a big ugly in the monitor on his desk felless image drew back in surprise and alarm no i would not believe that she said and used an emphatic cough to show how strongly she disbelieved it by the emperor why would you entertain such a mad desire because our society has trained us for many thousands of years to treat vengeance as undesirable he answered and because i wish i could enjoy taking my vengeance on the tosevite female who kidnapped and imprisoned me during the fighting big uglies still see nothing unfitting in revenge ah felless said that at least i can understand what i would like is vengeance on the male from the conquest fleet who first discovered ginger and i can understand that ttomalss said at least you finally managed to escape from nuremberg this marseille place is not much of an improvement felless said with another emphatic cough and the big uglies here i think may be even more addled than those in nuremberg i even had one female refuse what would be a great reward for a tosevite addled i tell you most likely a criminal or someone else with a good reason not to stick her snout in the air ttomalss said it could be felless said i had wondered about that myself having someone of your experience confirm it is valuable i thank you ttomalss said but he didnt want to talk about things that concerned felless he wanted to go on with his own train of thought revenge is not unknown among us or else shiplord straha would not still be living the life of an exile in the notempire called the united states i doubt fleetlord atvar will ever forgive him i have heard something of this scandal felless said did straha not try to raise a mutiny against the fleetlord not exactlyhe tried to relieve atvar but proved not to have quite enough support among the other fleetlords ttomalss answered but atvar would have punished him as if it were a mutiny i though cannot escape the belief that such efforts at vengeance are wrong i have long been of the opinion that you males of the conquest fleet from continual association with big uglies over so many years have become more like them than is healthy felless said it could be so ttomalss said the converse is that you of the colonization fleet sometimes seem to have no understanding whatever of the realities of life on tosev and the need for certain accommodations with the tosevites we understand more than you think felless replied but you of the conquest fleet do not seem to grasp the difference between understanding and approval approving of what goes on is in many cases impossible we intend to change it good luck ttomalss said and the continual sarcasm of the males of the conquest fleet is not appreciated either felless snapped i bid you farewell she broke the connection ttomalss glared at the blank monitor screen as far as he was concerned felless represented a good part of what had gone wrong with the colonization fleet finding he represented what she thought was wrong with the conquest fleet did nothing to increase his fondness for her he turned to more productive matters calling up a recording of kassquits meeting with the two big uglies from the united states neither the sssr nor the reich had requested similar meetings of course not ttomalss thought annoyed at his own foolishness they do not realize we have a tosevite here reared as if she were part of the race even the big ugly called sam yeager who knew as much about the race as any wild tosevite had discovered that only by listening to kassquits speech but sam yeager interested ttomalss less than jonathan yeager did the experts hatchling might almost have come from the same egg as kassquit true he wore tosevite wrappings but only of a minimal sort he also wore body paint and removed most though not all of his unsightly hair by the way he spoke by the way he acted he did not understand the race quite so well as his father but jonathan yeager was far more acculturated than sam yeager ever would be and what will jonathan yeagers hatchlings be like ttomalss said trusting the computer to record and transcribe his words what will their hatchlings be like little by little the tosevites will come to accept our culture and to prefer it to their own this is the slow route to conquest but it also strikes me as offering far more certainty and security than force given the force the big uglies can use in return the key will be making sure they never wish to use that force and using cultural dominance to gain political dominance he read the transcription of what hed said then made the affirmative gesture yes that made excellent sense he was proud of himself for thinking like a male of the race for remembering the importance of the long term and then rereading his words he was suddenly less pleased the trouble was that on tosev the short term had a way of making the long term obsolete if the big uglies looked as if they were on the point of overtaking the race technologically the planet would go into the fire it might go into the fire anyway if the deutsche or the other notempires acted under the delusion they were stronger than they were and the fire would swallow up the new hopeful colonies too how to keep it from happening slowing the tosevites acquisition of technology would do the job the only problem with that was its impossibility the big uglies either came up with new inventions of their own or started using ideas pirated from the race almost everyday they were transforming their societies at a rate that struck ttomalss as insanely rapid the only other choice he could see was making them not want to use whatever technology they ended up developing that meant making them contented living side by side with the race and eventually making them contented living under the rule of the race and that he thought meant encouraging them to produce more and more acculturated individuals like jonathan yeager ttomalss didnt suppose sam yeagers hatchling gave reverence to the spirits of emperors past but maybe his hatchlings would or their hatchlings we have to find ways to encourage that ttomalss thought the race couldnt use economic incentives in the independent notempires as it could in the territory it presently ruled cultural incentives cultural incentives ttomalss spoke into the computer up until now we have observed young tosevites imitating us they have done this on their own without encouragement from us we mightwe shouldbe able to encourage them the more they are like us the less interest they will have in assailing us he hoped that was true it struck him as logical it was the basis on which hed urged the authorities to promote reverence to the spirits of emperors past in those areas the race did rule that had drawn more resistance than hed expected but everything on tosev proved more difficult than the race expected when the telephone hissed for attention he hissed too in annoyancethe noise had frightened a thought out of his head kassquits image appeared on the monitor i greet you superior sir she said i greet you kassquit he replied i hope you are well i am thank you kassquit touched one of her arms i am certainly better now that i am not being immunized that was a distinctly unpleasant process falling ill and possibly dying would have been even more unpleasant ttomalss pointed out you were vulnerable to illnesses the visiting yeagers might have brought with them i understand that understanding it and liking it are not the same kassquit had become a far more sardonic adult than ttomalss would have expected she went on and the yeagers appear to have brought no illness with them for i have not fallen sick since their visit but you do not know whether you would have fallen sick had you not been immunized ttomalss said he gave kassquit credit after a moments thought his tosevite ward used the affirmative gesture she said no doubt you are right superior sir still now that i have proved i can safely meet them would it be possible for them to come up here again possible certainly though we would have to make arrangements for their transport with the american tosevites i know that kassquit used the affirmative gesture again i hope you will begin making those arrangements whatever they are very well ttomalss said not without a certain pang may i ask why you are so eager for me to do this he tried not to show the worry he could hardly help feeling did blood call to blood more strongly than he had imagined possible did kassquit wish she were an ordinary big ugly on the face of it the notion was absurd but judging anything pertaining to tosevites by first appearances could be deadly dangerous the race had learned that time and again kassquit said their visit will be something out of the ordinary one day here is very much like another this will give me something new to remember something new to think about i see ttomalss said and kassquits explanation was sensible enough it also relieved his mind all right i will see what i can do you understand of course that i cannot do this without approval from my superiors oh yes superior sir that goes without saying kassquit agreed and perhaps if this second meeting proves a success i might eventually visit these big uglies down on the surface of tosev that would truly be an adventure for me would you like to do that now kassquit knew he sounded alarmed he couldnt help himself day by day kassquit became a more autonomous individual ttomalss supposed that was inevitable it happened with hatchlings of the race too but watching it happen was acutely disconcerting i would kassquit said with an emphatic cough i have been thinking about this how can i be a bridge between the empire and the independent big uglies if i do not reach to them as they reach to me up until now they have done the accommodating ttomalss reminded her if you went down there you would have to do some of your own they would probably require you to wear cloth wrappings for instance to conform to their customs that would also be something new for me kassquit said sounding as enamored of novelty as any american big ugly she added and wrappings would help keep me warm would they not the surface of tosev is supposed to be a chilly place you have all the answers i see ttomalss said wryly let us discover how a second meeting goes before planning a third if that suits you to his relief kassquit didnt argue nesseref was very pleased with how smoothly shed brought her shuttlecraft out of its suborbital trajectory it took much less atmospheric buffeting than usual on the way down toward the port outside cairo as the braking rockets ignited she was thinking about how she could enjoy the layover at the races administrative center from what she remembered of the transient barracks she might have trouble enjoying it at all her passenger a regional subadministrator from china named ppevel was looking forward to the arrival by the spirits of emperors past he said it will be good to come to a place where the climate is close to decent i have been cold for what seems like forever so have i superior sir nesseref replied poland in winter reminds me of nothing so much as an enormous openair freezer ppevel started insisting china had to be colder before nesseref could argue with himand she intended to because she had trouble imagining any place colder than polanda puff of black smoke and a loud bang outside the shuttlecraft distracted her another puff and bang closer were followed by metallic clatters as shell fragments struck the shuttlecraft a warning light on the instrument panel came on what is that noise ppevel asked ignoring him nesseref shouted into the radio microphone cairo base cairo base we are under attack cairo base she felt like a perfect target hanging up there too she couldnt interrupt the computercontrolled descent sequence not unless she wanted to try to land manually by eye turret and by guess she wondered if she ought to she might pilot the shuttlecraft right into the ground but she might also make it harder to shoot down before she could hit the override switch a voice came out of the radio speaker shuttlecraft pilot we have the tosevite terrorists under assault maintain your present trajectory it shall be done nesseref said as another shell burst all too close to the shuttlecraft more fragments struck the machine another hit like that and i disobey orders she thought but only one more antiaircraft shell exploded this one farther away the descent after that went as well as if no one had been shooting at her she spied helicopters racing toward the spot from which she presumed the antiaircraft gun was firing ppevel said i have also been under fire in china the more often one endures it the easier it is to bear i have been under fire too nesseref answered i do not think i will ever come to enjoy it sheand the computerput the shuttlecraft down in the middle of the landing port a vehicle hurried across the wide concrete expanse to meet the shuttlecraft it was not the usual motorcar but a mechanized combat vehicle the big uglies will have to work hard to destroy that machine ppevel observed truth nesseref said but seeing the combat vehicle did not reassure her if the race sent it out to bring ppeveland incidentally herselfinto cairo that meant there was some risk to them both i thank you for a job well done the regional subadministrator told her you are welcome superior sir nesseref didnt say the computer had done the work with her along as little more than an organic emergency backup shed almost had to take over the controls of the shuttlecraftthis was as close as shed ever come to doing just that had her luck been a little worse but she didnt care to think about that if you like i will go first and attract whatever gunfire may be waiting for us that will not be necessary though i do appreciate the thought behind it ppevel said he unstrapped himself and went down the ladder with easy haste that showed hed flown in a good many shuttlecraft before no one shot at him the helicopters now buzzing around the port must have suppressed that tosevite gun nesseref followed him out of the shuttlecraft a male in helmet and body armor said into the vehicle do not waste time i was not wasting time nesseref said indignantly make sure this shuttlecraft is well repaired it took damage from the shells that exploded nearby had they cut a fuel or oxygen line the craftand my passenger and iwould be scattered all over this port it shall be done superior female the trooper lowered his voice as he went on would you like a taste of ginger that would make you feel better no nesseref used an emphatic cough if i had a taste of ginger you would feel better which is what you have in mind pheromones are in the air the male admitted but i did not mean it like that of course you did nesseref told him if you do not mention the herb again i will not have to learn your name and report you she pushed past the male and into the mechanized combat vehicle glumly he followed she repeated her warning about the damage the shuttlecraft had taken to the driver who relayed it by radio to the ground crew males and females at the shuttlecraft port nesseref relaxed a little after hearing him do that a couple ofrocks and a glass bottle hit the combat vehicle as it rolled through the insanely crowded streets of cairo ppevel took that in stride the same thing happens in china well it does not happen in cities in poland nesseref said the big uglies there are much better behaved why i even invited one of them and his hatchling to supper at my apartment and the evening proved quite pleasant i have heard about poland ppevel answered i must say i believe it to be a special case the big uglies in that subregion find their tosevite neighbors more unpleasant than they find us and so look to us to protect them against those neighbors that does not hold true either in china or here i wish it did it would make our rule much easier remembering conversations with veteran administrators in poland nesseref realized she had to yield the point and did you are probably right superior sir right or wrong ppevel got better accommodations than she did the mechanized combat vehicle took him to the races administrative center which had been a luxurious tosevite hotel before the conquest fleet arrived and had since been thoroughly modernized after he went inside the vehicle took nesseref to the barracks for visiting males and females some little distance away you will be quartered in the hall to the left the females hall the officer in charge of the barracks said pointing with his tongue barracks separated by sex nesseref exclaimed i never heard of such a thing you will hear more of it in the future superior female the officer said because of the tosevite herb we have had enough unfortunate incidents to reckon such segregation the wiser policy nesseref thought about that if a female who tasted ginger was liable to come into season at any time and if a male inflamed by some other females pheromones was liable to give a female ginger to provoke mating behavior in her nesseref made the affirmative gesture i see the need the barracks were as depressing as such places usually were none of the females with whom she spoke knew anyone she knew none of them was from the same region of home as she was most of them appeared more interested in watching the video on a large wall monitor than in any sort of conversation one who did feel like talking had a definite goal in mind do you have any ginger she asked nesseref i do not nesseref answered sharply i do not want any either ginger is more trouble than it is worth nonsense the other female said and tacked on an emphatic cough ginger is the only thing that makes this miserable accursed planet worth inhabiting without it i would just as soon have stayed in cold sleep i think your wits did stay in cold sleep nesseref said how much trouble have you caused by broadcasting your pheromones far and wide how many clutches of eggs have you laid because of the nasty herb only one the female said sounding altogether unconcerned and i placed no burden whatever on the race in doing so of course you did nesseref told her someone is now raising the hatchlings who came from those eggs no one from the race the other female remained blithe as soon as i laid my clutch i sold the eggs to some big uglies who wanted them those hatchlings are their worry not the races you did what nesseref could imagine depravity but such utter indifference was beyond her comprehension by the emperor what would tosevites do with hatchlings what would they do to hatchlings i do not know and i do not much care the other female said i do know that i got enough ginger for the eggs to keep me happy for a long time but now i have gone through it all and i wish i had some more disgraceful nesseref said i ought to report you to the authorities go ahead the female said go right ahead i will deny everything how do you propose to prove any of this whatsoever nesseref had no good answer for that however much she wanted one she turned both eye turrets away from the other female as if denying her the right to exist the direct insult did what she wanted the other females toeclaws clicked on the hard floor as she went away the almost equally hard cot on which nesseref slept wasnt the only reason she passed a restless uncomfortable night she had an uncomfortable flight back to poland too shed expected the local big uglies to stone the vehicle that took her to the airfield and they did had that been all she would have accepted it as an ordinary nuisance and thought little more about it but it wasnt allfar from it as soon as her aircraft entered the reichs air space a deutsch killercraft met it and kept pace with it so close that nesseref could seethe big ugly in the cockpit of the lean deadly looking machine had he chosen to launch missiles or use his cannon he could have shot down the aircraft in which she flew as easily as he pleased he didnt when the aircraft left the reich and flew into polish air space the deutsch tosevite peeled off and went back to one of his own airbases but even the deutsche had not offered such provocations for a long time nesseref was very happy indeed when her machine rolled to a stop outside of warsaw and she got off living in lodz not far from the eastern border of the greater german reich meant mordechai anielewicz could receive german television programming speaking yiddish and having studied german in school he understood the language well enough that didnt mean he turned his receiver to the channels coming from the reich very often football games were worth watching the germans and the nations subject to them fielded some fine clubs but the interminable nazi propaganda shows ranged from boring to savagely offensive since himmlers death though mordechai had started paying more attention to german propaganda hed never imagined he would miss the ss chief and fuhrer whod done the jews so much harm with something approaching horror he realized he did himmler had been a known quantitya known mamzer much of the time certainly but not someone who was likely to go off halfcocked the committee of eight on the other hand look at this anielewicz exclaimed his wife came over to the sofa in front of the television and dutifully looked mordechai pointed at the clumsylooking panzers with crosses painted on them rolling across the screen do you see what theyre doing bertha looks like another war film to me she answered with a yawn may i go back and finish the dishes now well it is anielewicz clicked his tongue between his teeth but i dont like it when they start showing films about invading poland its liable to mean theyre gearing up to try it again they wouldnt bertha said they have to know theyll get smashed if they try if theyve got any sense they have to know that mordechai answered but who says theyve got any sense when they start going on about provocations and insults what are they doing but getting their people ready for trouble thats what they did in after all on the screen the german panzers mowed down charging polish lancers wearing square hats bertha said it wont be that easy this time if theyre meshuggeh enough to try again you know that i know that i think even himmler knew that anielewicz said from what ive heard the lizards warned him off not so long ago and he listened to them but these fools he shook his head what can we do bertha asked that was more easily asked than answered i dont know mordechai said unhappily i know what id like to doid like to put jewish fighters on alert and id like to get in touch with the poles too so i know theyll be ready to move in case the nazis really do intend to go after us here will the poles listen to you his wife asked anielewicz shrugged i dont know that either as far as theyre concerned what am i just a damned jew thats all but they certainly wont listen to me if i dont get in touch with them his smile looked cheerful but wasnt gottenyu i dont even know if the jews in warsaw will pay any attention to me as far as theyre concerned poland is warsaw and the rest of the country can geh in drerd but you came from warsaw berthas voice quivered with indignation ive been away a long timeplenty long enough for them to forget where i came from mordechai replied his laugh didnt sound amused either of course with some of those people you can walk around the corner for a loaf of bread and theyll forget about you by the time you get back ingrates thats what they are bertha made a wife as loyal as any man could want she was also a long way from a fool asking do you suppose theyve forgotten about the explosivemetal bomb no theyll remember that mordechai admitted im the one who wishes he could forget about it he went into the kitchen and came back with a couple of glasses of slivovitz sipping from one he handed bertha the other i dont know if it will work and god forbid i should ever have to find out if you do it wont be the only explosivemetal bomb going off will it bertha asked when anielewicz shook his head she knocked back her plum brandy like a farm laborer she said that wont be all that happens either oh no poison gas and panzers and who can say what all else anielewicz poured down his brandy too the other thing id better do is id better talk with bunim im about as happy with that as i am with a trip to the dentist and that lizard loves me every bit as much as i love him but if were going to fight on the same side wed better have some notion of what well be trying to do that makes good sense his wifes mouth twisted of course if the whole world goes mad whether or not anything makes sense stops mattering very much doesnt it before mordechai could answer her the telephone rang he walked over to the shabby end table on which it sat and picked it up everything in the flat was shabby other peoples handmedowns charity after the arson fire that had forced the anielewiczes from the building where theyd lived so long hello he said and then spent the next ten minutes in intense conversation some in yiddish some in polish when he hung up his wife asked was that warsaw have they decided they need to worry about the reich after all he shook his head in some bemusement no you would have thought so from the way i was talking wouldnt you that was the armia krajowa the polish home army they want to cooperate with us even if the learned fellows back in warsaw havent figured out theres anybody to cooperate against the poles want to cooperate with us bertha sounded astonished mordechai didnt blame her he was astonished himself her gaze sharpened youd better go see bunimdo it first thing tomorrow morning too if you dont get there ahead of the home army who knows how much mischief the poles may be able to stir up youre right mordechai said at once you always were the best politician we ever had in lodz feh bertha tossed her head a most dismissive gesture you dont need to be a politician to see this as long as youre not blind its there with tea warm inside him with his greatcoat pulled tight around him anielewicz strode through snowclogged streets to the races administrative offices overlooking the bialut market square as soon as the lizards let him in he shed the coat folded it and carried it over his arm the race kept their buildings heated not only to but past the point humans found pleasantly warm that bunim was willing to see him with essentially no advance notice told him the lizards were worried about the greater german reich too i greet you regional subadministrator mordechai said in the language of the race good day bunim answered in fair polish the human language he spoke best was german neither he nor anielewicz seemed to want to use it now having politely used a human language the lizard went back to his own and what is it you want to see me about what do you suppose mordechai answered the increasing threat from the reich of course do you not agree that we will be better off if we prepare joint action well in advance of any certain need more often than not bunim looked down his snout at the idea of cooperating with humans now though he said only yes that might be wise what sort of notions do you have for unifying your forces those of the armia krajowa and our own to withstand whatever attacks may come from the west and south mordechai anielewicz stared at him you do take these threats seriously he blurted yes bunim said and underscored that with an emphatic cough you know as well as i that the deutsche can destroy this region we cannot prevent it we can only make it unpleasantly expensive you are blunt about it mordechai said truth is what truth is the regional subadministrator answered we do not change it by turning our eye turrets away from it tosevites sometimes seem to have trouble understanding this the deutsche for example see that they can overrun and wreck poland they refuse to see the price they will pay for doing so if you have any suggestions for getting the point across to them i would be grateful i am the wrong tosevite to ask i fear anielewicz said as you know the only thing that would delight the deutsche is my death i do not know how to dissuade them or if anyone or anything can dissuade them what i wanted to plan with you was how best to fight them i understand bunim said talks are also ongoing with your colleagues in warsaw and with the various polish tosevite factions had you not come to me i would have called you in a few days would you that surprised anielewicz too after all the time you have spent saying that big uglies have no place in the defense of poland bunim made the affirmative gesture you too are a leader mordechai anielewicz have you never had to hold a position with which you did not personally agree have circumstances never forced you to change a position many times mordechai admitted but i did not think it would also be so for the race strange things hatch from strange eggs bunim said which sounded as if it ought to be a proverb among the race something on the order of politics make strange bedfellows the regional subadministrator went on if you can bring the forces under your control to full alert i will be in touch with you on ways in which we can integrate them into the defense of this region is it agreed it is agreed anielewicz said but then he held up a forefinger it is agreed with the exception of our explosivemetal bomb that stays under our control no one elses as you wish bunim said which more than anything else told mordechai how worried the lizards were if you have this weapon i trust you will use it against the deutsche who are your most important foes i bid you good day good day mordechai said accepting the dismissal more meekly than hed dreamt he would still almost dazed he went outside a nondescript little man fell into step beside him somehow that left him unsurprised too he nodded almost as if to an old friend hello nussboym what brings you back to lodz trouble with the naziswhat else david nussboym answered his yiddish flavored these days by all the years hed spent in the soviet union he looked up at mordechai who was perhaps ten centimeters taller and im not so sorry as i was that we didnt quite manage to knock you off either that you anielewicz stopped in his tracks i ought to but you wont nussboym said you know damned well you wont weve got the germans to worry about first right the worst of it was mordechai had to nod david goldfarb had thought ottawas climate unfortunate as a matter of fact he hadnt just thought ithed been right but compared to the weather edmonton enjoyedor rather didnt enjoyottawa might as well have been the earthly paradise blizzards came down off the rockies one after another only some truly amazing machinery kept the city from coagulating for days at a time after a storm swept through but of all the places in the dominion of canada this was the one where electronics were booming and so it was the place to which goldfarb had moved his family once he was finally able to move them anywhere escaping from the detention center near the ministry of defense felt so good he was willing to overlook a few minor deficiencies in the weather as he crunched through snow on his way to work he did wonder why edmonton of all places had become canadas electronic heartland one answer readily springing to mind was that it was the most northerly big city canada boasted and so the one least likely to attract the lizards attention he almost got killed when he crossed rd street while walking along jasper avenue he was still in the habit of looking right first when crossing the streetbut canadians like their american cousins to the south drove on the right they drove big american cars too the chevrolet that came to a halt with blasting horn and a rattle of tire chains probably could have smashed the life out of goldfarb without even getting dented he sprang back up onto the curb sorry he said with a weak smile the fellow whod almost run him down couldnt have heard him the chevys windows were all up to give the heater a fighting chance the car rolled on on his second try goldfarb got across rd street without nearly committing suicide he made a point of looking left first when he made a point of it he had no trouble when he didnt he acted from habit and habit didnt work here the saskatchewan river widget works ltd operated out of a secondfloorgoldfarb would have called it a firstfloorsuite of offices on jasper near nd street the name of the firm had drawn him even before he had the faintest notion what a widget was the short answer was that it was anything some ingenious engineer said it was he shed his overcoat with a sigh of relief hello goldfarb said hal walsh the ingenious engineer whod founded the firm isnt it a lovely day out if youre a polar bear possibly goldfarb said otherwise no walsh and several other engineers all of them edmontonians jeered at him they took their beastly climate for granted goldfarb used to something approaching moderation in his weather didnt and couldnt he jeered back one of the engineers an alarmingly clever young fellow named jack devereaux said its bracing thats what it is puts hair on your chest fur would do better goldfarb retorted and im sure the eskimos up at the north pole say the same thing jack thats only a couple of miles outside of town isnt it we could go and check for ourselves the chaffing went on as he fixed himself a cup of tea and got to work hed thought that coming out of the raf he would know more about electronics than these civilians did it hadnt worked out like that they took lizard technology for granted in ways he didnt but youll learn walsh had told him not unkindly a few days after he was hired the difference is the militaryyours mine everybodyshas spent the past twenty years grafting the lizards technology onto our own to keep some sort of continuity with what we had before well of course said goldfarb whod watched that happenand whod helped make it happen how else would you go about it junk what we had before his new boss had answered the more we steal from the race the more we develop what weve stolen from the race the better the widgets we come up with that other stuff that stuff we used to have all belongs in the museumwith buggy whips and gas lamps and whalebone corsets goldfarb hadnt thought of it like that he didnt care to think of it like that but the saskatchewan river widget works came up with gadgets he wouldnt have imagined possible in his long years with the raf the one that hooked up a little electronic gizmoadapted from one the lizards usedto a battery hardly biggerstolen from a lizard patternto make a childrens book that included sound effects when the right buttons were pressed left him shaking his head he wasnt surprised to find it had been jack devereauxs idea hardly seems right to use all that fancy technology for something to keep threeyearolds happy for a few hours he remarked why not devereaux asked around a big mouthful of lunchtime sandwich thats what this stuff is for for heavens sake the military uses are all very well but the lizards live with these electronics every minute of the day and night they make their lives better they make them more interesting they make them more fun too they can do the same for us he sounded very sure of himself like a missionary spreading the word of god to the benighted heathen and the longer goldfarb thought about it the more convinced he was that the brash young engineer had a point britain had been a garrison state arming itself to the teeth against the lizardsand incidentally to make sure the reich stayed friendly ally and mentor not conqueror canada was different shielded by the usa from danger at the hands of the race canadians could as devereaux said have fun with the new technology they could and they did sitting there at a drawing board with bins of electronic parts all around for him to play with goldfarb had to work at the notion that having fun was all right that he wasnt betraying mankind by not working on some weapon that would make every lizard on earth shrivel up and turn purple designing a little plastic top that lit up and played music when you spun it struck him as absurdly frivolous when he said as much hal walsh gave him an odd look and asked are you sure youre not a protestant goldfarb snorted im not sure of a great many things but thats one of them well okay his boss laughed but look at it from a different angle suppose you took that top youre working on back to your radar station in suppose you spun it on the floor there and it did what its supposed to do what would your chums have thought of it what would you have thought of it back then hmm goldfarb rubbed his chin the battery would have been impossible the sound square would have been impossible the light and the plastic would just have been improbable offhand id say wed have thought the martians had landed you wouldnt have been so far wrong either would you walsh laughed some more now suppose you gave it to your father when he was a little boy what would his mother and father have thought back in warsaw before the turn of the century goldfarb thought about that jews dont burn people at the stake for witchcraft but thats about the only thing that would have kept me in one piece he got another chuckle from walsh but he hadnt been joking his boss was about to say something more when the telephone by goldfarbs table rang walsh waved and went off goldfarb picked up the phone before he could even say hello the fellow on the other end of the line announced its not over yet you may think its over but its not what goldfarb said who is this who do you suppose the caller answered we dont forget we do get even youll find out the line went dead goldfarb stared at the phone for a moment then put the handset back in its cradle who was that walsh asked you look like you just saw a ghost maybe i did goldfarb said he waited for his boss to ask more questions but walsh surprised him by doing nothing of the kind but turning away and going back to his own work an englishman might have done that but goldfarb hadnt expected it on this side of the atlantic from all the american films hed seen people over here were a lot more brash about sticking their noses into other peoples business after a moment he realized american films came out of the united states not canada the canadians whod grilled him had done it out of duty not because they were personally nosy the reserve wasnt quite so strong as the notorious british stiff upper lip but it was there he got back to work waiting all the while for the phone to ring again that was how these things worked wasnt it the bad eggs played on their victims fear and sometimes managed to drive him round the bend without even doing anything to him and sure as the devil the phone did ring again half an hour later when goldfarb picked it up all he heard on the other end was silence he listened for a little while then hung up nobodyd drive him round the bend by god but someone had made a good start on getting his goat somebody he had no idea who though whoever it was had to be a canadian pal of basil roundbushs suddenly he grinned and turned to hal walsh mr widget sir walsh grinned back at your service mr goldfarb and what can i do for you today youre in the widget business goldfarb said can you tell me if anyones ever invented a widget that shows the number a telephone call is made from a fast and easy kind of tracer you mean walsh asked something better than the police and the telephone company use goldfarb nodded thats what im talking about shouldnt be too hard not if we put some of the lizards informationprocessing gadgets on the job suppose you could see at a glance it was your brotherinlaw on the other end of the line and you didnt want to talk to him because you owed him twenty quiduh fifty dollars itd be handy youre right it would if walsh was wondering why goldfarb chose this exact moment to ask about that invention he didnt let on and no i dont think anything like that is on sale now and yes i can see how it might be popular he looked past goldfarb or maybe through him i can see how you might do it too so can i goldfarb said excitement kindling in him roundbushs nasty friends might have thought they were putting a scare in him but with a little luck theyd just gone a long way toward making him a rich man he started bouncing ideas off his boss who also had some good ones of his own goldfarb was a tinkerer and largely selftaught hal walsh understood more about theory than he would if he lived to be ninety both men started scribbling notes after the first couple of minutes after half an hour goldfarb was hoping the nasty boys would call back again and do it soon once he had their telephone number he could pass it on to the police then theyd be out of his hair for good from an office full of people who thought the same way he did everything looked very simple when the telephone rang kathe drucker answered it after a moment she turned and said its for you hans who johannes drucker asked setting down his newspaper and getting to his feet his wife shrugged as if to say it wasnt anybody she knew drucker tried to hide his worries as he walked to the phone if that damned gunther grillparzer was raising more trouble if grillparzer was doing that hed just have to deal with it as best he could he took the phone from kathe drucker here your leave is canceled said a crisp voice on the other end of the line all leaves are canceled by order of the committee of eight report to your duty station at peenemunde immediately jawohl drucker said fighting the urge to come to attention the line went dead he hung up the telephone what is it kathe askedshe could see it was something when he told her her eyes went wide does that mean what im afraid it means that the balloons going up on account of poland he asked and she nodded he answered the only way he could with a shrug i dont know no one tells me anything ill say thisi hope not but whether it is or not i have to report in he raised his voice heinrich what is it father his elder sons reply floated down from upstairs keep an eye on your brother and sister for a while i have to report to the base and your mother will come along so she can drive the car back here have you got that yes father heinrich said and then asked essentially the same question kathe had will it be war the difference was he sounded excited not afraid hes too young to know better drucker thought remembering how enthusiastic a hitler youth hed made at the same age not much later hed gone into the wehrmacht and hed been there ever since did that mean he didnt know better either maybe it did he had no time to worry about it now reliable no matter how ugly it was the volkswagen roared to life right away drucker didnt want to think about what he would have done if it hadnt started called for a taxi he supposedan order to report immediately meant that and nothing else no one cared about excuses the idea was that there shouldnt be any drucker drove out of greifswald and east across the flat muddy ground toward peenemunde he cursed every car that got in his way at the barbedwire perimeter around the base he showed the sentries his identification card they shot out their arms in salute and let him by he stopped in front of the barracks where he spent almost as much time as he did with his family when he jumped out of the volkswagen he started to take the keys with him kathe coughed reproachfully feeling foolish drucker left the keys alone his wife got out too to come around to the drivers side he took her in his arms and kissed her he wasnt the only soldier doing such things the road in front of the barracks was clogged with stopped cars and men saying goodbye to wives and sweethearts kathe got back into the vw and drove away drucker hurried into the barracks and threw on the uniform that hung in the closet whats up he called to another space flier who was dressing with as much frantic haste as he damned if i know his comrade answered whatever it is though it cant be good id bet on that not with me you wouldnt because i think youre right drucker told him they hurried toward the administrative center drucker looked at his wristwatch less than half an hour had gone by since the telephone rang he couldnt get in trouble for being late not when hed had to come from greifswald could he he resolved to raise a big stink if anyone complained no one did he checked off his name on the duty roster and hurried into the auditorium to which soldiers in militarypolice metal gorgets were directing people the auditorium was already almost full even though hed done everything as fast as he could he remained a latecomer he slid into a chair near the back of the hall and shot disapproving glances at the men who came in after him general dornberger stepped up onto the stage even from his distant seat drucker thought the commandant at peenemunde looked worried he couldnt have been the only man who thought so either the buzz in the hail rose abruptly then died as dornberger held up his hand for quiet soldiers of the reich our beloved fatherland is in danger dornberger said into that silence in their arrogance the lizards in poland have attempted to impose limits on our sovereignty the first step toward bringing the reich under their rule the committee of eight has warned them that their demands are intolerable to a free and independent people but they have paid no attention to our just and proper protests he building up toward a declaration of war drucker thought ice ran through him he knew the reich could hurt the race but probably better than any man whod never been into space he also know what the race could do to the reich he felt like a dead man walking the only hope he had for his familys survival was the wind blowing the fallout from peenemunde out to sea or toward poland rather than onto greifswald ashes to ashes dust to dust no state of war as yet exists between the greater german reich and the race dornberger went on but we must show the lizards that we are not to be intimidated by their threats and impositions accordingly the reich is now formally placed on a footing of kriegsgefahr because of this war danger order the armed forces are being brought to a maximum alertwhich is why you are here it wont happen right this minute then drucker thought thank god for so much his wasnt the only soft sigh of relief in the auditorium if the worst should befall we shall not stand alone general dornberger said the governments of hungary and romania and slovakia stand foursquare behind us as loyal allies should and we have also received an expression of support and best wishes from the british government that mixed good news and bad of course the allies stood by the reich if they didnt theyd fall over and in a hurry too if england really was supporting germany that was good news very good indeed the english were bastards but they were tough bastards no two ways about it but dornberger hadnt said a word about finland and sweden what were they doing sitting on their hands drucker thought hoping that when the axe falls it doesnt land on their necks sitting where they were he might have done the same thing that didnt mean he was happy they were staying quietfar from it but they had a better chance of coming through an allout exchange between the race and the reich in one piece than a place like greifswald did damn them we are going to put as many men into space as fast as we can the commandant said once up there they will await orders or await developments if we down here fall they shall avenge us heil he broke off looking confused for a moment he couldnt say heil himmler any more and heil the committee of eight sounded absurd but he found a way around the difficulty heil the reich heil along with everyone else in the hall drucker gave back the acclamation and no doubt along with everyone else he wondered what would happen next the enormous roar of an a blasting off penetrated the auditoriums soundprooflng sure enough the reich wasnt wasting any time getting its pieces on the board so it could play them those upper stages wouldnt do germany any good if they got destroyed on the ground have we got a schedule yet for whos going into orbit when drucker asked hoping someone around him would know a couple of people said no a couple of others laughed somebody remarked the way things are right now were damned lucky we know which side were on that brought a couple of more laughs and told drucker everything he needed to know he wondered why everyone had been summoned so urgently if things were no better organized than this we might as well be frenchmen he thought scornfully major neufeld pushed through the crowd toward him general dornbergers adjutant looked dyspeptic even when he was happy when he wasnt as now he looked as if he belonged in the hospital drucker he called urgently drucker waved to show hed heard what is it he asked whatever it was he would have bet it wasnt anything good had it been good neufeld would have left him alone to do his job just as the dour major was doing with everyone else sure enough neufeld said the commandant wants to see you in his office right this minute jawohl drucker obeyed without asking why that was the army way asking why wouldnt have done him any good anyhow he knew that only too well several people gave him curious looks as he left the auditorium hardly anyone knew why hed had runins with higherups but practically everyone knew that hed had them reporting as ordered sir he said when he got to dornbergers office come in drucker walter dornberger took a puff on one of the fat cigars he favored then set it in the ashtray sit down if you care to thank you sir as drucker sat he wondered if the commandant was going to offer him a blindfold and a cigarette next dornberger was usually brusque today he seemed almost courtly drucker asked whats up sir hed been asking that since he got to peenemunde if anyone knew if anyone would tell him the commandant was the man dornberger picked up the cigar looked at it and set it down without putting it in his mouth in conversational tones he remarked i wish field marshal manstein were as good a politician as he is a soldier do you drucker asked nothing at all in his voice he didnt need a road map to see where that led the ss is in charge of the committee of eight and the party and goebbels lapdogs general dornberger answered manstein knows better than to provoke the lizards or i assume he does thisthis is madness we can defend ourselves against the race yes certainly but win an offensive struggle anyone who has dealt with them knows better yes sir drucker said why was the commandant telling him this most likely because no one in authority trusted him which in an odd sort of way made him safe anyone whos been in space knows what theyve got up there thats for sure of course dornbergers nod was jerky yes of course and that brings me to the main reason i called you here lieutenant colonel changes in the alignment of the committee of eight affect more than the broad foreign policy of the reich i must tell you that you will not be allowed into space during this crisis i am sorry but you are reckoned to be politically unreliable drucker supposed he should have expected that but it hit like a blow in the belly even so bitterly he asked why bother calling me here then i might as well have stayed at home with my family we could all die together then ran through his mind why because i am still working to get the restriction lifted i know what a good man you are in space regardless of your troubles on the ground dornberger answered meanwhile you may be lucky you know if were all lucky none of this will matter wed better be drucker got up and walked out without bothering to ask for permission normally that was as close to lese majesty as made no difference today general dornberger said not a word they are serious vyacheslav molotov sounded indignant that in its own way was a prodigy andrei gromyko knew as much his shaggy eyebrows twitched in astonishment molotov was so agitated he hardly noticed the germans are serious i tell you andrei andreyevich so it would seem the foreign commissar answered you already told them we wanted no part of this madness past that what can we do prepare as best we can to have the western regions of the soviet union devastated by radioactive fallout molotov answered past that we can do nothing we are one of the four greatest powers on the face of the earth and above it and we can do nothing against stupidity the very gods themselves contend in vain from a convinced marxistleninist that was almost blasphemy it was also a telling measure of molotovs agitation perhaps even more telling than raising his voice gromyko understood as much nodding he commented and it was a german who said those words he knew his people all too well was it molotov had long since forgotten the source of the quotation well whoever it was we are about to watch all of europe west of our border go into the fire and the only thing we can do is stand back and watch gromyko lit a cigarette after a couple of meditative drags he said we could go in on the side of the reich that is the only action we have available to us the lizards will not want our assistance no we would only ruin ourselves by joining the germans i can see that molotov said but damn it we need the reich can you imagine me saying such a thing i can hardly imagine it but its true we need every single counterbalance to the lizards we can find without the nazis mankind is weaker he grimaced hating the words i agree with you vyacheslav mikhailovich gromyko said unfortunately yes unfortunately molotov said i have sent certain operatives into poland to give us contacts with the human groups there i do not know how much good that will do or whether it can do anything to minimize the destruction war will bring but i am making the effort he had control of himself again he hated giving way to alarm but there was so much about which to be alarmed here let us hope it will help gromyko didnt sound as if he thought it would molotov didnt really think it would either but david nussboym had volunteered for the mission and molotov let him go he owed nussboym a debt without the jewish nkvd man beria would surely have liquidated him before marshal zhukov put paid to the spymasters coup and if the worst did happen in poland odds were that nussboym wouldnt come back to claim any more payments on that debt molotov made such calculations almost without conscious thought gromyko said the americans are concerned about this crisis too do you suppose president warren can get the germans to see reason the nazis do not automatically hate and disbelieve the united states as they do with us i have had consultations with the american ambassador but they were less satisfactory than i would have liked molotov answered i could be wrong but i have the feeling the usa would not be sorry to see the reich removed from the scene the americans of course would suffer far less incidental damage from a conflict over poland than would we they are shortsighted though having the reich on the board strengthens all of humanity as you said comrade general secretary gromyko was not going to contradict his boss molotov remembered trembling when hed had to try to steer stalin away from a course whose danger was obvious to everyone but the great leader molotov knew he wasnt so frightful as stalin had been but even so his foreign commissar sighed i dont suppose they would be americans if they were not shortsighted they also would not be americans if they did not seek to profit from others misfortunes molotov said before the lizards came they were happy enough to send us aid against the nazis but how many soldiers in american uniform did you see none we did the dying for them as stalin had he remembered that remembered and resented it like stalin hed been unable to avenge it gromyko said if the americans will not act if the nazis will not heed us what about the lizards themselves have they not warned the reich of the dangers inherent in its provocative course i am given to understand that they have molotov said but telling a german something and getting him to listen are two quite different things he drummed his fingers on the polished wood desktop in front of him do you suppose we might be able to suggest ways in which the race might gain the nazis attention i dont know gromyko answered but at this point what have we got to lose molotov considered nothing whatever we might even worm our way into the good graces of the race a good suggestion if i say so myself i shall arrange a meeting with queek the ease with which he arranged the meeting told him the lizards were grasping at straws too and the polish interpreter for the races ambassador to the soviet union showed none of his usual toploftiness plainly he was worried about what might happen to his homeland queek gave forth with a series of hisses and pops and coughs the interpreter turned them into rhythmic polishaccented russian the ambassador says he is grateful for your good offices comrade general secretary and welcomes any suggestions you have on how to keep this crisis from hatching into fullscale conflict tell him that the best way to make sure the germans do not attack is to convince them they have no hope of winning molotov answered they do respect strength if nothing else that is not apparent in the present situation queek said we have repeatedly warned them what will happen if they attack poland they cannot help but know the strength at our command and yet to all appearances they continue preparations to attack i am baffled the race is baffled if the reich breaks the truce that has held so long we shall not be gentle i understand had molotov been in queeks position he would have said the same thing but he wasnt and he didnt like the position he was in he went on my own concern is not least related to the damage a conflict over poland will cause to the peaceloving people of the soviet union who do not deserve to be sacrificed because of the folly of others queek shrugged as if he were a man i am not responsible for the geography of tosev he said if your notempire does not provoke us we shall do it no direct harm what we need to do to defeat and punish the reich however that i assure you we shall do again molotov might have said the same thing in the same position again he didnt like hearing it he cast about for ways to head off the catastrophe he saw looming ahead here he did not feel the dialectic was operating on his side the dialectic he didnt smile but he felt like it your ambassador in nuremberg might tell the germans that we hope they do attack poland because we expect to profit from their overthrow at your hands why do you say this even in his own language which molotov couldnt understand queek sounded suspicious the translation proved the soviet leader had gauged the lizards tone aright the ambassador went on i know that you and your notempire love neither the race nor the reich no we do not molotov agreed glad he didnt have to bother with hypocrisy here but a war would be almost as disastrous for us as for either side fighting even if we are not directly involved the germans will not pay any attention to what we tell them for they do not love us either but if they think we want them to do one thing they might do the opposite to annoy us before answering molotov queek spoke back and forth with his interpreter in the language of the race again molotov didnt understand but he could guess what was going on the ambassador wanted to know if the interpreter thought what hed said was true the pole could damage the soviet union by saying no but he would damage his own homeland worse queek said perhaps we shall try this it cannot make things worse and it may make them better i thank you for the suggestion i do it in my selfinterest not yours molotov said i understand that the lizard replied against the reich your selfinterest and that of the race coincide you may rest assured i also understand this is not the case in other areas where we impinge i have no idea what you are talking about molotov said lying through his teeth our relations with the race are correct in all regards again queek and his interpreter conferred correct i am given to understand is a euphemism for chilly the lizard said at last this strikes me as an accurate summation before i go i shall repay you for your assistance however selfinterested it may have been by strongly suggesting that you should under no circumstances give the chinese rebels an explosivemetal bomb if they use one against us you will be held responsible do you understand i do molotov said since i had no intention of doing any such thing the warning is pointless but i accept it in the spirit in which it was offered that sounded polite and committed him to nothing after queek and the interpreter left molotov stepped out of the office too by the side door that led to the changing room there he took off his clothes and put on fresh ones brought in for the purpose only after he was sure he wasnt bringing along any electronic hangerson did he return to the office where he handled everything except meetings with the race he was about to call marshal zhukov when the telephone rang he was something less than astonished when his secretary told him the marshal waited on the other end of the line put him through pyotr maksimovich he said and then a moment later good day comrade marshal best to remind zhukov he was still supposed to be subservient to the party molotov wished theory and practice coincided more closely sure enough all zhukov said was well suppressing a sigh molotov summarized the conversation with queek he added this means of course that we cannot even think about operation proletarian vengeance for some time it would not be safe no it was always risky zhukov agreed we would have had to blame the bomb on the nazis or the americans and we might well not have been believed now we can only hope the germans dont give mao a bomb and blame it on us that was a horrifying thought before molotov could do more than note it zhukov went on the west is more important we are prepared for anything vyacheslav mikhailovich as best we can be good very good molotov said now we hope the preparations are needless he hung up zhukov let him get away with it why not if things went wrong who would get the blame molotov would and he knew it reuven russie was examining the cyst on the back of a stocky old ladys calf when the airraid sirens began to howl gevalt the woman exclaimed startled back into yiddish from the hebrew theyd been using is it starting all over again god forbid its probably just a drill mrs zylbring reuven answered the reassuring tones that came in so handy in medicine were useful in other ways too weve been having a lot of them lately you know just in case and would we have them if we didnt need them mrs zylbring retorted to which he lacked such a reassuring comeback yetta the receptionist said no matter what it is wed better head for the basement shed stayed in the examining room to make sure reuven didnt get fresh with mrs zylbring he couldnt imagine himself that desperate but protocol was protocol he also had no comeback for her his father and the fat middleaged man moishe russied been looking at came out of the other examination room they too headed for the basement as reuven went down the steps he wondered if hiding down there would save him from an explosivemetal bomb he doubted it hed been a little boy on a freighter outside of rome when the germans smuggled in a bomb and blew the eternal citys lizard occupiersand incidentally the papacyto radioactive dust that had been a horror from a lot of kilometers away close up he didnt like to think about it hed just gone into the shelter when the allclear sounded his fathers patient said several pungent things in arabic from which the jews of palestine had borrowed most of their swear words as a language used mostly in prayer for two thousand years hebrew had lost much of its own nastiness it could be worse reuven told him it might have been the real thing if they keep having alarms when no ones there though nobody will take shelter when it is the real thing the man answered which was also true he kept on grumbling as they all went back upstairs once theyd returned to the examination room mrs zylbring asked reuven well what can you do about my leg you have two choices he answered we can take out the cyst which will hurt for a while or we can leave it in there its not malignant it wont get worse itll just stay the way it is but its an ugly lump mrs zylbring said getting rid of it is a minor surgical procedure reuven said wed do it under local anesthetic it wouldnt hurt at all while it was happening but it would hurt afterwards you said so mrs zylbring made a sour face and it would be expensive too reuven nodded politely the training hed had at the lizards medical college hadnt prepared him for dealing with dilemmas like this he suspected he was a good deal more highly trained than he needed to be to join his fathers practice no he didnt suspect it he knew it but he was also trained in some of the wrong things the old lady waggled a finger at him if it were your leg doctor what would you do he almost burst out laughing the lizards had never asked him a question like that but it wasnt a bad question not really mrs zylbring assumed he had all the answers that was what a doctor was for wasnt ithaving answers answering what kind of condition she had was easy knowing what to do about it was a different question a different kind of question one shpaaka and the other physicians from the race hadnt got him ready to handle he temporized if the fact that it doesnt disturb function satisfies you leave it alone if the way it looks bothers you i can get rid of it inside half an hour of course the way it looks bothers me she said if it werent for that i wouldnt have come here but i dont like the idea of you cutting on me and i dont have a whole lot of money either i dont know what to do in the hope yetta would have a good idea reuven glanced over to her she rolled her eyes in a way suggesting shed seen patients like mrs zylbring a million times before but didnt know what to do about them either in the end the old woman went home with her cyst reuven wished hed tried harder to talk her into getting rid of it his urge was always to do something to intervene if he hadnt had that urge he probably wouldnt have wanted to follow in his fathers footsteps but when he said as much to his father moishe russie shook his head if its not really hurting the woman it doesnt matter one way or another shed have been unhappy at the pain afterwards too mark my words if shed wanted you to do it that would have been different the pain would be the same either way reuven said yesbut at the same time no too his father said the difference is shed have accepted it better if shed been the one urging you to have the thing out she wouldnt blame you for it if you know what i mean i suppose so reuven said things arent so cutanddried here as they were back in the medical college you were always supposed to come up with the one right answer there and you got into trouble if you didnt his fathers chuckle had a reminiscent feel to it oh yes but the real world is more complicated than school and youd better believe it he got up from behind his desk came around it and clapped reuven on the shoulder come on lets go home you havent got homework any more anyhow thats true reuven grinned i knew i must have had some good reason for getting out of there moishe russie laughed but soon sobered you did have a good reason a very good one and im proud of you cant you get the fleet lord to do anything about that reuven asked as they left the officemoishe russie locked up behind themand started for home lateafternoon sunlight gleamed off moishe russies bald crown as he shook his head ive tried he wont listen he wants everybody to reverence the spirits of emperors pasthe said the phrase in the lizards languageso well get used to bowing down to the race hed better not hold his breath or hell be the bluest lizard ever hatched reuven said i hope youre right with all my heart i hope youre right his father said but the race is stubborn and the race is very patient too that worries me how much is patience worth if we all blow up tomorrow reuven asked thats what worries me moishe russie started to step off the curb then jumped back in a hurry to avoid an arab hurtling past on a bicycle it worries me too he said quietly and then switched to yiddish to add god damn the stupid nazis everyones been saying that for the past thirty years reuven said if hes going to do it hes taking his own sweet time about it he works at his speed not ours moishe russie answered if hes there at all reuven said there were dayscommonly days when people were more stupid or vicious than usualwhen belief came hard his father sighed the night the lizards came to earth i waswe all werestarving to death in the warsaw ghetto your sister sarah already had id gone out to trade some of the family silver for a pork bone i threw a candlestick over the wall around the ghetto and the pole threw me the bone he could have just cheated me but he didnt as i was walking back to our flat i prayed to god for a sign and an explosivemetal bomb went off high in the sky i thought i was a prophet and other people did too for a while sarah reuven felt a sudden rush of shame he hadnt thought about his dead sister in years i hardly remember her he couldnt have been more than three when she died all he really had was a confused recollection of not being the only child in the family unlike his parents he brought little in the way of memories with him from poland she was very sweet and very mischievous and i think she would have been beautiful moishe russie said which was about as much as hed ever talked about the girl whod died before the lizards came she sounds like the twins reuven said he walked on again nu why not his father said theres something to this genetics business you know but maybe god really was giving me a sign there in warsaw that night if the lizards hadnt come wed surely be dead now so would all the jews in polandall the jews in europe come to that instead its only a big chunk that are and the rest who are liable to be reuven said maybe thats better but its a long way from good moishe russie raised an eyebrow so what youre accusing god of then is sloppy workmanship reuven thought about it well when you get right down to it yes if i do a sloppy job of something im only human i make mistakes i know ill make mistakes but i expect better from god somehow maybe he expects better from you too his father didnt sound reproachful he just sounded thoughtful thoughtful and a little sad i dont like riddles reuven now reuven sounded reproachful no moishe russies laugh came out sad too what is life then you wont find the answer to that one till you cant tell anybody he quoted from the psalms what is man that thou art mindful of him god has riddles too words reuven fleered sounding even more secular than he felt nothing but words wheres the reality behind them when i work with patients i know what is and what isnt he scowled remembering mrs zylbring things werent always simple with patients either from the bible his father swung to kipling whom he quoted in yiddish translation youre a better man than i am gunga din he laughed again or more likely youre just a younger man were almost home i wonder what your mothers making for supper he set a hand on reuvens shoulder hurrying him along as if he were a little boy reuven started to shrug it off but in the end let it stay when they got home the odor of roasting lamb filled their nostrils so did the excitement of the twins who like jacob with the angel of the lord were wrestling with algebra its fun judith said its fun after you figure out whats going on anyhow esther amended till then your head wants to fall off judith agreed but weve got it now good reuven said he hadnt liked mathematics that much himself will you still have it next week when they show you something new of course we will esther declared and judith nodded confidently he started to laugh at them then caught himself all at once he understood why his father had trouble taking his cocksure certainty seriously as einstein had been the race was convinced nothing could travel faster than light the crew of the lewis and clark though had discovered something that did rumor and so having caught the news from someone who knew someone who knew a radio operator glen johnson felt no hesitation in asking mickey flynn do you think its true oh probably the numbertwo pilot answered but id have a better notion if i knew what we were talking about that the germans have sent hermann goring out this way johnson said last i heard he was dead flynn remarked if he didnt have the deadest pan on the ship johnson was damned if he knew who did he restrained himself from any of several obvious comments and contented himself with saying no the spaceship oh the spaceship flynn said in artfully sudden enlightenment no i hadnt heard that i hadnt heard that its not heading for this stretch of the asteroid belt either so youd better tell me that too johnson snorted that propelled him ever so slowly away from flynn as they hung weightless just outside the control room i didnt think they could get it moving so soon he said reaching for a handhold life is full of surprises flynn said so is look but life has more of them in color youre impossible johnson said flynn regally inclined his head acknowledging the compliment johnson went on what do you think it means that they pushed their schedule so hard do you think they think the hammers going to drop back home and theyre sending the ship out so they dont have all their eggs in one basket maybe the numbertwo pilot considered launching another joke johnson couldnt tell not with his poker face if flynn was considering it he didnt do it some things were too big to joke about after a few seconds flynn said if they do think that way theyre fools the lizards can go after them out here too sure they can johnson agreed but we have defenses the nazisll have em too they might even have better ones than oursthe bastards are awfully damn good with rockets flynn nodded okay say theyre twice as good as we are at knocking down whatever the race sends after em how often are you taking out the lizards missiles in our drills a little more than half the time sounds about right flynn nodded again suppose theyre getting eighty percent then i dont think they can do that well myself but suppose now suppose the lizards send ten pursuit missiles after them how many are the aryan supermen likely to stop he looked around as if at an imaginary audience come on come on dont everybody speak up at once did i make the statistics too hard fighting back laughter johnson said odds are theyll knock down eight thats true which leaves how many likely to get through mickey flynn held up two fingers giving a broad hint before johnson could suggest what he might do with those fingers he went on and how many of those missiles need to get through to give everybody an unhappy afternoon johnson wondered if hed fold down his index finger to give the answer but he decorously lowered his middle finger instead getting the message across by implication rather than overtly and even if they knock down all ten johnson began chances of that are a little better than ten percent on the assumptions were using flynn broke in if you say so remind me not to shoot craps with you if we ever get somewhere we can shoot craps johnson tried to remember where hed been going oh yeah even if the germans knockdown all ten the lizards have a lot more than ten to send after em and they only have to screw up once they dont get a second chance thats about the size of it id say the germans can run but itll be a long time before they can hide flynn paused meditatively then added and the germans are liable to be looking over their shoulders all the way out here anyhow we took the race by surprise they had to be pretty sure of what the master race was up to if the lizards were human id stand up and cheer if they whaled the stuffing out of the nazis you know what i mean johnson said even though they arent i dont think my heart would break flynn pondered that the two questions are how badly do wepeople i meanget hurt if everything west of poland goes up in smoke and how badly can the germans hurt the lizards before they go down swinging bombs in orbit johnson spoke with authority there hed kept an eye on the nazis and reds as well as the lizards idly he wondered how hans drucker was doing he hadnt been a bad fellow even if he did have a tendency to paw the air with his hooves and whinny whenever they played deutschland uber alles missiles inside the reich submarines in the mediterranean and prowling off arabia and australia and every one of em loaded for bear not all the missiles would get through no the race has better defenses and more of em than we do flynn said but building missiles has been the german national sport for a long time heh johnson said though it was anything but funny and the nazis arent the sort to stop shooting as long as theyve got any bullets in the gun either theyd just as soon go out in a blaze of glory i wish i could say i thought you were wrong flynn answered actually i can say it but it would sully my reputation for truthfulness and now if youll excuse me i am going to earn my paycheck he pushed off from his own handhold and glided into the control room gloomily johnson went in the opposite direction into the bowels of the lewis and clark he hated war with the sincerity of a man whod known it facetoface even if it was a couple of hundred million miles away even if it wouldnt directly involve the united states he still hated it and a war between the lizards and the germans would be big enough and nasty enough that the usa couldnt possibly be unaffected even if no american soldiers went into battle and if the lizards decided to get rid of the hermann goring what would they do about the lewis and clark doing anything would get them into a war with the usa but would they care if they were already fighting the reich in for a penny in for a pound he wished the lewis and clark had a bar he would have liked to go and sit and have a couple of drinks things would have looked better after that so far as he knew nobody had rigged up a still yet it was probably only a matter of time brigadier general healey would pitch a fit but not even he could stop human nature human nature johnson muttered if that wasnt what was pushing the nazis into trouble what was original sin was there any difference human nature reared its head in a different way when lucy vegetti came swinging down an intersecting corridor the lewis and clark s traffic rules had grown up from those back in the usa little octagonal stop signs were painted on the walls at every corner to warn people to be alert when crossing johnson always paid attention to them you got going fast enough to hurt somebody when you barreled along without a care in the worldand some people did just that lucy stopped too she smiled at johnson hi glen how are you before he could answer she took a second look at him and said you dont seem very happy he shrugged ive been bettersort of wondering whether things would blow up back home doesnt sound good does it she said soberly maybe were lucky to be way out hereunless the lizards decide to clean us up as long as theyre busy back on earth sooner or later well spread out too much to make that easy but but we havent done it yet johnson broke in yeah his chuckle was flat and harsh cant even go out and get drunk nothing to do but sit tight and wait and see i know what you mean lucy hesitated then said when i came up from earth i brought along a quart of scotch if you promise not to be a pig you can have a sip with me once its gone its gone for good solemnly johnson crossed his heart hope to die he said he hadnt brought anything with him when he came up from earth of course he hadnt intended to stay aboard the lewis and clark and she had come on then she swung off toward her tiny cubicle johnson followed he knew the way even though they still werent anything more than friends but if she asks me in for a drink i can hope cant i lucy opened the door to the cubicle then closed it after them the place was crowded for twohell it was crowded for one but closing the door didnt have to mean anything except that lucy didnt want to advertise her whiskey johnson wouldnt have she took the bottle out of a duffel bag mostly full of clothes cutty sarknot great scotch but a hell of a lot better than no scotch the bottle was almost full she undid the screw top and replaced it with a perforated cork with a piece of glass tubing doing duty for a straw go ahead she said and passed him the bottle thanks he said from the bottom of his heart he sucked up what he judged to be not quite a shots worth of whiskey it tasted so good he wanted a lot more instead he put his thumb over the top of the tubing and gave the bottle back to lucy vegetti trust my germs if this stuff wont kill em what will she drank about as much as he had then yanked out the cork put on the lid and stowed away the scotch an amber globule the size of a pea still floated in the air in the middle of the cubicle lucy and johnson both moved toward it at the same time johnson nodded to her go ahead its yours a gentleman lucy opened her mouth the droplet of scotch disappeared then she leaned forward a couple of inches farther and kissed him seemingly of themselves his arms slipped around her the kiss went on and on jesus he said when they finally broke apart ive wanted to do that for a long time so have i lucy said now i have a better notion that i can i dont know trust you isnt quite right but its close enough he wondered what she would have doneif shed have done anythinghad he been a pig with the bottle or stolen that floating drop of cutty for himself then he stopped wondering because she unzipped her coverall and wriggled out of it she wore bra and panties underneath a lot of women had stopped bothering with brassiereswhat point to them in weightlessness but not her either she was too stubborn to care or she didnt want to put herself on display like that johnson was too busy getting out of his own clothes to worry about it they caressed each other and stroked each other and kissed each other all over floating free as they did who was on top was a matter of opinion unimportant opinion presently a little awkwardly he went into her she wrapped her arms and legs around his back he used one hand to snag a handhold and the other to keep on stroking her down where they were joined that brought her along about as quickly as he came himself hed gone without a long time then before long there were other little moist sticky droplets floating in the air they both hunted them down with rags messy he said with a grin as happy and relaxed as hed been for a long time it always is lucy said usually though men dont have to pay attention to it he shrugged and snagged another drop before it hit a wall the world was still every bit as liable to blow up as it had been half an hour before but that didnt seem to matter nearly so much kassquit read each days news reports with mounting alarm the race had made it very plain to the deutsche that any aggression the big uglies tried would be punished manyfold the deutsche had to understand that but here they were sounding fiercer and more determined every day are they addled she demanded of ttomalss in the starships refectory they must know what will happen to them if they go on you were among them for a while why do they not believe us tosevites have a greater capacity for selfdelusion than do males and females of the race ttomalss answered and kassquit knew no small pride that he spoke to her as if she were a female of the race he went on past that i will only say that fathoming their motivations remains difficult if not impossible they cannot hope to defeat us kassquit exclaimed ttomalss waved at the males and females mostly males for this ship had orbited tosev since the arrival of the conquest fleet and still carried a large part of its old crew of the race in the refectory with them our kind is relatively homogeneous he said big uglies are more variable we come from one culture they still have many very different cultures we are discovering that cultural differences can be almost as important as genetic variation we had some evidence of this in the assimilation of the hallessi but it is much more striking here i can see how it might be kassquit looked down at her soft scaleless arms at the preposterous organs on her chest that secreted or could secrete nutritive fluid at the itchy stubble between her legs that reminded her she would soon need to shave it off again after all what am i but a big ugly with cultural differences exactly so ttomalss said which was the last thing she wanted to hear more often than not ttomalss hadnt the faintest idea hed upset her this time for a wonder he noticed and amended his words you are a tosevite citizen of the empire the first but surely not the last there are timesthere are many timeswhen i wish i could be altogether of the race kassquit said wistfully culturally you are ttomalss said which she couldnt deny he went on physiologically you are not and you cannot be but that has not stopped either the rabotevs or the hallessi from becoming full participants in imperial life that was also a truth but it was only a partial truth kassquit said both the rabotevs and the hallessi are more similar to the racephysiologically and psychologicallythan big uglies are we have known from the beginning that assimilating this planet would be harder than incorporating rabotev or halless ttomalss answered but we are willingindeed we have no choice butto expend the time and effort necessary to do what must be done he let his mouth fall open and waggled his lower jaw wry laughter they are very perturbed back on home we have just received answers to some of our early communications after we discovered the true nature of this world they are wondering if any of us still survive considering the attitude of the deutsche they have a right to be worried kassquit said if the reich has a missile targeted on this ship we could die in the next instant probably before we even knew we were hit if that happensif anything like that happensthe reich will cease to exist ttomalss said the deutsche have to know as much they have to he sounded as if he was trying to reassure himself as well as kassquit but do they truly grasp it kassquit persisted they have shown no sign of doing so and even if they are smashed can they weaken us enough to leave us vulnerable to uprisings from the areas we rule or to attacks from the sssr or the usa i am not the fleetlord i do not know such things ttomalss said what i do know is that we will destroy all the tosevites if we ever appear to be in danger of being conquered ourselves what felt like a lump of ice formed in kassquits belly she tried to call up a word and could not in ancient days when incurable disease was spreading quarantine ttomalss said this time following her thought well kassquit made the affirmative gesture the male who had reared her continued yes that is the planned strategy tosevites here in this solar system can be managed one way or another tosevites who might travel between the stars in their own ships we cannot permit it we shall not permit it that made sense if it meant exterminating kassquits biological species it still made sense she could see as much the idea of wild big uglies with starshipsin essence wild big uglies with a conquest fleet of their ownwas truly horrifying what might they do to home or other planets of the empire all of which were essentially undefended far worse than the race had done on tosev she was sure of that they wouldnt want to colonize hometheyd want to smash it alternatives well she herself was one of the alternatives we have to do everything we can to keep them from seeking such a thing which means we have to do everything we can to assimilate them before they are technically able to do such a thing truth ttomalss added an emphatic cough in aid of which kassquit said how are the arrangements going for another meeting between the american tosevites and me fairly well her mentor answered for some reason the americans seem more hesitant now than they were before but i still expect matters to be resolved before long who among the americans is hesitant kassquit asked in some surprise in my communications with sam yeager he expresses eagerness and says his hatchling feels the same way in the hatchlings case if not in that of the elder yeager such eagerness may in part be related to sexual desire ttomalss said dryly not for the first time kassquit was glad her face didnt show what she felt a pang of longing it startled her it embarrassed her but it was there she didnt want to think about it and so resolutely she didnt all she said was they showed no signs of it at the last meeting and if it is a factor it is certainly not the only one involved there i would agree with you ttomalss replied and so long as you want them i also want these meetings to go forward as i have said i shall do everything i can to resolve the difficulties which appear to be bureaucratic in nature i thank you superior sir kassquit got to her feet towering over the males and females in the refectory she set her tray and bowl and utensils on the conveyor that took them off to be washed and reused then went back to her cubicle that little space gave her as much privacy as she could get aboard the starship somewhere though a tiny camera recorded everything she did she was a tosevite citizen of the empire true but she was also a specimen for the race to study she wished ttomalss hadnt told her about the camera now when she felt the overpowering need to stroke her private partsas she sometimes didshe also felt even more constraint and guilt than she had before it wasnt just that her biology made her different from the race not any more it was also that ttomalssand other males and femalescould watch her being different and could scorn her for the differences as she checked for electronic messages though she let her mouth fall open in a laugh the idea that struck her wasnt funny enough to make her laugh out loudanother difference rooted in tosevite biology but ginger had made the races reproductive behavior more like that prevailing down on tosev ttomalss and other males and femalesespecially felless whom she intensely dislikedwere no longer in such a good position to criticize what she did sure enough a couple of messages awaited her one assuming she truly did belong to the race tried to sell her a new improved fingerclaw trimmer she wondered how after so many millennia of civilization a fingerclaw trimmer could possibly be improved most likely the merchant selling it had been on tosev so long hed acquired tosevite notions of extravagant advertising kassquit deleted that one without a qualm the other message came from sam yeager your people are being kind of picky about letting jonathan and me come up for a second visit he wrote seems they do not want an american spacecraft linking up with one of your starships hard to blame them with the deutsche making such nuisances of themselves but we americans are still mostly harmless kassquit pondered that how was she supposed to take it tone was hard to gauge on electronic messages anyhow and she had all the more trouble because sam yeager was a big ugly she also noted that the story he told was different from the one shed got from ttomalss she didnt suppose that should have surprised her tosevites were even more reluctant to admit they could be at fault than were males or females of the race would it be possible for you and your hatchling to fly here in one of our shuttlecraft she asked no immediate answer came back which didnt surprise her sam yeagers message wasnt very recent and hed doubtless gone off to do other things instead of sitting at his computer waiting for her reply she read for a while then returned to the computer to check the newsthe deutsche still sounded as bellicose as everand then in an act that brought her as much pleasure from defiance as from physical sensation turned off the lights in the cubicle and caressed herself no doubt the camera monitored infrared the watchers would know what she was doing even with the lights out while she was doing it she didnt care that was a mixture of defiance and physical sensation too shed seen videos of big uglies matingmore products of the races research on tosevites she wasnt usually in the habit of imagining herself in one of those videos but today she did another act of defiance and she imagined the male with which she was doing the improbable deed had jonathan yeagers face after the pleasure faded the shame for what shed done seemed all the greater as she turned the lights back on and washed her hands she sighed she wished her body wouldnt drive her to such extremes but it did and she had to come to terms with that a fair stretch of the day went by before sam yeager answered her i think you have a good idea there he wrote i will pass it on to my superiors you do the same on your side of the fence and we shall see what happens next good enough kassquit wrote back adding i hope your own superiors will not prove difficult to see how he would respond well they may he answered this time promptly they do not trust me so far as i would like it seems but i am useful to them and so they just have to put up with me that sounds like my own position here kassquit wrote in some surprise she wondered how sam yeager had fallen foul of his own kind not through looking the wrong way anyhow he looked like a typical big ugly maybe he would explain if he did come up to the starship again nesseref let out a soft astonished hiss as she guided the shuttlecraft down toward the tosevite city called los angeles she hadnt realized the big uglies built on such a scale few structures seemed very tall but builtup areas stretched as far as her eye turrets could turn a tosevite speaking the language of the race said this is los angeles international airport shuttlecraft you are cleared for your final descent all airplane traffic has been diverted from the area i should hope so nesseref exclaimed that the big uglies didnt take the notion of clearing air traffic for granted that they felt they had to mention it chilled her how many mishaps did their air travel system allow she didnt care to think about that there was the concrete expanse of the airport the radio beacon had guided the shuttlecraft well enough now she saw the visual beacons too the ones that would mark out her precise landing spot as she had while in cairo she let her fingerclaw hover above the switch that would fire the braking rockets if the shuttlecrafts electronics didnt do the job but the braking rockets ignited when they should have deceleration pressed her into her seat just routine she told herself landing at a port under the big uglies control wasnt quite routine but shed done it before once more shouldnt be a problem controlled by the computer the braking rockets started burning just as the shuttlecrafts landing legs touched the concrete very neat job there the big ugly monitoring the descent said we will bring out more fuel and liquid oxygen for you and also your passengers i thank you nesseref answered though she didnt feel particularly thankful she just hoped the tosevites knew what they were doing even the race treated liquid hydrogen with a great deal of respect if the big uglies didnt theyd put her in danger but everything seemed to go as it should the trucks the big uglies sent out had fittings that matched those of her oxygen and fuel tanks shed been told the fittings were supposed to be standardized but was glad to find reality matching her suppositions and the tosevites handling the hoses exercised as much caution as they should have when the vehicles carrying the hydrogen and oxygen had withdrawn a tosevite motorcar approached the shuttlecraft two big uglies got out of it one wore wrappings of a color not far removed from that of his own skin the other nesseref stared at the image of the other in her monitor with more than a little bemusement he wore minimal wrappings shaved the hair on his head and had body paint on his torso she had heard some big uglies aped the styles of the race but had seldom seen it for herselfit was uncommon in poland and for all practical purposes nonexistent in cairo she was supposed to fly two tosevites up to a starship she supposed these were the ones after they got out the motorcar had turned around and driven away making sure struck her as a good idea she used the external speaker you are the american tosevites sam yeager and jonathan yeager no doubt she was making a hash of the alien names but she couldnt help that we are superior sir answered the big ugly in the tan wrappings mind if we join you superior female if you please nesseref said yes you have permission to come aboard this shuttlecraft has been fitted with seats suitable to your species she undogged the hatch and let in some of the local atmosphere which was cool and moist and left the odor of partially burned hydrocarbons on her scent receptors i am sorry the same tosevite said as he came through the hatch we cannot tell your gender by voice as we can among our own kind he spoke the language of the race well and seemed to have some feeling for proper behavior as he lay down on one of the seats he continued i am sam yeager and this is my hatchling whose familiar name is jonathan i greet you superior female said the tosevite who wore the body paint of a psychologists assistant i greet you jonathan yeager nesseref hoped she had that right neither big ugly corrected her so she supposed she did she went on we do not have long to wait before leaving for the rendezvous with the starship do you mind my asking the purpose of your visit by no means said sam yeager evidently the superior of the two we are going to meet one of our fellow big uglies nesseref wondered if hed correctly understood the question he proved he had by adding yes i mean exactly what i say there very well nesseref replied with a shrug she had an eye turret on the chronometer which showed the launch window rapidly approaching when the proper moment came she ignited the shuttlecrafts motors both big uglies grunted under acceleration and both behaved well when it cut off and weightlessness began docking was quick and routine nesseref could have gone aboard the starship while waiting for the proper time to descend from orbit and return to poland but she didnt bother she just stayed where she was enjoying a little weightlessness while knowing too much wasnt good for her when she did leave the docking station at the starships central hub she used her maneuvering jets to get clear of the great ship then fired her braking rockets to fall out of orbit and down toward the surface of tosev she traveled of course from west to east with the direction of the planets rotation which meant she had to pass above the territory of the greater german reich before reaching poland do not deviate from your course a deutsch big ugly warned you and you alone will be responsible for the consequences if you do i do not intend to deviate nesseref answered the reich will be responsible for any aggression as i am sure you know do not threaten me the tosevite said and used an emphatic cough do not threaten my notempire either we are seeking our legitimate rights nothing more and we will have them you cannot prevent it you had better not try to prevent it silence seemed the best response to that and silence was what nesseref gave it despite bluster the deutsch big uglies did not seek to attack the shuttlecraft nesseref let out a long sigh of relief as she landed at the port between warsaw and lodz whose construction shed supervised this is the first time in a while i have heard anyone be glad to return to poland a male in the control center said as she arranged ground transportation to her home many males and females are looking for the chance to escape if war comes who knows which places will be safe nesseref said weapons can land anywhere that is a truth superior female the males said weapons can land anywhere but if war comes weapons will land on poland and that was also a truth even if one nesseref didnt care to contemplate she also didnt care to discover that no male or female of the race was heading toward the new town in which she lived the only driver available was a scrawny big ugly with an ancient decrepit motorcar of tosevite manufacture nesseref was anything but eager to entrust herself to it that must have shown for the big ugly let loose one of the barking laughs of his kind and spoke in the language of the race you flew between the stars are you afraid to drive to your apartment when i flew between the stars i was in cold sleep nesseref replied with dignity i will be awake to experience this worse luck the tosevite laughed again that is funny but come get in i have not killed anyone yet even myself nesseref found that a dubious recommendation but did climb into the motorcar which had the rightside front seat modified to fit a posterior of the sort the race had but the motorcar boasted no safety straps of any kind and she rapidly discovered the big ugly drove as if he labored under the delusion of being a killercraft pilot traveling a relatively short distance along a narrow asphalttopped road proved more terrifying than all the shuttlecraft flying nesseref had ever done in the shuttlecraft of course she had radar and collision avoidance alarms and radio to talk with the ground and with other pilots in the neighborhood here she and the driver had no aids whatever all the other big uglies on the road drove with the same reckless disregard for life and limb as he displayed madness nesseref exclaimed as he passed a lorry and then swung back into his lane so that another lorry this one oncoming missed him by a scales thickness she was too rattled even to bother appending an emphatic cough you want to get home as soon as you can is that not a truth the driver asked i want to get there alive nesseref answered this time she did use an emphatic cough it felt very emphatic in fact is that really so important the big ugly said in the end what difference will it make when the war comes you will be dead either way do you want to die sooner than you must nesseref returned she thought she would die in the next instant when an animaldrawn wagon blithely started to cross the road on which she was traveling but the tosevite lunatic handling the motorcar had quick reflexes even if he had no sense its suspension swaying the motorcar dodged the wagon that fellow is a fool the driver said nesseref was convinced he said so because he had no trouble recognizing others of his own kind after a moment he went on i am a jew do you know what the deutsche did to jews when they held poland he didnt wait for her answer but continued they could not kill me then and i do not think they or anyone else will have an easy time killing me now if the way he drove hadnt killed him nesseref doubted explosivemetal bombs or poison gases could do the trick but she asked if war does come what will you do he hesitated there no more than he did on the roadway fight the deutsche as long as i can i have a rifle i know what to do with it if they want me they will have to pay a high price for me with a squeal from his overworked underpowered brakes he pulled to a stop in front of nesserefs building she got out of his motorcar with so much relief she almost forgot the bag in which she carried her personal belongings the big ugly called her back to get it he might be maniacal but he wasnt larcenous when she got up to her apartment orbit greeted her with a yawn that displayed his mouthful of sharply pointed teeth it was hard to impress a tsiongi had she bought a beffel it would have danced around her and jumped up on her squeaking wildly all the time but a beffel would have wrecked the apartment while she was gone orbit didnt do things like that one of the pieces of mail shed picked up was a flyer that began in case of emergency the emergency it was talking about was a deutsch attack nesseref began to wonder if she should have been glad to come home every step sam yeager took out from the hub of the starship made him feel heavier every step he took also made him hotter the race favored temperatures like those of a very hot day in los angeles turning to his son he said youre dressed for the weather better than i am thats for sure as at his previous meeting with kassquit jonathan wore only a pair of shorts he nodded and said you must be dying in that uniform ill get by sam chuckled kassquitll be better dressed for it than either one of us jonathan didnt answer that sam suspected hed embarrassed his son by implying that he noticed what a woman was or wasnt wearing somewhat to his surprise the lizard leading them to kassquit turned out to speak english he said the whole notion of wrappings except to protect yourselves from the nasty cold on tosev is nothing but foolishness no sam made the negative hand gesture he thought about going into the language of the race but decided not to english was better suited to the subject matter clothes are also part of our sexual display sometimes they keep us from thinking about mating but sometimes they make us think about it had their guide been a human being he would have sniffed as things were he waggled his eye turrets and spoke one dismissive word foolishness do you think so jonathan yeager asked in the language of the race would you say the same thing after you smell the pheromones of a female who has just tasted ginger the lizard didnt answer in fact he didnt say another word till hed led sam and jonathan to the chamber in which kassquit sat waiting for them i greet you superior female sam said in the language of the race his son echoed him they both briefly assumed the posture of respect kassquit got up from her seat and politely returned it she was smoother at it than either of them having no doubt had much more practice i greet you sam yeager jonathan yeager she said and sat down again it is good to see you once more sam said it was disconcerting to see so much of her he had to work to keep his eyes on her face and not on her small firm breasts or the slit between her legs which looked all the more naked for being shaved she made no move to conceal herself she had no idea that she ought to conceal herself jonathans right sam thought im not as used to skin as he is and it is good to see both of you she answered seriously innocent in her nakedness i shall remember your visits all the days of my life for they are so different from anything i have known before they are different for us too jonathan said you live in space to us getting here is an adventure in itself i did not think it would be so bad kassquit said in obvious dismay adventure had connotations of hardship in the language of the race that it lacked in english you came on one of our shuttlecraft after all and with us spaceflight is routine sam did his best to spread oil on troubled waters one of these days it would be nice if you could visit us down on the surface of tosev i have thought of this kassquit said i do not yet know whether it can be arranged or whether it would prove expedient if it can ever since hed whiled away summer afternoons fishing for bluegill and crappie in the creek that ran through his parents farm sam had known how to bait a hook would you not be interested to learn what being among tosevites is like he asked if you wore our style of wrappings and false hair you would look just like everyone else if that wasnt bait he didnt know what was poor kassquit had to be the most isolated individual in the world even mickey and donald dont have it so bad he thought uneasily theyve got each other and she s got nobody tempting her hardly seemed fair but he was a soldier on duty and a human being loyal to his species while she wasnt human except by parentage undoubtedly wished that parentage hadnt happened and served the race with all her heart he could tell the hook had gone home all right it might well tear out of her mouth of course people were a lot more complicated than bluegill her face didnt show much but then like liu meis her face never showed much but she leaned forward in her seat and took a couple of deep breaths if that wasnt intrigued interest he had scales and eye turrets himself to look like everyone else she said musingly i have never imagined such a thingexcept in my wishes and dreams where i look like a proper female of the race nobody raised by humans would have told a nearstranger anything so intimate kassquit didnt understand the limits behind which people functioned then she said something that made sam sit up and take notice if war comes i may be safer in the notempire called the united states than here aboard this starship do you really think there will be a war between the reich and the race jonathan blurted he hardly seemed better at concealing what he felt than kassquit did and what he felt was horrified dismay who can know kassquit answered the race does not want to fight the reich but the reich has no business making demands on the race that is about what our government thinks too but we have little influence on what goes on in the reich sam said too bad kassquit told him for big uglies you seem sensible you americans aside from your absurd custom of snoutcounting we like it sam said it seems to suit us we are not a people who care to be told what to do by anyone but what if those who tell you what to do know more about a question than you do kassquit asked does a physician not know more about how to keep you healthy than you can know for yourself judging who is an expert in public affairs is harder sam replied many claim to be experts but they all want to do different things that makes choosing among them harder so we let those who convince the largest number of us that they are wise and good govern our notempire what if they lie kassquit asked bluntly if we find out we do not choose them again yeager said we choose them for terms of so many years not for life and we hope they cannot do too much damage while in office what if the race has a very bad emperor he is the emperor for as long as he lives his ministers will do what is right regardless kassquit said and even a bad emperors spirit will watch over the spirits of citizens of the empire what good is a bad tosevite snoutcounted official after he is dead none whatever no sooner had sam discarded one particular question as impolitic than jonathan asked it how do you know spirits of emperors past watch over other spirits is it not a superstition the same as our tosevite superstitions of course it is not a superstition kassquit said indignantly it is a truth the truth is not a superstition how do you know jonathan persisted sam made a small gesture warning his son not to push it too hard he gave kassquit credit instead of saying something like i just do she gave a serious answer all the males and females of three species on three worlds believe it all the males and females of the race have believed it for more than a hundred thousand years since home was unified could so many believe such a thing for so long if it were not true and you believe it sam asked gently i do kassquit made the affirmative gesture spirits of emperors past will cherish my spirit and my spirit when that time comes will look no different from any other she spoke with great confidence you poor kid yeager thought he had to look away from her for a moment tears were stinging his eyes and he couldnt let her see that and the worst part of it is you only know a fraction of what all the lizards have done to you because there so much of it you cant see any more than a fish sees water but then he shook his head no that wasnt the worst part of it after all he could see just how warped the race had made kassquit and he knew damn well he was going to go right on raising mickey and donald as if they were human beings what a son of a bitch i am but its my job dammit he supposed the ss men who put jews and fairies and gypsies into gas chambers said the same thing how could they do anything else if they wanted to go home afterwards and kiss their wives and eat pigs knuckles and knock back a seidel or two of beer if they really thought about what they were doing wouldnt they go nuts its not the same he knew it wasnt but had the uncomfortable feeling the difference was of degree not of kind a silence had fallen in the chamber as if nobody knew what to say next finally kassquit made a pointed return to a new take on an earlier subject do you not think the present aggressive policy of the deutsche makes it more likely that they were the big uglies who attacked the ships of the colonization fleet a good question sam said jonathan nodded but then remembered to make the proper hand gesture too sam went on i am not sure the one has anything to do with the other it might but i have no proof he would have been happy to incite the race against the nazis had he had proof he didnt think that would make his superiors happy though and he more or less understood why however thoroughgoing a lot of bastards the germans were they were also part of the balance of power he sighed life never turned out to be as simple as you thought it would when you were jonathans age or kassquits kassquit said i can understand why you would not admit any such thing about your own notempire but are the deutsche not your foes as well as the races that was also balanceofpower politics speaking carefully sam answered it is a truth that the united states and the reich were fighting a war when the race came but each decided the race was a bigger danger than the other i do not understand this kassquit said in the empire all tosevites would be at peace you would not fight the race and you would not fight among yourselves either is this not good one of the parts of the united statesprovinces is as close as i can come in your language but that is not quite righthas a slogan sam said that slogan is live free or die many many big uglies feel that way i do not understand kassquit repeated how are the tosevites in the usa or the sssr or the reich freer than those the empire rules sam wished she hadnt phrased the question like that millions of frenchmen and danes and lithuanians and ukrainians werent free or anything close to it neither were millions of germans or russians for that matter not all tosevite notempires are the same he said at last they look that way to us kassquit answered whoeverd raised her had done a good job she really did think of herself as a member of the race sam made a small clucking noise i hope i can do that well with mickey and donald no matter how unfair it is to them kassquit had trouble getting used to the way the wild big uglies looked at her with a male or female of the race eye turrets said exactly where eyes pointed the gaze of the tosevites was shiftier subtler she thought their eyes kept drifting down her body but they would return to her face whenever she was at the point of remarking on it their words were also confusing and evasive they steadfastly defended what was to her obvious nonsense and they seemed sure they made perfect sense alien she thought how can they be so strange when they look so much like me after a moment she realized she was the strange one by tosevite standards that realization was something of an intellectual triumph because she loathed the idea of judging herself by the standards of wild big uglies and the tosevites insisted they didnt have one set of standards but manyperhaps one for each of their notempires you are all one species she said how can you have more than one standard the empire has three speciesfour now counting tosevitesbut only one standard having many on a single planet is absurd ttomalss had also said the big uglies varied by culture but she wanted to hear how these wild ones explained it jonathan yeager said we do not always agree on what the right way to do things is sam yeager made the affirmative gesture sometimes there is no right or wrong way to do something only different ways being different is not always the same as being right or wrong i think the race has trouble seeing that back on home the race has no trouble seeing right from wrong kassquit said that was what shed been taught contact with tosevites has corrupted some of us to her surprise and annoyance both wild big uglies burst into loud barking yips of laughter that is not a truth superior female sam yeager said and used an emphatic cough i have met plenty of malesand some females now toowho are as crooked as any big ugly ever hatched he sounded very sure of himself in the face of direct experience how much was teaching worth kassquit decided to change the subject again what do the two of you hope to learn by these visits with me how to meet the race halfway jonathan yeager answered sam yeager amended that to see whether we can meet the race halfway if we cannot then perhaps war is the best hope we have after all live free or die it struck her as a slogan fit only for the hopelessly addled plainly it meant something different to the wild big uglies she did not want to explore that path again instead she pointed with her tongue at jonathan yeager and said it seems to me that you are meeting the race halfway i enjoy your culture he answered it interests me i am learning your language because i cannot deal with the race without it but under thishe patted his shaven head and tapped the body paint on his chestunder this i am still a tosevite with my own culture meeting you helped show me what a truth that is did it kassquit felt a pang of disappointment meeting you made me hope you were leading toward her voice trailed away she was not sure how to say what she wanted without giving offense sam yeager who seemed not to take offense easily spoke for her you thought jonathan was leading toward the races quiet bloodless conquest of tosev well yes kassquit made the affirmative gesture even if she wouldnt have been so frank as the wild tosevite then the older yeager surprised her again saying you could be right i do not know if you are frankly i doubt that you are but you could be why do you doubt it kassquit asked because no matter how much of the races outward culture we adoptno matter whether we start using body paint instead of wrapping no matter whether we reverence the spirits of emperors past instead of keeping our own superstitionswe are still too different from you sam yeager answered and we will stay different from you because of our sexuality and the social patterns that come from it truth jonathan yeager said his agreement with his father hurt kassquit more than the elder yeagers words and he went on in fact is not ginger making males and females of the race here on and around tosev more like us than like the race as it is back on home kassquit thought of felless who could not stop tasting ginger and who was going to lay her second clutch of eggs as a result she thought of the mating shed watched in a corridor of this very starship that had shaken her faith in the races wisdom and rationality she thought of the endless prohibitions against ginger and of how widely they were flouted i hope not she said and used an emphatic cough of her own but you recognize the possibility sam yeager asked i do not suppose i have to tell you that officials of the race recognize the possibility no you do not have to tell me that kassquit admitted i am quite aware of it i wish i were not but such is life indeed sam yeager said may i ask you another question he waited for her to use the affirmative gesture before going on you have talked about what you hope will happen with the big uglies and you have talked about what you hope will happen with the race what do you hope will happen to you ttomalss would sometimes ask her what she thought would happen or even what she wanted but what she hoped he didnt seem to think about that kassquit hadnt done a whole lot of thinking about it either after a long pause she said i do not know my position is too anomalous to give me the luxury of many hopes would you not agree yes as a matter of fact i would he replied i wondered if you understood that you might well be better off or at least have more peace of mind if you did not does that sound very callous it does indeed kassquit considered but then the truth often sounds callous does it not i fear it does sam yeager said one more question if you please he asked it before she could tell him yes or no what would you wish for yourself if you could have anything what would it be kassquit had hardly dared ask that question of herself ttomalss hadnt thought to ask about her desires any more than he had about her hopes to him she remained part experimental animal part hatchling over the past few years hed had to recognize that she had a will a mind of her own but he was a long way from liking the idea but she answered sam yeager without hesitation saying if i could have anything i wanted i would be rehatched as a female of the race sam yeager and jonathan yeager both made the affirmative hand gesture yes i can see how you would want that the older big ugly said let me ask it a different way thenif you could have anything you wanted that you might actually get what would it be that was harder all of kassquits material needs were met only in the social sphere did she have problems i do not know she said at last i have plenty to eat i have the races communication network what more in that regard could i desire she met question with question what would you choose sam yeager see how you like answering the big ugly yipped tosevite laughter the easy answer is more money ask any tosevite and he will say that or something like it he might ask for a bigger house or a fancier motorcar or other such things but it all means the same in the end unlike you we mostly do not have enough to keep us happy kassquit turned her head toward jonathan yeager and what of you i do not know if this is possible or not the younger tosevite answered but i hope i live long enough to be able to travel to home either on a ship of the race or on a tosevite starship a tosevite starship the very idea was a nightmare to kassquit as it was to every male and female of the race she didnt know whether she ought to spell that out so she contented herself with asking if that should prove impossible what would you like jonathan yeager hesitated sam yeager said something in their own language jonathan yeagers answer was short sam yeager laughed again he turned to kassquit and returned to the language of the race i told him that having a mate with whom he can be happy throughout his life is also important you did not wish for that yourself kassquit pointed out no but then i am lucky enough to have such a mate sam yeager answered jonathan has a female friend who may become such a mate but it is difficult to be sure about such things ahead of time what are the criteria for judging whether a mate is good or not kassquit asked if she was questioning the big uglies they couldnt very well question her she liked this better jonathan yeagers skin was more transparent than kassquits she could watch blood rise to his face shed felt the same thing in herself in moments of embarrassment so that was probably what he was feeling too if sam yeager also felt it he showed no sign he answered that varies from individual to individual a mate who makes one male or female happy would addle another in short order how does one judge the possibility that one of these lifelong matingsthe notion struck kassquit as very strangewill be successful some of that involves the sexual desire each partner arouses in the other and the sexual pleasure each gives the other sam yeager answered those are often enough reason for the partners to come together but they do not mean that the mating will be a longterm success the male and the female also have to be friends to see things in similar ways and to forgive each others small failings it is not easy to judge in advance whether this will happen she hadnt expected such a thoughtful answer she had only the races view of big ugly sexualitythat it was constant and indiscriminate it occurred to her that the race might have as much trouble understanding tosevites as the big uglies had understanding the race though ttomalss knew of her own sexual urges she doubted he understood them for that matter she doubted she understood them herself and wished she did what makes one tosevite sexually attractive to another she asked appearance jonathan yeager answered at once that is one thing often the most important thing at first sam yeager said but character is also important and perhaps more important in the long rum he paused then added i think character may be more important at first to females judging males than to males judging females why kassquit asked both wild big uglies shrugged they saw each other do it and both laughed kassquit noted the byplay without having any notion what might have caused it and then she found a question the tosevites were uniquely suited to answer one that would have been utterly meaningless if not repellent to ttomalss by your standards am i sexually attractive jonathan yeager had never imagined being asked such a question by a naked woman who obviously didnt know the answer he looked to his father for help only to discover his father looking back at him he needed a couple of seconds to understand why then he realized his dad was a married man and probably thought he wasnt the one to be talking about whether a woman was sexy or not and so jonathan had to figure out the answer for himself after a moment he realized only one answer was possible regardless of what he really thought yes he said and added an emphatic cough anything else would have been a diplomatic disaster by the speed with which his father added the lizards affirmative hand gesture he knew hed done the right thing better still he hadnt been lying he was used to girls who shaved their heads even though his own girlfriend didnt and living in gardena which a lot of japaneseamericans called home had accustomed him to oriental standards of beauty kassquit had a pretty faceit would have been prettier still of course had it shown more expressionand he could be in no possible doubt that she had a nice figure to go with it to his astonishment she folded herself into the posture of respect i thank you she said with an emphatic cough of her own you will understand that this is not a question i could possibly ask ttomalss or any other male or female of the race she corrected herself no that is not true i could ask but without hope of obtaining a meaningful answer she certainly wouldnt have been attractive to the lizards not when their everyday name for human being was big ugly jonathan tried to imagine what living among aliens would be like after you discovered the truth about your body and the delights it could bring he tried yes but felt himself failing the one thought that stuck in his mind was that he was damn glad it hadnt happened to him his father said there are times superior female when you must have beenmust bevery lonely truth kassquit said what was she thinking with her impassive features jonathan couldnt tell she went on i do not know if i myself realized how lonely i was until i first began communicating with you wild tosevites who can say with certainty where the intersection between biology and culture lies even among the race it remains a subject for debate it is among us tosevites too jonathan said mickey and donald at least wouldnt grow up worrying about whether they were sexually interesting unless they turned out to be females who went into their mating season or males who met a female in her season they wouldnt worry about such things at all jonathan suspected being a lizard was easier than being a human but what if one of thems a male and the others a female that hadnt occurred to him before it would sure complicate things then he shrugged even if it was so the yeagers wouldnt have to worry about it for a good many years yet how old were lizards when they hit puberty he couldnt remember have to look it up he thought kassquit said i do not find tosevite scientific research likely to be of much value before jonathan could respond indignantly to that his father shrugged and said well in that case i do not suppose you have any reason to want anything to do with us at all shall we go jonathan leaving was the last thing jonathan wanted but a glance at his fathers face warned him hed better play along all right he said and started to rise he turned to kassquit it was pleasant and interesting to talk with you again no do not go kassquits face still showed nothingit could show nothingbut alarm and grief filled her voice please do not go we had not yet come close to finishing this discussion jonathan looked down at the metal floor of the chamber so kassquit couldnt see him grin sure as hell his old man knew how to bait a hook and kassquit had swallowed the bait damned if she hadnt why should we stay if you mock us sam yeager asked sternly you are proud as the race is proud but it never occurs to the race that we big uglies also have reason to be proud of what we have done this is not something easy for a citizen of the empire to grasp kassquit said i meant no offense it wasnt quite an apology but it came closer than jonathan had expected he had to hide another smile kassquit wasnt apologizing because she hadnt intended to offend she was apologizing because she wanted to go on talking with the only other human beings shed ever met jonathan knew he wasnt the most socially conscious fellow around but he had no trouble seeing that not long after the colonization fleet arrived kassquit said i was asked if i wanted a tosevite male brought up from the surface of tosev as a means of obtaining sexual release i said no at the time the thought of a strange wild big ugly as a mate was too distressing to contemplate but the two of you do not seem like such strangers to me now jesus jonathan thought ive just been propositioned how am i supposed to say no when i just told her i thought she was attractive part of himone particular part of himdidnt want to say no if he said yes of course karen would kill him but karens down there and im up here in space she wouldnt have to know i wouldnt be unfaithful not really its research thats what it is while those thoughts were going through his mind his father said superior female you will have to forgive me i do find you attractive as i said but i am not in a position to do anything about it my permanent mate would be most unhappy if i were to mate with any female but her and i do not wish to make her unhappy in any way like any child jonathan had trouble imagining his parents making love with each other when he tried to imagine his father making love with kassquit the picture in his mind did not want to form and when he tried to imagine his father telling his mother hed made love with kassquit that picture would not form at all what he saw instead was the mushroom cloud from an explosivemetal bomb kassquit said i do not understand why such a mating would make her unhappy because we try to concentrate all our affection on our principal mate and an outside mating implies a loss of that affection jonathans father answered we have a word in our language that means something like affection but it is a stronger term we say love the last word necessarily was in english love kassquit echoed to her plainly it was just a noise sure enough she went on i do not understand but i gather you are telling me this is a strong custom among american tosevites jonathans father made the affirmative hand gesture kassquit turned her attention back to jonathan do i gather that you as yet have no such permanent mating commitment uh that is uh correct jonathan said and then wished hed lied instead of telling the truth a lie would have let him escape gracefully the truth made things more complicated he turned to his father and spoke in english what am i going to do dad good question his father sounded amused which only made things worse if you want to be this particular kind of guinea pig go ahead if you dont youll figure out some way around it what are the two of you talking about kassquit asked sharply we are trying to decide what is proper here jonathan answered which was true enough picking his words with great care he went on i do not have a permanent arrangement with a female no but i am seeing a female with whom i may have such an arrangement one day what does this meanyou are seeing her kassquit asked is this a euphemism for mating with her jonathans father had to translate euphemism for him the question made jonathan cough it also made him wonder how to answer he and karen hadnt actually gone to bed with each other but theyd sure done everything else he was damned if hed try to explain petting and oral sex to kassquit with his father listening instead keeping it simple he just said yes and that made his dads eyebrows shoot up too as hed known it would kassquit said if you do not have a permanent mating arrangement you may mate with whomever you choose is this not a truth do you choose to mate with me jonathan yeager that wasnt a proposition it was more like an ultimatum before jonathan could answer his father said superior female regardless of what my hatchling may decide there should be no matings at this meeting and why not kassquits face didnt show emotion but her voice did she sounded furious why not jonathans father echoed because the purpose of matingor a purpose of mating anyhowis reproduction do you want to take the chance of becoming gravid as a result of mating how well equipped is the race to handle that problem oh kassquit bent into the posture of respect i had not thought of that a lot of tosevites do not think of it ahead of time sam yeager answered dryly this ends up making their lives more difficult than they would be otherwiseor more interesting anyhow by his expression he was looking a long way back into the past had they been somewhere else jonathan might have asked him about it but not here not now what is the solution then kassquit asked it cannot be not mating that by what i am given to understand is not the tosevite way the usual american solution is a thin rubber sheath worn on the males reproductive organ sam yeager said jonathan admired his dispassionate tone it came easier in the language of the race but even so his father went on this permits mating but keeps sperm and egg from meeting ingenious kassquit said sanitary do you have any of these sheaths with you no jonathan said we did not expect the issue of mating to arise very well kassquit made the affirmative gesture next time you visit do bring some or i can arrange for a supply to be brought up from some of the territory the race rules is it agreed she sounded as brisk as if she were arranging a business deal maybe that was what she thought she was doing she had no idea what being human meantand she wanted to start learning in the most intimate way possible that made sense of a sort but only of a sort jonathan kept wondering if he wanted to be her teacher is it agreed she repeated jonathan looked at sam yeager his fathers face said nothing at all jonathan knew it was up to him no one else well no one from the starship was likely to tell karen which was more than he could say about most earthly situations ever so slightly he nodded it is agreed sam yeager said and jonathan couldnt tell for the life of him whether or not his dad thought he was doing the right thing tosevite sheaths for mating without the risk of reproduction ttomalss said bemusedly one eye turret on the recording of the meeting between kassquit and the two wild big uglies the other on kassquit herself yes superior sir kassquit said i can certainly understand how becoming gravid as the result of a mating would be undesirable these sheaths reduce the risk of such a mischance are you sure you are not being precipitate in this ttomalss had trouble getting used to the idea of kassquit grabbing at things with her own fingerclaws yes superior sir i am sure i would like to make the experiment at any rate kassquit told him remember some time ago you offered me a wild tosevite for such purposes i declined then but no longer wish to decline i see what ttomalss mostly saw was occasion to worry he knew how strongly the mating urge and the urge to form families affected the big uglies would kassquit become addicted to that gratification as so many males and females of the race had to ginger everything will be all right kassquit reassured him how can you know that in advance of the event ttomalss demanded the answer is you cannot you have committed yourself to this course of action without adequate forethought and if that wasnt a tosevite thing to do what was ttomalss did not tax kassquit with it though for fear of prompting an indignant denialanother typical tosevite response i have not she said i have been considering this pondering it since you made your offer to me some time ago indeed i have been pondering it longer than thatever since i discovered some of the physiological responses of my own body this is something evolution has adapted me to do she was likely to be right in that she was almost certain to be right in that in fact even so ttomalss said suppose i forbid it i have the authority to do so as you must know on what grounds would you do such a thing kassquit demanded angrily and you do not have the authority i must assuredly do ttomalss hadnt intended to get angry in return but found he couldnt help himself and my authority is based on my continuing wardship of you i see kassquit leaned forward and glared at him so all your talk about my being a citizen of the empire was nothing but talk is that what you are telling me now superior sir she made the title one of reproach so much for any hope of equality i see calm yourself ttomalss exclaimed though he was feeling anything but calm himself dealing with big uglies had that effect on him though he hadnt thought of kassquit as a big ugly in such matters for quite a while i am trying to see what is best for you this of course is for your own longterm good he wondered if mature tosevites ever spoke to their hatchlings thus he doubted it how likely were any big uglies young or old to value the longterm at the expense of the immediate kassquit certainly remained unconvinced considering who i am and what i am who are you to judge my longterm good no one either among the race or among the big uglies is so well suited to evaluate that as i am myself i am in this particular case unique and my judgment must stand a moment ago you were claiming you were not unique you were claiming to be a citizen of the empire ttomalss pointed out which is it it cannot be both at once you know you are being deliberately obstructive kassquit said that was a truth but not one ttomalss intended to admit kassquit went on you realize you are trying to keep me from following a course you once urged on me you cannot do both at once either superior sir you do not seem to understand what a large step mating is for a tosevite ttomalss said you are taking it too lightly and you are equipped to understand this better forgive me superior sir but i doubt it yes kassquit could be devastating when she chose and she chose now ttomalss said i told you i believe you were hasty in this may i propose a compromise go ahead though i do not see where there is room for one kassquit said either i shall mate with this wild big ugly or i shall not we will obtain some of these sheaths ttomalss didnt think that would be difficult but i want you to consider whether they should be used and i want there to be some little while before the wild big ugly comes up here this may be wise in any case in the event of war between the race and the reich all space travel may well entail unacceptable risks now kassquit exclaimed in dismay do you truly believe war is likely superior sir with along hissing sigh ttomalss answered i wish i did not but i am afraid i do having visited the reich having sojourned there i must say that the deutsche are of all the tosevites i have seen and heard of the least susceptible to reason they are also among the most technically adept and the most arrogant it strikes me as a combination bound to cause trouble and grief it strikes me as a combination logically impossible kassquit replied and that is also a truth ttomalss replied but logic like reason goes by the board far more often on tosev than it does here and because the deutsche are so fond of reasoning from premises that strike even other big uglies as absurd logic however well applied becomes less valuable the most perfect logic cannot make truth hatch from false premises what will we do if they attack this ship kassquit asked logic should be able to tell you that ttomalss answered unless we can deflect or prematurely detonate a missile with an explosivemetal warhead it will destroy us we have to hope we are not attacked he hoped kassquit wouldnt ask him how likely it was that the race could deflect or prematurely detonate deutsch missiles he knew too well what the answer was not very when the conquest fleet came to tosev no one had imagined the big uglies would ever be in a position to assail orbiting starships the ships had had some antimissile launchers added in the years since the tosevites taught the race how inadequate its imagination was but few males thought they could knock down everything kassquit didnt choose the question ttomalss dreaded but did ask a couple related to it if the deutsche do go to war with the race how much damage can they do to us and to our colonies can they cripple us to the point where we would be vulnerable to attacks from the other tosevite notempires i do not know the answers there ttomalss said slowly i would doubt that even the exalted fleetlord knows the answers there my opinionand it is only my opinionis that they could hurt us badly though i do not know just how badly or whether they could as you say cripple us but of this i am sure if they undertake to attack us we will smash them to the point where they will never be able to do so again he used an emphatic cough to show how sure he was good kassquit said with an emphatic cough of her own i thank you superior sir to some degree that relieves my mind i am glad to hear it ttomalss replied that was a truth the psychological researcher knew more than a little relief at having managed to distract his ward from thoughts of mating with the wild big ugly named jonathan yeager of course the means of distracting her was contemplating great damage to the race and the devastation of a goodsized stretch of tosev it occurred to him that such distractions might be more expensive than they were worth and this one didnt even prove completely successful kassquit said very well then superior sir after this discussion i do understand the need for delay in carrying out these matings but once the crisis with the deutsche is resolved i want to go forward with them assuming of course that part of the resolution does not involve the destruction of this ship yesassuming ttomalss tone was dry i assure you kassquit you have made your views on that matter very plain and i will do what i can consistent with your safety and welfare to obtain for you that which you desire that which you lust after he thought biologically she was a big ugly sure enough pointing that out though would only inflame the situation further instead of doing anything so counterproductive he asked do we need to concern ourselves with other topics at this time no superior sir kassquit answered no matter what she was biologically she did belong to the race as far as culture went recognizing ttomalss question as a dismissal she rose briefly assumed the posture of respect and left his office he sighed again once she was gone hed managed to slow her a bit but shed seized the initiative she was going to do what she wanted to do not what he and the rest of the race wanted her to do and if that didnt recreate in miniature the history of the relationship between the race and the big uglies he didnt know what did hoping to distract himself from worries about kassquitand from larger worries about the deutsche a situation over which he had no control whateverhe turned to the latest news reports on the computer monitor deutsch bluster formed a part of those too if the big uglies were bluffing they were doing a masterful job he feared they werent video from elsewhere on tosev came up on the screen rioting brown big uglies most of whom wore only a strip of white cloth wrapped around their reproductive organs the races commentator said farmers in the subregion of the main continental mass known as india have resorted to violence to protest the appearance of hashett in their fields the plant from home is of course a prime feed source for our own domestic animals but the big uglies are concerned because it is successfully competing against grains they use for food no males or females of the race were reported injured in this latest round of unrest but property damage is widespread if hashett grew well on tosev other crops from home would too they would help make this world a more homelike place as would the spread of the races domestic animals if tosev did not go up in nuclear explosions the race might do very well for itself here if can we acculturate the big uglies before they go to war with us that was the question no doubt about it increasing the tosevites reverence for the spirits of emperors past would help ttomalss was sure of that but it would help only slowly danger was growing in a hurry the race was running up against a deadline not a situation familiar to its males and females what can we do ttomalss wondered can we do anything he could hope past that he had no answers which worried him more than anything as gorppet patrolled the streets of cape town his eye turrets swiveled this way and that he was as always alert for the possibility of trouble from the big uglies who crowded those streets the darkskinned tosevites were supposed to be much more friendly to the race than the pinkish beige ones but he trusted none of them to a male whod served in the sssr in basra and in baghdad all big uglies were objects of suspicion till proved otherwise but gorppets eye turrets swiveled this way and that for other reasons too he kept waiting for a male with an investigators commission to come up tap him on the flank and say come along with me for interrogation it hadnt happened yet he had trouble understanding why it hadnt by the spirits of emperors past he and his pals had got into a firefight not only with the big uglies whod wanted to hijack his gold without giving him any ginger but also with a patrol of his own kind for all he knew he might have shot another male of the race that wasnt mutiny not quite but it came too close for comfort he knew the race would be turning everything inside out to find out who had committed such a crime they havent caught me yet he thought maybe being officially a hero helped hed captured the infamous khomeini after all who could imagine that a male with such a glorious accomplishment on his record might also be a male interested in acquiring large amounts of ginger no one had imagined it yet gorppet counted himself very lucky that no one had any investigator with a nasty suspicious mind would have noticed that his credit balance which had swollen with the bonus hed won for capturing the tosevite fanatic then proceeded to shrink not long after he came to cape town but it was growing again by now it was almost back to where it had been before he turned so much credit into gold hed sold a good deal of ginger even now an investigator who looked only at his current balance and not at his transaction record would be unlikely to notice anything out of the ordinary maybe i will get away with it he thought he wouldnt have bet a fingerclaw clipping on that when hed returned to his barracks after the threecornered gunfight had the investigators descended on him then he would have confessed everything now now he intended to fight them as aggressively as if they were so many big ugly bandits he turned a corner and came onto a street where vehicle traffic had halted several hundred tosevites on foot filled the street from curb to curb almost all of them were of the pinkish beige variety they carried signs lettered in the angular local script which gorppet couldnt read he couldnt understand their shouts either but those cries didnt sound friendly a handful of males of the race were walking along with the big uglies keeping an eye turret on what they were up to there werent nearly enough males not in gorppets view from his experience in basra a parade of this sort always led to fights often to gunplay suppress them he called to one of the males but the male to his surprise made the negative hand gesture it is not necessary he said and then noting gorppets body paint it is not necessary superior sir i do not expect any trouble to arise from this demonstration why not gorppet exclaimed they will go from fighting to shooting any moment now they always do do i gather superior sir that you are new to this subregion the other male asked he sounded of all things amused well what if i am gorppet knew how he sounded disbelieving no male who wasnt addled would have sounded any other way it is only that you do not know that peaceful protest was a tradition here at least among these pale big uglies before the race conquered this area the other male said if we let them yell and fuss and release energy in this fashion we have less trouble here than we would otherwise think of it as a safety valve venting pressure that might otherwise lead to an explosion in gorppets experience parades didnt vent pressurethey manifested it he asked what are they fussing and yelling about here a small increase in the tax on meat the other male replied that is all gorppet had trouble believing it what do they do if they get worked up over something really important then they start shooting at us from ambush and we have to take steps against them the other male replied but this is for show nothing more we may even end up reducing the tax increase somewhat to give them the impression that we care about what they think even when we do not i see gorppet said slowly this has a kind of deviousness i find appealing it is not like this believe me in the lands that cling to the muslim superstition he used an emphatic cough marches there are not for show no indeed it is not usually like this with the darkskinned tosevites either said the male who was keeping an eye turret on the marching big uglies when they come out into the streets trouble often follows but these pale ones seem to take the parade for a real action strange i know but true very strange gorppet said it must make them easier to administer than they would be otherwise truth the other male said when we ended the privileges their kind had enjoyed and we enforced equal treatment far all varieties of tosevites within this subregion they were outraged and rebellious but once they saw we were not to be shifted from that courseand once we quashed their uprisingsthey settled down and now the biggest trouble we have with them is ginger trafficking ah gorppet said and his guilty conscience twinged is that a severe problem here is it not a severe problem everywhere the other male answered when it was just a matter of you or me tasting it was not such an important business i agree but with females involved it became more important have you never had pheromones reach your scent receptors every now and then gorppet admitted sometimes more often than every now and then it makes me feel as shameless as a big ugly well there you are superior sir the other male said it is the same for everyone which is why ginger is such a problem truth gorppet said and went on his way ginger was not a problem for him hed been tasting ever since the race first discovered what the herb could do oh hed let himself get a little addled every now and again but most of the time he was pretty careful with his tastes so were a large number of the males from the conquest fleet theyd had plenty of practice with ginger they knew what it could do for them and they knew what it could do to them too on the other fork of the tongue the colonists were still learningand females who bad trouble learning addled the males around them too most of the really large sales gorppet had made were to colonists seeking excess they were fools gorppet was convinced they would have got into trouble regardless of whether he was the one who sold them the herb he looked back with one eye turret the protesting big uglies went round a corner herded along by that handful of males from the race for all the noise the tosevites made they evidently werent after trouble they might as well have been a herd of azwaca driven to a fresh part of their feeding range domesticated gorppet thought they werent completely domesticated not the way azwaca were but they were getting there the muslim big uglies farther north by contrast remained wild beasts and what of the tosevites in the independent notempires gorppet hadnt had much to do with them since the fighting stopped but theyd kept on being independent that argued they were tough customers still and a long way from domestication or assimilation or whatever the race wanted to call it so did the pugnaciousness of the notempire called the reich gorppet had fought deutsch soldiers as well as russkis in the sssr he hadnt liked them then he still didnt and now they had more in the way of technology than theyd enjoyed then that went a long way toward making them more dangerous but when gorppet got back to his barracks all thoughts of big uglies even pugnacious ones disappeared from his head a couple of males whose body paint showed they were from the inspector generals office awaited him there you are gorppet recently promoted to the rank of smallunit group leader it was phrased as a questionit even came with an interrogative coughbut it was not a question i am superior sir gorppet answered more calmly than he felt and who are you if they had him they had him if they didnt he was cursed if he would make life easy for them who we are is of no consequence nor is it any of your business the other male said we ask the questions here sure enough he had the arrogance that went with the office he served go ahead and ask then i have nothing to hide gorppet was guilty of enough that one more lie wouldnt hurt him in the leastif they had him if they did theyd have to show him they did the other inspector spoke up are you now or have you ever been acquainted with tosevites named rance auerbach and penny summers if they knew enough to ask they could tell whether he lied or not on that one i have met them a few times he answered they are more interesting than most big uglies because they speak our language fairly wellthe female better than the male i have not seen them for some little while however why do you wish to know we ask the questions here the first male repeated were you aware that they were and are notorious ginger smugglers no superior sir gorppet said gingersmuggling is illegal and we never discussed anything illegal discussing illegal acts is illegal in itself is it not it is indeed both males from the inspectorate said together the second one went on nowwhen was the last time you saw these two big uglies i do not precisely remember gorppet answered as i say it was some time ago do you know what has become of them i rather miss their company was that too audacious hed find out together the two males made the negative gesture we were hoping you would be able to tell us the second one said gorppet made the same gesture himself i am sorry superior sir but i cannot do it i hope nothing unfortunate has happened to them that was even true especially when he thought of rance auerbach the big ugly had been through the worst the fighting could do just as gorppet had himself we do not know the first inspector said we believe however that they were involved in the recent unfortunate incident you do know to which matter i refer i believe so superior sirgossip is everywhere gorppet answered i hope not for their sakes and you dont know about me after all he felt like laughing in the inspectors faces mordechai anielewicz had just sat down to supper when airraid sirens began to wail in the streets of lodz bertha exclaimed in dismay and set the roast chicken she was bringing in from the kitchen down on the table mordechai sprang to his feet grab your masks everyone he said then down to the cellar as fast as we can go his own gas mask was right behind him he pulled it on wondering how much good it would do hed already made the acquaintance of german poison gas once hed been lucky then heinrich jager had had syringes of the antidote even so hed almost died a second exposure he didnt want to think about it bertha had her mask on so did miriam and david heinrich where was heinrich anielewicz shouted his younger sons name ive got my mask father heinrich anielewicz shouted back from the bedroom but i cant find pancer leave the beffel mordechai exclaimed weve got to get down to the cellar i cant leave him heinrich said ohhere he is under the bed ive got him he came out with the beffel in his arms all rightwe can go now the sirens were shrieking like lost souls mordechai whacked heinrich on the backside as his son hurried past him you put yourself in danger and your whole family with you on account of your pet he snapped im sorry heinrich said but pancer saved us once you know so i thought i ought to save him too if i could that wasnt the sort of response to which anielewicz could find an easy comeback heinrich didnt see his life as more important than the beffels come on mordechai said bertha carefully shut the door behind them as they hurried down the hall down the stairs and into the cellar below the block of flats everyone else in the building hurried with them men women and children all wearing masks that turned them from people into pigsnouted aliens there you see from behind his mask heinrichs stillpiping voice rose in triumph theyve got a dog and theyve got a cat i see anielewicz said the other thing i see is they took chances they shouldnt have and so did you heinrichs older brother had a more urgent more important question if an explosivemetal bomb goes off in lodz how much good will hiding in the cellar do us it depends on just where the bomb goes off david mordechai answered i dont know for sure how much good it will do i do know weve got a better chance in the cellar than upstairs by the time he and his family got in the cellar was already packed people talked in high excited voices mordechai didnt talk he did worry the cellar didnt hold enough food and water to let people last very long before being forced to go out hed complained to the manager whod nodded politely and not done a thing if the worst came it didnt not this evening instead the allclear blew a long steady blast of sound thank god bertha said quietly just another drill mordechai agreed but with things the way they are we cant know ahead of time so we have to treat every one like the real thing lets go upstairs supper wont even be cold he took off his mask breathing unfiltered air even in the cramped quarters of the cellar felt far better than the seemingly lifeless stuff he got through the rubber and charcoal of the mask after supper bertha was washing dishes with miriam helping her when the telephone rang mordechai picked it up hello just another drill david nussboym sounded wryly amused with the world yes just another drill mordechai agreed nu he didnt know how to respond to the man whose hirelings had come unpleasantly close to killing him a couple of times when do you suppose the real thing will come along nussboym asked he didnt seem to feel the least bit guilty about what hed done what molotov didnt tell you before he sent you out here anielewicz jeered no as a matter of fact he didnt replied the jew from lodz whod become an nkvd man he told me i would be the best man on the spot because of my old connections here but that was all anielewicz wondered how to take that you know molotov personally he said sure you do just like i know the pope say hello to him for me next time you see him nussboym answered imperturbably know molotov personally i dont think anyone does except maybe his wife but i deal with him if thats what you mean im the one who got him out of his cell in the middle of berias coup he spoke matteroffactly enough if he was lying anielewicz couldnt prove it by his tone if he sent you here thinking thered be a war he didnt do you any favors he observed this thought also occurred to me nussboym said but i serve the soviet union he spoke without selfconsciousness hed been a red before anielewicz and some of the other jewish fighters in lodz spirited him off to the ussr because he was also too friendly with the lizards theyd been playing a double game with the race and the germans theyd got away with it too but mordechai didnt ever want to have to take such chances again he said and what does serving the soviet union mean about your being here now i volunteered for this because i know lodz and because your interests and the soviet unions coincide for the time being david nussboym answered we both want to stop the war any way we can this is what you get for going to bed with the fascists during the fighting no he hadnt forgotten what had happened all those years ago either with a sigh anielewicz answered if the race had beaten the nazis then odds are theyd have beaten the russians too and what soviet union would you be serving these days if that had happened i dont deal in mighthavebeens nussboym said as if mordechai had accused him of a particularly unsavory vice i deal in whats real all right anielewicz said amiably whats real here if the germans come over the border what do we do about it do we start yelling for soviet soldiers to help drive them away he chuckled under his breath figuring that would get a rise out of his former colleague if anything could and it did no nussboym exclaimed had he been a lizard he would have used an emphatic cough formally the ussr is and will stay neutral in case of conflict molotov doesnt want the germans and the race landing on russia with both feet eh behind that cynical tone mordechai felt a certain amount of sympathy for the soviet leaders position would you nussboym returned which showed he was thinking along similar lines maybe yes maybe no anielewicz was damned if hed admit anything and that brings me back to what the devil youre doing here if russias neutral why arent you back in moscow twiddling your thumbs formally the soviet union is neutral david nussboym repeated informally informally what mordechai demanded do you want to split poland with the germans again the way you did in that was proposed i am given to understand nussboym answered general secretary molotov rejected the proposal out of hand was it did he mordechai thought about what that was likely to mean hes more afraid of the race than of the nazis then fair enough if i were living in the kremlin i would be too he thought a little more if russia gives informal help here you might even end up on the lizards good side nobody ever said molotov was a fool anybody who stayed alive all the way through stalins time couldnt be a fool you dont know what youre talking about nussboym said softly you havent the faintest idea what youre talking about and if you still believe in god you can thank him you dont mordechais voice went harsh all right then tukhus afen tish nussboym what will you do what wont you do how much can we count on you privately he didnt intend to count on nussboym at all counting on the ussr though was or at least might be something else again we will not do anything that makes it look as though the soviet union is interfering in poland replied the nkvd man whod grown up in lodz short of that well theres always been a lot of smuggling along the border between white russia and poland we can get you weapons we can even get you a cadre of polishspeaking soldiers to train new recruits oh ill bet you can anielewicz said and youd train them to be just the finest little marxistleninists anybody could want wouldnt you he hadnt used the jargon much since the fighting stopped but he still remembered it one of these days the revolution will come to poland nussboym said one of these days the revolution will come to home he might not believe in god any more but he still had a strong and vibrant faith arguing with him struck anielewicz as more trouble than it was worth instead he asked how much good is all this likely to do if the reich hits us with explosivemetal bombs and poison gas they wont kill everyone nussboym spoke with a peculiar coldblooded confidence german generals doubtless sounded much the same way soldiers will have to come into poland and seize the land when they do the survivors from among your forces can make life difficult for them youre leaving the lizards out of your calculations anielewicz said whatever else they do they wont sit quietly i know that nussboym said my assumption is that they will give the reich exactly what it deserves that ought to make the fight in poland easier dont you think the nazis wont be able to support their troops the way they could in again cold calculation weighing the probable result of thousandsno millionsof deaths again that calculation however horrific struck mordechai as reasonable and wasnt making reasonable calculations about millions of deaths perhaps the most horrific thing of all the next question of course is what happens after the race finishes destroying the reich mordechai said then the soviet union picks up the piecesprovided there are any pieces left to pick up nussboym answered the other half of the question is how much damage can the nazis do to the lizards before going down however much it is too much of it will be in poland mordechai predicted gloomily so from my point of view that leads to a different question can we do anything to keep the war from starting youd better think about that too nussboym as long as youre here i have been thinking about it david nussboym answered what i havent been able to do is come up with anything to stop the war and neither i gather have you he hung up before mordechai could either curse him or tell him he was right tahiti wasnt what rance auerbach had expected oh the weather was gorgeous always warm and mild and just a little muggy and he could walk along the beach under the palm trees and watch the gentle surf roll in off the blue blue pacific that was all terrific even if he did get a hellacious sunburn the first time he tried it hed had to slather zincoxide ointment all over his poor mediumrare carcass as far as setting went hed had everything straight papeete now where he and penny were renting an apartment even more crowded and cramped than the one theyd had in cape town papeete was something else the town didnt quite know what to make of itself parts of it were still the sleepy even languorous backwater the place must have been back before the fighting started a generation earlier the rest was what had come since the places role as the capital of free france such as free france was the tricolor flew everywhere in papeete the same way the stars and stripes did back in the usa on the fourth of july but the stars and stripes flew out of honest pride and strength rance didnt think that was why the free french draped their banner over everything that didnt move rather they seemed to be saying hey look at us we really are a country honest no kidding see weve got a flag and everything stick tapping on the sidewalk auerbach made his way toward his apartment building tahitian girls were all around some walking like him some on bicycles some on the little motorbikes that turned people into more or less guided missiles a lot of them were very pretty even so rances fantasy life wasnt what it had been before a series of battered freighters brought him and penny here from south africa what he hadnt considered was that a lot of those pretty tahitian girls had hulking badtempered tahitian boyfriends some of whom carried knives and some of whom were a lot more heavily armed than that one such massive tahitian wearing nothing but a pair of dungarees and a gun belt with a pistol on his right hip loomed up in front of auerbach as he walked into his building when the fellow grinned he showed very white teethand a hole where one in front had been till he lost it in a brawl allo rance how you are today he asked in english flavored by both french and tahitian not too bad jeanclaude auerbach answeredabout as much as hed ever say these days you take care of that leaky toilet in our bathroom yet i do it soon the handyman promised very very soon hed been saying that ever since rance and penny moved in a couple of weeks before sometimes it was hard to tell tropical languor from being a lazy bum but rance didnt feel easy about leaning on a guy half his age who outweighed him almost two to one and packed a pistol to boot a fan buzzed inside the apartment penny summers sat in a chair letting the stream of moving air play on her face and neck she turned her head when rance came in we ever gonna get that toilet fixed she asked doesnt look likely rance said maybe the son of a bitchll do it if we pay him off if we dont you can forget about it itll just have to stay leaky then penny said she made a weary unhappy gesture we took a hundred pounds of gold away from cape town near enough who wouldve figured that wouldnt do the job comes to something a little over forty thousand bucks rance said thats a pretty fair piece of change but penny shook her head a lock of blond hair escaped a hairpin and fell down in front of one eye she brushed it back with an impatient gesture we had to spend like it was going out of style just to get here and more to keep from getting handed over to the lizards and everything here costs more than anybody in his right mindd believe of course it does auerbach said this is the boondocks the ass end of nowhere nobody makes anything here everything gets shipped in from places where they really do make stuff no wonder we pay through the nose hey they do make one thing here penny said rance raised a dubious eyebrow yeah whats that sweetheart trouble penny answered with a grin and they make it in great big carload lots too why else would we be here but we dont have enough money to make all the trouble we want auerbach said if wed brought a hundred pounds of hundreddollar bills where was gorppet going to get his hands on hundreddollar bills in cape town penny broke in dont make me laugh weve got a stake we just cant afford to get fancy till we run it up some i know i know rance said if we dont run it up were ruined when what weve got runs out penny said flatly if theres one thing this place runs on its cold hard cash they dont give a damn about whose cash its supposed to be either i know that too auerbach paused and lit a cigarette he coughed as he sucked in smoke which made his ruined chest hurt and that wasnt the only ache the coffin nails gave him here holding up the pack he said you know how much these goddamn things cost you bet i do penny answered give me one will you he took one out and handed it to her then awkwardly bent forward putting a lot of weight on his stick so she could start it on his her cheeks hollowed as she inhaled listen ive got a line on a guy wholl sell us some ginger now all we need to do is get a lizard to buy and were in business for a while longer whos the guy rance asked somebody new or do you know him from before from beforei dealt with him back when i was working with those people in detroit penny said his names richard she pronounced it reeshard which meant the fellow was a frenchman is he pals with the guys you used to work for rance asked if he is hes liable to want you dead after the way you stuffed them nobodys really pals with anybody in the ginger racket penny said from what auerbach had seen of it she wasnt far wrong i didnt stiff richard so him and me wont be anything but business heres hoping youre right auerbach limped into the kitchen poured himself a drink of the nasty local brandy and cut it with a little water the stuff was too harsh and too potent for anybody in his right mind to want to drink it straight he poured a knock for penny too she grinned and blew him a kiss when she saw the drinks in his hands when he gave her one she raised the glass and said mud in your eye yeah rance sipped wheezed and for a wonder managed not to cough jesus that stuff kicks like a mule as penny also drank he studied her if he were this richard how far would he trust her about as far as i can throw her he decided the fellow selling the ginger would have to be wondering where shed got the cash this time and whether shed try to cheat him hed be a jerk if he didnt come loaded for bear for once penny didnt seem to know where his thoughts were going she said we get ourselves a discount on the herb for paying in gold do we auerbach thought about that too not all his thoughts were pleasant wed better talk with jeanclaude then or with somebody well want some firepower along so your pal doesnt try redistributing the wealth he watched penny she took a deep breath he knew exactly what she was going to say something along the lines of oh he wouldn t do anything like that rance intended to land on her with both feet if she did but she didnt instead she looked sheepish and answered yeah wed better do something about that hadnt we he let out a rasping sigh of relief oh good you remember frederick after all yeah her mouth twisted that stupid greedy son of a bitch you even told him there was plenty for everybody and you were dead right too but would he listen hell no of course frederick was an amateur and richards a pro hes been doing this for a long time anybody can get greedy rance spoke with great conviction best way to make him think twice is to show hed pay for it if he tried well i wont try and tell you youre wrong because i think youre right penny said you want to talk to jeanclaude or would you rather i did it go ahead bat your baby blues youll get a better deal out of him than i could rance wasnt particularly worried about penny fooling around with the tahitian muscleman for one thing jeanclaude was only in his midtwenties so he wasnt all that likely to find her appealing and for another jeanclaude had a girlfriend of formidable proportions and equally formidable temper auerbach wouldnt have wanted to cross her and he didnt think jeanclaude did either now penny was following his thoughts for she stuck out her tongue at him he laughed and said you dont want to do that at a native its sort of like asking for a fight now the next question is once weve got the ginger how much trouble will we have selling it to a lizard we should manage penny said theres always plenty of em around this place draws shady characters the way honey draws flies she took another sip from her brandy were here arent we uhhuh i wondered when youd mention that rance said but she was right the free french ran a wideopen outfit they stayed in business by skimming a little off the top of the deals that got made in their territory by not asking a whole lot of inconvenient questions and by keeping the japanese the americans and the lizards all too busy eyeing one another for any of them to kill the goose that laid the golden eggs and so even as penny and he went to meet richard along with jeanclaude and several other large beefy pieces of hired muscle auerbach saw half a dozen lizards on the streets of papeete all of them in conversation with humans who looked shady takes one to know one he thought richard was small and lithe and surrounded by bodyguards who looked a lot nastier than the ones rance and penny had along he spoke english with an accent partly french partly southwestern as if hed learned the language by watching a lot of horse operas you got the goods he askedthe subject under discussion might have been wagon wheels not gold sure do penny answered do you you bet richard said and gestured to one of his henchmen the burly tahitian held up a parcel wrapped in twine at richards gesture he opened it the spicy tang of ginger tickled rances nose richard gestured again this time to penny check itgo right ahead no false weight no false measure im a straight dealer had he said he was a straight shooter auerbach would have believed that too penny did check tasting the herb and probing to make sure the package held nothing but ginger when satisfied she turned to auerbach pay him rance with a nod he passed a little caseit didnt have to be a big oneholding ten pounds of gold to richard this was the nasty moment as soon as the case was out of his hand that hand slid down toward his own pistol the temptation to keep the ginger and grab the gold had to be therehad to be there on both sides in fact for richard and his bodyguards were awfully intent themselves but here unlike the cape town park everything went smoothly the frenchman examined the gold as carefully as penny had checked the ginger when he said cest bon his bully boys visibly relaxed then he returned to english good luck unloading that stuff enjoyed doing business with you and off he went wed better unload it rance muttered theyd just traded away a lot of what they were living on they couldnt buy groceries with ginger not directly if things went wrong relax penny said were in business again she sounded confident but then she always sounded confident rance sighed he had to hope she was right two please reuven russie said in hebrew to the ticketseller at the cinema the man gave him a blank stare he repeated the request in arabic and handed the fellow a banknote the ticketsellers face lit up he passed reuven two tickets then quickly and accurately made change thanks reuven told him again in arabic he switched to english come on jane still should be plenty of good seats right jane archibald said also in english she went on that bloke should know more hebrew hes probably just come from some little country village in the middle of nowhere reuven answered hell learn i expect he paused at the snack counter inside the building to buy a couple of rolled papers full of fried chickpeas and two glasses of cocacola nibbling and drinking he and jane went through the curtains and into the theater itself they did get good seats but it was filling faster than reuben had expected the crowd was about twothirds jews onethird arabs and will you look at that reuven pointed to three or four lizards who sat in the front row so they wouldnt have to peer over and around taller people in seats in front of them why do you suppose they want to watch the battle of chicago their side lost after all maybe they think its funny but them losing is good enough reason for me to want to see it janes voice took on the grim edge it always held when she talked about the lizards she sighed i only wish they could make that kind of film about the fighting in australia i know reuven didnt have the same attitude about the coming of the race but then the lizards had conquered janes homeland while theyd freed his people from almost certain death when they drove the nazis out of poland he reached out and took her hand she smiled at him and squeezed his he went on what surprises me is that the lizards are letting people here see the film jane shrugged if the americans ever conquer the world itll be on account of their cinema not their guns before reuven could find a good answer for that the house lights dimmed and the cartoon started it too was american with donald duck rampaging across the screen he spokespluttered ratherin english with hebrew and arabic subtitles children obviously too young to read who obviously didnt speak english giggled at his antics so did reuven anybody who couldnt laugh at donald duck had to have something wrong with him somewhere he also kept glancing over at jane her elegant profile illuminated by the flickering light from the screen she was laughing too but after the cartoon ended and the main feature started her features grew solemn intent as far as reuven was concerned the battle of chicago was just another shootemup with tanks and airplanes instead of galloping horses and sixshooters he paid more attention to the pretty blond french actress who played a nurse in an improbably tight improbably skimpy uniform than he did to rattling machine guns and spectacular explosions not so jane whenever the lizards looked as if they were on the point of breaking through she squeezed his hand hard enough to hurt and she whooped and cheered every time the americans rallied when the explosivemetal bomb went off and blew the lizards army to kingdom come she leaned over and kissed him for that he would have put up with a much longer much duller film if only we could have done it to them in a lot more places she said with another sigh as the credits rolled across the screen well the germans may try it again reuven answered do you really like the notion of airraid drills and more nuclear explosions and poison gas and who can guess what all else i dont not very much jane thought for several seconds before saying if another war would get rid of the lizards once and for all id be for it no matter what else it might do but i dont think that will happen no matter how much i wish it would and the bloody nazis wouldnt be any better than the race as top dogs would they worse if you ask me reuven said of course theyd throw me in an oven first and ask questions later jane got up and started for the exit hard to believe they really did that to peoplethat its not just lizard propaganda i mean i wish it were reuven said but if you dont believe me talk to my father he saw a couple of their murder factories with his own eyes this was he knew not the ideal sort of conversation when out for a good time with a very pretty girl but the battle of chicago and the present world situation had put such thoughts in both their minds he went on if the lizards hadnt come there probably wouldnt be any jews left in poland i wouldnt be alive was what that meant though he shied away from thinking of it in those terms if the germans had won the war there probably wouldnt be any jews left anywhere they walked out into the night past people coming in for the next show slowly jane said when i was a little girl we used to think jews were traitors because they got on so well with the lizards i never really understood why you did till i came here to palestine to study at the medical college reuven shrugged if the only choices youve got are the reich and the race youre caught betweenbetween he snapped his fingers in annoyance what are you caught between in english i cant remember the devil and the deep blue sea jane suggested thats it thanks reuven said what would you like to do now shall i walk you back to the dormitory no jane said and used one of the races emphatic coughs between the dorm and the college i feel like im in gaol half the time this is your city you get to go out and about in it i dont not nearly enough all right then reuven said lets go to makarios coffeehouse its only a couple of blocks away jane nodded eagerly smiling reuven slid his arm around her waist she snuggled against him his smile got broader run by a greek from cyprus makarios was as close to neutral ground as jerusalem had jews and muslims and christians all drank coffeeand sometimes stronger thingsthere and ate stuffed grape leaves and chatted and argued and dickered far into the night lizards showed up there too every now and again rumor was that makarios sold ginger out the back door of the coffeehouse reuven didnt know if that was true but it wouldnt have surprised him he and jane found a quiet little table off in a corner the coffee was turkish style thick and sweet and strong served in small cups jane said well i wont have to worry about sleeping any more tonight she opened her eyes very wide to show what she meant reuven laughed he drained his own demitasse and waved to the waiter for a refill evkharisto he said when it arrived hed learned a few words of greek from children hed played with in london during the fighting thank you was one of the handful of clean phrases he remembered he and jane didnt leave makarios till after midnight the streets of jerusalem were quiet almost deserted it wasnt a town that hummed around the clock reuven put his arm around jane again when she moved toward him instead of pulling back he kissed her her arms went around him too she was as tall as he was and very nearly as strongshe all but squeezed the breath out of him his hands cupped her bottom pulling her against him she had to know what was going through his mindand through his endocrine system and she did when at last the kiss broke she murmured i wish there were somewhere we could go if they went back to the medical students dormitory theyd hatch gossip maybe even scandal reuven didnt know which hotels turned a blind eye to couples who wanted to check in without baggage he imagined making love to jane in the parlor of his familys house and having the twins interrupt at the worst possible moment and then instead of despair inspiration struck there is he exclaimed and kissed her again as much from delight at his own cleverness as from desirealthough desire was there too oh indeed it was where jane asked youll see reuven answered come along with me he feared shed said what she said because she thought they really didnt have anywhere to go and that she would balk when she found they did but she held his hand till he got out his keys and used one hed certainly never thought he would need at this time of night she gurgled laughter then in a small arch voice she said im not your patient dr russie and a good thing too dr archibald he answered closing the outer door to the office behind them and locking it again if you were this would be unethical it wasnt a perfect place neither high hard narrow examining couches nor chairs made an adequate substitute for a bed but it was quiet and private and they managed well enough better than well enough reuven thought dizzily as jane crouched in front of him as he sat in one of the chairs then rose from her knees sat down on his lap and impaled herself upon him it was as good as hed thought it would be considering all his imaginings about jane that made it very fine indeed he did his best to please her too letting his mouth glide from hers to the tips of her breasts and stroking between her legs as she rode him she threw back her head and let out a couple of sharp explosive gasps of pleasure a moment later he groaned as he too spent himself she leaned forward and kissed him on the end of the nose with one arm round her back and his other hand resting on her smooth bare thigh he thought of something he realized should have crossed his mind sooner i should have worn a rubber he blurted he had stayed hard inside her that was alarming enough to make him lose his ardor and slide out not too much to worry about jane said my periods due in a couple of days id have fretted a good deal more a week or ten days ago all right reuven ran a hand along the curves of her flank and hip he didnt want to let go of herbut at the same time he began to wonder what would or what ought to happen next not just friends anymore he said no jane chuckled then kissed him again your family wont approve oh your sisters might but your mother and father wont what are you going to do about that it was a good question and one reuven heard with a certain amount of relief she might have said now are you going to ask me to marry you he was a long way from sure he wanted to marry jane that was a notion very different from wanting to lay her and even though shed made love with him he wasnt at all sure she wanted to marry him either right now i just dont know he answered slowly we have to figure out what we want to do after this before we worry about my family i think he hoped that wouldnt anger her it didnt she nodded and got off him fair enough she answered i didnt know if you wanted to play it by ear but that suits me well enough for now and she added with brisk practicality wed better make sure we dont leave any spots on the chair or the carpet or else your father will know a lot sooner than we want him to money of my own monique dutourd thought it was less money than it would have been had she been able to take the grand prize the lizards tried to press on her that still rankled they should have been willing to give her the full cash value of the house she couldnt accept who would have thought there were cheapskates among the race she had a fine mental picture of herself accepting the house and moving in she might have stayed there by herself for five minutes before standartenfuhrer dieter kuhn started pounding on the door and demanding that she take him back to the bedroom on the other hand she might not have too but twenty thousand reichsmarks was a tidy little sum and best of all pierre didnt know she had the moneyor she didnt think he did anyhow as far as she could tell her brother didnt search her room i can do what i want with it she thought what i want not what anybody else wants if i can get a passport under a name thats not my own i can even get out of the reich altogether from the bellicose rantings in the newspapers that struck her as a better idea every day the germans seemed as intent on attacking poland as they had when she was a girl she thought they were insane but shed seen a lot of german insanity over the past generation more wouldnt surprise her the only trouble was if the germans got into a war with the lizards the lizards wouldnt care that marseille was properly a part of france to them it would be just another city in the greater german reich in other words a target that cheerful thought made her more blunt with her brother than she might have been otherwise over breakfast one morning she came right out and said i want an identity card with a false name on it pierre dutourd looked up from his croissant and cafe au lait and why do you want this he inquired his tone one of mild curiosity because its safer if i have one monique answered she knew hed be suspicious not just curious no matter how he sounded he hadnt stayed in business all these years by virtue of a trusting disposition she went on its safer for me and its safer for you too in case i ever get picked up the boches wont have such an easy time learning who i am and they wont squeeze me so hard lucie took a drag on her cigarette then stubbed it out why do you think we can get you anything like that she asked especially coming in the sexylittlegirl voice of pierres girlfriend the question infuriated monique why because im not an idiot thats why she snapped how many false cards do the two of you have it could be that i have one or two pierre said mildly it could even be that lucie has one or two i do not say that it is mind you but it could be acid still in her voice monique asked well could it be that i might have one you would think i were asking for a diamond necklace it would be less risky for me to get you a diamond necklace her brother replied let me think and let me see what i can do no matter how much she squawked he would say no more than that she didnt know shed won her point till she got summoned to a dingy photographic studio a couple of days later flashbulbs made her see glowing purple spots those should do the job the photographer told her he didnt say what kind of job they were supposed to do but she figured that out for herself a few days later pierre handed her a card that told the world or at least the german and french officials therein that she was madeleine didier the photograph was one the fellow at the little holeinthewall studio had taken as for the rest of the document she compared it to her old id card which she knew was genuine i cant see any difference pierre looked smug there isnt any difference not unless you chance to have a highpowered microscope my friend the printer does these with great success hed better monique exclaimed no quicker way to commit suicide than an identification card that doesnt pass muster i had not finished her brother looked annoyed at the interruption he liked to hear himself talk he has a lizard machine that makes an image of whatever document he requires and stores it so he can alter it as he pleases on one of their computing devices this he assures me is far easier and more convenient than working from photographs ever was so the lizards have brought us a golden age of forgery monique said amused and how long will it be before he finds it easier to print money in his shop than to earn it by honest work there for all i know francois may be doing just that pierre dutourd replied you will understand i do not ask him a great many questions about such things just as he does not ask me a great many questions about my occupation yes i can see that this might be so monique studied the new card it really did seem perfect not just the printing but also the rubber stamps and official signatures were exactly as they should have been himmler himself would not suspect anything was wrong with it of course not pierre rolled his eyes hes dead and good riddance too he paused then after a moment shook his head no it could be that i am wrong we may be sorry he is gone for these fools all trying to steal his seat may set the reich on fire to show how manly they are he made a sour face some of my best customers are very worried about that some of the lizards you mean monique asked but of course pierre dutourd replied and they do not carethey hardly even know except as far as the language goeswe here are french not germans as far as they are concerned one part of the reich is the same as another to them it is all ein volk ein reich ein fuhrer he looked disgusted now merde alors monique almost laughed out loud from everything shed seen her brother was far more mercenary than patriotic shed never heard him say much about the reich till living under nazi rule seemed likely to land him in troublehe certainly hadnt cared a great deal when she got slapped around at the palais de justice but hearing that he and the race worried about war ahead did make her sit up and take notice can we do anything run for the hills he suggested it could be i would not bring you back to the city as i did before it could be that i would also run the best defense against an explosivemetal bomb is not to be there when it goes off this is i believe an american saying it is also i believe a true saying yes i believe it could be monique said she sat thoughtfully at the breakfast table if she couldnt get a passportif even with a passport she couldnt get out of marseillerunning into the hills didnt seem the worst idea in the world will your friends among the race know the war is on the point of breaking out before it does if anyone among the race knows they will know pierre answered but whether anyone will know that i cannot say all the germans have to do is launch their rockets and voila war no its not that simple monique said they have to move soldiers into position and tanks and airplanes these things must be noticeable less than youd think her brother told her from what my friends say the boches move forces all the time so it becomes difficult to be sure which movements are intended to confuse and which are intended to deploy and the germans are better at keeping things secret than they used to be too that unfortunately seemed altogether too probable to monique thanks to dieter kuhn she knew the nazis were getting better at unscrambling the lizards security devices it seemed logical they should also be getting better with their own the conversation helped make up her mind for her leaving the porte daix made her nervous she expected every ss man in france to descend on her with cocked submachine gun and possibly with unbuttoned fly only after she was already on the way to the prefecture on rue st ferreol did she pause to wonder whether pierres clever printer could forge passports as readily as id cards after pedaling on for another half a block she shook her head she didnt want pierre to know she intended fleeing because she wanted to flee from him too that meant she had to get the passport on her own and that meant she had to get a real one except through her brother she had no illicit connections and so the prefecture it was larger and more massive than the palais de justice with a small square on the north side and a park over to the east she set her bicycle in a rack in front of the building and chained it into place even here with gendarmes strolling about keeping an eye on things thieves might thrive but at least the policemen were gendarmes and not the germans who gave the palais de justice its sinister reputation how well deserved that reputation was she knew better than shed ever wanted to inside languid ceiling fans did a halfhearted job of stirring the air fill out all forms before entering line a prominent sign warned from everything monique had heard french bureaucracy had been bad before the reich overran the country from everything shed seen it was worse now having added german thoroughness without the slightest trace of german efficiency as shed expected the forms for obtaining a passport were formidable so were the fees requiredofficials wanted to know everything about anyone who might want to leave the reich and also wanted to soak wouldbe travelers for the privilege monique filled out page after page much of the information being fictitious if the bureaucrats did any careful checking she was in trouble but her assumption was that no one would have any reason to check on madeleine didier who couldnt very well have fallen foul of the authorities because shed existed for only a few days do you really want to do this she wondered if youre wrong and if you get caught youre back in dieter kuhns handsand probably back in his arms too she didnt have to worry about that in porte daix anyhow but her brother wanted to use her too even if in a different way if she could get away shed also be free of pierre she nodded briskly the game was worth the candle the line moved forward a centimeter at a time at last though she stood before a boredlooking functionary he gave the forms a desultory glance then said your fee she pushed reichsmarks across the counter he riffled through them nodded and said your identification card heart thuttering monique passed that to him too he examined it more carefully than the forms less carefully than the money and pushed it back to her very good all appears to be in order you may return in four weeks time to pick up your passport it must be done in person you understand yes of course monique answered thank you she turned away thinking either i get the passportor the ss gets me shed find out if she still had the nerve and if the world hadnt blown up in the meantime atvar studied the latest reports from the subregion known as poland as well as those from the races spy satellites he turned one eye turret from the monitor on which the reports were displayed to kirel i begin to be optimistic he told the secondhighestranking male in the conquest fleet if the deutsche had truly been on the point of launching an attack against us i believe they would have done so by now every day they delay is another day in which they can have second thoughts no doubt the big uglies are impetuous exalted fleetlord kirel replied i agree delay is likely to be advantageous to us but they have not backed away from their preparations either see how many spacecraft they continue to keep in orbit around tosev if they truly intended relaxing into a peaceful posture they would not be making such an effortin my opinion of course even the shiplord of the conquest fleets bannership had to be careful when disagreeing with the fleetlord but atvar did not have all his claws sunk deeply into his view of things here as sometimes happened indeed that is a truth shiplord he admitted but i wonder how much damage these crewed craft can do as opposed to the many orbiting explosivemetal bombs and missiles that require only an electronic command for activation i also wonder kirel said but i hope we do not have to find out the tosevites themselves have a nastier imagination than their mechanisms even with inferior means they might find a way to do us more harm than we would expect they have a knack for doing that and i would be the last to deny it atvar said but they also must know what we would do to them if they did not understand that i believe they would already have gone to war that is undoubtedly a truth kirel said he swung one of his eye turrets toward the display do we have any certain knowledge of where their submersible craft carrying missiles are presently located no that didnt make atvar happy either and i must say i wish we did but on the other fork of the tongue we rarely do they and the americans and the russkis make a point of keeping the whereabouts of those vessels secret in their position i would do the same we cannot target the submersibles as we can their landbased missiles pshing came into atvars office and waited to be noticed when atvar slid an eye turret toward him he said exalted fleetlord we have received replies from four tosevite notempires in regard to our request to open shrines dedicated to reverencing the spirits of emperors past in their territories four at once kirel said they must be acting in concert then atvar thought the same thing but pshing made the negative hand gesture no shiplord three of the replies are negative the nipponese say they strongly prefer to reverence their own emperors the sssr and the reich simply refuse the request the sssrs rejection implies that we made it for purposes of espionage rather than reverence that was in some measure true atvar said and the fourth reply exalted fleetlord it is from the united states and gives us permission to do as we will there pshing replied the american tosevites cite a doctrine of theirs called freedom of reverence or something of the sort i confess that i do not fully understand this doctrine i often wonder if even the american tosevites understand their own doctrines atvar replied this probably stems from their passion for snoutcounting most of their peculiar institutions do since they are not bellicose at the moment i am inclined to forgive them their doctrines kirel said as pshing left the office no doubt some truth will hatch from that eggshell shiplord atvar said and we still await the reply from britain but the americans do cause me some concern for the simple reason that they have prospered rather than falling to pieces in the interval since the fighting stopped none of our analysts seems to understand why they have prospered either by all logic government through snoutcounting should have failed almost immediatelyshould never have been attempted in fact kirel made the affirmative gesture i see what you are saying exalted fleetlord nippon and britain have systems similar to ours though the british also use some of this snoutcounting silliness and the reich and the sssr have rulers with the power of emperors though they gain that power by murder or intrigue not by inheritance but the americans truly are anomalous and they are technically proficient atvar said discontentedly they are the ones with a spacecraft in the asteroid belt they are the ones sending representatives to meet with the big ugly our researcher has raised as if she were a female of the race i have been keeping track of that yes kirel said truly a worthwhile project on the researchers part do you think some of the wild big uglies are beginning to become acculturated video of one of the wild ones meeting with our specimen suggests he is one of that sort the wild ones my judgment is that acculturation is still superficial atvar said if they do begin to reverence the spirits of emperors past that would be a more significant turn toward the empires way of life than removing their hair and wearing body paint in place of their cloth wrappings indeed i completely agree kirel said but the american big uglies as you have pointed out are not fools even if they are barbarians they too must realize the likely result of permitting such reverence and yet they do so why again analysis is incomplete we really do need to study the americans more atvar said and scribbled a note to that effect for himself their ideology seems to be almost evolutionary in nature they let individuals compete in snoutcounting contests and they let ideas compete through freedom of reverence and freedom of discussion their assumption seems to be that the best will prevail as a result of this untrammeled competition now that is interesting exalted fleetlord kirel said i had not seen their ideology expressed in quite those terms before his mouth fell open in a laugh they certainly are optimists are they not i think so every male of the race i know thinks so by all i can tell most other big uglies think so too atvar said and yet the americans continue to do well they continue to steal and adapt and build on our technology even more aggressively than the reich or the sssr puzzling is it not very much so kirel answered and their relations with us are less shrill and warlike than are those of the other two leading independent notempires they might almost be civilized almost atvar said but then he realized the shiplord had a point we do seem to make more allowances for them than for the other notempires do we not i wonder if the american big uglies are devious enough to take advantage of that we have not suspected them of attacking the ships of the colonization fleet at least not seriously suspected them kirel said do you believe we should begin a more intensive investigation along those lines after some thought atvar made the negative gesture we have no evidence that would lead us to suspect their guilt and their behavior otherwise has been as near exemplary as big uglies come we have no evidence to lead us to the reich or to the sssr either though each has tried to implicate the other kirel pointed out before the fleetlord could respond to that pshing hurried into his office once more atvar saw his agitation even before he spoke exalted fleetlord by the emperor what now atvar asked casting down his eyes in respect for the sovereign so many lightyears away exalted fleetlord i have just received a written communication from the ambassador of the nipponese empire what now atvar repeated in some irritation like britain nippon had retained its independence when the fighting stopped the nipponese thought that entitled them to equality of status with the usa the sssr and the reich the race didnt for the simple reason that nippon being without explosivemetal weapons could not do them nearly so much harm as the three more prominent tosevite powers pshing said exalted fleetlord the ambassador reports that nippon has detonated an explosivemetal weapon of its own manufacture on an isolated island calledhe looked down at the paper he heldbikini that is the name atvar let out a furious hiss and turned to the computer monitor when he chose a reconnaissance and intelligence channel he saw the explosion was just being reported the nipponese must have timed the delivery of that note most precisely he said and then dreading the answer is there more there is exalted fleetlord pshing said unhappily the note goes on to demand all privileges previously accorded only to tosevite powers with explosivemetal weapons it warns that nippon has submersible craft of its own and knows how to use them to its own best advantage even for big uglies the nipponese are arrogant kirel said and now they have some good reason for arrogance atvar knew he sounded even more unhappy than his adjutant but he had cause to sound that way he turned an eye turret toward pshing do the nipponese demand that we evacuate all territory that they occupied when the conquest fleet arrived not in this note no exalted fleetlord pshing said what they may do in the future however is anyones guess that is a truth kirels voice was mournful too after calling up a map of tosevite political conditions at the time of the conquest fleets arrival atvar examined it there are occasions when i would be tempted to return to the nipponese the subregion known as china considering the difficulties its inhabitants have given us some other big uglies might as well have the dubious privilege of trying to rule them you cannot mean that exalted fleetlord now kirel sounded horrified and atvar realized his chief subordinate was right no he said with a sigh i suppose i cannot all the tosevite notempires would take it for a sign of weakness and they leap on weakness the way befflem leap on meat what will you tell the nipponese then pshing asked atvar sighed once more unfortunately they have demonstrated strength and they may be arrogantor shortsightedenough to use their new weapons without fear of punishment here pshing tell them this tell them we shall grant them all the diplomatic privileges they request but tell them also that with privileges comes responsibility tell them we are now constrained to observe them more closely than ever before tell them we shall take a much more serious view of any potentially aggressive action they may prepare tell them they still are not powerful enough to seek any real test of strength against us and that any attack on us will be crushed without mercy very good exalted fleetlord his adjutant said and used an emphatic cough it shall be done in every particular i thank you pshing ohand one thing more atvar said pshing and kirel both looked curious the fleetlord explained now we hope they listen as liu han paced through the prisoners camp she kept shaking her head no she said i dont believe it i dont want to believe it it cant possibly be true nieh hoting gave her an amused look it cant possibly be true because you dont want to believe it what kind of logic goes into a statement like that i dont know she answered and i dont care either what do you think of that tell me where you heard that the eastern dwarfs used an explosivemetal bomb did the little scaly devils tell you i doubt it to show how much she doubted it she used one of the little devils emphatic coughs but nieh said you do not want to believe it of the japanese because you hate them even more than you hate the scaly devils that liu han started to say that wasnt true but discovered she couldnt she did hate the japanese with a deep and abiding hatred and why not when theyd destroyed the village that had been her whole life and slaughtered the family shed thought would be hers forever she amended her words that doesnt matter what matters is whats true and what isnt and you didnt answer my question well so i didnt the peoples liberation army officer admitted he bowed to liu han as if she were a noblewoman from the old days the days of the manchu empire i will then no the scaly devils didnt tell me but i heard the guards talking among themselves i dont think they knew i understood oh liu han said unhappily she knew the scaly devils often didnt pay any attention to what their human captives might hear why should they even if the humans understood what could they do about it nothing as liu han also knew all too well she scowled and kicked at the dirt will the japanese start using their bombs against the little devils here in china then who knows what the japanese will do nieh hoting answered i often wonder if even they know ahead of time but whether they use bombs or not theyve gained a lot of face by having them so they have now liu hans voice went savage she kicked the dirt again harder than before they learned imperialism from the roundeyed devils all we ever learned was colonialist oppression the little scaly devils threw them out of china but they kept most of their empire and they kept their freedom and what have we got from the little devils more colonialist oppression where is the justice in that nieh shrugged justice comes with power the strong have it and they give their version of it to the weak we were unlucky for we were found weak at the wrong time when liu han looked out to the horizon she did so through strands of razor wire the little scaly devils had set up around the perimeter of the camp if that didnt tell her everything she needed to know about strength and weakness what would she scowled how can we use the japanese to our advantage now that is a better thought nieh hoting set a hand on her shoulder for a moment as if to remind her theyd been lovers once the russians have always refused to give us explosivemetal bombs of our own so have the americans maybe the japanese will be more reasonable maybe theyll hope the russians get the blame liu han said which made nieh laugh and nod that might be a reasonable hope too i wonder if mao has this news yet mao always knows the news nieh spoke with great assurance what he can do with it may be another question im sure hed be willing to deal with the japanese to get an explosivemetal bomb im not nearly so sure theyd be willing to deal with him if i were one of the eastern dwarfs id be afraid of dealing with anyone chinese liu han said they must know how much vengeance we owe them for what they did to us thats true no one would argue with it nieh said but how much do we owe the scaly devils if that is more then the japanese wouldnt need to fear for we would want to settle the bigger debt first though liu han knew how to make such coldblooded calculations they didnt appeal to her i want to pay back the scaly devils and i want to pay back the japanese she said how can we be free till we punish all our enemies nieh sighed ive been fighting for our freedom since i was a young man and it seems further away than ever the struggle ahead wont be any quicker or any easier than the one weve already made that made sense too but it wasnt what liu han wanted to hear i want liu mei to live in freedom she said and then her lips twisted into a bitter smile i want to live in freedom myself i dont want either one of us to spend the rest of our days locked up in this prison camp i dont want to spend the rest of my days here either nieh hoting said i am not a young man any more i do not have so many days to spend anywhere and this isnt the place id have chosen his own smile showed wry amusement but the little devils gave us no choice your daughter helped make sure they would give us no choice liu han turned away she didnt want to hear that either even though she knew it was true she started to explain that she understood why liu mei had done as she did but what difference did it make none she kept walking a man she didnt know came by her he gave her a polite nod so she returned one probably with the kuomintang she thought plenty of prisoners here were the little devils didnt care if they and the communists went right on with their civil war here inside this razorwire perimeter that just made life easier for them the first time shed been taken to a camp things had been a lot easier the little devils were newer at the game thenand shed been only an experimental animal to them not a dangerous political prisoner the reds had helped spirit her out of the camp through a tunnel and no one had been the wiser for a long time things werent so simple here no humans went into and out of this camp people came in they never went out nothing seemed so tempting as giving way to despair if she stopped caring about what happened to her maybe she could accept the likelihood that she would never leave this place again then she could start shaping a life for herself within the razorwire perimeter she shook her head she wouldnt give up she couldnt give up she hadnt given up after ttomalss took her daughter away from her and shed got liu mei back if she kept up the struggle she might get her own life back one day too after all who could guess what would happen the japanese might resume their war with the little scaly devils or the germans might fight them the germans were strong even if they were fascist reactionaries if they caused the scaly devils enough trouble maybe the little devils would have to loosen their grip on china you never could tell she went back to the tent she shared with liu mei to tell her daughter the news shed had from nieh but liu mei wasnt in the tent liu hans carefully constructed bravado collapsed if the little devils had taken her daughter off to do horrible things to her what good was bravado a woman who lived in the tent next door said the scaly devils do not have her she had a southwestern accent that hardly seemed mandarin at all to liu han who had trouble following her when at last she did she asked well where is she then the other woman who was not a communist smiled unpleasantly she went out walking with a young man a young man liu han exclaimed which young man the camp held a lot of them far more than women i have no idea the other woman was full of sour virtue my children would never do such a thing without my knowing you ugly old turtle you must have had a blind husband if you have any children at all liu han said that produced a splendid fight each of the women called the other everything she could think of the other woman took a step toward liu han who only smiled come ahead i will snatch you even balder than you are already oh shut up you horrible clappedout whore the other woman screeched but she backed away again contemptuously liu han turned her back she listened for footsteps that would mean the other woman was rushing at her but they didnt come she wondered if she ought to wait in her tent for her daughter or to go after her she decided to wait liu mei came back about an hour later alone what have you been doing liu han asked walking with a friend liu mei answered her face showed nothing but then it never didit never could who is this friend liu han persisted someone i met here her daughter said and what other sort of person is it likely to be liu han said full of sarcasm someone you met in peking maybe or in the united states i am going to ask you again and i want a straight answer this time who is this friend someone i met here liu mei repeated is it a man or a woman is it a communist or a kuomintang reactionary liu han said why do you beat around the bush why do you hound me liu mei returned if the nosy neighbor hadnt told liu han her daughter was walking with a man that would have i can walk with whomever i like its not like theres anything else to do if she went walking with a man they might soon find something else to do liu han knew that perfectly well if liu mei didnt it wasnt because liu han hadnt told her who is he liu han snapped liu meis eyes blazed in her expressionless face whoever he is hes none of your business she said are you going to be a bourgeois mother worrying about a proper match or are you going to be an upperclass mother from the old days and bind up my feet till i walk like this she took several tiny swaying mocking steps her face might not show expression but her body did i am your mother and i will thank you to remember it liu han said treat me like a comrade if you please and not the way the keeper in a traveling beast show treats his animals liu mei said is that what you think i do liu han demanded and her daughter nodded she threw her hands in the air all i want is for you to be happy and safe and sensible and you always havetill now all you want is to keep me in a cage liu han shouted and tears streamed down her face she stormed off liu han stared after her then started to cry herself everything shed worked for lay in ruins around her much as he would have liked to straha hadnt passed on to the race what hed learned about the hatchlings sam yeager was raising in an odd sort of way he was loyal to the united states after all if this notempire hadnt taken him in atvar would have given him a very hard time and yeager was a friend even if he was a big ugly but those werent the main reasons hed kept quiet about that business his main concern was that he wouldnt get the reward he most desired a return to the society of the race after all his own kind had done the same sort of thing with a tosevite hatchling how could they condemn the americans without condemning themselves at the same time his driver walked into the kitchen i greet you shiplord he said casually looks as if the sun is finally coming out you knew straha said angrily you knew all along and you said not a thingnot a single solitary thing had the big ugly asked what he was talking about straha thought he would have taken a bite out of him but his driver didnt bother affecting innocence i was following the orders of my superiors shiplord they wanted this secret kept and so it was i am surprised sam yeager obtained permission to have you visit his home as a matter of fact how do you know he even asked permission straha asked i do not know that he did the driver answered i know that he should have if he did not it will be one more black mark in the book against him that was an english idiom translated literally into the language of the race straha had little trouble figuring out what it meant he said yeager is a good officer he should not have difficulties with his superiors if he obeyed orders if he did as he was told to do he would not have difficulties with his superiors the big ugly said then he let out a couple of grunts of tosevite laughter of course if he acted in that fashion he might not be such a good officer either straha would have reckoned a perfectly obedient officer a good officer or would he he thought of himself as a good officer and yet he was one of the most disobedient males in the history of the race this planet corrupts everyone he thought his driver dropped into english you know what yeagers problem is shiplord yeagers got too goddamn much initiative thats what initiative is desirable isnt it straha switched to english too yes and no his driver replied yes if youre going after what your superiors tell you to go after no if you go off on your own especially no if you keep sticking your nose into places they told you to stay away from yeager does this straha made a mental leap of his own is that why he has had trouble with tosevites trying to harm him and his family i really couldnt tell you anything about that his driver said it might just be a run of bad luck you know like any male of the race straha read big uglies imperfectly but hed been associating with this one for a longtime he had a fair notion when the tosevite tried to lie by misdirection this felt like one of those times he started to press his driver to try to learn more from him for he was sure the big ugly knew more instead though he left unuttered the questions he might have asked he doubted the driver would have told him much the tosevites first loyalty was to his american superiors not to straha and if word got back to them that straha had been asking such questions sam yeager might land in more trouble still the exiled shiplord didnt want that maybe the big ugly had expected straha to ask such questions eyeing him the tosevite asked is there anything else shiplord he returned to the language of the race and with it to formality no nothing else straha replied also in his own language how you big uglies conduct your affairs is of no great consequence to me that made his driver relax males of the raceand females too these dayshad a reputation among the big uglies for being contemptuous of everything pertaining to tosev straha was contemptuous of a great deal about the tosevites but not of everything and not about all big uglies but he used the reputation to his own advantage here to conceal a genuine interest with a laugh his driver said after all its not as if yeager were a male of the race it certainly is not straha agreed the driver nodded and went off making the small somewhat musical noises the big uglies called whistling that was a sign he was amused and unconcerned and happy or maybe he wanted straha to think it was a sign he was amused and unconcerned and happy big uglies could be devious creatures straha knew from experience that his driver could be a devious creature if he were to pick up the telephone now and call sam yeager he had no doubt the driver would listen to every word he said he wouldnt have been surprised if the americans listened to every word he said whenever he picked up the telephone he waited till he was using the limited access to the races computer network a fellow male in exile had illicitly obtained for him before sending an electronic message to maargyees the false name sam yeager used on the network in case you did not know it your own curiosity has amused curiosity in others he wrote yeager was a clever male he would have no trouble figuring out what that meant having written the message straha erased it from his own computer it would of course remain in the networks storage system but the americans didnt have access to that he hoped with all his liver that the americans didnt have access to it anyhow theyd known next to nothing about computers when the race first came to tosev they knew a great deal more than that these days worse luck the race had phased in computers ever so gradually in the couple of millennia following the unification of home devices with such important influence on society had to be phased in gradually to minimize disruption that was the way the race looked at things anyhow the big uglies had other ideas straha didnt suppose he should have been surprised when the tosevites found a new technology no matter what it was they always felt they had to do as much with it as they could as soon as they could even if the troubles that would hatch as a result of rapid change were obvious they went ahead all the same theyd done as much with computers in a generation as the race had in centuries not all american tosevites had the education they needed to use computer systems to best advantageor at all that didnt deter the big uglies those of them who could use the new technology did and flourished those who didnt might as well have stayed inside their eggshells their failure their falling behind bothered the others not at all and if upheaval followed because some tosevites gained more advantages than othersthey didnt seem to care that struck straha as madness but it was as much dogma to the americans as reverencing the spirits of emperors past was to the race straha knew an american saying look out for yourself and let the devil take the hindmost to him that was individualism to the point of addlement survival of the fittest made into a law of society to the americans it seemed common sense those who succeeded in the united states succeeded spectacularly those who failedand there were by the nature of things many who didfailed the same way and all things considered i am one of the ones who have succeeded straha murmured he had less than he would have had back on home but he had everything with which the big uglies could supply him the sliding glass door at the back of the house was open the spring air was chillier than he found ideal but no worse than a brisk winters day back on home he didnt even bother bundling up before he pushed open the sliding screen that kept little flying and crawling pests out of the house and walked out into the backyard he looked around with a certain amount of pride bare ground and sand and succulents some smooth some spiky put him in mind of a landscape back on home though details differed here even more than inside the house hed shaped things to suit himself inside the place was built to suit tosevites and many of the devices he used every daytelephone stove refrigeratorwere perforce of american manufacture different from and usually inferior to their equivalents on his native world they always reminded him what an alien he was out here though he could look around and imagine himself somewhere on home somewhere a long way from his native city few big uglies cared for the effect any more than he was enamored of the boring green lawns they so admired the dog next door started barking it often did when he came outside it probably disliked his odor for that matter he wasnt fond of the scent of its droppings which the breeze sometimes wafted to his scent receptors he didnt like the noise it made either nothing on home sounded remotely like a dog and its yaps and growls spoiled the illusion the yard gave him a small bird with a bright green back and an even brighter red head buzzed among the flowers red ones particularly attracted it it too reminded him he wasnt on home any more flying creatures there had bare leathery wings and none of them came close to matching the aerial gymnastics of a hummingbird but even though the flying creature was alien it didnt irk him the way the dog did it was small and quiet and attractive not loud and annoying suddenly the hummingbird which had been swooping low darted away as if something had startled it straha strode closer and saw a scaly fourlegged creature a little longer than the distance between his wrist and the end of his middle fingerclaw it was a brown not much different from the color of the dirt with darker stripes to break up its outline like the succulents among which it crawled it looked familiar without being identical to anything on home it stuck out a short dark tongue then as if nervous about coming out into the open it scuttled back under some of the plants and disappeared straha started to root around after it but decided not to bother it was living where it belonged and doing what it was supposed to do he wished he could say the same maybe he could return to the society of the race if he betrayed sam yeager maybe his mouth fell open in a laugh that held little in the way of real mirth hed just warned his friend of danger from other big uglies but he hadnt warned of danger from himself of course yeager understood the race about as well as any tosevite could he would have to understand that straha might be able to buy his way back into atvars good graces by passing on the story of the hatchlings wouldnt he from the exile that wasnt quite comfortable from the garden that wasnt quite home straha made the negative gesture if i have to buy my way back into atvars good graces they are not worth having the exshiplord said aloud spirits of emperors past turn their backs on him he feared those spirits would reject him when he came before them but hed feared that ever since ordering his shuttlecraft pilot to take him down to the usa yet those spirits wouldnt approve of him if he betrayed a friend either not even if that friend was a big ugly now he made the affirmative gesture he would stay quiet and stay here okay lets give it a try hal walsh said david would you like to do the honors as a matter of fact no david goldfarb said i want to get the bloody call i dont want to make it i want to see the numbers light up on the gadget here you dont know how much i want that his boss at the saskatchewan river widget works eyed him oh maybe i do he said he dug in his pocket and tossed a dime to jack devereaux go find a phone booth and call david all right devereaux said he put on his overcoat before leaving the office the calendar said spring had come to edmonton but the weather paid no attention ill even note the phone number so we can see if it works the way its supposed to it had better walsh spoke as if a failed widget were a personal affront that was how he thought too which probably went a long way toward making him such a good engineer devereaux slammed the door behind him david goldfarb knew a phone bootha far flimsier phone booth than the solid redpainted british sortstood around the corner with this ghastly weather he didnt understand why booths in canada were so flimsy but they were it helped remind him he was in a foreign country waiting for devereaux to call reminded him of the same thing on the other side of the atlantic hed be waiting for his colleague to ring the telephone rang it did the same thing regardless of where it was he picked it up hullogoldfarb here numbers appeared on the screen of the widget hooked up to the phone a widget that sent electronic tendrils through the telephone lines to the instrument the person on the other end of the connection was using yes id like to order some pirogis to go that was devereauxs voice even if he was trying to get ukrainian dumplings bravoyou just wasted hals dime goldfarb said devereaux laughed and hung up on him walsh came over and looked at the numbers which remained on the screen i think weve got something here police fire departmentsthis beats the hell out of having an operator try to trace a call businesses will use it too goldfarb said if you have customers ringing you youll be able to ring back whenever youve got something on special walsh understood ring just as goldfarb understood call he didnt bother using the north american term instead of the one hed grown up with jack devereaux came back into the office he was waving a scrap of paper goldfarb snatched it out of his hand he compared it to the number hed written down they matched solemnly goldfarb walsh and devereaux shook hands were in business hal walsh said devereaux said not yet were not he said we have a useful widget now weve got to convince people they really want to use it walsh beamed at him youd be handy to have around if you didnt know a slide rule from a skelkwank light he said youve always got your eye on the main chance i should hope so devereaux replied with dignity as for slide rules another five years and theyll be nothing but antiques why get eyestrain trying to read a third significant figure when an electronic calculator will give you eight or ten just as fast he turned to goldfarb isnt that right david he asked as if hal walsh had challenged him i expect it is goldfarb said in what he feared was a hollow voice ill miss em though he felt very much an antique himself remembering how proud hed been when he learned to multiply and divide on a slide rule and how hed been even prouder after hed found a couple of tricks for keeping track of the decimal pointunlike a calculator the slide rule wouldnt do it for him he also knew he had no great head for business that didnt make him a stereotypical jew but it did make him a man whod spent his entire adult life in the raf he hadnt had to worry about what things cost or about the best ways to sell them to a public that didnt know what it was missing by doing without them so will i walsh said and you never have to worry about the batteries going dead with a slide rule either but if the calculator gives better results youd have to be a fool to want to use anything else eh devereaux grinned a sassy grin david doesnt think like that hes an englishman remember they hang on to things because theyre old not because theyre any good isnt that right he said again something to it i shouldnt wonder goldfarb said to the canadians he was an englishman to most of the englishmen hed known hed been nothing but a jew perspective changed things sure enough before he could say as much the telephone rang he picked it up goldfarb here he answered as he had before hello goldfarb that was his wife calling can you pick up a loaf of bread on the way home tonight no not a chance he said just to hear naomi snort see you when i see you sweetheart he hung up even before he did that he craned his neck to see the number displayed on the small screen of the widget works latest widget his boss and jack devereaux were doing the same thing is that your home number hal walsh asked which somewhat surprised davidhis working assumption was that if it had to do with numbers in any way walsh already knew it without needing to check yes thats it goldfarb agreed and id say were really on to something here id say youre right walsh looked as if he wanted to blow canary feathers off his chin the saskatchewan river widget works was his company even though the phonenumberreading gadget hadnt been altogether his idea the greater share of the profits from it would end up in his pocket he might have picked that thought out of goldfarbs mind for he said nobody will be poor on account of this i promise you all i think itll be a big enough pie for everybody to have a big slice hal youve played straight with us right from the start devereaux said i dont think anybodys worried youre going to pull a fast one this time thats right david goldfarb said though he hadnt been with the widget works right from the start walsh was the sort of boss who inspired confidence he laughed at his employees now in the old days the days before the race came i could have turned everything into cash and headed down to rio well i still could if i felt like living under the lizards for the rest of my days since i dont i suppose id have to go to los angeles instead theyd ship you back from the usa devereaux pointed out but at least youd have decent weather while you were there goldfarb said with undisguised longing by what he was used to los angeles was liable to be beastly hot but he preferred that to too bloody cold which was how canadian weather struck him jack devereaux said i wonder where the jet stream is this year and where itll take the fallout not that much from the japanese test hal walsh said of course they may set off some more i wasnt thinking of that devereaux said i was thinking of the big dose when the nazis and the race start going after each other god forbid goldfarb said ive got family in poland the others wouldnt think of him as an englishman anymore but too bad he tried to look on the bright side of things maybe the war wont happen after all the germans have been thumping their chests for a while now but thats all theyve been doing theres a big part of me that would love to see germany smashed to smithereens devereaux said and goldfarb could no more help nodding than he could help breathing his colleague went on all the same though i hope youre right thered be too much damage to the rest of the world to make the war worthwhile i think theyre going to fight hal walsh said i think theyve done too much posturing to back down without looking yellow and they dont dare do that itd be asking half the countries theyre sitting on to rise up against em that makes sense goldfarb said i wish it didnt before he could go on his telephone rang yet again he picked up the handset hullogoldfarb here you lousy stinking kike the voice on the other end of the line replied you think youre too goddamn good to play with us do you youll pay for that and so will your whole family the nazis have the right idea slam the phone went dead who was that walsh asked nobody i know goldfarb answered nobody i want to know either he glanced over at the little screen attached to the telephone and jotted down the number it displayed but the police may be interested in doing something about it oh really that was jack devereaux one of your charming friends as a matter of fact yes david goldfarb held up the telephone number hed just noted and i have an excellent notion of how to go about helping myself and getting some publicity for the widget works both at the same time he called the edmonton police and reported the threat hed just received you got this by telephone sir the policeman asked im afraid we cant do much about thatyou do understand the difficulty not in this case no goldfarb answered and gave the number from which the threatening call had been placed after a long pause the policeman asked how could you possibly know the call came from that number sir and goldfarb spent the next ten minutes explaining who he was for whom he worked and exactly how he knew what he knew he finished i assume you can find out which numbers go with which houses if you can you might find it worth your while to pay a visit to that particular one do be careful though these are not nice people i make no promises the policeman said and hung up after david reported the other end of the conversation to his boss hal walsh grinned from ear to ear if they go and if they find things worth finding weve just made our mark in big letters he said and held up an imaginary advertising signboard as endorsed by the edmonton police department unless that number turns out to be another phone booth of course goldfarb said walsh crossed his forefingers as if to avert a vampire david laughed that doesnt work im jewish remember nobody at the widget works got much work done till goldfarbs telephone rang again a couple of hours later when he answered it the edmonton copper said mr goldfarb my hats off to you thanks to your call and your device we have four very nasty fellows in custody we also have several illegal firearms some illegal drugs and a large quantity of ginger which is of course not illegalhere now if you would be so kind as to let me speak to mrwelsh was it about the possibility of acquiring this device for ourselves walsh goldfarb corrected happily hal walsh he gave his boss the phone with his hand over the mouthpiece he said we are in business felless said i think it is extremely unfortunate that we should have to prepare to evacuate this area as a result of threats from these tosevite savages kazzop the science officer at the races consulate in marseille waggled his eye turrets ever so slightly to show his bemusement correct me if i am wrong superior female he said but is this evacuation not the only way in which you are likely to be able to return to territory ruled by the race without it would you not remain indefinitely in the greater german reich well yes so i would she admitted ambassador veffani holds a grudge against me she preferred not to dwell on whether her disgrace had given the ambassador good reason to hold a grudge against her but continued still i would sooner the race were strong enough to make it safe for me to stay here than to have to go we are strong we are stronger than we were when the conquest fleet arrived kazzop said as he was a male from that fleet he knew whereof he spoke he went on the trouble lies not in ourselves or in our strength but in the big uglies they are far stronger now than they were when we first came here too and infinitely stronger than we imagined they could be when we left home it is humiliating that the males of the conquest fleet cannot guarantee our safety here felless said humiliating and disgraceful superior female we are not being evacuated from marseille because we are in any particular danger from the deutsche kazzop said the big uglies will not harm us even in the event of war they know we could retaliate against their males and females serving as diplomats or otherwise living in parts of tosev ruled by the race the tosevites have developed elaborate and surprisingly sophisticated rules for exchanging individuals under these circumstances because of their own frequent conflicts they have needed such rules what then felless said perhaps you are correct perhaps i truly do not understand why we are being evacuated i will make the eggshell clear so you may see the hatching truth within kazzop sounded as if he was taking an almost tosevite glee in explaining things to a superior as if she were a hatchling we are being evacuated because marseille will make an important target for the race if war breaks out explosivemetal bombs unfortunately are not very selective oh felless said in a small voice please understand that i am new to the idea of war and to everything involved with it i expected the conquest would have been completed before i woke from cold sleep life on tosev is full of surprises the science officer said dryly that is also a truthand how i wish it werent felless said of course veffani also gets to leave the reich since he has been stuck here much longer than i have i am sure he will welcome the opportunity to escape but kazzop made the negative gesture veffani will not leave any more than the deutsche will call their ambassador back from cairo by tosevite custom ambassadors do not leave other lands until war breaks out of all the things felless had never imagined a reason to feel sympathy toward veffani certainly ranked high on the list poor fellow she said and then but the only announcement of the war is liable to be the launch of missiles tipped with explosivemetal bombs how can he be sure of safe evacuation he cannot kazzop answered which surprised felless all over again she said you males of the conquest fleet cannot always have had an easy time of it she could hear the surprise in her own voice she spent most of the time resenting the males of the conquest fleet because they hadnt given the colonization fleet so completely subdued a world as the newcomers had anticipated only rarely as now did she stop to think about the difficulties the males had faced and continued to face superior female that is a great truth kazzop said it is also a truth few females or males of the colonization fleet ever realize i am glad you have realized it and i hope you will cling to the memory here i shall not forget felless said and then as she sometimes did she thought about the clutch of eggs shed laid at nuremberg i presume arrangements have been made to bring hatchlings out of the reich i believe so yes kazzop said some of us have to be responsible for them or the species would perish after all i suppose thats true felless agreed i have never felt the urge to any great degree myself slomikk the science officer at the embassy did a far better job with the hatchlings than i could have as far as i am concerned he is welcome to it adults now adults are interesting hatchlings after the interrogative cough she used the negative hand gesture slomikk is a very capable male in many ways i have known him for a long time kazzop said i can see how he would be good with hatchlings my own attitude i confess is more like yours you do of course realize that the tosevites are far more centered on their offspring than we are on ours i have gathered that yes this time felless used the affirmative gesture i gather also that the reasons behind it are primarily biological when the big uglies hatch or rather when they emerge from the bodies of the females who bear themfelless spoke with fastidious disgustthey are much less developed much less able to care for themselves than are our hatchlings if adult big uglies were not genetically programmed to care for them they would perish in short order just so kazzop said these strong personal bonds permeate tosevite society to a degree we can understand only intellectually not emotionally they are no small part of what makes the big uglies so vengeanceprone and so generally difficult to administer i have also heard this from senior researcher ttomalss felless said ah yes i can see how you would have kazzop replied ttomalss is very sound very sound indeed when it comes to tosevite psychology why he might almost be a big ugly himself he understands tosevites so well having had her share of problems with ttomalss felless did not care to hear him praised in such extravagant terms i have heard this about the big uglies she repeated but i am not altogether convinced it is truth it seems a very foolish principle on which to organize a society but the big uglies use it constantly kazzop said take the reich for example you must know that its ruling ideology holds the deutsche to be superior to other tosevites by reason of their genetics from every available bit of evidence this is an ideology unsupported by truth felless pointed out oh of course the male from the conquest fleet said but the existence and popularity of an ideology are truths of their own independent of the truthif anyat the yolk of the ideology and this one asserts that the deutsche are part of a large family grouping descended from a common ancestorderived you see from tosevite family patterns well perhaps felless admitted this is certainly not an organizing principle we would use for ourselves no among us it would be madness kazzop said our matings are nonexclusive after all we could not tell family lines even if we wanted to in most instances but if you ignore the ways the big uglies differ from us you will never come to a satisfactory understanding of them that is where ttomalss insights have proved so useful so valuable is it felless said tonelessly before she could add anything less complimentary to ttomalss and before kazzop could further irritate her by praising him the consulgeneral spoke over the intercom his voice filling the entire building we must evacuate we must evacuate we can delay no longer i am told negotiations between the race and the reich have broken down it is no longer safe for us to remain here we must evacuate kazzop sighed so many opportunities for research going to waste oh indeed felless said and so many opportunities for getting killed now becoming available kazzop started to answer but thought better of it instead he went off to see to his packing felless had already seen to hers she had little in the way of personal belongings having pruned her possessions before coming from nuremberg to marseille body paint took up far less room than the wrappings traveling tosevites had to bring with them all the data shed collected in the greater german reich had already gone into the races electronic storage system they were safer than she was all she really had to worry about was she checked as shed thought she had plenty of ginger she wanted a taste but restrained herself she knew she would get in trouble if she started mating with males on the way out of marseille i can wait she thought i will not have to wait forever the herb will be there when we get wherever we are going shed long since given up the idea of telling herself she would never taste again it was a lie as she knew all too well telling herself she would wait though worked well enough sooner or later she could enjoy the herb she craved report to the front entrance immediately the intercom bellowed adding a loud emphatic cough repeat report to the front entrance immediately ground transportation to our aircraft is now waiting armed and uniformed big uglies stood guard outside the consulate felless had seen their like in nuremberg they put her in mind of trained tsiongyu waiting to bite anyone who went where he shouldnt one after another the males and females from the consulate boarded buses and motorcars under their cold watchful stares and a good many males and females of the race who were not part of the consular staff were also boarding those buses and motorcars kazzop said if anyone wants to know my opinion we ought to leave most of those fasttalking cheats and thieves behind they come to marseille to buy ginger and to sell drugs to the big uglies even if an explosivemetal bomb vaporized them all the race would be just as well off and probably better felless knew she would have felt the same way if she werent a ginger taster herself she said some of them may have legitimate business here we cannot be sure which ones are criminals and rogues few who have only legitimate business come to marseille kazzop replied but he said no more than that the fasttalking males and females got aboard which made all the vehicles taking the race out of marseille more crowded than they would have been otherwise deutsch soldiers on motorized cycles that made a dreadful racket escorted the procession to the aircraft waiting at the field outside the city because so many interlopers were fleeing marseille the aircraft was as crowded as the ground transportation had been but it had no trouble taking off felless let out a long happy sigh going back to civilization at last she murmured the male sitting next to her made the affirmative gesture she laughed going off to somewhere i can taste again too from looking at that male she thought he would have agreed with her but she didnt try to find out walter stone looked pleased with himself as he peered out from the control room of the lewis and clark were spreading out he said as if hed done all the spreading himself possibly with a manure cart most times glen johnson would have laughed at the senior pilot now he just nodded the more spread out we are the more working bases weve got on every little chunk of rock near ceres the better off well be because every separate base makes it that much harder for the lizards to wipe us off the map we always knew wed be up against that stone said johnson nodded oh yeah he agreed but we didnt figure wed be up against it so hard so soon stupid goddamn nazis those bastards seem bound and determined to go out in a blaze of glory dont they stone said theyve sure got a wild hair up their ass about poland anyhow if half of what we hear on the radio is true johnson said and ill tell you something else i wouldnt give you a plug nickel to be aboard the hermann goring right now either stones chuckle was not a happy sound me neither can you say bullseye how many missiles do you suppose the lizards have aimed at that baby remembering his conversation with mickey flynn johnson answered enough to do the joband probably about another ten more besides that sounds about right stone agreed the race doesnt like doing things by halveswhich is one reason its gods own miracle they didnt finish the fight back in the forties it was a question of whod finish who johnson said they wanted the colonization fleet to have a planet worth landing on his chuckle didnt show much in the way of good humor either so now they can blow things up with the colonists here hot damn hot damn is right stone said real hot what worries me is they might decide to go after us if theyre going after the hermann goring johnson said in for a penny in for a pound you know what i mean as long as theyve got a war on their hands itd be a lot bigger one if theyre fighting us too stone said yeah but if youre a lizard the other question is how big is too big if youre already fighting the nazis johnson said the only answer i can think of is if its big enough to blow up the planet its probably too big otherwise who knows walter stone looked at him youre in a nice cheerful mood today arent you wouldnt you be the way things are now glen johnson returned remember you spent all the time before we left learning to fly the lewis and clark i spend a lot of my duty time in orbit watching the race and the nazis and the russians i know how fast things can go wrong they almost did a few times you tried to help make things go wrong poking your nose in where it didnt belong stone said and look what it got me johnson said im stuck for life with people like you before stone could answer a bell chimed the hour johnson sighed and im stuck on an exercise bicycle for the next hour have fun stone said i already did my bit today fun johnson said as if it were a fourletter word but he didnt have time to do any more complaining than that not if he wanted to get to the gym on time he didnt give two whoops in hell about getting to the gym on time but he didnt want to listen to the lecture hed get for missing some of his exercise period either and so he swung out of the control room and down the halls to the gymnasium when he got there he signed the sheet to log in changed into sweat clothes in the little mens room off the gym and then got onto a bike and got to work one of the mainengine technicians whod started exercising before him grinned and said you sure youre really here sir i think so bob johnson answered grinning back i look like im here dont i you never can tell bob said and they both laughed the joke was only funny if you looked at it the right way not very long before the lewis and clark had gone through its first really juicy scandal a good many people including several of high rank had got in the habit of signing their names on the sheet and then going off and doing something else instead of getting in their work brigadier general healey had not been happy when word of what they were doing finally got to him and when the commandant wasnt happy nobody else was happy either one thing youve got to give healey bob said hes fair he came down on everybody and who didnt matter yeah thats true johnsons considered opinion was that the commandant hated everybody impartially and that the crew of the lewis and clark returned the favor he realized he wasnt objective but he didnt much care as far as he was concerned healey didnt rate objectivity johnsons legs pumped hard as he did his best to keep calcium in his bones he didnt want to think about gravity not any more the idea of having weight of moving his muscles against resistance seemed alien and repugnant he pedaled on anyhow when his body was working hard he could stop thinking about the troubles back on earth and indeed about everything else exercise wasnt as much fun as sex but it did the job of distraction almost as well thinking about sex made him think about lucy vegettiand thinking about her was certainly more enjoyable than not thinking about anything at all trouble was he couldnt do anything but think about lucy right now she was down on ceres helping to set up a habitat there he missed her he hoped she missed him if she didnt she could find plenty of guys to take his place he wondered if shed taken her bottle of cutty down to the surface of the asteroid a jolt of scotch was almost enough to tempt him into some breaking and enteringalmost but not quite and then before he let himself get more tempted than he should have the intercom came to noisy life lieutenant colonel johnson lieutenant colonel glen johnson report to the commandants office immediately lieutenant colonel glen johnson report to the im coming johnson muttered keep your shirt on the intercom went right on bellowing lucky son of a gun bob said going to see the commandant johnson shook his head id sooner keep exercising he unhooked the belt that tethered him to the bicycle and pushed off toward the nearest handhold he didnt bother changing out of his exercise togs if healey wanted him immediately that would be how the commandant got him and if he was a little sweaty a little smelly what better proof hed been doing his work like a good little boy he sailed right past brigadier general healeys adjutant and into the commandants office catching himself on a handhold there reporting as ordered sir he said saluting yes healey eyed him there are times when you find following orders to the letter more amusing than others arent there lieutenant colonel i dont know what youre talking about sir johnson said with the air of a maiden whose virtue had been questioned tell me another one healey said i shanghaied you and youve been trying to make me sorry ever since sometimes youve even done it but not today this doesnt bother me not a bit johnson shrugged thats the way it goes sir if he was disappointedand he was a littlehed be damned if hed admit it did you want me for anything else besides seeing how fast i could get here brigadier general healey unlike mickey flynn had the stereotypical irishmans fair skin when he got angry he turned red johnson watched him flush now and carefully pretended not to notice a thing biting off his words one at a time the commandant said as a matter of fact i did all right sir johnson said what is it healey leaned forward across his desk for all the world as if he were back on earth nobody else aboard the lewis and clark was so good at pretending weightlessness didnt exist he said youre the one with the orbital patrol experience if the germans and the lizards start slugging it out which way do you think the russians are likely to jump that was a real question all right johnson went from insolent to serious in the blink of an eye sir my best guess is they sit on their hands they hate the nazis and the lizards scare the hell out of them thatd be a war where they hope both sides lose so they can pick up the pieces if there are any pieces left to pick up i mean healeys jowls wobbled slightly as he nodded okay that makes pretty good sense matches up pretty well with what ive been hearing from back on earth too as much to himself as to johnson he added you always like to get things from more than one source if you can you dont trust anybody johnson realized its not just me you dont trust the bigwigs who sent you out here either besides sir he said the russians fly tin cans thats compared to what weve got and what the germans have compared to what the lizards have he shook his head to his surprise healey laughed what they fly doesnt matter much not for this game theyve got their missiles aimed at the lizardsand at the nazisand theyve got their submarines as long as those work everything else is gravy johnson didnt like to hear what hed spent his career doing belittled he could have argued about it several relevant points occurred to him most times he would have done it at the moment he had something more urgent on his mind ask you a question sir when brigadier general healeys bulldog head bobbed up and down johnson said if the nazis and the lizards go at it sir will we stay out of it healeys eyebrows sprang upward wed damn well better or this mission will fail we still need resupply missions from home well need more people too sooner or later yes i understand all that johnson couldnt very well misunderstand it not after so much time aboard the lewis and clark but will we stay out of it if it heats up im hoping it wont the commandant said if the germans were going to jump they would have jumped by nowthats what the consensus back home is anyhow he paused and coughed realizing he hadnt answered the question johnson asked with another cough he did as far as i know we arent going to go to war unless were attacked will that do yes sir johnson said itll have to wont it brigadier general healey nodded again vyacheslav molotov nodded to paul schmidt good day the soviet leader said be seated take tea if you care to he gestured toward the samovar that stood on a table in a corner of his office no thank you comrade general secretary the german ambassador said in his good russian i suppose you are curious as to why i asked to see you on such short notice somewhat molotov said and said no more no matter how curious he was he didnt intend to show schmidt anything rather to his annoyance which he didnt show either the german ambassador smiled paul schmidt had known him a long timesince before the lizards cameand might well guess how much he was concealing schmidt said my government has charged me with announcing the dissolution of the committee of eight and the selection of a new fuhrer to guide the destiny of the greater german reich that was indeed news it was news molotov had awaited with a curious mixture of hope and dread he concealed both of those too asking only and to whom are congratulations due whos come out on top in the intrigue and backstage bloodletting why to dr ernst kaltenbrunner inheritor of the great mantle formerly worn by hitler and himmler schmidt replied please convey to him my heartiest and most sincere felicitations and the hope that he will have a long successful and peaceful tenure at the head of the reich molotov said not even his legendary selfcontrol could keep him from putting a little extra stress on the word peaceful it did however keep his most sincere felicitations from sounding too dreadfully insincere kaltenbrunner was the man he had hoped would not rise to the top in germany and would surely have been himmlers chosen successor had himmler not dropped dead before choosing anyone a big austrian with cold eyes kaltenbrunner had stepped into reinhard heydrichs shoes after the british arranged heydrichs untimely demise in prague and filled them all too well no one noticed him for a while either molotov thought heydrich had been assassinated just as the lizard invasion began and the chaos that followed masked many things for a long time but when the dust settled there was kaltenbrunner as much of a righthand man as himmler allowed himself now molotov asked the question he had to ask what willdoctor did you say yes dr kaltenbrunners policies be i expect him to continue on the path laid down by his illustrious predecessor and continued by the committee of eight the german ambassador said that was the answer molotov had expected it was also the answer he dreaded picking his words with some care he said a change of leaders can sometimes lead to a change in policy with no disrespect for what has gone before i have not been nearly such a mad adventurist as stalin for instance but schmidt shook his head the new fuhrer is convinced his predecessor followed the proper course our neighbors ignore the legitimate claims of the reich at their peril at their peril certainly molotov said but also at yours i hope the new fuhrer bears that in mind as well unlike the leaders he served schmidt was a man of culture molotov had thought so for many years but the german did serve the ruffians who led the reich and served them loyally he said the fuhrer does indeed have that in his mind because he does he sent me to renew the offer his predecessor reichs chancellor himmler extended to the soviet union in regard to the illegally occupied polish regions he wants us to join him in an attack on the race you are telling me molotov said yes schmidt nodded after all part of the territory between our states was formerly occupied by the soviet union so it wastill june molotov said with a savage irony he did not try to hide i asked you once and now i ask you again if our borders marched with each other how long would it be till the reich was at the soviet unions throat again perhaps longer than it would take for the soviet union to be at the reich s throat schmidt answered tartly or perhapsand it is certainly the new fuhrer s earnest hopewe could live at peace with each other once the victory has been won living at peace with each other if our borders touched would take a small miracle said molotov using the language of the religion in which he had not believed since youth living in peace with the race after attacking poland however would take a large miracle as reichs chancellor himmler did not dr kaltenbrunner does not share this view schmidt said as i told himmler through you so i tell kaltenbrunner if he wants to attack poland on his own that is his affair molotov said i do not think however he will be pleased with the result but did that matter to the nazis molotov doubted it fascists wanted what they wanted because they imagined they were entitled to it whether their desires inconvenienced or infuriated anyone else mattered very little to them what they wanted after all was legitimate what anyone else wanted was nothing but the twisted desires of subhumans or in the case of the lizards nonhumans they couldnt even see that not even the clever able ones among them of whom there were a depressing number could see it paul schmidt for instance only shrugged and said i obey the fuhrer take him my answer then it is the same one i gave to himmler no molotov spoke the word nyet with more than a little relish and now i will tell you something on a personal leveli think you are fortunate to be here in moscow if this war begins you would not want to be in germany i am not worried schmidt said and for once molotov had met his match in obscurity did the ambassador mean he wasnt worried because he was in moscow or because he did not fear what would happen to his homeland not even the soviet leader quite had the crust to ask him what molotov did ask was have we any other issues to discuss no comrade general secretary schmidt replied very well molotov said in lieu of screaming youre mad your fuhrer is mad your whole country is mad you are going to wreck yourselves you wont beat the lizards and youll hurt the ussr with the radioactive waste from the explosivemetal bombs you use and the ones the race will use on you schmidt rose to his feet he bowed to molotov good day then be of good cheer everything will turn out for the best before molotov could answer the diplomat bowed again and left molotov sat behind his desk for some time silent and unmoving his secretary looked in saw him there and silently withdrew a few minutes later though the telephone jangled molotov picked it up marshal zhukov on the line the secretary said put him through pyotr maksimovich molotov said without preamble zhukov demanded what did the german have to say as bluntly molotov told him its kaltenbrunner is it after that zhukov said nothing for perhaps half a minute as molotov had been he was adding up what that meant when he did speak again it was with one explosive word shit my thought exactly molotovs voice was dry as before schmidt felt me out for a joint attack on the race in poland and what did you tell him zhukov sounded worried georgi konstantinovich i am not suicidal molotov said you may rest assured that i declined the generous offer i am ever so glad to hear it the marshal replied the next question is do you think that matters to the germans even in the slightest no molotov answered shit zhukov said again comrade general secretary if they go at it the western part of this country takes it on the chin i am painfully aware of that molotov said if you have discovered some secret weapon that will stop a fool from acting like a fool i suggest that you start using it it may well be the most powerful weapon in the world today including explosivemetal bombs no such luck zhukov sounded like an angry peasant now a peasant watching his cattle die without being able to do anything about it molotov decided to match his tone things could be worse you know if we did go along with the nazis the whole country would take it on the chin dont remind me marshal zhukov said his laugh was anything but pleasant im glad i didnt dispose of you when you turned up alive while the army was smashing berias men i thought about it vyacheslav mikhailovichbelieve me i thought about it you would have been an idiot not to think about it whatever else you are you are no idiot molotov had discussed the liquidation of a great many other peopleever so coldly ever so dispassionately he knew a certain amount of pride in being able to discuss his own the same way but why bring this up now because if id got rid of you then id be the one left with nothing to do but watch while the reich and the race throw brickbats at each other zhukov answered this way if anybody ends up needing to take the blame youre the one yes having a scapegoat around is always handy molotov agreed stalin was a master at it the only trouble is the reich and the lizards have nastier things than brickbats to throw thats the only trouble is it zhukov chuckled have you got any nerves at all vyacheslav mikhailovich i try not to molotov said if you purge me marshal you purge me i cannot do anything about it not yet i wish i could im working on it i cannot do anything about the nazis and the lizards either if i get excited about what i cannot help that doesnt change the situation and it leaves me more liable to make a mistake you would not have made the worst soldier in the world zhukov remarked after a few seconds thought he meant it as a compliment of that molotov was sure and so he said spasebo though he was not at all sure he wanted to thank zhukov to him soldiers were crude and unsubtle men relying on force because they lacked the brains to do anything else they were necessary no doubt about it but so were ditchdiggers and embalmers youre welcome comrade general secretary the marshal answered here for the sake of the rodina the motherland we have to pull together when the nazis invaded stalin had said the same thing hed practiced what he preached too hed even cozied up to the russian orthodox church after beating it about the head and shoulders for almost twenty years in an emergency hed been willing to jettison a lot of ideology and hadnt lenin done the same when hed instituted the new economic policy to keep the country from starving after the end of the civil war yes we all have to pull together we all have to do everything we can molotov agreed and then because he could speak as frankly to zhukov as to anyone save possibly gromyko he added for the life of me though i dont know how much good it will do or if it will do any good whatever he hung up without waiting for a reply when johannes drucker strolled into the mess hall at peenemunde he discovered that the powers that be had wasted little time here it was only two days after ernst kaltenbrunner had been named fuhrer and a color photograph of him now occupied the frame that had held heinrich himmlers picture for years drucker wasnt the only man studying it from behind him somebody said he looks like a tough son of a bitch we need one of those right now that struck drucker as a pretty fair assessment though he was less sure about the need kaltenbrunner was in his vigorous early sixties with a big head and heavy features he was leaning forward so that he seemed to stare out through the camera lens at whoever was looking at him even with the advantage of twenty years drucker wouldnt have cared to meet him in a dark alley till himmlers death and even afterwards drucker hadnt paid kaltenbrunner much attention himmler kept his strength by not letting anyone around him be strong the man who now led the greater german reich had been just another official in a fancy uniform standing at the old fuhrer s back in party rallies and state functions now the whole world would find out what sort of man had been inhabiting that uniform grabbing a mess tray drucker got into line cooks helpers spooned sauerkraut boiled potatoes and blood sausage onto the tray another helper gave him a small mug of beer he carried the full tray to a table and sat down to eat nobody sat near him hed got used to that he knew he suffered from political unreliability a disease always dangerous and often fataland highly contagious hed stayed away from men with such an illness in the days before the ss got curious about kathes racial purity and before gunther grillparzer had tried blaming him for the murders during the fighting of which he was unfortunately guilty no one had proved anythinghe was still here still breathing even so no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than the loudspeaker in the mess hall blared out his name lieutenant colonel johannes drucker lieutenant colonel johannes drucker report to the base commandants office you are ordered to report to the base commandants office drucker took a last bite of blood sausage it might really be the last bite i ever take he thought as he got to his feet most of the men in the hall looked down at their own mess trays sure enough they thought political unreliability was contagious a few stared avidly they wanted him to get a noodle in the back of the neck he hurried to general dornbergers office wondering if a couple of hulking fellows in ss black would be waiting for him in the antechamber if they werewell he still had his service pistol on his hip but what would they do to his family if he made them kill him fast instead of taking him away to do a lingering nasty job with such thoughts going through his mind he wondered why he kept heading toward the commandants office instead of running because you know damn well theyd catch you thats why and maybe he wasnt in a whole lot of trouble he laughed fat chance when he got to the antechamber he saw no bully boys in black shirts only dornbergers dyspeptic adjutant shooting out his arm in salute he said reporting as ordered yes major neufeld eyed him i rather wondered if you would the general expected you though go on in reporting as ordered drucker said again after hed saluted general dornberger dornberger puffed on his cigar then set it in the glass ashtray on his desk he now had a photo of dr kaltenbrunner in his office too drucker you are a man who does his duty he said yes sir drucker said in spite of everything dornberger went on and then waved a hand to show drucker didnt need to answer that the base commandant drew on the cigar again i have an a on the gantry fueled and ready for launch are you prepared to go into space within the hour jawohl drucker saluted again then he went from military automaton to honestly confused human being sir am i allowed has my grounding been rescinded instead of answering general dornberger picked up a flimsy sheet of yellow paper i have here an order for your immediate arrest and incarceration i got it half an hour ago i have spent that half hour documenting how i ordered your launch last night because of shortages of pilots i will finish the documentation in the time remaining until the rocket goes up then of course just too late i will receive this telegram how unfortunate that i could not obey the order dont you agree try as he would drucker couldnt hold his stiff brace his knees sagged he stared at walter dornberger my god sir he breathed wont they put your head on the block instead of mine not a chance dornberger said calmly they havent got anyone else who can run peenemunde even a quarter as well and they bloody well know it theyll yell at me and tell me i was a naughty boy and ill go on about my business for as long as i can go on about it for as long as you can go on about it drucker echoed what about me what do i do if they order me to land ignore them general dornberger told him youre carrying two missiles with explosivemetal bombs they cant argue too hardor theyd better not but i cant stay up forever even so drucker said what do i do when i run low on oxygen maybe i can fix things by then dornberger replied if you hear the phrase served with honor in any communication you will know i have done it if you do not hear that phrase you would do better to land somewhere outside the greater german reich drucker gulped what would they do to his family if he did that before he could speak dornberger held up a hand i do not expect any of this to matter lieutenant colonel when you go up there i think you will have every opportunity to make yourself a hero for the vaterland that could mean only one thing in a small voice drucker said the balloon is going up with him at the helm dornberger jerked a contemptuous thumb at the new color photograph on the wall behind him yes the balloon is going up if he werent the fuhrer hed make a good butchers assistant but he is and we must obey he might have been speaking more to himself than to drucker then he grew brisk once more a motorcar will be waiting outside it will take you to the gantry and drucker yes sir if we must go down let the lizards know theyve been in a brawl yes sir drucker saluted spun on his heel and marched out of the office he saluted major neufeld too even though he outranked the commandants adjutant the volkswagen was there the driver said to the gantry sir drucker nodded not trusting himself to speak aircooled engine roaring flatulently the vw sped off at the gantry the crew had druckers pressure suit tailored to his measure ready and waiting the upper stage of the a there wasnt kathe he could tell that at a glance someone else had his baby this upper stage looked older more battered almost of an earlier generation in the crisis the reich was using anything that could fly a couple of the technicians gave drucker curious or hostile looks as they helped him into his pressure suit his fellow pilots werent the only ones who knew about his troubles with the higherups of course but then one of the techs said good to see you cleared for launch again sir thanks helmut drucker answered ive been away too long going back will feel good it will certainly feel a hell of a lot better than getting thrown in the guardhouse and handed over to the blackshirts for interrogation but as he rode the elevator to the upper stage of the a he wondered about that if the new fuhrer really was crazy enough to go to war with the lizards over poland how long would the german spacecraft in earth orbit last for that matter how much longer would the hermann goring last out in the asteroid belt he shrugged he couldnt do anything about that and if the race blew him out of orbit odds were hed be dead before he knew it he wouldnt be able to say that if the ss got its hooks into him hansulrichs bus that was the name painted on the upper stages flank when drucker climbed into the bus he discovered it had seen better days everything looked worn shabby he half expected to find cigarette butts under the leathercovered acceleration couch but as he went through the checks he found everything in working order a good thing too because they were going to launch him any which way a technician slammed the entry port shut drucker dogged it conversations with the launch crew were quicker more perfunctory than they had been before the crisis they wanted to get him out there and only some obviously looming disaster would keep them from doing it it would be a disaster for me if they aborted all right drucker thought but they didnt the last numbers of the countdown sounded in his earphones and then the great thunder of the as main engine sounded in every fiber of his body acceleration slammed him back into the seat he wondered whether hans ulrichs bus had an oldmodel seat or if it was simply that he hadnt gone up for a while whichever it was the kick in the pants seemed harder than usual all the instruments read as they should have as far as they could judge the flight was perfect when acceleration cut off with the upper stage in its proper orbit druckers stomach lurched a couple of times before settling down ive been away too long he thought with something approaching horror he was normally one of the minority who enjoyed weightlessness and then as hed known it would the radio squawked into life lieutenant colonel drucker lieutenant colonel drucker do you read me lieutenant colonel drucker not very wellyour signal is breaking up he lied it didnt matter the radio operator on the other end of the circuit went right on talking you are to land your upper stage immediately lieutenant colonel ground telemetry has discovered an oxygenline leak your safety is endangered in normal times that would have got him down in a hurry now he smiled and said my instruments say everything is normal the reich needs me here ill take the chance and stay your patriotism is appreciatedill bet drucker thoughtbut we cannot take the risk you are ordered to return to earth as soon as possible for the sake of the vaterland i must disobey this order druckers smile got bigger two hypocrites were trying to outlie each other the radioman cajoled he talked about the blemish on druckers sterling service record he talked about disciplinary action after drucker did land before very long he faded out of range another one would pick up the thread soon drucker was sure of it but that didnt matter they couldnt talk him down he didnt think theyd have another flier in an upper stage try to shoot him down his smile slipped then no theyd save that for the lizardsand the lizards were all too likely to be able to pull it off jonathan yeagers voice broke in exasperation something that hadnt happened to him in a couple of years but mom he cried no his mother repeated no no you are not going up there while the race and the germans are liable to start throwing things at each other any minute now and thats final your mothers right his father said its just too dangerous right now lets wait and see how things work out kassquits not going anywhere its not just kassquit jonathan said its the chance to do all this stuff to go up there to talk with the lizards he felt his ears getting hot just the same it wasnt just kassquit but a lot of it was his father shook his head wait he said after things settle downif things settle downthe invitation will still be open dad jonathan took a deep breath dad the invitation was for me you know if the lizards want me up there if theyll take me up there i can go you can his mother said you can but you may not you do not have our permission another deep breathand then one more for luck id like your permission sure but i dont have to have it im twentyone now if theyll take me im going to go and thats flat youre doing no such thing his mother said through clenched teeth barbara his father said in a tone of voice that made his mother look as if shed been stabbed in the back his father took a deep breath of his own then went on i was eighteen when i left the farm you know you werent heading off to places where the world could blow up any minute though jonathans mother said no but i might have if id been a little older his father answered plenty of boys jonathans age couldnt get off the farm fast enough to go fight in the trenches and i tried to join the army after pearl harbor but they wouldnt have me he opened his mouth and tapped one of the front teeth on his upper plate they took me after the lizards landed but they took anybody who was breathing then if theyd taken him earlier i wouldnt be here because he never would have met mom jonathan thought his mind shied away from things like that dealing with what was seemed hard enough mighthavebeens were a lot worse let him go barbara his father said its what he wants to doand the lizards have a lot of ships out there even if the worst happens odds are hell be fine odds his mother made it into the filthiest word in the language she turned on her heel and walked back to the bedroom with long furious strides she slammed the door after her when she went in there jonathan couldnt remember her ever doing that before congratulations his father said youve won go pack a bag your moms right about this much you may be up there longer than you expect okay jesus dad thanks jonathan bounced to his feet he started to hurry off to his own room then stopped and turned back hesitantly he asked how much trouble will you get into for this as long as you come home safe nothing that wont blow over his father hesitated too if anything happens to you ill be in too much trouble with myself to worry about what your mother does jonathan didnt care to think about that so he didnt he hurried into his bedroom and packed shorts and underwear and socks a toothbrush and toothpaste and a razor and a pack of blades he wasnt worried about food if the lizards had fed kassquit all these years they could take care of him too and he packed something hed bought at a drugstore he didnt usually go to a box of trojans his father took care of the arrangements with the race and with his own superiors at supper that eveningas brittle a meal as jonathan had ever eatenhis dad said launch from the races shuttlecraft is a little past four tomorrow afternoon ill drive you to the airport okay jonathan said by his mothers closed expression she didnt think it was anywhere close to okay his dad didnt look convinced either neither one of them contradicted him out loud though he thought about calling karen in the end he didnt what could he say considering why he was going into space either nothing or a pack of lies nothing seemed better he took care of mickey and donald the next day knowing he wouldnt for a while he waved to them im going away but ill come back pretty soon byebye they waved back mickey made a noise that might have been byebye but it might not have too he and donald talked more than baby lizards had any business doing but less than baby people his father took him up to the airport copsno they were soldiersescorted the car to the shuttlecrafts landing area thanks dad jonathan said as he got out im not so sure youre welcome his father answered but then he stuck out his hand jonathan leaned back in to shake it down came the shuttlecraft its braking rocket roaring louder than any jet engine jonathan had ever heard when the entry hatch opened he climbed the ladderawkwardly with his bagand got inside get in strap down as soon as we are refueled we shall depart the shuttlecraft pilot said it shall be done superior sir jonathan hoped hed guessed right the pilot didnt contradict him so he supposed he had having gone into space twice before jonathan found the third launch routine which was probably a testimony to the shuttlecraft pilots skill the male tended to the craft all the way through the flight and said a lot less than the female named nesseref had on his previous trip to the starship jonathan wondered what the male would have done if hed been sick from weightlessness he was glad he didnt have to find out as soon as he left the shuttlecraft and entered the starship a lizard seized his bag from him declaring we shall search this after he had searched ithe opened the toothpaste tube to see what was inside and asked what the razor was forhe gave it back nothing useful in sabotaging the ship come along it shall be done superior sir jonathan said once more sabotaging the ship was the last thing he wanted to do the race is worried he thought and im not even a german i wonder if they really understand how different different countries are as he had before he got heavier the farther he went from the starships hub at last when he was close to his proper weight the lizard escorting him said this is the chamber holding the female kassquit heart thumping more sweat on his forehead than the heat could account for jonathan went inside i greet you superior female he said and bent into the posture of respect i greet you kassquit replied and returned the gesture to one side of the chamber stood something he hadnt expected to see in a starship an army cot from whose army he wasnt sure the lizards had done some research then and hadnt got everything wrong jonathan was acutely conscious of being alone in a room with an attractive young woman not wearing any clothes he was even more acutely conscious of lizards walking along the corridor outside and every so often swiveling an eye turret toward the chamber to see what was going on he said can you shut that door kassquit made the affirmative gesture she touched a button by the doorway the door silently slid shut is that better she asked now jonathan used the gesture kassquit asked you prefer privacy then among the race from what i have seen it matters very little it matters for tosevites jonathan tacked on an emphatic cough you may have less than you expect but i suppose expectations count too kassquit said while jonathan was still trying to untangle that she added you understand then that you have come up here for the purpose of mating she didnt beat around the bush at all jonathan stopped worrying about the first part of what shed said the second demanded every bit of his attention yes he said carefully i understand that very well kassquit started to say something then stopped when she spoke again he would have bet it wasnt what shed first intended to say it was instead an almost plaintive question are you nervous yes he repeated and used another emphatic cough good she said so am i this is very strange for me being a tosevite at all is strange for me being one in this way it is something i have not done before and had not imagined i would want to do before i understandi hope i understand he said he wondered if so much had ever ridden on a man and a womans lying down together he had his doubts i will do my best to please you i thank you kassquit replied gravely i will do the same for you without missing a beat she went on if we are to do this should you not remove your wrappings i suppose so jonathan knew he sounded sheepish he hadnt expected her to be quite so matteroffact in one quick gesture he pulled off his shorts and the jockeys he wore beneath them kassquit studied him she never seen a naked man before he realized he knew a certain amount of pride in rising to the occasion she came up to him and asked may i touch you he nodded then remembered to use the gesture she understood she wrapped her palm around him then to his astonishment she dropped to her knees and took him in her mouth how do you know to do that he spluttered i watched videos she answered seriously i wanted to be prepared am i doing it correctly she sounded anxious yes he said with another emphatic cough wondering where on earthor off itshe could have got stag movies oh yes but as she bent toward him again he said wait she looked up at him her face didnt couldnt show anything had it he thought it would have shown puzzlement he pointed toward the cot if you lie there i will try to please you she got to her feet as she walked to the cot she remarked i do not think anyone has ever tried to please me the resigned way she said it made tears come to jonathans eyes it also made him all the more resolved to do everything he could for her she didnt get kissing he found that out at once when he knelt on the metal floor by the cot but when his mouth went to her breasts instead of her lips she let out a soft surprised sigh the one bit of advice hed had from his father was dont hurry he tried to remember that now when hurrying was what he most wanted to do he stroked her all over before he let his hand slip between her legs she was already wet he moved his head down a little later hed done that only a couple of times with karen and didnt know how good he was kassquits being shaved made things easier or at least less distracting and the unrestrained noises kassquit made left him with no doubt hed done well enough he went back to his bag and took out the box of trojans kassquit reached under the cot and held outan identical box they both laughed kassquit first in the races fashion and then noisily like a human jonathan put on a rubber hed practiced at home he hadnt wanted to make a botch of it he was about to get down on the cot between kassquits legs when a horrible wordless hissing broke out from a speaker overhead kassquit sprang up in alarm words words in the language of the race followed emergency stations we are under attack emergency stations at once we are under attack kassquit ran past the wild big ugly to the door when she hit the button it slid open come with me she said to jonathan yeager you have no proper emergency station so come to my compartment it shall be done he tossed the box of elastic sheaths into his satchel which he picked up then he realized he was still wearing a sheath himself he peeled it off and threw it on the floor kassquit disapproved of such untidiness as he followed her out into the corridor he asked is it the deutsche i do not know what else it could be kassquit answered hurry the emergency warning echoed through the ship males and females of the race rushed this way and that heading for their own emergency stations some few would defend the starship the rest merely huddle in it if an explosivemetal bomb burst against its side they would die where they huddled probably faster than they could realize they were dead seeing big uglies inside the starship made some males and females shout angrily kassquit shouted back so did jonathan yeager not always quite grammatically then he asked the very question shed pondered a moment before what happens if we are hit she gave him the only answer shed come up with we die his face twisted she knew little of the facial expressions wild big uglies used from what shed gathered though this one did not indicate pleasure here was her home corridor here was her home doorway she punched the keypad outside it she had to try twice to get the combination right when she did the door opened she went inside again jonathan yeager followed she closed the door behind them even through the metal the clicks of toeclaws on metal and the cries of frightened males and females came clearly kassquit was frightened too and so no doubt was jonathan yeager she needed a little while to realize how frightened he must be she at least was where she belonged where shed lived her whole life he had to be as much adrift as she would have been had war broken out while she was on the surface of tosev what do we do now he asked if there were any answers he knew she had to be the one who had them he depends on me she realized with a small shock shed never had anyone do that before shed always been the one who depended on ttomalss wait she told him the obvious hope the allclear sounds once past the obvious she had to pause and think but not for long she wished she could form her face into the expression wild big uglies used to show amiability also we ought to go on with what we were doing before the alarm came jonathan yeager threw back his head and barked tosevite laughter we have a saying eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we may die the laughter stopped but it may not be tomorrow it may be the next instant that is a truth kassquit said because it is a truth should we not go on is there anything else you would rather do no he said and added an emphatic cough nor i she lay down on her sleeping mat it was less resilient than the cot brought up from tosev it fits the race needs not mine she thoughtbut it would have to do let us continue then shed expected him to put on another sheath and continue from exactly the point where they were interrupted instead to her surprise and delight he knelt beside her and began stimulating her all over again she hadnt realized she could be stimulated on the web of flesh between her thumb and forefinger or the crook of her elbow or her earlobes shed always hated her ears which marred the smooth lines of her head and wished she had hearing diaphragms instead as the race did here was a reason to change her mind she hadnt expected his mouth on her breasts gave her more pleasure than her own fingers had she wasnt so sure that was true when his head went between her legs she knew just what to do and when to do it there he didnt he was finding out by experiment when shed stroked herself though shed always known what would happen next with jonathan yeagers caresses she didnt sometimes the surprises were disappointing sometimes they were altogether delightful she gasped and shuddered taken to her peak of pleasure almost by surprise after that jonathan yeager did reach for the box of sheaths would you not like me to stimulate you as well kassquit asked the corners of his mouth turned up i am stimulated he answered and pointed to that part of himself which proved the truth of his words if you stimulate me much more i will he paused perhaps looking for a way to put what he wanted to say into the language of the race he found one i will spill my seed and then you would have to wait a while before i could mate again that was the first kassquit had heard of tosevites having to wait between matings how long she asked a day ten days he laughed again no not so long as either of those maybe a tenth part of a day maybe even less than that kassquit considered you gave me pleasurei would like to return it she said at last it seems only fair after all if you spill your seed before we mate then you do that is all and we will wait if not we will go on is that all right the corners of his mouth turned up again yes indeed superior female he said and lay back on the mat partly remembering the videos of big uglies mating shed watched partly imitating what jonathan yeager had done with her kassquit worked her way down his body with her hands and mouth by the small noises he made she judged she was succeeding in giving him pleasure as he had with her she crouched between his legs and stimulated him with her mouth with a small whir the door to her chamber slid open and ttomalss walked in jonathan yeagers reaction astonished kassquithe made a noise that sounded something like eep jerked away from her so quickly that she almost bit him and held both hands in front of the organ shed been stimulating ttomalss said i greet you kassquit and you jonathan yeager i wanted to make certain you were both safe i am glad to see you are he turned to go i thank you superior sir kassquit said as he left jonathan yeager said eep again kassquit wondered what it meant in his language she got up and closed the door once more then walked back to him shall we go on he said something else she didnt understand it sounded like jesus then he went back to the language of the race after that i hope i can kassquit wondered what he meant she found out he had wilted more stimulation seemed called for she applied it she wondered what was in his laugh as he rose again she thought it sounded like relief but had too little experience with tosevites to be sure there she said briskly after a little while nowthe sheath it shall be done he said and did it in the videos shed seen several possible mating postures female astride male seemed as practical as male mounting female she straddled jonathan yeager and joined their organs as she lowered herself onto him she stopped in sudden surprise and pain this is a mating she exclaimed it should not hurt the idea of mating that gave pain rather than pleasure struck her as addled even by the standards of tosev but jonathan yeager said female tosevites have a membrane that must be broken on the first mating that can cause pain after the membrane heals this does not happen again i see kassquit sighed she hadnt known that none of her research had shown it she wondered if the race even knew it she shrugged if she hadnt found out about it before it couldnt matter much even to wild big uglies she bore down the membrane certainly was there jonathan yeager had better information than she did she bore down again at the same time as he thrust up from beneath her the membrane tore she hissed it did hurt and she wasnt used to physical pain is it all right jonathanyeager asked isuppose so kassquit answered i have no standards of comparison he kept moving inside her that went on hurting but less than it had when he first pierced her it brought a little pleasure with it but not nearly so much as she got from a hand or from his tongue she wondered if it would be different after she healed beneath her jonathan yeagers face went very red he grunted clutched her hindquarters ahnost painfully tight and thrust himself into her to the hilt then he relaxed his eyes which had squeezed shut opened again the corners of his mouth turned upward kassquit slid off him her blood streaked the sheath and her inner thighs is it supposed to be like this she asked jonathan yeager yes i think so he answered he took off the sheath which was messy inside and out what do i do with this superior female she showed him herethis is the trash chute i do not think it would be wise to send it through the plumbing it might cause a blockage in the pipes that would not be good not in a starship he said no it would not kassquit agreed tosevite wastes already give the plumbing difficulties it was not designed to handle she went to the sink wet a tissue and wiped the blood from her legs and private parts then she sent the tissue down the trash chute too jonathan yeager imitated everything she did as he washed himself you are going to have to show me things here he told her i do not know how to live on this starship any more than you would know how to live in my land on tosev it should not be too hard she said he laughed not for youyou have lived here all your life for me everything is strange you have no idea how strange everything here is that was likely to be true kassquit said i only hope we can go on living here as if to underscore her words the floor shuddered a little beneath her feet what was that jonathan yeager asked i do not know not for certain she answered but i think it may have been missiles firing at a target oh the wild tosevite said and then i hope they hit it so do i kassquit answered if they do not hit it it will hit us i know that jonathan yeager put his arm around her no male or female of the race would have made such a gesture physical contact mattered more among big uglies than it did to the race having grown up among the race kassquit had not thought it would matter to her she was surprised to discover herself mistaken genetic programming mattered the touch of another of her kindand one with whom shed known other physical intimaciesbrought a certain reassurance not that that will do us any good whatever if a missile does strike this starship she thought and then wished she hadnt for mordechai anielewicz a quarter of a century might have fallen away in the course of bare days here again were the nazis swarming over polands western border panzer engines rumbling attack aircraft diving on the forces defending the land where hed lived all his life coming out of lodz he was a lot closer to the border than he had been in when hed lived in warsaw the germans didnt have so far to come to get him this time on the other hand poland was better able to fight back than she had been then a lizard fired a missile at an oncoming german panzer the panzer stopped coming on it burst into flames a hatch opened german soldiers started bailing out anielewicz squeezed the trigger on his automatic rifle one of the germans threw out his arms spun and fell facedown a lot of bullets were flying mordechai didnt know whether hed been the one who killed the nazi he hoped so though the lizards didnt have a lot of troops on the groundmost of their males were in landcruisers by themselves theyd had trouble with the wehrmacht when the conquest fleet first landed the nazis were a lot better armed now than they had been in that was why jewish fighters and poles served as a lot of the infantry in the fight against the german invaders gas the cry rang out in yiddish in polish and in the language of the race at almost the same instant mordechai anielewicz yanked out his mask and put it on with almost desperate haste it wasnt complete protection against nerve gas he knew that all too well and hed already had one dose of what the germans had used during the last round of fighting against the race he didnt know how much he could take now without quietly falling over dead maybe youll get to find out he thought breathing in air that tasted of rubber through an activatedcharcoal canister that gave him a pigsnouted look if hed been a proper kind of fighting leader he wouldnt have been at the front at all he would have been back in a headquarters somewhere tens of kilometers to the rear with aides to peel him grapes and with dancing girls to pinch whenever he felt he needed a break from commanding but headquarters werent necessarily safe these days either he couldnt think of any place in poland that was necessarily safe as soon as talks between the race and the germans broke down hed got his wife and children and heinrichs beffel out of lodz and into a hamlet called widawa southwest of the city widawa wasnt safe either and the knowledge that it wasnt ate at him it was closer to the german border than lodz was he didnt want to think about what would happen if the nazis overran the little town trouble was he also didnt want to think about what would happen if the nazis hit lodz with an explosivemetal missile if they did the city would goand probably the fallout from the blast would blow east looked at that way widawa made more sense than a lot of other refuges machinegun bullets stitched the ground in front of anielewicz kicking up dirt that bounced off the lenses of his gas mask he blinked as if the dirt had gone in his eye if he did get an eyelash in his eye or something like that he would have to live with it if he took off the mask to get it out he would die on account of it another german panzer started burning they didnt go up like bombs the way they had before though back in the last round of fighting theyd used gasolinefueled engines now they ran on diesel fuel as russian tanks had even then or on hydrogen as lizard landcruisers did but the germans had a lot of panzers the flame that burst from a machine near the one that had taken a hit was muzzle flash not damage and a lizard landcruiser off to anielewiczs right caught fire itself males of the race bailed out as german soldiers had a moment before mordechai grunted though he could hardly hear himself inside the mask in the last round of fighting the germans had counted on losing five or six of their best panzers for every lizard landcruiser they knocked out the ratio would have been higher than that but the nazis were tactically better than the race as they had been tactically better than the red army and now they had panzers that could stand against the landcruisers the lizards had brought from home that wasnt a pretty thought but before mordechai could do more than form it it vanished from his mind the day was typical of polish springtime with clouds covering the sun more often than not all of a sudden though a sharp black shadow stretched out ahead of anielewicz toward the west he whirled there right about where lodz waswould have beenhad beena great apricotandsalmoncolored cloud utterly unlike the gray ones spawned by nature climbed into the sky crying inside the gas mask mordechai rapidly discovered was almost as bad as getting something in his eye in there he blinked and blinked trying to clear his vision yisgadal vyiskadash shmay rabo he began the kaddish the prayer for the dead looking around he saw polish fighting men making the sign of the cross the expression was different but the sentiment was the same the repulsively beautiful cloud rose and rose mordechai wondered how many other explosivemetal bombs were going off in poland then he wondered how many would go off above the greater german reich and then with horror that truly chilled him he wondered how many people would survive between the pyrenees and the russian border he wondered if he would be one of them too but that thought came only later weve got to fall back somebody near him bawled the germans are cutting us off how many times had that frightened cry rung out on battlefields throughout europe during the last round of fighting this was how the wehrmacht worked its brutal magic pierce the enemy line with armor then either surround his soldiers or make him retreat it had worked in poland in france in russia why wouldnt it work again anielewicz couldnt see any reason why it wouldnt work again not if the nazis had broken throughand they had form a rear guard he shouted we have to slow them down he fired at a german infantryman who dove for cover but more germans kept coming infantrymen following the panzers into the hole the armored machines had broken in the defenders line the nazis had been doing that since theyd had more practice than any other human army in the world however much practice they had at it though not everything went their way the poles hated them as much as ever and didnt like retreating and the jewish fighters whom anielewicz led hated retreating and wouldnt be captured they knewthose of his generation from the bitterest personal experiencethe fate of jews who fell into german hands german jets raced low over the battlefield spraying it with rockets and rapidfiring cannon shells they didnt have it all their own way either the lizards killercraft replied in kind and were better in quality but the germans had been building like men obsessedwere men obsessedand had more airplanes as they had more panzers step by step the defenders of poland were forced back what are we going to do one of anielewiczs fighters asked him seen through the lenses of his gas mask the mans eyes were wide with horror keep fighting mordechai answered i dont know what else we can do what if the poles give way the jew demanded they wont anielewicz said theyve fought well theyd better be fighting well we have to have emthere are a lot more of them than there are of us all the same he worried not so much that the poles would throw in the towel as at the command structure or lack of same of the defenders he commanded his jews the poles led their own and the lizards while theoretically in charge of everybody were a lot more diffident than they might have been whatever command problems the germans might have had diffidence wasnt one of them battered by superior force the defenders fell back toward lodzor rather toward what had been lodz before long they began running into refugees streaming out from the city some of those plainly wouldnt last long they were vomiting blood and their hair fell out in clumps theyd been far too close to the bomb its radiation was killing them anielewicz had never seen burns like those in all his life it was as if some of their faces had been melted to slag some people were blind in one eye some in both that was a matter of luck depending on the direction in which theyd happened to face when the bomb went off some were burned on one side but not the other the shadow of their own bodies having protected them from the hideous flash of light and bad off as they were they told stories of worse horrors closer to the explosion everythings melted down flat an elderly polish man said just flat with only little bits of things sticking out from what looks like glass its not glass i dont guess what it is is its what everything got melted down into you know what i mean a woman a badly burned woman who probably wouldnt live had her own tale i came out of what was left of my house and there was my neighbors wall next door all the paint got burned off itexcept where shed been standing i dont know what happened to her i never saw her again i think she burned up instead of that stretch of the wall and all that was left of her was her silhouette heredrink mordechai said and gave her water from his canteen he thanked god his own family was in widawa maybe they would live if theyd stayed in lodz they would surely be dead because the refugees filled the roads they made fighting and moving harder but then to anielewiczs delighted surprise the german onslaught slowed he and his comrades and the lizards contained them well short of lodz before long he ran into someone with a radio whod been listening to reports of how the wider war was going breslau the fellow said the germans had set off an explosivemetal bomb east of it in the last round of fighting it wasnt the germans this time it was the races turn peenemunde leignitz frankfurt on the oder he tolled the roll of devastation olmutz kreuzberg neustettin a light went on in anielewiczs head no wonder the germans have stalled the race is bombing all their cities near the border they must be having the devils time getting supplies through thats not all the race is bombing the man with the radio answered the lizards arent playing the game halfway this time will there be anything left of the world when theyre through mordechai asked i dont know about the world the man answered but ill tell you this there wont be much left of the goddamn greater german reich mordechai anielewicz said good so far the deutsche had aimed four missiles at cairo the race had knocked down two one warhead had failed to detonate and even the explosivemetal bomb that had gone off exploded a good distance east of the city all things considered it could have been much worse and atvar knew it he swung an eye turret toward kirel they thought we would be meek and mild and forbearing he said not this time they miscalculated in spite of all our warnings they miscalculated and now they are going to pay for it indeed exalted fleetlord kirel pointed toward the map on the monitor in front of atvar they have paid for it already not yet atvar said not enough this time we are going to make a proper example of them by the time we are through with the reich nothing will be left of it kirel said good atvar said coldly the deutsche have troubled us altogether too much in the past weihave been far too patient the time for patience is past in the future the deutsche shall not trouble us again kirel ordered a different map up on the monitor they have also done us considerable damage in the present conflict atvar sighed that unfortunately was to be expected with their orbiting weapons and with those fired from their submersible boats the time between launch and detonation is very short our colonies on the island continent and on the central peninsula of the main continental mass have suffered as have those west of here and our orbiting starships kirel said and our orbiting starships atvar agreed and also poland very heavily which is unfortunate we might have done better not to settle so many colonists in poland atvar admitted the only reason we ended up administering the subregion was that none of the tosevite factions involved in the area would admit that any of the others had the right to control it to reduce the chances of an outbreak we kept itand see what our reward was for that reward is hardly the term i would use exalted fleetlord kirel said pshing came into atvars office which had become the command post for the races war against the reich exalted fleetlord our monitors have just picked up a new broadcast from the notemperor of the deutsche oh a pestilence atvar burst out we have expended several warheads on nuremberg i had hoped their command and control would be utterly disrupted by now we shall just have to keep trying that is all well pshing what does the big ugly say his tone remains defiant exalted fleetlord his adjutant replied translation indicates he still predicts ultimate victory for his side he is as addled as an egg twenty days past hatching in the hot sun atvar said unfortunately exalted fleetlord he is not so addled as to have failed to take shelter against our attacks at least not yet kirel said we kept getting reports that the deutsche were constructing elaborate subterranean shelters those reports if anything appear to have been understatements so they do atvar said and the deutsche appear to have continued all the ruthlessness they displayed in the earlier fighting you will recall that we hoped some of their subject allies would desert them yes exalted fleetlord kirel said and one of those notempiresthe one called romania wasnt it did attempt to do so yes that notempire attempted to do so atvar said whereupon the deutsche detonated an explosivemetal bomb above its largest city that notempire or what is left of it now loudly proclaims its loyalty to the reich and the other subject allies are too terrified to do anything but obey how much more harm can the deutsche do us exalted fleetlord pshing asked their armies in poland are already faltering for lack of supplies and reinforcements atvar replied most of their facilities in space have been destroyed as have as many of their groundbased launch sites as we could hunt down those submersible boats of theirs are our greatest problem now every so often they will surface throw more missiles and then disappear again and once submerged the miserable things are almost impossible to detect or destroy in short kirel said they can go on hurting us for a while they have no hopenone whatsoeverof defeating us atvar made the affirmative gesture that is the truth at the yolk of the egg bit by bit they are being smashed they have harmed us but they will be in no condition to keep on harming us much longer and that is as it should be pshing said an alert light appeared on the monitor i will answer your telephone in the antechamber pshing told the fleetlord and hurried away a moment later he came back exalted fleetlord it is the ambassador from the notempire of the united states he requests an immediate audience find out what he wants atvar said pshing disappeared again when he came back he said he seeks terms for a ceasefire between the race and the reich is the reich seeking to surrender and to yield itself to us atvar asked is he coming at the request of the deutsch government i shall inquire pshing duly did so then reported no exalted fleetlord his mover is his own notemperor seeking to end the war tell him i will not see him under those circumstances atvar replied if the deutsche want to end the war they can ask us for terms no one else may do so tell him just that it shall be done pshing said when he came back this time though he sounded worried the ambassador says the american notemperor will take a very dim view of our refusal to discuss terms with his representative does he atvar let out an unhappy hiss if the united states got angry enough to join the fighting especially without much warning victory looked much less secure and the race would suffer much more damage the fleetlord changed his mind very well then he may come pick some reasonably short amount of time from now and tell him to arrive then it shall be done pshing said and made the arrangement henry cabot lodge entered the fleetlords office at precisely the appointed time even for a tosevite he was unusually tall and unusually erect he spoke the language of the race with a heavy accent but was fluent enough i greet you exalted fleetlord he said and bent into the posture of respect i greet you and i greet your notemperor through you atvar replied what message does he wish to convey through you that you have punished the deutsche enough the american big ugly replied they cannot take poland their facilities in space are badly damaged and their homeland is a shambles president warren strongly feels any more attacks against them would be superfluous if your notemperor sat in my chair he would have a different opinion atvar stressed that with an emphatic cough to show how sure he was he would aim to be certain the deutsche could never menace him again which is what we aim to do now how was the hermann goring menacing you henry cabot lodge asked in no way anyone could see and yet you destroyed it we do not know what the deutsch spacecraft was doing or would be doing atvar replied we were not interested in taking a chance and finding out either he turned both eye turrets toward the big ugly we do not know what the lewis and clark is doing either he added pointedly whatever it is doing it is none of the races concern lodge said and used an emphatic cough of his own if you interfere with its operation in any way or attack it the united states will reckon that an act of war and we will answer with every means at our disposal do i make myself plain you do atvar seethed but did his best not to show it before hed gone into cold sleep hed never imagined he would have to submit to such insolence from a tosevite but let me also make one thing clear to you you are not a party to the dispute between the race and the reich because you are not a party you would be well advised to remove your snout from the dispute or it will be bitten do i make myself plain events all over this planet are the concern of the united states oh atvar spoke in a soft menacing tone he wondered if the big ugly could perceive that do you consider yourself a party to this dispute then is your notempire declaring war on the race you had better make yourself very very plain lodge licked his fleshy lips a sign of stress among the tosevites no we are not declaring war he said at last we are trying to arrange a just and lasting peace the race will attend to that atvar answered battering the deutsche to the point where they are not dangerous to us is the best way i can think of to make certain the peace endures and that peace will last would you not agree perhaps that peace will lodge said but you will also frighten the united states and the soviet union is that what you want i know the deutsche have hurt you how much could we and the sssr hurt you do you want to make us more likely to fight you you may do that how atvar was genuinely curious will you not think if we fight the race we will get what the reich got surely any sensible beings would think along those lines perhaps lodge said but perhaps not too his features were not so still as molotovs or gromykos but he revealed little we might think the race will believe we have so much fear that it can make any demand at all upon us we had better fight to show that belief is mistaken atvar didnt answer right away given what he knew of tosevite psychology the american ambassadors comment had an unpleasant ring of probability to it but he could not admit as much without yielding more ground than he wanted we shall have to take that chance he said is there anything more no exalted fleetlord lodge said i shall send your words back to president warren i fear he will be disappointed i do not relish this war myself it was forced on me atvar answered but now that i have it i intend to win it is that clear yes that is clear lodges sigh sounded much like that which might have come from a male of the race but i will also say that your reply is a personal disappointment to me i had hoped for better from the race and i had hoped for better from the deutsche atvar said i warned them what would happen if they chose conflict they did not care to believe me now they are paying for their errorand they deserve to pay for their error before the american ambassador could reply pshing burst in and said exalted fleetlord a deutsch missile has just got through our defenses and wrecked istanbul oh a plague atvar cried that makes resupplying poland all the more difficult he turned both eye turrets back to henry cabot lodge you see ambassador that the deutsche do not yet believe the war to be over if they do not i cannot either goodbye for a wonder lodge left without another word not for the first time sam yeager spoke reassuringly to his wife hes all right hon theres the message he pointed to the computer monitor read it yourselfhes fine nothing bad has happened to him as a matter of fact hes probably screwing himself silly and having the time of his life he didnt say that to barbara she wasnt reassured either he shouldnt be up there in the first place she said he ought to be down here in la where its safe yeager sighed barbara was probably right i really didnt think the germans would be dumb enough to start a war with the lizards honest i didnt well you should have barbara said and you should have put your foot down and kept him from going especially since you know the main thing he was going up there to do its one way to get to know somebody sometimes its the fastest way to get to know somebody sam raised an eyebrow it worked like that for us if you want to think back about it barbara turned red all she cared to remember these days was that she was respectably married and had been for a long time she didnt like remembering that shed started sleeping with sam during the fighting when shed thought her thenhusband dead she especially didnt like remembering that shed married sam not long before finding out her thenhusband remained very much alive maybe the marriage wasnt so perfectly respectable after all if she hadnt got pregnant right away she would have gone back to jens larssen in a redhot minute too sam thought hed heard larssen had come to a hard bad end later on sometimes he wondered what would have happened if barbara had gone back to jens would the physicist not have gone off the deep end no way to tell no way to know sam was pretty sure he would have been a lot less happy had she chosen the other way though barbara said what on earth are we going to tell karen the only thing im going to tell her is that jonathans fine sam answered ive already told her that i hope to heaven thats the only thing youre going to tell her too if jonathan wants to tell her anything else thats his business not yours not mine his his girlfriend is his problem hes twentyone so he kept telling us barbara hardly bothered hiding her bitterness but hes living under our roof not at the moment sam put in and whose fault is that his wife demanded he couldnt have gone if you hadnt let him it would have been harder yeager admitted but i think he would have managed it and if we had put our feet down hed be mad at us for years when would this chance have come along again this chance for what barbara asked to go into space or to go into she broke off grimacing now youve got me doing it sooner or later the nazis will run out of upper stages and orbiting bombs sam said then itll be safe for the lizards to let jonathan come home in the meantime ill go out of my mind worrying barbara said hes fine yeager said hell be fine hed been saying that all along sometimes on good days he managed to convince himself for a little while most of the time he was as nearly out of his mind with worry as his wife was long training in the minor leagues and in the army had taught him not to show whether or not things were going his way at any given moment that didnt mean he lacked feelings only that he kept them inside more than barbara did he never should have gone up there barbara glanced at the messagethe very reassuring messageon the computer screen shook her head and strode out of the study yeager left the connection to the races electronic network and went back to review messages hed received in the past the one hed got from straha a little before the germans attacked poland stuck in his mind he examined it yet again trying to extract fresh meaning from the shiplords oracular phrases he had no great luck hed been wondering for some time whether his own superiors had it in for him he had to wonder since none of the people whod tried to do bad things to his family and him suffered any great punishment some of those people hadnt suffered anything at all that he knew ofthe fellow with the molotov cocktail for instance and how had straha got wind of this probably from the hardnosed fellow who did his errands for him sam wouldnt have wanted to wind up on that guys bad side not even a little he wouldnt the next interesting question was how much did the lizards man friday know about such things sam realized he might know a great deal to work for straha he had to have a pretty high security clearance he also had to know a good deal about the race put those together and the odds were that he knew quite a bit about lieutenant colonel sam yeager how can i find out what he knows yeager muttered inviting the fellow over and pumping him while they drank beer didnt strike him as the best idea hed ever had he didnt think it would do any good and it would make the man suspicious of that sam had no doubt whatever anybody who did what strahas factotum did was bound to be suspicious for a living ill have to operate through straha yeager realized he started to telephone the defector but then checked himself straha hadnt phoned him but had used the races electronic network to pass on the message did that mean straha thought his own phone was tapped or did he worry about yeagers sam didnt know and didnt care for either alternative he reconnected to the lizards network and asked did you learn of my difficulties with my superiors from your driver he stared at the screen as if expecting the answer to appear immediately as a matter of fact he had expected the answer to appear immediately and felt foolish because of it straha had a right to be doing something other than sitting around waiting for a message from a big ugly named sam yeager as long as yeager was hooked up to the races electronic network he checked the news feeds the lizards were giving one another by what they were saying theyd squashed germany flat and everything was over but for the mopping up scattered deutsch units still refuse to acknowledge their inevitable defeat but their resistance must soon come to an end that wasnt the song the nazis were singing the race hadnt been able to knock out all their radio transmitters they claimed they were still advancing in poland they also claimed to have smashed the ground attacks the lizards had made into southern france since the lizards had stopped talking about those attacks a couple of days before yeager suspected german radio was telling the truth there it probably didnt matter though a map came up on the screen showing where the lizards had tossed explosivemetal bombs at the reich showing where the race hadnt sent them probably would have resulted in fewer marks on the display germany and its european puppets were going to glow in the dark for a long time to come before long the nazis would have to run out of men and equipment wouldnt they the race didnt show maps of where german explosivemetal bombs had hit with his connections sam had seen some rather more accurate versions than the papers were printing poland was wrecked of course but the germans submarines had managed surprisingly heavy blows against the new cities that had sprung up in australia and the arabian peninsula and north africawith the strong german presence in the mediterranean those last had been hit repeatedly without a doubt the reich had suffered and was suffering worse but the lizards had taken a pounding while that thought was still going through his mind he got the warning hiss that told of an electronic message arriving he checked to see whod sent it it could have been from straha from kassquit relaying news from jonathan or from sorviss the lizard exile whod first gained access to the network for him he hadnt yet used what hed got from sorviss so he couldnt very well give him any proper answer but the message turned out to be from straha yes i received this information this warning from gordon the exshiplord wrote i hope you will use it wisely i thank you yeager wrote back i think i can do that he chuckled under his breath what a liar im getting to be in my old age he muttered he knew what straha meant by using the information wisely staying out of things his own superiors thought were none of his business hed never been good at that not when his itch to know wanted scratching if things went wrong with what he was about to try hed land in even more hot water with a snort he shook his head people had already tried to kill him and burn down his house how could he get into worse trouble than that after turning off the lizardmade computer he used to join the races electronic network he removed his artificial fingerclaws and turned on the larger clumsier americanbuilt machine he used much less often its only advantage he could see was that it used a keyboard much like an ordinary typewriters even though it was made in the usa it used a lot of technology adapted from what the race also used when he inserted the skelkwank disk hed got from sorviss the computer accepted it without any fuss the lizard was convinced his coding would defeat any traps mere inexperienced humans could devise sam was interested in seeing if he was right somewhere in the rudimentary american computer network lay an archive hed tried to access a couple of times before an archive of communications and radio intercepts covering the time just before and after the surprise attack that had done the colonization fleet so much harm less harm than the germans have done it now he thought but that wasnt really what mattered not any more what mattered was that hed tried repeatedly to access the archive and failed every time and bad things had happened after every try too by now he wanted to know what was in there as much for his own sake as because he wanted to see whoeverd bombed the colonization fleet punished curiosity killed the cat he thought his own curiosity might well have come close to killing him but the proverb had another line too satisfaction brought it back there was the archive hed made it this far a couple of timesand the screen had gone blank as hed been disconnected from the network the first time hed thought that an accident he didnt think so any more his computer started making small purring noises he suspected he knew what that was sorviss coding at war against the measures the government had set up to keep unwelcome visitors out of the archive if humans had learned more about computers than sorviss thought sam might be in live steam not just hot water for a second the screen started to go dark he cursedsoftly so barbara wouldnt notice but then it cleared entry authorized it read proceed proceed he did as he read his eyes got wider and wider he finished then left the archive at once for good measure he turned off the computer too jesus he said shaken as he hadnt been since watching a teammate get beaned what the hell do i do now the first thing nesseref did when she got up in the morning was check her computer monitor that was the first thing she did any morning of course to see what the news was and what electronic messages had come in during the night but she had a more urgent reason for checking it today she wanted to find out what the fallout level was to see if she could safely leave her block of flats she let out an unhappy hiss it was very radioactive out there this morning were it not for the filters and scrubbers newly installed in the heating and air purification systems it would have been very radioactive inside the apartment too the deutsche were taking quite a pounding in the abstract nesseref didnt mind that at all but the prevailing winds on tosev blew from west to east they brought the radioactive ashes from the reich s funeral pyre straight into poland and the deutsche had also managed to detonate several explosivemetal bombs of their own inside poland those only made the fallout level worse theyd also done a lot of damage to tosevite centers and to those of the race in this subregion lodz had gone up in a hideous beautiful cloud nesseref wondered if the big ugly called mordechai anielewicz remained among the living she hoped so she also wished his youngest hatchling wellshed met young heinrich after all and heard about his beffel her concern for the rest of anielewiczs family was considerably more abstract they mattered to her not for their own sakes but because her friend would be concerned if anything happened to them orbit came up and turned an eye turret toward the screen as if the tsiongi were examining the fallout levels too his other eye turret swung toward nesseref when she made no move to take him outside for a walk he let out a dismayed hiss of his own no matter how he looked at the monitor he couldnt understand what the numbers displayed on it meant unfortunately nesseref could we cannot go walking today she said and scratched him between the eye turrets shed said that so often lately orbit was starting to know what it meant this time the look he gave her was halfway between dismayed and speculative as if he was wondering whether biting her on the tailstump might get her to change her mind she waggled a forefinger at him do not even think about it i am the mistress you are the pet remember your place in the hierarchy orbit hissed again as if to remind her that while inferiors were bound to respect superiors superiors had responsibilities to inferiors one of her responsibilities was taking the tsiongi for a walk whenever she could shed never been home and still failed to take him out for such a longtime as far as he could see she was falling down on the job the trouble was orbit couldnt see far enough suppose i feed you nesseref told him will that make you happier he wasnt smart enough to understand what shed said but he followed her out of the bedchamber and into the kitchen when she pulled a tin of food from the shelf reserved for him his tail lashed up and down slapping the floor again and again he knew what that meant she opened the tin the food plopped into his dish he started eating then paused and turned an eye turret toward her i know she said it is not just what you would get back on home it is made from the flesh of tosevite animals and it probably tastes funny to you but it is what i have you can eat it or you can go hungry those are your only choices i cannot give you what i do not have orbit kept on giving her that reproachful stare but he kept on eating too he kept on eating till the bowl was empty nesseref knew the food was nutritionally adequate for tsiongyu the label on the tin assured her of that but orbit hadnt evolved eating the beasts from which the food was made animals were even more conservative than males and females of the race if something was unfamiliar to them they were inclined to reject it nesseref heated a slice of smoked and salted pork for herself she found ham and bacon quite tasty even if they werent salty enough to suit her after shed eaten she went back into the bedroom and ordered an exercise wheel for orbit it would take up a lot of space in the apartment but it would also go a long way toward keeping the tsiongi healthy and happy when she entered her name and location a signal flashed onto the screen due to the present unfortunate emergency it read delivery of the ordered item is subject to indefinite delay oh go break an egg she snarled at the monitor if only she could get out of her apartment she could walk to the pet shop where shed bought orbit buy an exercise wheel and carry it back but if she could walk to the pet shop she could walk orbit too and then she wouldnt need the wheel your account will not be debited until the ordered item is delivered the computer told her thank you for your patience and cooperation during the present unfortunate emergency it is not an emergency she said it is a war she knew a war when she got stuck almost in the middle of one shed never expected to do that not when shed gone into cold sleep in orbit around home everything about tosev had turned out to be different from what shed expected she went over to the window and looked out to the streets that were so silently so invisibly dangerous far fewer motorcars and other vehicles moved in them than they usually held the ones that did move had all their windows rolled up some of them she knew boasted airfiltration systems of their own even so she was glad to be inside here at the moment she couldnt launch out of the local shuttlecraft port even had she wanted to deutsch aircraft had pounded the site doing their best to smash up all of the oncesmooth landing surface repair efforts were supposed to be under way but the radioactivity had inhibited them and airfields had higher priority because more supplies and reinforcements went through them than through shuttlecraft ports and there was generally too much to do and not enough with which to do it she was still peering out the window when a convoy of ambulances came racing into the new town from out of the west warning lights flickered atop them even through the doublepaned insulated window their alarm hisses hammered nesserefs hearing diaphragms they sped on toward the hospital a few blocks away she marveled that the hospital hadnt been overwhelmed war produced injuries on a scale shed never imagined till now orbit came up and stood on his hind legs leaning his forepaws on the glass so he could get his head up high enough to see out nesseref scratched him on the muzzle he shot out his tongue and licked her hand she wondered what he made of the view and thought hed come over mostly because he wanted companionship like befflem tsiongyu paid more attention to scent than to sight other alarms began to hiss a voice from the computer monitor shouted stridently air raid take cover deutsch air raid take cover at once nesseref said come on orbit she dove under the bed the new town had been attacked before she knew how terrifying that could be antiaircraft missiles roared out of launchers around the town antiaircraft gunssome made by the race others of tosevite manufacture but pressed into service all the samebegan to bark and crash and then above those barking crashes she heard the screams from the jet engines of several deutsch killercraft that the deutsche should have killercraft with jet engines still struck her as wrong unnatural even though shed been on tosev for several years now that she should be a target for those killercraft stuck her as a great deal worse if one of the bombs they dropped struck her building if one of the shells they fired struck her she didnt want to think about that it was hard not to though when bombs burst in the town and when shells started slamming into the building it shuddered as if in an earthquake fortunately it was harder to set on fire than a tosevite structure but fallout is getting in nesseref thought even before the allclear sounded she left the shelter that probably wouldnt have done her much good and stuffed plastic sheeting under the door she didnt know how much it would help if polluted air was getting in through the ducts it wouldnt do much of anything but it couldnt hurt orbit was intrigued nesseref had to speak sharply to keep the tsiongi from dragging away the plastic shed used the animals answering stare was reproachful shed had the fun of putting the plastic down why wouldnt she let him have the fun of pulling it up again because it might not be healthy for either one of us if you did nesseref told her pet that made no sense at all to orbit shed known it wouldnt an ambulance hissed up in front of her building along with its flashing lights she saw it also had a red cross painted on top of it that was no symbol the race used it belonged to the big uglies it meant the vehicle was used only to aid the sick and injured and so was not a proper military target workers leaped out of the ambulance and ran skittering into the apartment building when they came out again they carried wounded males and females on stretchers or helped them get into the ambulance under their own power the wounded left behind streaks and pools of blood nesseref could see even from her upperstory flat she turned away more than a little sickened shed never imagined seeing so much blood except perhaps at a rare traffic accident she swung an eye turret toward the monitor this buildings filtration system is still functional she read damaged windows are being resealed as rapidly as possible please remain calm damaged windows nesserefs mouth fell open in sardonic laughter didcouldanyone think the deutsch cannon shells had penetrated only through window glass they could have gone through the outer walls just as easilyand through several inner walls too anyone who thought would be able to see that in the flick of a nictitating membrane across an eyeball but how many males and females feel like thinking right now nesseref wondered how many will just want to seize any reassurance they can find nesseref sighed colonists hadnt come to tosev expecting the conquest to be continuing here theyd come to reconstruct lives as much like those back on home as they could make them she wondered how they would react to being plunged into the chaos of war by all shed seen big uglies took it for granted that wasnt so among her own kindfar from it the deutsche will never have another chance to do this to us she thought but what of the other independent notempires if they didnt walk soft they would be sorry she was sure of that back in south africa gorppet had more ginger than he knew what to do with when the race uprooted him from the comfortable post hed won as a reward for capturing the fanatic named khomeini hed brought barely enough to poland to keep himself happy for a little while and most of what he had he couldnt taste hed learned during the last round of fighting that a male who tasted too often thought he was braver and smarter and more nearly invulnerable than he really was he usually found out his mistake by finding himself dead gorppet had learned all sorts of things during the fighting that of course was why the race had summoned him back to combat he could have done without the honor hed already given the big uglies too many chances to kill or maim him that was his view of the matter anyhow as far as his superiors were concerned he was just one more munition to be expended as necessary at the moment he waited in a barn that smelled powerfully of tosevite animals a regiment leader was briefing him and a good many other lowerranking officers we can expect this latest deutsch thrust to exhaust itself before long the big uglies ability to resupply is almost entirely destroyed superior sir gorppet signaled for attention yes what is it smallunit group leader the officer asked superior sir did you ever run up against the deutsche during the last round of fighting gorppet asked no the regimental leader admitted i served on the lesser continental mass then well then superior sir all i can tell you is dont count them out of anything till you see them all dead and be careful even thenthey may be shamming gorppet said they are much tougher male for male than the russkis or than any other kind of big ugly i can think of i assure you i have been thoroughly informed as to their proclivities the regiment leader said i can also assure you that i know whereof i speak we shall deal with them here in short order he spoke as if he knew everything there was to know he probably thought he did that meant he either hadnt seen hard fighting over on the lesser continental mass or had forgotten what it was like knowing he was wasting his time gorppet tried again the deutsche superior sir are broken the regiment leader said firmly let us have no further doubts on that score do i make myself clear yes superior sir gorppet knew he sounded resigned and imperfectly subordinate but had trouble caring the regiment leader outranked him but that didnt mean the fellow kept his brains anywhere but his cloaca and then to gorppets astonishment another male spoke up superior sir the smallunit group leader is right as long as the deutsche are in the field they are dangerous underestimating them will do nothing but get good males killed to no purpose i mean no disrespect when i say this for it is a manifest truth in a deadly voice the regiment leader said give me your name midgroup leader your statement will go on the record very well superior sir i am shazzer the other male replied the regiment leader spoke into a computer hookup there all too probably went shazzers reputation and hope for advancement they would surely be gone if the regiment leader turned out to be right they were also likely doomed even if the regiment leader turned out to be wrong the race did not like those who disagreed with duly constituted authority the regiment leaders eye turrets swung toward gorppet give me your name too smallunit group leader superior sir i am gorppet he answered hed never expected to become an officer if he stopped being one the eggshell of his world wouldnt shatter gorppet the regiment leader repeated this time into the computer hookup having finished that he continued now let us turn to the business at hand wiping out the surviving remnants of the deutsche it shall be done superior sir the assembled officers chorused gorppet mouthed the words along with the rest though they were bitter on his tongue he longed for ginger to rid himself of their taste but made himself hold back out of the barn trooped the officers gorppet checked his radiation meter this particular area wasnt doing too badly he didnt need a breathing mask let alone protective wrappings the winds blowing the radioactive wreckage of the reich to the east had been relatively kind here as the officers began to scatter and return to their units gorppet hurried over to shazzer and said i thank you superior sir for what you tried to do in there i fear you did not help yourself by doing it shazzer shrugged you spoke plain truth gorppet any male who has ever fought the deutsche knows you spoke plain truth only pity is we could not make that male see it he sounded not in the least concerned about what would happen to him before gorppet could say how much he admired that aircraft streaked toward him out of the west concern about careers suddenly evaporated those are deutsch he shouted and dove into a shell crater shazzer dove in right behind him some of the other males were slower to take cover flames rippled under the wings of the enemy killercraft rockets shazzer screamed he tried to scrabble deeper into the earth gorppet didnt blame him he was trying to do the same thing the killercraft wailed past and were gone gorppet stuck up his head and looked around for the regiment leader whod said the deutsche were at the end of their tether he didnt spot him maybe that meant the optimistic officer had found himself a hole in the ground too maybe it meant hed been blown to bits gorppet didnt much care one way or the other he didnt keep his head up very long either hisses in the air rose swiftly to shrieks he shrieked too artillery he dove down into the crater once more he thought the shells that burst around him were of heavier caliber than most of the ones the big uglies had thrown during the last round of fighting he cursed the races artillery remained essentially the same as it had been when home was unified a hundred thousand years before why change it did the job well enough the big uglies unfortunately didnt think that way splinters whined overhead the ground shook under gorppets prostrate body reminding him of the earthquakes hed known when stationed in basra and baghdad shazzer said i think these are all explosive shells the ones with gas in them sound different when they burst praise the spirits of emperors past for small favors gorppet said i truly hate the masks we have to wear to protect ourselves against the gas and who does not the other veteran officer replied but i hate dying even more truth gorppet agreed if the deutsche were short on ammunition the bombardment they laid down gave no sign of it shells fell from the sky like rain shazzer said they are going to try to break through here they would not be pounding us so hard if they were not how can they do that gorppet said mockingly we have smashed them they are completely destroyed the regiment leader has said so shazzer laughedit was either laugh or curse i do not think the regiment leader bothered informing the deutsche of this factif it is a fact i wish i could get back to my small group gorppet said they should have their commander with them you would not last long if you climbed out of this hole shazzer said have you never seen that without its officers a small group often fights about as well under the command of its underofficers i would not say that to every male but you do not strike me as the sort it would insult no superior sir it does not insult me gorppet answered i have been an ordinary trooper and an underofficer myself i never expected to be anything more my opinion of officers is not far removed from yours then trust your soldiers shazzer said i think we may have to do some fighting of our own here sure enough big uglies started falling back past the barn where the regiment leader had held his briefing they were not deutsche they were the local tosevites as loyal to the race as any big uglies were but if they had to retreat that meant the deutsche were advancing i wish we had more landcruisers in the neighborhood gorppet said fretfully more landcruisers and more antilandcruiser rockets with a shrug shazzer answered the deutsche previously concentrated their efforts farther south in the direction of the city of lodzor what was the city of lodz naturally we concentrated our resources there too naturally gorppet said bitterly and then the big uglies shifted their forces and did something we failed to anticipate this has happened too many times before shazzer could reply a clanking rumble announced that the deutsche had landcruisers in these parts even if the race didnt gorppet stuck his head out of the hole again the artillery barrage had moved on and was now pounding positions farther east even if it hadnt been he needed to see what was going on the greater the distance at which he and his comrades engaged the landcruisers the better we have to fight as a small group ourselves now he told shazzer the other male made the gesture of agreement and here came the landcruisers three of them much bigger and no doubt much more heavily armored than the ones the big uglies had used during the last round of fighting a tosevite stood up in the cupola of the closest one landcruiser commanders had a habit of doing that it let them see much more than they could if they stayed buttoned up inside their machines and peered out through periscopes it also left them much more vulnerable the race had lost many fine landcruiser commandersit was commonly the good ones who did stand up and look aroundto tosevite snipers now gorppet did his best to redress the balance he fired a quick burst from his rifle at the big ugly in the cupola the deutsch male toppled got him gorppet shouted but the rest of the landcruiser crew had spotted his muzzle flashes the turret and the big gun it carried swung toward his hole before it could fire though a tosevite leaped from cover scrambled up onto the landcruiser and threw something down through the open cupola into the turret flames and smoke rose escape hatches popped open big uglies bailed out gorppet gleefully shot them a moment later the landcruiser blew up one of those nasty bottles of burning hydrocarbon distillate shazzer said remember how they gave us fits i am not likely to forget gorppet answered and i am not sorry to see them used against the deutsche by tosevites on our side a second deutsch landcruiser exploded this one even more spectacularlya hit from another landcruisers big gun gorppet shouted in glee before his shout was through the third tosevite landcruiser went up to flames one of the races machines rattled past the barn heading west maybe the regiment leader was right after all gorppet said he turned his eye turrets this way and that maybe he is even still alive to find out he was right after allbut i do not see him he shrugged i do not miss him very much either my guess is we have a better chance against the deutsche without him ever since the fighting stoppedin fact since before the fighting stoppedttomalss had devoted himself to the exhausting task of raising a tosevite hatchling from all hed gathered the task of raising a tosevite hatchling was difficult and exhausting even for the big uglies themselves it was doublyodds were a lot more than doublydifficult and exhausting for him since he was the first male of the race to try it he had neither instincts nor accumulated wisdom upon which to fall back years of patient work had made kassquit into a female very nearly independent of him he was grateful for that it let him analyze some of the work hed done with her so that others who came after him could do it better and it also let him do some work unrelated to her after so long without it hed rediscovered the joys of having time to himself again and now the war had broken out once more confining him to the starship for the time being that would have been annoying enough by itself but there was worse because hed raised kassquit he was also expected to take charge of jonathan yeager the wild big ugly whod been brought up to the starship to mate with her this is most unfair he complained to the starship captain after receiving the order most extremely unfair superior sir wild tosevites are only a secondary interest of mine my main concern his been civilizing big uglies unspoiled by their own cultures in that i have succeeded beyond anyones expectations i cannot promise a result even remotely similar with this specimen senior researcher it is a big ugly the captain said you have made a name for yourself as an expert on big uglies if this one does not deal with you with whom will it deal with me i thank you but no i have not the patience or the expertise to deal with it the same holds true for my officers you are the logical candidate for the job and you will do it that is an order senior researcher do you understand me only too well superior sir ttomalss replied with a sigh very well it shall be done to the best of my ability it shall be done it is not altogether wild the captain reminded him softening his manner now that hed got his way it speaks our language fairly well for a tosevite and it has some knowledge of our culture i placed greater hopes on such epiphenomena in former days than i do now ttomalss said they are the eggshell the egg within i fear remains profoundly alien you do not have to transform it into a female of the race male ttomalss corrected with a shrug the captain said whichever it could matter only to another big ugly as i was trying to tell you it does not have to become a male of the race all you have to do is keep it from getting under everyone elses scales and making males and females itch while it is up here eventually it will return to its notempire after all go on tend to it it shall be done ttomalss repeated miserably and left the captains office when he returned to his own chamber he found jonathan yeager waiting in the hallway outside the wild big ugly assumed the posture of respect and said i greet you superior sir i greet you jonathan yeager ttomalss replied with no great warmth and what can i do for you today is it not something kassquit could handle for you several times he had managed to use his tosevite ward to keep this other big ugly from unduly bothering him but jonathan yeager shook his head in the tosevite negative gesture then remembered to shape his hand into the one the race used no superior sir kassquit cannot handle this that is why i wanted to talk with you very well ttomalss said as he had to the starship captain not long before he opened the door as it slid wide he went on come in and tell me what you require the sooner he dealt with the big ugly the sooner he could return to his own concerns once more i thank you jonathan yeager said as he usually did he wore wrappings around the area of his private parts in a way that marked him as a wild big ugly in another way though it simplified his outline his projecting reproductive organs were quite different from the unobtrusive ones kassquit had he sat down in the seat designed for tosevite hindquarters that ttomalss had installed in his office what is it you want then the psychological researcher asked he was certain the big ugly wanted something and sure enough jonathan yeager said i would like to make an arrangement to get a gift for kassquit superior sir i want it to be a surprise that is why i cannot tell her and why i had to come to you a gift ttomalss was floundering what sort of gift something to show i care for her the tosevite replied i am not sure what sorts of things i can get for her here that is another reason i came to you to learn what is available in the way of such things a gift to show you care for her ttomalss repeated care for her in the alarmingly emotional way you tosevites tend to care for your sexual partners is that what you mean well yes superior sir the wild big ugly said it is a custom among us for those who are fond of each other ttomalss remembered encountering the custom now that the big ugly reminded him of it he had never thought it would matter to him more to the point he had never thought it would matter to kassquit he asked if you were back in your own notempire what gift might you give a female for whom you had conceived such a foolish and violent fondness i might get her flowers superior sir jonathan yeager answered why ttomalss demanded what possible good are flowers they are pretty the big ugly replied and they smell sweet females like them this liking is bound to be cultural ttomalss said not having the proper conditioning kassquit is unlikely to share it in any case flowers are unlikely to be available are there other possibilities yes jonathan yeager said i might get her i do not know the word in your language superior sir but it would be used to make her smell sweet perfume ttomalss supplied the term then he said no and used an emphatic cough we are more sensitive to odors than you big uglies and what you find pleasant is often unpleasant to us perfume would be altogether too public a gift try again or else abandon this idea he hoped jonathan yeager would abandon it but the wild tosevite said i might also get her sweet things to eat this is a common sort of gift between males and females in my notempire you should have mentioned it sooner ttomalss told him it is something we might possibly be able to supply return to the quarters you share with kassquit when i have the sweet foods i will summon you i thank you superior sir jonathan yeager said you do not have the custom of giving gifts i gather to a much smaller degree than you big uglies certainly ttomalss answered among us gifts are often slightly suspect if someone gives me something the first thing i wonder is what he wants in return they can be among us too the big ugly said but they can also simply show affection as i want to do here affection ttomalss spoke the word with amused contempt all too often tosevites used it when they meant nothing but sexual attraction you are dismissed jonathan yeager i will try to get these sweets for youand for kassquit he had a genuine disinterested affection for the hatchling hed raised since he could not possibly want to mate with her like any male of the race he viewed decisions influenced by sexuality with the greatest of suspicion he did sometimes wonder whether he or veffani had fathered felless first brace of hatchlings when shed come to them reeking of the pheromones ginger made females produce he shrugged if he had he had if not not mating with felless certainly made him feel no more affection for the difficult and crossgrained female but big uglies worked differently he had seen that before and saw it again with kassquit and jonathan yeager their matings made them feel increased liking for each other the video records made that quite plain with the wild big ugly such behavior might have been a cultural artifact with kassquit it assuredly was not but it was there nonetheless ttomalss sighed he wished his wards behavior in this matter were less like those of the tosevites whod grown up in independent squalor sighing again he made a few calls to learn when and from where shuttlecraft from the surface of tosev were scheduled to reach the starshipassuming they survived deutsch attack on the way up but the deutsche these days had few spaceships left in orbit around tosev the race had done a good job of getting rid of them supply missions were almost routine again sure enough a shuttlecraft brought what hed asked for he summoned jonathan yeager and said here are the sweets you requested instead of delight the wild big ugly showed confusion i had expected what we call choklit he said slowly these look like balls of raiss a couple of words were in his own language ttomalss figured out what they were likely to mean he exhaled in some annoyance you asked for sweets these are sweets moreover they are sweets from the subregion of the main continental mass called china this is the subregion from which kassquit came may i try one first jonathan yeager still sounded dubious ttomalss made the affirmative gesture the tosevite plucked one of the balls out of the syrup in which it came put it in his mouth and chewed thoughtfully it has sesamisidz inside he said is this good or bad ttomalss asked jonathan yeager shrugged i do not think it is as good as choklit but it is a sweet and i thank you for it i hope kassquit will like it i think she will he bent into the posture of respecthe did have manners for a wild toseviteand took the container with the remaining sweets back to kassquits chamber ttomalss eyed the video that came from the chamber he listened to kassquit exclaim in surprise and pleasure and watched her try the sweets she must have liked them she ate several one after another no one has ever cared for me as you care for me she told jonathan yeager before long the two of them were mating again though shielded from the possibility of reproduction having seen that activity before ttomalss stopped watching the video feed he hadnt imagined that kassquits words could hurt as much as they did who had fed her when she was helpless who had cleaned excrement from her skin who had taught her the language and the ways of the race did a few sweets and pleasurable mating count for more than all that he let out a discontented hiss he had not been the one to think of giving kassquit an unexpected treat even so it hardly seemed fair he wondered if tosevites ever so discounted the efforts of those of their own kind who raised them it struck him as most unlikely no this case of ingratitude was surely unique i tried to get out monique dutourd thought i did everything i could is it my fault that i didnt do it quite soon enough whose fault it was didnt matter what mattered was that she remained stuck in marseille a passport even a passport with a false name did her no good whatever when she couldnt go anywhere with it she had two choices now as she saw things run for the hills or wait for explosivemetal fire to burst over her city as it had over so many cities of the greater german reich to her surprise pierre and lucie were sitting tight how can you stay she asked them one morning over breakfastcroissants and cafe au lait as usual war having affected the black market very little the radio said the lizards blew up lyon yesterday how long can they keep from blowing us up too quite a while i hope pierre answered placidly pass the marmalade if you would be so kind monique didnt want to pass it she wanted to throw it at him you are mad she cried we live on borrowed time and you ask for marmalade croissants are better with it he said she shook with fury her brother laughed i do not think we are all going to explode in the next few minutes will you calm yourself and let me explain why you had better before i get on my bicycle and head for the hills monique said you were talking about doing that yourself if you will remember i know pierre nodded and paused to light a cigarette he coughed a couple of times first one of the morning yes i know i was talking about fleeing you still may if you feel you must but i doubt it is necessary to flee from marseille why do you doubt it monique bit off the words one by one why pierre grinned at her and said no more enough teasing pierre lucie could tell when monique was on the ragged edge of cracking where her own brother could not turning to monique she went on we havewhich is to say marseille hasa good many friends in high places from what we hear from them the city is safe enough friends where among the germans monique demanded they cant keep any place in the whole blasted reich safe her brother and his lover both burst out laughing among the germans he said no not at all by no means i would not trust what a german told me if christ came down from heaven with a choir of angels to assure me it was so but we have plenty of friends in high places among the race of that you may be very certain they do not want to see such a fine place of business wiped off the face of the earthand so it will not be monique stared at him they will spare this city for the sake of the ginger trade she said slowly i knew your connections with the race were good i never dreamt they were that good she wondered if pierre was fooling himself but lucie said here we are an obvious target close to spain a target close to africa but have they attacked us no not at all are they likely to attack us i do not think so well monique hadnt thought of it in those terms marseille was an obvious target the nazis knew it as well as the lizards did they wouldnt have installed all those antiaircraft missiles in the hills outside the city if they hadnt known it but not even an enemy airplane had appeared over marseille let alone an enemy missile grudgingly monique said it could be i suppose so far it is pierre said i see no reason to believe the future will be very much different from the past that almost set monique laughing where nothing else had come close to doing the job it was a very roman attitude it was from everything shed seen also very much the attitude of the race but it wasnt the attitude of the reich and it didnt work so well for the lizards here that worried her pierre wasnt worried after stubbing out the cigarette he said go on monique go shopping spend my money on whatever you want after the lizards finish the nazis they will still need people to buy and sell for them we will be waiting and if the germans come back in another twenty yearshe shruggedthey will need people to buy and sell for them too and we will still be waiting that wasnt a classical roman attitude but she had no doubt the inhabitants of ancient massilia had shared it and they would have had reason to do so but not even caesars sack of the ancient city would have wrecked it anywhere near so thoroughly as one explosivemetal bomb could monique wasnt sure how well pierre understood that she found another question to ask her brother how long can you hold out if the lizards dont come into marseille to buy what you have to sell he chuckled again oh twenty or thirty years i would say they make me extra money i dont deny that but i do most of my business with people anyhow i can go right on doing that whether there is a war or not plenty of things come into the old port there arent enough germans in the world to look through all the little boats that sail in from spain and from italy and from greece and from turkey ah turkey lucie said rapturously the business we do with turkey all by itself could keep us afloat poppies i suppose monique said and her brother and his lover nodded monique had visions of opium dens and other sinister things she didnt know any details she didnt want to know any details she shook her head sordid it could be pierre shrugged in fact i suppose it is you do not see lucie or me using these things do you but there is a great deal of money to be had from the lizards and from the nazis and from he broke off from the french hed been about to say monique knew it her brother wasnt too proud to take his profits wherever he could find them and shed been living off his largesse ever since escaping dieter kuhn she hadnt thought till now about how filthy the bargain was maybe she hadnt let herself think about it she took a deep breath getting ready to tell him in great detail what she thought of him for doing what he did before she could speak though sirens all through marseille started to scream she sprang to her feet that is the attack warning it cant be pierre and lucie said it together but it was the way they leaped up from their seats the sudden horrid fear on their faces said they knew it was too monique wasted no time arguing with them to the shelter and pray god we arent too late with that she was out the door and rushing down the stairs her brother and lucie didnt argue with her either they followed how soon lucie moaned even terrified she sounded sexy monique wondered if that was worth admiring but she also wondered much more about the question if the lizards had launched a missile from spain it would be in before she got to the basement of the block of flats and that would be that if it came from farther away she had more timebut not much down down down the sirens kept screaming monique felt like screaming too farther behind her people with slower reactions were screaming screaming with the dreadful fear that they might be too late too late she knew that fear she clamped down on it till she tasted blood and realized she was also clamping down on the inside of her lower lip and there was the door to the cellar merci mon cher dieu she gasped as she rushed inside the most sincere prayer shed sent up in many years oh shed wished dieter kuhn dead but wishing that turned out to be far more pallid than wishing that she herself should stay alive pierre and lucie came in right behind her pierre started to slam the door but a big burly man almost trampled him monique grabbed her brother cursing he said youre going to kill us all she had no good answer to that not after her prayer of a moment before the discovery that there were circumstances under which she would rather not stay alive was as astonishing as the discovery of how much she wanted to live more people crowded into the shelter and then came a roar like the end of the worldjust like the end of the world monique thoughtand the lights went out the ground shook as if in an earthquake it knocked monique off her feet she thought she was dead then someonemaybe the burly mandid slam the door after that the darkness should have been complete absolute stygian but it wasnt not quite a light brighter than summer sunshine at its hottest showed all around the cracks between the door and its frame ever so slowly it faded and reddened then it was black monique didnt think the light itself had vanished quite so abruptly she judged it much more likely that the block of flats had fallen down and cut off the view peoplemen and women bothwere screaming about being buried alive in the pitch blackness monique understood the fear not least because she felt it herself and then her brother flicked a flame from a cigarette lighter ahh everyone in the shelter said together pierre held up the lighter like a sacred talisman there will be candles he said in a voice of great certainty hurry and find them there were several boxes theyd fallen off their shelf but a woman brought one to him he lit it and closed his lighter with a snap the candle flame was pallid but ever so much better than being stuck in the dark monique was still afraid but much less than she had been pierre went right on speaking with authority now we wait we wait as long as we have air and food and wateror better wineand even this little light the longer we wait the safer it will be when we have to come out i do not know if it will be safewe will be taking a chance of that there is no doubtbut it will be safer from everything monique knew about explosivemetal weapons he was speaking the gospel truth even now radiation would be entering the shelter but she didnt know what she could do about that or rather she did know nothing she turned toturned onher brother and snarled no they wont bomb marseille you have friends in high places you know these things from the way the candlelight filled the lines of his face with shadow he looked to have aged twenty years he said i was wrong shall i tell you i was right i have some hope if we had been closer to where the bomb burst we would already be dead out of the darkness where the candlelight didnt reach someone said now we have to see whether radiation sickness kills us in the next day or two if it doesnt kill us we have to see how many years it takes off our lives shut up monique said fiercely she didnt want to think about that she wanted to remember shed stayed alive so far we have to see how much there is to eat and how much to drink as my brother said and we have to see how many buckets and pails we can find her nose wrinkled the shelter would be a nasty place before long something else occurred to her and well need shovels and poles and picks if there are any to dig our way out when we cant stay here any more if there arent well have to do it with our bare hands if we can she didnt want to think about that about being entombed here forever and she didnt want to think about what they would find when they didif they diddig themselves out she stood there in the cellar and stared and stared at the candle with her classical training the flickering flame put her in mind of her own life but if the candle went out they could light another if she went out one more thing she didnt want to think about johannes drucker had done everything he could with hansulrichs bus but he wasnt going to be able to stay in space much longer hed managed to make the air purifier go a lot further than it was designed to but hed be eating his underwear before too longthough by now after four mortal weeks it was far too filthy to be appetizing he knew why he was still alive when most if not all of his comrades up here had died hed never got orders to attack the lizards after a while the reich had stopped ordering him to land but no one down on the ground had included him in the assault on the race maybe the powers that be had thought him too unreliable to be trusted in the fight maybe too theyd just forgotten about him by now he wasnt sure who if anybody was in charge down on the ground these days maybe i should have done what i could to hurt the lizards even without orders he thought for about the five hundredth time but the war was madness as far as he was concerned poland wasnt worth having hed fought there and did not hold the place in high esteem but himmler and then kaltenbrunner had thought otherwise and the new fuhrer threw the wehrmacht over the border as hitler had in we did better then drucker muttered the poles hadnt been able to fight worth a damn no matter how brave they were the race on the other hand the race he realized had decided to use the reich s attack as an excuse to smash germany the lizards had warned they would do just that but nobody in authority seemed to have listened to them they hadnt been kidding german upper stage the radio crackled to lifein english anybody home in there german upper stage over am i an idiot that im going to answer you drucker asked hed maintained radio silence ever since the slugging started if he started transmitting the lizards would get a fix on him and blow him out of the sky hed known americans were naive but this struck him as excessive german upper stage german upper stage if youre alive in there you might as well give up the american flier said whats the point to you ending up dead and maybe more lizards too you arent going to win the war all by yourself silence for a few seconds then over and out silence returned drucker grimaced he scratched his chin hed grown quite a beard this past month the american made good sense in a waybut only in a way as a soldier he was supposed to strike at the enemy wasnt he then why havent you he pondered that as he had so often before he came up with the same answers he had before too nobody gave me any orders and its a goddamn stupid war too he glanced down toward the earth he was approaching europe though clouds hid much of the continent even if they hadnt he wouldnt have been able to see much from kilometers up even massive devastation was invisible but hed seen bombs blazing like suns as they burst at night and he knew there had been many more he hadnt seen every time he passed above the wreckage of the reich he wondered if he would get orders at last though by now hed almost given up on it if he did get them this would be the placethe only place the lizards had knocked out all the german relay ships it had taken them a while longer than it should have even if the delay worked to the reich s advantage they never had paid as much attention to the seas as they should have but theyd finally got round to it did the reich have any working radars these days if not his superiors wouldnt even know he was up here of course all his superiors might well be dead his family all too likely was hed cried himself sick about that the day the missiles started flying he blamed kaltenbrunner much more than the lizards the race had been content with the status quo the fuhrer hadnt he should have been damn him drucker said hed cursed himself sick that first day too a burst of static came from the radio spacecraft of the greater german reich all spacecraft of the greater german reich the fight for justice in europe continues a voice said in clear german punish the lizard aggressors however and wherever you may your sacrifice will not be in vain when the message finished it began repeating as far as drucker could tell it was identical the second time around a recording he wouldnt have been surprised was anyone alive down there to give orders to the remaining german spacecraft could anybody down there be alive at all millions tens of millions of people down there were surely dead but what about the high command he had to admit that he wasnt sure party and military leadership had known for a long time that a war with the race might be coming they would have done everything they could to make sure they could go on fighting it in the middle of the recorded messages third repetition it suddenly broke off a different voice came on the air one that sounded both military and tired unto death be it known that all charges against lieutenant colonel johannes drucker are rescinded and that he is raised in grade to colonel by order of walter dornberger acting fuhrer of the greater german reich drucker stared at the radio receiver his boss at peenemunde was running whatever was left of the reich how had that happened when had it happened why hadnt dornberger started broadcasting sooner and even more to the point if dornberger was running the reich why in hell wasnt he surrendering just as fast as he could hed thought the idea of war against the race utter madness as drucker had it had proved to be utter madness too why wasnt he giving up then did he think he could win had the race refused to accept his surrender was he trying to prove he could still hurt the lizards after theyd done their worst to western and central europe did any of that matter reluctantly drucker decided it didnt an order that included all german spacecraft certainly included him and he had to admit dornberger was a fuhrer he could respect if he was going to go out he would go out in a blaze of glory for the first time in quite a while he looked out through the canopy with a view to sizing up targets the points of light that moved against the stars were in earth orbit as he was some of them the bright ones shone more brilliant than venus those would be the starships of the conquest and colonization fleets the ships the lizards couldnt afford to lose he chose one by eye theyd always orbited higher than upper stages usually did and had moved higher still after the war with the reich broke out he could have fired up his radar to see exactly how far theyd moved but he would have been shouting here i am if he did instead he eyeballed a starship out ahead of him if he could get close before turning on the radar and launching his missiles his calculations were automatic instinctive like a fighter pilots if it was at that altitude it was moving about so fast which meant hed need a burn of about so long to take himself out of his present orbit and put him into firing position if the lizards were alert and blasted him into wreckage before he could launch theyd win if they werent he sighed if they werent theyd blow him into wreckage after he launched soldiers unfortunately found themselves in such positions now and again his finger poked the button that started his engine the acceleration wasnt enormous but he hadnt felt any acceleration at all for most of a month any at all made him seem to weigh five hundred kilos he used his fuel lavishly it wasnt as if hed be coming back the starship hed chosen as a target grew brighter and brighter then started showing a visible disk drucker knew hed be visible too on every lizard radar screen in the neighborhood that starship couldnt run away not as massive as it was they would need to interpose or to come at him from some other direction before he got close enough to do what hed set out to do now he did light up his radar it showed the starship dead ahead with just about the range and velocity hed guessed i have good eyeballs he said with a chuckle if he was going to go out hed go out laughingand as a colonel no less and he thought he would take the starship with him the lizards never had been good at reacting to the unexpected none of their missiles headed his way none of their spacecraft designed to fight in orbitnastier creatures than hansulrich bus showed up on his screen somewhere on their starships they were probably yelling back and forth at one another trying to figure out what the devil to do he didnt need to figure he was already doing no here came one of their spacecraft under what looked like pretty good acceleration but it was late late he used the attitude jets to align the nose of hansulrich bus on the starship and then his thumb and forefinger found the red switch hed never thought he would use he pulled it out and activated it then flipped it first to the left then to the right his upper stage shuddered as the missiles left their tubes with puffs of compressed gas when they were far enough from hansulrich bus their motors came on the radars they carried guided them straight toward the lizards starship less than fifty kilometers away drucker cursed horribly a moment later for the lizards aboard the starship werent asleep after all countermissiles leaped away no more than a heartbeat after he launched his one of his blew up almost at once the other thoughthe other bored in on its target come on drucker whispered come on the missiles had proximity fuses set to detonate them a hundred meters from a ships skin would that one get through all the countermissiles had missed it if the lizards didnt do something nasty they did something sparkled along the starships centerline a closein weapon system nothing more dramatic than a computerized heavy machinegun batteryand the missile exploded in a fireball made up not of bursting atoms but of bursting fuel tanks over it was all over drucker swung hansulrichs bus by the attitude jets so he could face the oncoming lizard spacecraft without hope and without fear he readied himself for his last fight deutsch upper stage that was a lizard speaking the language of the race surrender deutsch upper stage you have no more missiles you can do no more significant harm your notempire is in ruins what can you gain by further senseless sacrifice that was a good question the longer drucker thought about it the better it looked he swung his thumb from the machinegun trigger to the radio switch male of the race i have no good answer for you he said wearily you have me i do not know what you will do with me at the moment i do not much care what you will do with me whatever it is you have me i surrender what can i do for you today shiplord strahas driver asked i cannot think of anything straha answered if i need anything you may be certain that i shall not be shy in letting you know his driver bent into the posture of respect it was half true subordination half mockery the tosevite had at least as much power in their relationship as did straha himself i have no doubt that you will in the meantime if it suits you i will do some work on your motorcar go ahead straha told him you could just as easily take it to someone specializing in repairs you know funds would appear to be adequate for any necessary expenditures considering that the government of the notempire of the united states paid for everything connected with strahas upkeep funds were bound to be adequate but the driver said i enjoy working on machinery i would rather do it myself that way i am sure it is done right whatever pleases you straha replied now that he thought about it he shouldnt even have tried to discourage the big ugly with him out on the street tinkering with balky tosevite machinery straha could come closer to living a normal or at least an unspiedupon life when straha looked out the kitchen window a little later he saw his driver bent over the engine compartment of the motorcar happily repairing something or other the exshiplord shrugged hed also known males and females of the race who enjoyed messing about with machines he had never understood the excitement himselfbut then most big uglies saw his gardening as a waste of time straha hurried to his study and turned on the computer that connected him to the races computer network since his connection was highly unofficialeven more so than sam yeagershe didnt get very many electronic messages but a synthesized voice announced that he had one today it was he noted without surprise from yeager under his pseudonym of maargyees i greet you shiplord the tosevite had written i wonder if we could possibly meet without your driver s knowing about it perhaps straha replied it may not be easy are you sure it is necessary he wondered what the tosevite had in mind something to do with one of the places into which yeager had pushed his unwelcome snout unless straha missed his guess he also wondered if he would get an answer right away the tosevite had sent the message much earlier in the morning but he stayed by the computer for a little while on the off chance that yeager was sitting in front of his as he sometimes did and sure enough a reply came back quite quickly yes i am sure it is necessary yeager wrote and appended the conventional symbol for an emphatic cough i must trust someone in that particular mess i would sooner trust you than any of my tosevite acquaintances i am honored straha wrote back but are you sure you would not be better served by one of your fellow big uglies i am sure of nothing yeager responded i have done a great deal of thinking but my way is not plain any more i do not think my way will ever be plain again as you know my driver clings to me as if he were a parasite under my scales straha wrote i do not know if i can arrange to have him disappear i also do not know if l should well you will do as you see fit yeager wrote back if you decide to make the arrangement let me know in all fairness i should tell you that seeing me about this business may be risky for you are you yourself in danger now straha asked i have been in danger for some time the tosevite answered had i not been carefuland luckyi would be dead that is why i want to see you if i die suddenly and mysteriously i want you to avenge me that was stark enough many ancient classics from the races literature and videos revolved around such themes straha hadnt thought he would find himself caught in the middle of one though something else occurred to him he wrote this may involve me in no small amount of danger then is that not a truth yes shiplord jam afraid that is a truth and i am sorry for it yeager answered he was honest straha had seen as much many times if you do not wish to do it i will understand and i will look for someone else not necessary straha wrote at once come here at midday tomorrow if you see the motorcar in front of the house i will not have succeeded in getting my driver to go elsewhere if it is gone you are welcome actually you will be welcome in any case but you might well make the driver suspicious i understand i thank you it shall be done goodbye goodbye straha wrote but yeager would probably get that message later the exshiplord paused a while in thought at last he found an idea that satisfied him in fact he quite liked it had he been a big ugly he would have used the curious grimace the tosevites called smiling after a while his driver came inside greasy to the elbows and with a smile of his own on his face he was indeed one of those individuals who enjoyed tinkering for the sake of tinkering straha asked is everything now operating as it should couldnt be better the driver answered in english as he started cleaning himself off his mind was plainly elsewhere or he would have stuck to the language of the race excellent straha did stay with his own tongue i would like you to drive down to the races consulate in the center of the city tomorrow for me and to bring back a selection of new books and videos the ones i have are growing stale as hed expected that made the drivers smile disappear oh very well the big ugly said at last i do not suppose you can go to the consulate yourself not when you would be seized and spirited away if you tried but i must tell you that i will also use the visit as an opportunity to brief my own superiors who are based not far away if you must straha sounded sulky the driver was punishing him his report would take some time which meant he would be later bringing back the things straha wanted but straha also wanted other things things the driver didnt know about and to keep the big ugly from wondering if they might be there the exshiplord had to act as if they werent rubbing in the punishment his driver went on i will not want to start until late morning to escape the worst of the traffic yes think of your convenience first and then of mine straha complained though he was laughing inside in fact the big ugly waited so long to leave the next day that straha feared he would still be there when sam yeager arrived straha couldnt hurry him too much either not without rousing his suspicions but he drove off not long before yeager pulled up i greet you straha said opening the door for his friend and i greet you shiplord the tosevite replied i also thank you from the bottom of my heart that was an english idiom translated literally into the language of the race you are a true friend i feel the same about you straha said truthfully now tell me of this trouble and of how i can help you with it he led yeager to the front room and got him comfortable on the sofa where his driver usually sat can i bring you some alcohol some of that nasty bourbon you favor perhaps that would be very good yeager said but can we talk in your garden out back he didnt say why but straha had no trouble figuring out the answer he feared things said inside the house might be recorded straha didnt know if they were or not but recognized they might be he said of course go on out i will follow with your drink and with one for me his own drink was vodka without ice like most members of the race he found whiskey of any sort vile he carried the two glasses out to the backyard for him the weather was cool but not cold yeager he judged would find it ideal they sipped their glasses of alcohol one flavored one not a hummingbird buzzed among the flowers then flew off with startling speed do you care to begin straha asked i wish i did not have to begin the big ugly answered straha realized slower than he should have that yeager wasnt wearing his usual uniform but the wrappings a civilian would have chosen what made the exshiplord notice was the tosevites pulling a sealed envelope from the inside pocket of his upper outer wrappinga jacket that was the english word he handed straha the envelope saying keep this for me hide it you will know when to open it that straha would the envelope had to be opened in the event of my death written on it in both english and the language of the race the exshiplord kept one eye turret on it and turned the other toward sam yeager and what do i do with this if i should have to open it when you see what is inside you will know yeager said i trust you not to open it while i am still among those present that was another english idiom if i ever ask on the telephone to have it back do not give it to me unless i say it would help if you did unless i use that exact phrase i am asking under duress then tell me it was accidentally destroyed or lost or something of the sort as you say so shall it be by the spirits of emperors past i swear it straha cast down his eyes sam yeagers head bobbed up and down in the tosevite gesture of agreement straha found another question what if i were to open it before anything happened to you one of the reasons i am giving it to you is that i trust you not to do that more than i trust any of my big ugly friends yeager answered am i wrong no straha said firmly he cast down his eyes again by the spirits of emperors past i swear that too he paused and slyly waggled an eye turret a little how much trouble would i cause if i did yeager laughed he relied on straha not to mean that but his own voice was serious as he replied more than you can imagine shiplord even if you multiply that imagination by ten more than you can imagine he laughed again and that probably tempts you to open it more than anything else i have said as a matter of fact it does straha answered what did yeager have in the envelope he now held in his own scaly hand whatever it was by the way he spoke it was even more important than his raising hatchlings of the race as if they were big uglies straha wondered if it was some purely tosevite affair or one also involving the race he could find out he could as i said i trust you yeager told him you may straha meant it i shall hide this envelope and keep it safe and not open it as you require he laughed but i shall go right on wondering what it holds sam yeager nodded fair enough when the telephone rang vyacheslav molotov feared it would be marshal zhukov ever since the germans and the lizards started fighting zhukov had called more often than molotov really wanted to listen to him the soviet unions leading soldier assumed that war close to the border brought him to the fore and molotov was in no position to contradict him but molotovs secretary spoke in some excitement comrade general secretary i have paul schmidt on the line the german ambassador pyotr maksimovich molotov said put him through by all means he waited then spoke to schmidt and what can i do for you today your excellency may i please see you as soon as i can reach the kremlin schmidt asked i would sooner not conduct my business over uncertainly secure wires by all means come i will see you molotov replied he wondered whether his wires were insecure whether zhukov was listening probably he judged but he called the marshal anyway as soon as he got off the phone with the german without preamble he said schmidt is on the way here did he say what for no he said he would tell me when he got here all right keep me apprised zhukov hung up molotov had cakes and rolls stuffed with spiced meat set out beside the samovar in the corner of the office where he went to wait for schmidt he had never had any use for the mans nazi bosses but liked him as well as he liked anyone after the handshakes and polite greetings that followed the german ambassadors arrival schmidt took tea and did eat one of the rolls molotov waited patiently schmidt blotted his lips on a linen napkin then grimacing said comrade general secretary i would like you to use your good offices to help the greater german reich end its hostilities with the race ah molotov had thought it might be so he wasnt sure whether or not hed hoped it might be so he wouldnt have been altogether sorry to see the germans and the lizards pound on each other a while longer maybe the nazis couldnt pound any more delicately molotov said you understand this may involve negotiating a surrender schmidt nodded yes i do understand that general dornberger who has assumed the fuhrer s office understands it as well i see from the briefings molotov had had from the gru dornberger was indeed a capable sensible man but the briefings didnt explain everything how did general dornberger survive the races attack on peenemunde we knew the race would attack there and fortified our shelters to stand up to the worst we thought they could do schmidt replied there our engineering proved adequate he bowed his head molotov wondered if he should have offered vodka along with the tea gathering himself schmidt went on but we did not realize the lizards would strike so many hard and violent blows against the reich molotov couldnt imagine why the nazi leaders hadnt realized that the race had told them what would happentold them in great detail theyd chosen not to listen and paid an enormous price for not listening now they had to settle accounts molotov didnt bring that up all he said was if you would care to wait i will withdraw and call queek i have another office where the two of you can confer and i will be glad to assist in any way i can thank you schmidt said i would be grateful for your assistance as molotov had expected he had no trouble reaching queek or rather the lizards interpreter after the interpreter spoke to his principal he returned to russian to tell molotov we shall be there directly this war has done too much damage to both sides for it to continue i look forward to seeing the ambassador molotov replied he went back to the office where schmidt waited queek and his interpreter are on their way come with me i will take you to a room where you and he can discuss the matter why not this one the german ambassador asked security molotov answered one word for which no counterargument existed in the soviet union servantsnot that the dictator of the proletariat thought of them as suchhastily brought refreshments to the office where molotov met with queek the ambassador from the race and his interpreter arrived within fifteen minutes after hypocritical expressions of personal esteem aimed at paul schmidt queek came to the point is the reich prepared to surrender without conditions without conditions no schmidt answered we still have resources we can use to hurt you and we are prepared to go on doing that at need queek rose from the chair that was suited to his posterior in that case we have nothing to say to each other call me again when you come to your senses wait molotov said quickly you are here now why not listen to the conditions schmidt proposes for surrender they may be acceptable to you or you may be able to negotiate with him until they become acceptable molotov had seen how hard the concept of negotiating with humans was for the race to grasp the interpreter and queek had to go back and forth several times before the lizard grudgingly made the hand gesture his kind used for a nod let it be as you request he said i recognize that your government has broken no significant promises during this period of crisis it was faint praise but molotov took it queek swung his eye turrets toward schmidt and asked what conditions do you propose then first the reich is to retain its political independence schmidt said why should we grant you that the lizard demanded you have devastated our land but you do not occupy it schmidt replied in fighting on the ground we have given at least as good as weve got so what queek said we have found other ways to win the war found them and used them if you do not think we have won why did you ask for this meeting it is hard to imagine you could do more to wreck the reich than you have already done schmidt said fighting to salvage what he could with a skill molotov had to admire but we still have landbased missiles unfired and you have done next to nothing to our missilecarrying submarines if you give us nothing what have we got to lose by using all the explosivemetal bombs we have left against you this is a point worthy of consideration molotov said to queek the reich wasnt going to be able to threaten his country for quite a while and he didnt want the lizards hitting it with any more explosivemetal bombs not when the wind had already blown too much fallout into the ussr but queek said if on the other fork of the tongue we rule the reich from now on we will have no fear of any such attacks in the future molotov had to hide a grimace though it knew nothing of the dialectic the race did think in the long term before molotov could say anything paul schmidt did do you have enough soldiers to garrison another land full of people who hate you you have enough trouble holding down the mostly unindustrialized areas of the world that you rule how hard would it be for you to occupy the reich too how expensive would it be and for how long would you have to do it again cogent points molotov didnt want to sound like germanys advocate but he didnt want the war to go on either and queek this time didnt reject out of hand instead he said if you retain independence it will necessarily be limited we will restrict your military forces and we will place inspectors in your notempire to make sure you do not seek to exceed by stealth the restrictions we set general dornberger will accept such restrictions schmidt said at once germany has known them in the past and germany had got around them too molotov knew during the s there had been a good deal of clandestine cooperation between germany and the soviet union from which theyd both benefited he wondered if the new fuhrer would try to make history repeat itself that would be harder this time he guessed england and france hadnt had the will to make germany live up to the restrictions of the treaty of versailles for very long the lizards had far more patience then queek proved the race had been ready for this dicker after all for he said if the reich is to remain independent of the race then we shall also insist that the region of your notempire known as france shall become independentindependent once more i should sayof the reich schmidt looked as if hed bitten into an apple and found half a worm molotov said under the circumstances this does not strike me as an unreasonable request no it wouldnt would it schmidt muttered a resuscitated france weakened germany against the ussr as well as against the race it is not a request queek said it is a demand it is a minimum demand scowling still paul schmidt said i believe the new fuhrer will accept it further queek said the reich will be prohibited from possessing explosivemetal weapons and missile delivery systems the reich will also be prohibited from flights into earth orbit or to other regions of the solar system of tosev you leave us very little schmidt said bitterly you deserve very little after the damage you have done us replied the races ambassador to the soviet union many among us think we are overgenerous in allowing you anything at all you may keep this reduced role or you may fight on after all of you are dead occupying the reich should not be difficult molotov added i do not know if the new fuhrer of the reich will listen to my views but i think he would be wise to accept these terms do you believe he will get better ones if he goes on fighting schmidt could hardly have seemed more miserable if we do accept them we go from a firstrate power to one of the second or third class and if you do not accept them what will happen to you queek retorted you will be altogether destroyed and what sort of power will you retain after that none the reich will become an empty eggshell to be crushed underfoot i shall have to consult with general dornberger before finally accepting these terms the german ambassador said consult quickly queek warned every instant you delay will lead to more damage to your notempire and may result in harsher terms may i use your facilities comrade general secretary schmidt asked you may molotov answered i hope success attends your efforts as schmidt left molotov turned back to the lizard and his interpreter take more refreshments if you care to queek used the negative hand gesture the pole who translated for him ate as if food and drink would be proscribed tomorrow he was not sorry to see germany discomfitedno not even a little after less than half an hour schmidt returned he bowed to queek he agrees he agrees to everything you have won this war we did not begin it queek said let us be glad it is over molotov put in let us be glad it is over and let us begin to rebuild and to plot against one another again he added but
