a better mousetrap the four skitty stories appeared in cat fantastic anthologies edited by andre norton im very very fond of skitty it might seem odd for a bird person to be fond of cats but i am so there it is i was actually a catperson before i was a birdmother and i do have two cats both siamesemix both rather old and very slow just if the other local cats poach too often at my bird feeders they can expect to get a surprise from the gardenhose if there was one thing that dick white had learned in all his time as supercargo of the catseye company free trader brightwing it was that having a cat purring in your ear practically forced you to relax the extremely comfortable formmolding chair he sat in made it impossible to feel anything but comfortable and warm black fur muffled both of dick whites ears a steady vibration massaging his neck build a better mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your door dick said idly as scat poured himself like a second fluid black rug over the bluegrey of his lap it was skitty who was curled up around his shoulders vibrating contentedly in what dick called her subsonic purrmode while her mate took it as his responsibility to make sure there was plenty of shed hair on the legs of his grey shipsuit uniform what asked terran ambassador vena ferducci looking up from the list of lacuun nobles petitioning for one of skittys latest litter the petite darkhaired woman sat in a less comfortable metal chair behind a stone desk which stood next to a metal rack stuffed with archaic rolled paper documents the lacuun had not yet devised the science of filing paperwork in multiples yet which made them ultracivilised in venas opinion this her office in the palace of the lacuara and lacuteveras was not often used for that very reason when she dealt with terran bureaucracy she needed every electronic helper she could get the list she perused was very long and made rather cumbersome due to the lacuun custom of presenting all official courtdocuments in the form of a massively ornamented yellowparchment scroll with case and end caps of engraved bronze and illuminated capitalinitials dick had a notion that somewhere in the universe there probably was a collector of handwritten documents who would pay a small fortune for it but when every petitioner on the list had been satisfied it would probably be sent to the underclerks scraped clean and reused its an old terran folksaying dick elaborated and gestured to the list by way of explanation one which certainly seems to be borne out by our present situation yes well given the length of this list were doubly fortunate that skitty and scat are soahfertile and that biotech is willing to send us their shipscat washouts vena stretched out her hand towards scats head and the huge black tom cooperated by craning his neck towards her even before her fingers contacted his fur scat was purring loudly giving dick an uncannily similar sensation to being strapped in while the ship he served was under full power dick white could well be one of the wealthiest supercargoes in the history of spacetradehis share of the profits from catseye companys lucrative trade with the lacuun amounted to quite a tidy sum it wasnt enough to buy and outfit his own shipyetbut if trade progressed as it had begun there was the promise that one day it would be not that i want my own ship yet he told himself not until i know as much as captain singh there are easier ways to commit suicide than pretending i know enough to command a starship when all i really know is how to run the cargo hold not that captain singh would let him take his profitshare and do something so stupid dick grinned to himself imagining the captains face if he showed up in the office with that kind of harebrained proposal captain singhs expression would be one to beholdfollowing which dick would probably find himself stunned unconscious and wake under the solicitous attentions of a concerned headshrinker the captain had been willing even more than willing to let dick stay onplanet for few terranmonths though after skitty and scat announced the advent of a littertobe one of her last litter was coopted to serve as shipscat pro tem while dick and his two charges waited out the delivery maturation and weaning of eight little black furballs who were if that was possible even cuter than the last batch it was a good thing that they all were onplanet too because the octet managed to get themselves into a hundred times more mischief than the previous lot the trouble is they have a lot of energy absolutely no sense and no fear at all at this age brainless kitten antics rapidly begin to pall when youve fished a wailing fuzzmote out of the comconsole for the fifteenth time in a single shift but every lacuun in the palace from the lacuteveras down to the lowliest scullerylad was thrilled to the toesor rather clawsto play with rescue and cuddle the bratlings if skitty and scat had not taken their duties as parents palaceguardians and rolemodels so seriously they wouldnt have had to do anything but lie about and wait for the kittens to be carried in to them for feeding fortunately for all concerned their parents had powerful senses of responsibility towards their offspring both cats were born and bredliterallyfor duty yes they were cats with a cats sense of independence and contrariness but they took duty very very seriously and their duty was vermin control this was a duty that went back centuries to the very beginnings of the association of man and cat but until biotech developed shipscats never had a feline been better suited to or more cooperative in the execution of that duty furthermore dick now knew what few others didthat the shipscats so necessary to the safety of traders and their ships were actually a highly profitable byproduct of other research secret research designed to give the men and women of the patrol uniquely clever comradesinarms these genetically altered cats were not just clever it was not just that they had forepaws modeled after the forepaws of raccoonsoh no that was not enough patrol cats were telepaths scat had been a patrol catbut although he could understand the thoughts of humans he couldnt speak to them this was a flaw so far as the patrol was concerned though not an insurmountable flaw however when criminals took over the ship he served on and killed all of those aboard scat was the only survivor and the only witnessunable to call for help or relate what he had witnessed he had sought for help from his own kind and found it in skitty when the same criminals learned scat was still alive and tried to eliminate him and the crew of the free trader ship brightwing for good measure it had been dicks research and deductive reasoning that had learned the truth in time and with scats and skittys help he had foiled the plot as for skitty she was something of an aberration herselfordinary shipscats were not supposed to be telepathic or fertile she was both as far as dick could tell she was telepathic only with himthough given that she was all cat with a cats puckish sense of humor she might well choose not to let him know she could speak to others everyone on the ship knew she was fertile thoughwhen they had first come to the world of the lacuun shed already had one litter and was pregnant with another that first litterborn and raised in the shiphad shown just what kind of a nightmare two loose kittens could be within the close confines of a spaceship dick had not been looking forward to telling captain singh of the second litter when skitty had solved the problem for them the lacuun a race of goldenskinned vaguely reptilian anthropoids suffered from the depredations of a particularly voracious fast and apparently indestructible pest called kreshta the only way to keep them from taking over completely was to lock anything edible and the creature could eat practically anything in airtight containers of metal glass ceramic or stone and build only in materials the pest couldnt eat the pests did keep the streets so clean that they sparkled and there was no such thing as a trash problem but those were the only benefits to the plague the lacuun had just opened their planet to trade from outside and the brightwing was one of several ships that had arrived to represent either themselves or one of the large companies only captain singh had the foresight to include skitty in their delegation however for only he had bothered to research the lacuun thoroughly enough to learn that they placed great value on totemic animals and had virtually nothing in the way of domesticated predators themselves he reckoned that a tame predator would be very impressive to them and he was right skitty had been on her best behavior charming them all and taking to this alien race immediately the lacuteveras the female coruler had been particularly charmed so much so that she had missed the presence of one of the little pests which had bitten her enraged at this attack on someone she favored skitty had killed the creature for the lacuun this was nothing short of a miracle the end of a scourge that had been with them since the beginning of their civilization after that moment there was no question of anyone else getting mostfavored trading status with the lacuun ever catseye got the plum contract skittys kittenstobe got immediate homes and dick whites life became incredibly complicated since then he was no longer just an apprentice supercargo and designated shipscat handler on a small free trader ship hed been imprisoned by company goons stalked and beaten within an inch of his life by coldblooded murderous hijackers and had to face the patrol itself to bargain for scats freedom hed had enough adventure in two short standardyears to last most people for the rest of their lives but all that was in the past or so he hoped for a while anyway it would be nice if the most difficult decision i had to make would be which of the lacuun nobles get skittybabies and which have to make do with shipscat washouts those washouts were mature cats that for one reason or another couldnt adapt to ship life gengineering wasnt perfect even now there were cats that couldnt handle freefall cats that were claustrophobes cats that were shy or antisocial those had the opportunity to come here to join the verminhunting crew thus far thirty had made the trip some to become mates for the first litter others to take up solitary residence with a noble family there were other washouts who didnt pass the intelligence tests but those were never offered to the lacuunthey already filled a steady need for companions in childrens hospitals and retirement homes where the high shipscat intelligence wasnt needed just a loving friend smart enough to understand what not to do around someone sick or in pain there were still far more lacuun who urgently craved the boon of a cat than there were cats to fill the need thus far none of skittys female offspring had carried that rare gene for fertilitywhen one did that one would go back to biotech to be treated like the precious object she was pampered and amused asked to breed only so often as she chose there was always a tradeoff in any gengineering effort lack of fertility was a small price to pay in a species as notoriously prolific as cats meanwhile the proud parents were in the last stages of educating their current offspring there was a pile of the dead vermin just in front of venas desk every so often one of the halfgrown kittens would bring another to add to the pile then sit politely and wait for his parents to approve sometimes when the pest was particularly large scat would descend from dicks lap with immense dignity inspect the kill and bestow a rough lick by way of special reward dick couldnt keep track of how many pests each of the kittens had destroyed but from the size of the pile so far the parents had reason to be proud of their offspring the kittens certainly inherited their parents telepathic skills as well as their hunting skills for just as it occurred to dick that it was about time for them to be fed they scampered in from all available doorways in a moment they were neatly lined up eight identical pairs of yellow eyes staring avidly from eight little black faces beneath sixteen enormous ears at this age they seemed to consist mainly of eyes ears paws and tails the lacuun servant whose proud duty it was to feed the weanlings arrived with a bowl heaping with their imported food she was clothed in the simple silky draped tunic in the deep gold of the royal household the frilled crest running from the back of her neck to just above her eyeridge stood totally erect and was flushed to a deep salmoncolor with pleasure and pride she started to put the bowl on the floor and the kittens leapt to their feet and ran for the food but suddenly scat sprang from dicks lap every hair on end spitting and yowling he landed at the startled servants feet and did a complete flip over so that he faced his kittens as they skidded on the slick stone he growled and batted at them sending them flying scat vena shouted as she jumped to her feet horrified and angry what are you doing bad cat no hes not dick replied making a leap of his own for the food bowl and jerking it from the frightened servants hands he had already heard skittys frantic mental screech of bad food as she followed her mate off dicks shoulders to keep the kittens from the deadly bowl the foods poisoned dick added sniffing the puffy brown nodules suspiciously as the servant backed away the slits in her goldenbrown eyes so wide he could scarcely see the iris scat must have scented itthats probably one of the things patrol cats are trained in i cant tell the difference but as skitty held the kittens at bay he held the bowl down to scat who took a delicate sniff and backed away growling see venas expression darkened and she turned to the servant the food has been poisoned she said flatly who had access to it they both knew that shivari the servant was trustworthy she would sooner have thrown herself between the kittens and a ravening monster than see any hurt come to them she proved that now by her behavior her crestfrill flattened she turned bright yellowthe lacuun equivalent of turning paleand replied instantly i do not knowi got the bowl from the kitchen she grabbed venas hand and the two of them ran off with dick closely behind still carrying the bowl when they arrived at the kitchen vena and shivari cornered all the staff while dick blocked the exit he had a fair grasp of lacuun by now but vena and shivari were talking much too fast for him to get more than two words in four soon enough though vena turned away with anger and dissatisfaction on her face while shivari began a blistering harangue worthy of captain singh there was a new servant that no one recognized on staff this morning vena said in disgust obviously they were smart enough to keep him away from the food meant for people but no one thought anything of letting him open up the cat food into a bowl well they know better now dick replied grimly ill put the embassy on alertand give me that vena took the bowl from him ill have the marines run it through an analyzer embassy guards by long tradition were called marines although they were merely another branch of the patrol dick readily surrendered the poisoned food to vena knowing that if scat could smell a poison the forensic analyzer every embassy possessedjust in casewould easily be able to find it relations with the lacuun were important enough that vena had gone from being merely a trade advisor and titular consul to a fullscale ambassador with the attendant staff and amenities it was that promotion that had persuaded her to remain here instead of returning to her former position in the scouts dick himself went to the storage vault that held the imported catfood got a highlycompressed cube out and opened it over a freshly washed bowl the stuff puffed up to ten times its compressed size once it came into contact with air and humidity it would be impossible to tamper with the packages without a resulting explosion of food the entire feline family flowed into the kitchen as soon as his fingers touched the package the kittens swarmed around his legs mewling piteously but he offered the bowl for scats inspection before allowing them to engulf it his mind buzzed with questions but two were uppermostwho would have tried to poison the kittens and why scat and skitty herded their kittens along like a pair of attentive sheepdogs when theyd finished eating following behind dick as he left the palace heading for the embassy the marine at the entrance gave him a brisk nod of recognition saving her grin for the moving blackfurred flock behind him a second marine at a desk just inside skilled in the lacuun tongue served doubleduty as a receptionist the ambassador is expecting you sir he said she left orders for you to go straight in dick led his parade past the deska desk of cast marble reinforced with plastile which would serve very nicely as a blastandprojectileproof bunker at need the door to venas office a cleverly concealed blastdoor was slightly ajar it sensed his approach and opened fully for him after a retinal scan have you ever wondered why our peaceful hosts happen to field a battleready army vena asked him without even a preliminary greeting ah no i hadntbut now that you mention it it does seem odd dick took a seat cats pooling around his ankles as vena tossed her compuslate aside our hosts arent the sole representatives of their race on this dirtball vena replied with no expression that dick could see and now they finally get around to telling me this it seems that there is another nation entirely on this continentwe thought that it was just another fief of the lacuara and they never disabused us of that impression let me guessthe other side doesnt like terrans dick hazarded i wish it was that simple unfortunately the other side worships the kreshta as children of their prime deity vena couldnt quite repress a snarl kill one and youve got a holy war on your handsweve been slaughtering hundreds for better than two years the attempt on the octet was just the opening salvo for us heretics the chief minister has been here telling me all about it and falling all over himself in apology here she pulled a micro reader out of a drawer in her desk and tossed it to him my head of security advises that you commit this to memory what is it dick asked thumbing it on and seeing with some puzzlement the line drawing of a nude lacuun appear on the plate how to kill or disable a lacuun in five easy lessons as written by the patrol marines her face had gone back to that deadpan expression again lieutenant reynard thinks you might need it the prickling of claws set carefully into his clothing alerted him that one of the cats was swarming up to drape itself over his shoulders but somewhat to his surprise it wasnt skitty it was scat the tom peered at the screen in his hand with every evidence of fascinated concentration too he was patrol after all was his second thought after the initial surprise and on the heels of that thought he decided to hold the reader up so that scat could use the touch screen too it was easier to disable a lacuun than to kill one at least in hand to hand combat their throats were armored with bone plates their heads with amazingly thick skulls but there were vulnerable major nervepoints at all joints concentrated pinpoint pressure would paralyze everything from the joint down when applied there when dick figured he had the scanty contents by heart he tossed the reader back to vena though what he was supposed to do with the information was beyond him at the moment he wasnt exactly trained in anything but the most basic of selfdefensethat was more in erica makumbas line and she was several lightyears away at the moment the lacuun army has been alerted the palace has been put under tight security and the caretakers of the other cats have been warned about the poisoning attempt however the mysterious kitchenhelper got clean away so we can assume hell make another attempt my advisors and i would like to take him alive if we canweve got some plans that may abort this mess before it gets worse than it already is scats deepvoiced growl showed what he thought of that idea and vena lowered her smoldering dark eyes from dicks to the toms and smiled grimly id like to put a marine guard on the catsbut i know thats hardly possible vena continued as scat and skitty voiced identical snorts of disdain but lets walk back over to the palace and talk about what we can do on the way scat looked up at him and made an odd noise easy enough to interpret scat thinks he and skitty can guard the kittens well enough dick replied as vena waved him through the door a torrent of cats washing around his ankles im sure he does vena retorted but lets remember that hes only a cat however much his genes have been tweaked i hardly think hes capable of understanding the danger of the current situation he isnt just a cat he was a patrol cat dick pointed out but vena just shook her head at that dick we dont even know exactly what were intoall we know is that there was an attempt to poison the cats by an assassin that got away we dont know if it was a lone fanatic someone sent by our hosts enemies if theres only one or more than one she sighed as they reached the street were doing all the intelligence gathering we can but its difficult to manage when you dont look anything like the dominant species on the planet the street was empty which was fairly normal at this time of day when most lacuun were inside at their evening meal the sky of this world seemed a bit greenish to him but hed gotten used to ittoday there were some clouds that might mean rain or might not he didnt know very much about planetside weather scats squall was all the warning dick got to throw himself out of the way as something dark and fast whizzed through the place where hed been standing skitty and the kittens fairly flew back to the safety of the embassy scat whisked out of sight altogether a larger cloaked shape sprang from the shadows of a doorway and before dick managed to get halfway to his feet the greycloaked paleskinned lacuun seized vena and enveloped her holding a knife to her throat be still blasphemous shedemon it grated holding both venas arms pinned behind her back in a way that had to be excruciatingly painful she grimaced but said nothing and you father of demons be still also it snapped at dick i am the righteous hand of kreshkali the alldevouring the purifier i am the bringer of cleansing the anointed of god in his name and by his mercy i give you this choiceremove yourselves from our soil take yourselves back into the sky forever or you will die first you and your shedemon and your god killing pests then all of those who brought you its voice rose taking on the tones of a hellfireandbrimstone preacher kreshkali is the one the true god whose word is the only law and whose minions cleanse the world in his image his will shall not be flouted and his servants not denied it sounded like a wellrehearsed speech and probably would have gone on for some time had it not been interrupted by the speakers own scream of agony and small wonder for scat had crept up unseen even by dick until the instant he leapt for the assassins knifewielding wrist and fastened his teeth unerringly into those sensitive nerves at the joining of hand and wrist the knife clattered to the street vena twisted away and dick charged all at the same moment his shoulder hit the assassin and they both went down on the hard stone paving but not in a disorderly heap no by the time the marines came piling out of the embassy alerted by the frantic herd of cats dick had the miscreant facedown on the ground with both arms paralyzed from the shoulders down and miracle of miracles this time he wasnt the one battered and bruisedin fact he was intact beyond a few scrapes he wasnt taking any chances though he waited until the marines had all four limbs of the assassin in stasiscuffs before he got off his captive and surrendered him do we turn him over to the locals one of the marines asked vena diffidently not a chance she growled hustle him into the embassy before anyone asks any questions what are you going to do dick asked sotto voce following the marines and their cursing burden i told you weve got some ideasand a couple of experiments id rather try on this dirtbag rather than any lacuun volunteers was all she said leaving him singularly unsatisfied all he could be certain of was that she didnt plan to execute the assassin outofhand we caught him and weve got a chance to try those ideas out he continued to follow and was not prevented as vena led the way up the stairs to the embassy medlab the entire entourage of cats followed and vena not only let them she waved them all inside before shutting and locking the door the prisoner was strapped into a dental chair and gagged which at least put an end to the curses though not to the glares he cast at them but vena dropped down onto one knee and looked into skittys eyes i know youre a telepath skitty she said in terran can you project to anyone but dick could you project into our prisoners mind put your voice in his head skitty turned her head to look up at dick walls she complained dick has no walls for skitty she says hes got barriers dick interpreted i understand that most nontelepathic people have and its just an accident that the two of us are compatible i may be able to change that vena replied with a tight smile as she got to her feet skitty im going to do some things to this prisoner and i want you to tell me when the barriers are gone she turned to a cabinet and unlocked it inside were hypospray vials and she selected one weve been cooperating with the lacuun healers putting together drugs weve been developing for the lacuun she continued there are hypnotics that are proven to lower telepathic barriers in humans and i have a few that may do the same for the lacuun if they dont kill him that is she raised an eyebrow at dick you can see why we didnt want to test them even on volunteers but if the drugs kill him dick gulped then we save the lacuara the cost of an execution and we apologize that the prisoner expired from fear she replied smoothly dick gulped again this was a ruthless side of vena hed had no notion existed she placed the first hypo against the side of the prisoners neck the device hissed as it discharged its contents and the prisoners eyes widened with fear an hour later there were only two vials left in the cabinet vena had administered all the rest and their antidotes with sublime disregard for the strain this was probably putting on the prisoners body the effects of each had been duly noted but none of them produced the desired effect of lowering the barriers nontelepaths had against telepathic intrusion vena picked up the first of the last two and sighed if one of these doesnt work ill have to make a decision about giving him to the locals she said with what sounded like disappointment id really rather not do that dick didnt ask why but one of the two marines in the room with them must have seen the question in his eyes if the ambassador turns this fellow over to them theyll execute him and that might be enough to send cold war hostilities into a real blaze the young lieutenant muttered as vena administered the hypo and the word from the palace is that the other side is as advanced in atomic physics as our lot is in other words these are religious fanatics with a nuclear arsenal dick winced the terrans would be safe enough in a nuclear exchange and so would the bulk of citydwellers for the lacuun had mastered forceshield technology but in a nuclear exchange there were always accidents and as yet it wasnt possible to encase anything bigger than a city in a shield hed seen enough blasted lands never to wish a nucwar on anyone and certainly not on the decent folk here skitty watched the prisoner as she would a mouse his eyes unfocused when the drug took hold and this time she meowed with pleasure it didnt take dicks translation for vena to know that the prisoners telepathic barriers to skittys probing thoughts were gone excellent she exclaimed with relief all right little onewere going to leave the room until you send one of the kittens to come get us let him think weve lost interest in him for the moment then get into his head and convince him that he is a very very bad kitten and you are his mother and youre going to punish him unless he says hes sorry and he wont do it again make him think that you are so angry that you might kill him if he cant understand how bad hes been in fact any of you cats that can get into his head should do that then make him promise that hell always obey everything you tell him to and dont let up the pressure until he does skitty looked at vena as if she thought the human had gone crazy then sighed stupid she told dick privately but okay i do dick was as baffled as skitty was as he followed vena out into the hall leaving the cats with the prisoner just what is that going to accomplish he demanded she chuckled i rather doubt hes ever heard anyone speak in his mind before she pointed out not even his god now dick saw exactly what shed had in mindand stifled his bark of laughter hes going to be certain skittys more powerful than his god if she can do thatand if she treats him like a naughty child rather than an enemy to be destroyed exactly vena said with satisfaction this is what lieutenant reynard wanted me to try though we thought wed have to add halucinogens and a vr headset rather than getting right directly into his head my problem was finding a way to tell her to act like an allpowerful rebuking god in a way shed understand in the drugged state hes in now hell accept whatever happens as the truth so he wont threaten the cats anymorebut then what dick asked according to reynard the worst that will happen is that hell be convinced that this new god of his enemies is a lot more powerful and real than his own and thats the story hell take back home and the best dick inquired she shrugged he converts just what will that accomplish she paused and licked her lips unconsciously we ran some simulations based on what weve learned about lacuun psychology and projecting the rest from history historically the most fanatic followers of a new religion are the converts who were just as fanatical in their former religion in either case imagine the reaction when he returns home which he will and miraculously because well take a stealthed flitter and drop him over the border while hes drugged and unconscious hell probably figure out that we brought him but there wont be any sign of how imagine what his superiors will think the marine lieutenant standing diffidently at her elbow cleared his throat actually you dont have to guess he said respectfully as the ambassador mentioned weve been running a psychprofiles for possible contingencies and they agree with her educated assessment no matter what the fanatics will be too frightened of the power of this new god to hazard either a war or another assassination attempt and if we send back a converttheres a seventyfour point three percent chance hell end up starting his own crusade or even a holy war within their culture no matter what they cease to be a problem now that dick replied with feeling is really a better mousetrap
