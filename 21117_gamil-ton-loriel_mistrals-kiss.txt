laurell k hamilton mistrals kiss the th book in merry gentry series to jonathon worrying about the perfect words makes me miss the perfect moment you remind me its not perfection im seeking but happiness acknowledgments to darla cook and sherry ganey who keep so much running smoothly mary schuermann best motherinlaw in the world to my writing group the alternate historians deborah milletello mark sumner rett macpherson marella sands tom drennan and sharon shinn our tenth anniversary as a group with its current members is coming in its eighteen years from the groups inception in we will celebrate twenty years can you believe it party party party okay our kind of party no drinking certainly no drugs just us sitting around talking eating debbies amazing desserts just us doing what weve done for a decade being friends and helping each other succeed chapter i dreamt of warm flesh and cookies the sex i understood but the cookieswhy cookies why not cake or meat but thats what my subconscious chose as i dreamt we were eating in the tiny kitchen of my los angeles apartment an apartment i didnt live in anymore outside of dreams the we were me princess meredith the only faerie royal ever born on american soil and my royal guards more than a dozen of them they moved around me with skin the color of darkest night whitest snow the pale of newborn leaves the brown of leaves that have gone down to die on the forest floor a rainbow of men moving nude around the kitchen the real apartment kitchen would have barely held three of us but in the dream everyone walked through that narrow space between sink and stove and cabinets as if there were all the room in the world we were having cookies because wed just had sex and it was hungry work or something like that the men moved around me graceful and perfectly nude several of the men were ones id never seen nude they moved with skin the color of summer sunshine the transparent white of crystals colors i had no name for for the colors did not exist outside of faerie it should have been a good dream but it wasnt i knew something was wrong that feeling of unease that you get in dreams when you know that the happy sights are just a disguise an illusion to hide the ugliness to come the plate of cookies was so innocent so ordinary but it bothered me i tried to pay attention to the men touching their bodies holding them but each of them in turn would pick up a cookie and take a bite as if i werent there galen with his pale pale green skin and greener eyes bit into a cookie and something squirted out the side something thick and dark the dark liquid dripped down the edge of his kissable mouth and fell onto the white countertop that single drop splattered and spread and was red so red so fresh the cookies were bleeding i slapped it from galens hand i picked up the tray to keep the men from eating any more the tray was full of blood it dripped down the edges poured over my hands i dropped the tray which shattered and the men bent as if they would eat from the floor and the broken glass i pushed them back screaming no doyle looked up at me with his black eyes and said but it is all we have had to eat for so long the dream changed as dreams will i stood in an open field with a ring of distant trees encircling it beyond the trees hills rode up into the paleness of a moonlit winters night snow lay like a smooth blanket across the ground i was standing ankledeep in snow i was wearing a loose sweeping gown as white as the snow my arms were bare to the cold night i should have been freezing but i wasnt dream just a dream then i noticed something in the center of the clearing it was an animal a small white animal and i thought thats why i didnt see it for it was white whiter than the snow whiter than my gown than my skin so white that it seemed to glow the animal raised its head sniffing the air it was a small pig but its snout was longer and its legs taller than those of any pig id ever seen though it stood in the middle of the snowy field there were no hoofprints in that smooth snow no way for the piglet to have walked to the center of the field as if the animal had simply appeared there i glanced at the circle of trees for only a moment and when i looked again at the piglet it was bigger a hundred pounds heavier and taller than my knees i didnt look away again but the pig just got bigger i couldnt see it happening it was like trying to watch a flower bloom but it was growing bigger as tall at the shoulder as my waist long and broad and furry id never seen a pig so fuzzy before as if it had a thick winter coat it looked positively pettable that pelt it raised that strangely longsnouted face toward me and i saw tusks curving from its mouth small tusks the moment i saw them gleaming ivory in the snow light another whisper of unease washed through me i should leave this place i thought i turned to walk out through that ring of trees a ring of trees that now looked entirely too even too well planned to be accidental a woman stood behind me so close that when the wind blew through the dead trees her hooded cloak brushed against the hem of my gown i formed my lips to say who but never finished the word she held out a hand that was wrinkled and colored with age but it was a small slender hand still lovely still full of a quiet strength not full of the remnants of youthful strength but full of the strength that comes only with age a strength born of knowledge accumulated wisdom pondered over many a long winters night here was someone who held the knowledge of a lifetime no several lifetimes the crone the hag has been vilified as ugly and weak but that is not what the true crone aspect of the goddess is and it was not what i saw she smiled at me and that smile held all the warmth you would ever need it was a smile that held a thousand fireside chats a hundred dozen questions asked and answered endless lifetimes of knowledge collected and remembered there was nothing she would not know if only i could think of the questions to ask i took her hand and the skin was so soft soft the way a babys is it was wrinkled but smooth is not always best and there is beauty in age that youth knows not i held the crones hand and felt safe completely and utterly safe as if nothing could ever disturb this sense of quiet peace she smiled at me the rest of her face lost in the shadow of her hood she drew her hand out of mine and i tried to hold on but she shook her head and said though her lips did not move you have work to do i dont understand i said and my breath steamed in the cold night though hers had not give them other food to eat i frowned i dont understand turn around she said and this time her lips did move but still her breath did not color the night it was as if she spoke but did not breathe or as if her breath were as cold as the winter night i tried to remember if her hand had been warm or cold but could not all i remembered was the sense of peace and rightness turn around she said again and this time i did a white bull stood in the center of the clearing at least thats what it looked like at first glance its shoulder stood as tall as the top of my head it must have been more than nine feet long its shoulders were a huge broad spread of muscle humped behind its lowered head the head raised revealing a snout framed by long pointed tusks this was no bull but a huge boar the thing that had begun as a little pig tusks like ivory blades gleamed as it looked at me i glanced back but knew the crone was gone i was alone in the winter night well not as alone as i wanted to be i looked back and found the monstrous boar still standing there still staring at me the snow was cold under my bare feet now my arms ran with goose bumps and i wasnt sure if i shivered from cold or fear i recognized the thick white hair on the boar now it still looked so soft but its tail stuck straight out from its body and it raised that long snout skyward its breath smoked in the air as it sniffed that was bad that meant it was real or real enough to hurt me anyway i stood as still as i could i dont think i moved at all but suddenly it charged snow plumed underneath its hooves as it came for me it was like watching some great machine barreling down too big to be real too huge to be possible i had no weapon i turned and ran i heard the boar behind me its hooves sliced the frozen ground it let out a sound that was almost a scream i glanced back i couldnt help it the gown tangled under my feet and i went down i rolled in the snow fighting to come to my feet but the gown tangled around my legs i couldnt get free of it couldnt stand couldnt run the boar was almost on top of me its breath steamed in clouds snow spilled around its legs bits of frozen black earth sliced up in all that white i had one of those interminable moments where you have all the time in the world to watch death come for you white boar white snow white tusks all aglow in the moonlight except for the rich black earth that marred the whiteness with dark scars the boar gave that horrible screaming squeal again its thick winter coat looked so soft it was going to look soft while it gored me to death and trampled me into the snow i reached behind me feeling for a tree branch anything to pull myself up out of the snow something brushed my hand and i grabbed it thorns cut into my hand thorncovered vines filled the space between the trees i used the vines to drag myself to my feet the thorns were biting into my hands my arms but they were all i could grasp the boar was so close i could smell its scent sharp and acrid on the cold air i would not die lying in the snow the thorns bled me spattered the white gown with blood the snow covered in minute crimson drops the vines moved under my hands like something more alive than a plant i felt the boars breath like heat on the back of my body and the thorny vines opened like a door the world seemed to spin and when i could see again be sure of where i was again i was standing on the other side of the thorns the white boar hit the vines hard and fast as if it expected to tear its way through for a moment i thought it would do just that then it was in the thorns slowing it stopped rushing forward and started slashing at the vines with its great snout and tusks it would tear them out trample them underfoot but its white coat was bedecked with tiny bloody scratches it would break through but the thorns bled it id never owned any magic in dream or vision that i didnt own in waking life but i had magic now i wielded the hand of blood i put my bleeding hand out toward the boar and thought bleed i made all those small scratches pour blood but still the beast fought through the thorns the vines ripped from the earth i thought more i made a fist of my hand and when i opened it wide the scratches slashed wide hundreds of red mouths gaping on that white hide blood poured down its sides and now its squeal was not a scream of anger or challenge it was a squeal of pain the vines tightened around it of their own accord the boars knees buckled and the vines roped it to the frozen ground it was no longer a white boar but a red one red with blood there was a knife in my hand it was a shining white blade that glowed like a star i knew what i needed to do i walked across the bloodspattered snow the boar rolled its eyes at me but i knew that if it could even now it would kill me i plunged the knife into its throat and when the blade came out blood gushed into the snow over my gown onto my skin the blood was hot a crimson fountain of heat and life the blood melted the snow down to rich black earth from that earth came a tiny piglet not white this time but tawny and striped with gold it was colored more like a fawn the piglet cried but i knew there would be no answer i picked it up and it curled up in my arms like a puppy it was so warm so alive i wrapped the hooded cloak i now wore around us both my gown was black now not black with blood but simply black the piglet settled into the soft warm cloth i had boots that were lined with fur soft and warm the white knife was still in my hand but it was clean as if the blood had burned away i smelled roses i turned back and found that the white boars body was gone the thorny vines were covered in green leaves and flowers the flowers were white and pink from palest blush to dark salmon some of the roses were so deeply pink they were almost purple the wonderful sweet scent of wild roses filled the air the dead trees in the circle were dead no more but began to bud and leaf as i watched the thaw spread from the boars death and that spill of warm blood the tiny piglet was heavier i looked down and found that it had doubled in size i put it onto the melting snow and as the boar had gotten bigger so now this piglet grew again i could not see the change but like a flower unfurling undetectably it changed all the same i began to walk over the snow and the rapidly growing pig came at my side like an obedient dog where we stepped the snow melted and life returned to the land the pig lost its baby stripes and grew black and as tall at the shoulder as my waist and still it grew i touched its back and the hair was not soft but coarse i stroked its side and it nestled against me we walked the land and where we walked the world became green once more we came to the crest of a small hill where a slab of stone lay grey and cold in the growing light dawn had come breaking like a crimson wound across the eastern sky the sun returns in blood and dies in blood the boar had tusks now small curling things but i wasnt afraid he nuzzled my hand and his snout was softer and more nimble more like a great finger than any pigs snout id ever touched he made a sound that was pleasant and made me smile then he turned and ran down the other side of the hill with his tail straight out behind him like a flag everywhere his hooves touched the earth sprang green a robed figure was beside me on the hill but it was not the greyrobed figure of the crone goddess in winter this was a male figure taller than i broad of shoulder and cloaked in a hood as black as the boar that was growing small in the distance he held out his hands and in them was a horn the curved tusk of a great boar it was white and fresh with blood still on it as if he had just that moment cut it from the white boar but as i moved over toward him the horn became clean and polished as if with many years of use as if many hands had touched it the horn was no longer white but a rich amber color that spoke of age just before i touched his hands i realized the horn was set in gold formed into a cup i laid my hands on either side of his and found that his hands were as dark as his cloak but i knew this was not my doyle my darkness this was the god i looked up into his hood and saw for an instant the boars head then i saw a human mouth that smiled at me his face like the face of the goddess was covered in shadow for the face of deity was ever a mystery he wrapped my hands around the smooth horn of the cup the carved gold almost soft under my fingers he pressed my hands to the cup i wondered where had the white knife gone a deep voice that was no mans voice and every mans voice said where it belongs the knife appeared in the cup bladedown and it was shining again as if a star had fallen into that cup of horn and gold drink and be merry he laughed then at his own pun he raised the shining cup to my lips and vanished to the warm sound of his own laughter i drank from the horn and found it full of the sweetest mead i had ever drunk thick with honey and warm as if the heat of the summer itself slipped across my tongue caressed my throat i swallowed and it was more intoxicating than any mere drink power is the most intoxicating drink of all chapter i woke surrounded by a circle of faces in a bed that was not mine faces the color of darkest night whitest snow the pale green of new leaves the gold of summer sunshine the brown of leaves trodden underfoot destined to be rich earth but there was no pale skin that held all the colors of a brilliant crystal like a diamond carved into flesh i blinked up at all of them and wondered remembering my dream where were the cookies doyles voice deep and thick as if it came from a great distance said princess meredith are you well i sat up nude in the bed with black silk sheets cold against my skin the queen had loaned us her room for the night real fur soft and nearly alive pressed against my hip the fur covering moved and kittos face blinked up at me his huge blue eyes dominated his pale face and held no white in all that color the color was seelie sidhe but the eyes themselves were goblin he had been a child of the last great goblin sidhe war his pale perfect body was barely four feet tall a delicate man the only one of my men who was shorter than i was he looked childlike cuddled down in the fur his face framed like some cherub for a valentines day card he had been more than a thousand years old before christianity was a word hed been part of my treaty with the goblins they were my allies because he shared my bed his hand found my arm and stroked up and down my skin seeking comfort as we all did when we were nervous he didnt like me staring at him without saying anything he had been curled up close to me and the power of the goddess and the god in my dream must have slipped across his skin the faces of the fifteen men standing in their circle around the bed showed clearly that they had felt something too doyle repeated his question princess meredith are you well i looked at my captain of the guard my lover his face as black as the cloak i had worn in vision or the fur of the boar that had run out into the snow and brought spring back to the land i had to close my eyes and breathe deeply trying to break free of the last vestiges of vision and dream trying to be in the here and now i raised my hands from the tangle of sheets in my right hand was a cup formed of horn the horn ancient and yellowed held in gold that bore symbols that few outside faerie could read now in my left hand i expected to find the white knife but it was not there my left hand was empty i stared at it for a moment then raised the cup with both hands my god rhys whispered though the whisper was strangely loud yes doyle said that is exactly what it is what did he say when he gave you the cup of horn it was abe who asked abe with his hair striped in shades of pale grey dark grey black and white perfect strands of color his eyes were a few shades darker grey than most human eyes but not otherworldly not really if you dressed him like a modern goth hed be the hit of any club scene his eyes were strangely solemn hed been the drunk and joke of the court for more years than i could remember but now there was a different person looking out from his face a glimpse of what he might once have been someone who thought before he spoke someone who had other preoccupations than getting drunk as quickly and as often as he could abe swallowed hard and asked again what did he say i answered him this time drink and be merry abe smiled wistful sorrowfilled that sounds like him like who i asked the cup used to be mine my symbol i crawled to the edge of the bed and knelt on it i held the cup up with both hands toward him drink and be merry abeloec he shook his head i do not deserve the gods favor princess i do not deserve anyones favor i suddenly knew not by way of a vision i just suddenly possessed the knowledge you werent thrown out of the seelie court for seducing the wrong woman as everyone believes you were thrown out because you lost your powers and once you could no longer make the courtiers merry with drink and revelry taranis kicked you out of the golden court a tear trembled on the edge of one eye abeloec stood there straight and proud in a way that i had never seen him id never seen him sober as he appeared to be now clearly hed drunk to forget but he was still immortal and sidhe which meant that no drug no drink could ever truly help him find oblivion he could be clouded but never truly know the rush of any drug he finally nodded and that was enough to spill the tear onto his cheek i caught the tear on the edge of the horn cup that tiny drop seemed to race down the inside of the cup faster than gravity should pull it i dont know if the others could see what was happening but abe and i watched the tear race for the bottom of that cup the tear slid inside the dark curve of the bottom and suddenly there was liquid spilling up bubbling up like a spring from the dark inner curve of the horn deep gold liquid filled the cup to its brim and the smell of honey and berries and the pungent smell of alcohol filled the room abes hands cupped over mine in the same way i had held the cup in the vision with the god i raised it up and as abeloecs lips touched the rim i said drink and be merry drink and be mine he hesitated before he drank and i observed an intelligence in those grey eyes that id never glimpsed before he spoke with his lips brushing the edge of the cup he wanted to drink i could feel it in the eager tremble in his hands as they covered mine i belonged to a king once when i was no longer his court fool he cast me out the trembling in his hands slowed as if each word steadied him i belonged to a queen once she hated me always and made certain by her words and her deeds that i knew just how much she hated me his hands were warm and firm against mine his eyes were deep dark grey charcoal grey with a hint of black somewhere in the center i have never belonged to a princess but i fear you i fear what you will do to me what you will make me do to others i fear taking this drink and binding myself to your fate i shook my head but never lost the concentration of his eyes i do not bind you to my fate abeloec nor me to yours i merely say drink of the power that was once yours to wield be what you once were this is not my gift to give to you this cup belongs to the god the consort he gave it to me and bid me share it with you he spoke of me no not you specifically but he bid me to share it with others the goddess told me to give you all something else to eat i frowned unsure how to explain everything id seen or done vision is always more sensible inside your head than on your tongue i tried to put into words what i felt in my heart the first drink is yours but not the last drink and we will see what happens i am afraid he whispered be afraid but take your drink abeloec you do not think less of me for being afraid only those who have never known fear are allowed to think less of others for being afraid frankly i think anyone who has never been afraid of anything in their entire life is either a liar or lacks imagination it made him smile then laugh and in that laughter i heard the echo of the god some piece of abeloecs old godhead had kept this cup safe for centuries some shadow of his old power had waited and kept watch watched for someone who could find their way through vision to a hill on the edge of winter and spring on the edge of darkness and dawn a place between where mortal and immortal could touch his laughter made me smile and there were answering chuckles from around the room it was the kind of laughter that would be infectious he would laugh and you would have to laugh with him just by holding the cup in your hand rhys said your laughter makes me smile you havent been that amusing in centuries he turned his boyishly handsome face to us with its scars where his other tricolored blue eye would have been drink and see what is left of who you thought you were or dont drink and go back to being shadow and a joke a bad joke abeloec said rhys nodded and came to stand close to us his white curls fell to his waist framing a body that was the most seriously muscled of any of the guards he was also the shortest of them a fullblooded sidhe who was only five foot six unheard of what do you have to lose i would have to try again i would have to care again said abe he stared at rhys as completely as he had at me as if what we were saying meant everything if all you want is to crawl back into another bottle or another bag of powder then do it step away from the cup and let someone else drink rhys said a look of pain crossed abeloecs face its mine its part of who i was the god didnt mention you by name abe rhys said he told her to share not who with but its mine only if you take it rhys said and his voice was low and clear and somehow gentle as if he understood more than i did why abe was afraid its mine abe said again then drink rhys said drink and be merry drink and be damned abeloec said rhys touched his arm no abe say it and do your best to believe it drink and be merry ive seen more of us come back into our power than you have the attitude affects it or can abeloec started to let go of the cup but i moved off the bed and came to stand in front of him you will bring everything you learned in this long sad time with you but you will still be you you will be who you were just older and wiser wisdom bought at great cost is nothing to regret he stared down at me with his eyes a dark and perfect grey you bid me drink i shook my head no it must be your choice you will not command me i shook my head again the princess has some very american views on freewill rhys said i take that as a compliment i said but abe said softly yes rhys said it means its all on you your choice your fate all in your hands enough rope to hang yourself as they say or save yourself doyle said and he came to stand on the other side like a taller darkness to rhyss white abeloec and i stood with white on one side black on the other rhys had once been cromm cruach a god of death and life doyle was the queens chief assassin but once he had been nodons a god of healing we stood between them and when i looked up at abeloec something moved in his eyes some shadow of that person i had glimpsed on the hill inside the hood of a cloak abeloec raised the cup taking my hands with it we raised the cup together and he lowered his head his lips hesitated for a breath on the edge of that smooth horn then he drank he kept tipping the cup back until he had to drop to his knees so that my hands stayed on the cup while he upended it he drank it down in one long swallow on his knees releasing the cup he threw his head back eyes closed his body bent backward until he lay in a pool of his own striped hair his knees still bent underneath him he lay for a moment so still so very still that i feared for him i waited for his chest to rise and fall i willed him to breathe but he didnt he lay like one asleep except for the odd angle of his legs no one slept like that his face had smoothed out and i realized that abe was one of the few sidhe who had permanent worry lines tiny wrinkles at eye and mouth they smoothed in his sleep if it was sleep i dropped to my knees beside him the cup still in my hands i leaned over him touched the side of his face he never moved i placed my hand on the side of his face and whispered his name abeloec his eyes flew open wide it startled me drew a soft gasp from my lips he grabbed my wrist at his face and his other arm wrapped around my waist he sat up or knelt up in one powerful movement with me in his arms he laughed and it wasnt a mere echo of what id heard in my vision the laughter filled the room and the other men laughed with him the room rang with joyous masculine laughter i laughed with him them it was impossible not to laugh with the pure joy in his face so close to mine he leaned in closing the last inches between our mouths i knew he was going to kiss me and i wanted him to i wanted to feel that laughter inside me his mouth pressed against mine a great cry went up among the men joyous and rough his tongue licked light along my bottom lip and i opened my mouth to him he thrust himself inside my mouth and suddenly all i could taste was honey and fruit and mead it wasnt just his symbol he was the cup or what it contained his tongue shoved inside me until i had to open my mouth wide or choke and it was like swallowing the thick golden honeyed mead he was the intoxicating cup i was on the floor with him on top of me but he was too tall to kiss me deeply and press much of anything else against my naked body at the same time beneath us was a fur throw that lay on the stone floor it tickled along my skin helped every movement he made be something more as if the fur were helping caress me our skin began to glow as if wed swallowed the moon at her ripe bursting fullness and her light was shining out from our skin the white streaks in his hair showed a pale luminous blue his charcoalgrey eyes stayed strangely dark i knew that my eyes glowed each circle of color green of grass pale green jade and that molten gold i knew that every circle of my iris glowed my hair cast a reddish light around my vision it shone like spun garnets with fire inside them when i glowed his eyes were like some deep dark cave where the light could not go abruptly i realized that for a long while we hadnt been kissing wed simply been staring into each others faces i leaned up toward him wrapped my hands around him id forgotten i still held the cup in one hand and it touched his bare back his spine bowed and liquid poured across his skin though the cup had been emptied before it was full again heavy cool liquid rushed down his body and over mine drenching us in that thick golden flow pale blue lines danced across his skin i couldnt tell if they were under his skin inside his body or on the surface of his glowing torso he kissed me he kissed me deep and long and this time he didnt taste like mead he tasted of flesh of lips and mouth and tongue and the graze of teeth along my lower lip and still the mead ran down our bodies spreading out out into a golden pool the fur underneath us flattened in the tide of it he spilled his mouth and hands down my body over my breasts he held them in his hands gently caressed my nipples with his lips and tongue until i cried out and i felt my body grow wet but not from the spreading golden pool of mead i watched the pale blue lines on his arm flow into shapes flowers and vines and move down his hand and across my skin it felt as if someone traced a feather across my skin a voice cried out and it wasnt me and it wasnt abeloec brii had fallen to his hands and knees his long yellow hair spilling down into the growing pool of mead abeloec sucked harder on my breast forcing my attention back to him his eyes still didnt glow but there was that intensity in them that is a kind of magic a kind of power the power that all men have when they spill themselves down your body with skilled hands and mouth he moved his mouth over me drinking where the mead had pooled in the hollow of my stomach he licked the tender skin just above the hair that curled between my legs his tongue pressed in long sure strokes over such innocent skin it made me wonder what it would be like when he dropped lower to things that werent so innocent a mans strangled cry made me look away from abeloecs dark eyes i knew that voice galen had fallen to his knees his skin was a green so pale it was white but now green lines traced his skin glowing writhing under his skin forming vines and flowers pictures other cries drew my attention to the rest of the room of the fifteen guards most were on their knees or worse some had fallen flat to the floor to writhe on their stomachs as if they were trapped in the flowing golden liquid as if it were liquid amber and they were insects about to be caught forever and they fought against their fate lines of blue or green or red traced their bodies i caught glimpses of animals vines images drawn over their skin like tattoos that were alive and growing doyle and rhys stood in the growing tide and seemed unmoved but doyle stared at his hands and arms at lines tracing those strong arms crimson against that blackness rhyss body was painted with palest blue but he didnt watch the lines he watched me and abeloec frost also stood in the writhing spill of liquid but he like doyle stared at the tracing of lines that glowed over his skin nicca stood tall and straight with his brown hair and the brilliant spill of his wings like the sails of some faerie ship but no lines covered his skin he remained untouched it was barinthus tallest of all the sidhe who had moved to the door he stood pressed to it avoiding the spill of mead that seemed to creep like a thing alive across the floor he held on to the door handle as if it would not open as if we were trapped here until the magic had its way with us a small sound drew me back to gaze at the bed and kitto still perched there safe above the flowing mead his eyes were wide as if he was afraid regardless he was afraid of so much abeloec rubbed his cheek across my thigh it brought me back to him back to gazing into those dark almost human eyes the glow of his skin and mine had dimmed i realized that hed paused to let me look around the room now his hands slid under my thighs and he lowered his face hesitating as if he were coming in for a chaste kiss but what he did with his mouth wasnt chaste he plunged his tongue thick and sure across me the sensation threw my head back bowed my spine upside down i saw the door open saw the surprised look on the face of barinthus as mistral the queens new captain of the guard strode in his hair the grey of rain clouds once he had been the master of storms a sky god now he strode into the room and slipped on the mead started to fall then it was as if the world blinked one moment he was falling near the door the next he was above me falling toward me he put his hands out to try to catch himself and i put my arms up to keep him from falling on top of me his hand caught the floor but my hand touched his chest he shuddered above me on his knees and one hand as if i had made his heart stutter i touched him through the tough softness of leather armor he was safe behind it but the look on his face was that of a stricken man eyes wide he was close enough now that i could see his eyes were the swimming green of the sky before a great storm breaks destroying all in its path only great anxiety could bring his eyes to that color or great anger long ago the sky itself had changed with the color of mistrals eyes my skin sang to life glowing like a whitehot star abeloec glowed with me for the first time i saw the lines on my own skin and the writhing lines of color marched over us neon blue in the glow i watched a thorny vine crawl blue and alive down my hand to unfurl across mistrals pale skin mistrals body convulsed above me and it was as if the lines of color drew him down toward me as if they were ropes pulling him down down his eyes stayed unwilling his body fighting with muscle and might only when he was nearly on top of me and abeloec and only the force of his shoulders held his face above mine did his eyes change i watched that frightening storm green fade from his eyes replaced with a blue as swimming and pure as a summer sky id never known his eyes could be that blue the blue lines in his skin painted a lightning bolt across his cheek then his face was too close to mine for me to see details his mouth was upon mine and i kissed mistral for the second time ever he kissed me as if he would breathe the air he needed to live from my mouth as if if his mouth did not touch mine it would be death his hands slid down my body and when he touched my breasts he made a sound deep in his throat that was eager almost a sound of pain abeloec chose that moment to remind me that there was more than one mouth against my body he fed between my legs with tongue and lips and lightly teeth so that i made my own eager sounds into mistrals mouth it drew another of those sounds from him that was both eager and painfilled as if he wanted this so badly that it hurt his hand convulsed on my breast hard enough that it did hurt but in that way that pain can feed into pleasure i writhed under both their mouths plunging lips to mistral hips to abeloec it was at that moment that the world swam i thought at first it was simply the inside of my own head caught in pleasure but then i realized there was no longer a fur rug heavy with mead under my body i lay instead on dry twigs that poked and prodded my bare skin the shift of surroundings was enough to draw the attention of us all away from mouths and hands we were in a dark place for the only light was the glow of our bodies but it was a brighter glow than just the three of us held it made me look beyond the men touching me frost rhys and galen were like pale ghosts of themselves doyle was almost invisible except for the lines of power there were others glowing in the dark almost all the vegetative deities and nicca standing with his wings glowing around him theyd gone back to being a tattoo on his back until tonight i didnt remember nicca touching the mead i looked for barinthus and kitto but they werent here it was as if the magic had picked and chosen among my men by the glow of our bodies i saw dead plants withered things we were in the dead gardens those once magical underground lands where legend had it that faerie had its own sun and moon rain and weather but i had never known any of that the power of the sidhe had faded long before i was born the gardens were simply dead now and the sky overhead was only bare empty rock i heard someone say how then those lines of color flared bright crimson neon blue emerald green in the dark it forced cries from the dark and sent abeloecs mouth back between my legs mistrals mouth pressed into mine his hands eager on my body it was a sweet trap but trap it was laid for us by something that cared little for what we wanted the magic of faerie held us and we would not be free until that magic was satisfied i tried to be afraid but i couldnt there was nothing but the feel of abeloecs and mistrals bodies on mine and the push of the dead earth underneath me chapter abeloecs tongue made long sure strokes around the edge of my opening then a caress at the top as he moved downward again mistrals hands played with my breasts in the same way he kissed as if he could not fill his hands with enough of my body as if the sensation was something that he had to have he rolled my nipples between his fingers and finally moved his mouth from mine to join his hands at my breasts he took one breast into his mouth as far as he could as if he would truly eat my flesh he sucked hard and harder until his teeth began to press into me abeloec moved up to that sweet place at the top of my opening and began to roll his tongue over and around it mistrals teeth pressed in slowly as if he were waiting for me to say stop but i didnt the combination of abeloecs mouth sure and gentle between my legs and the inexorable pressure of mistrals mouth on my breast tight and tighter was exquisite a soft breeze danced across my skin a trickle of wind pushed strands of mistrals hair across my body pulling strands free from his long ponytail his teeth continued their relentless press he was crushing my breast between his teeth and it felt so good abeloecs tongue flicked fast and faster over that one sweet point the wind blew harder sending dead leaves skittering across our bodies mistrals teeth were almost met in my breast and it hurt now i opened my mouth to tell him to stop but in that moment abeloec flicked that one last time i needed he brought me screaming my hands flinging outward upward searching for something to hold on to while abeloec built the orgasm with tongue and mouth my hands found mistral i dug nails into his bare arms and only when one of my hands reached for his thigh did he grab my wrist to do it he had to release my breast from the prison of his mouth he pinned my hands into the dry earth while i screamed and strained to reach him with nails and teeth he stayed just above me pressing my wrists into the ground he stared down at me with eyes flickering with light my last sight of his eyes before abeloec made me fling my head from side to side fighting against the pleasure was that they were full of lightning flickering dancing so bright it made shadows on the glow of my skin abeloecs hands dug into my thighs holding me in place while i struggled to break free it felt so good so good that i thought i would lose my mind if he didnt stop so good that i wanted him both to stop and never to stop the wind blew harder dried woody vines screeched in the growing wind and trees creaked with protest as if their dead limbs would not last the wind the lines of color that fed out from abeloec red and blue and green grew brighter with the wind the colors pulsed bright and brighter maybe because the light was so intensely colored it didnt so much push back the darkness as make the darkness glow as if the endless night had been brushed with neon lights abeloec let go of my thighs and the moment he did the lights dimmed just a little he knelt between my legs and began unlacing his breeches his modern clothes had been ruined in last nights assassination attempt and he like most of the men who rarely left faerie had few things with zippers or metal buttons i started to say no because he hadnt asked and because the magic was receding i could think again as if the orgasm had cleared my mind i was supposed to be having as much sex as i could for if i didnt get with child soon not only would i never be queen but id probably be dead if my cousin cel got someone with child before i got pregnant he would be king and he would kill me and all who were loyal to me it was an incentive to fuck that no aphrodisiac could match but there was something sharp under my back and more smaller pains up and down my body dead branches and bits of plant poking and biting at me i hadnt noticed it until after the orgasm when the endorphins were receding at a rapid rate thered been almost no afterglow just mindblowing orgasm and then this feeling of fading of being aware of every discomfort if abeloec had missionary position in mind we needed a blanket it wasnt like me to lose interest so quickly if abeloec was as talented with other things as he was with his mouth then he was someone i wanted to bed just for sheer pleasure so why did i suddenly find myself with no upon my lips and a desire to get up off the ground then a voice came out of the growing dark as the lines of color faded a voice that froze us all where we were and sent my heart pounding into my throat well well well i call for my captain of the guard mistral and he is nowhere to be found my healer tells me that you all vanished from the bedroom i searched for you in the dark and here you are andais queen of air and darkness stepped out from the far wall her pale skin was a whiteness in the growing dark but there was light around her light as if black could be a flame and give illumination if you had stood in the light i would have not found you but you stand in the dark the deep dark of the dead gardens you cannot hide from me here mistral no one was hiding from you my queen doyle said the first any of us had spoken since wed all been brought here she waved him silent and walked over the dry grass the wind that had been whipping the leaves was dying now as the colors died the last of the wind fluttered the hem of her black robe wind she made it a question there has not been wind in here for centuries mistral had left me to drop to his knees before her his skin faded as he moved away from me and abeloec i wondered if his eyes still flashed with lightning but was betting they did not why did you leave my side mistral she touched his chin with long pointed nails raised his face so he had to look at her i sought guidance he said in a voice that both was low and seemed to carry in the growing dark now that abeloec and i had stopped having sex all the light was fading all the flow on everyones skin was dying away soon we would stand in a darkness so absolute that you could touch your own eyeball without first blinking a cat would be blind in here even a cats eyes need some light guidance for what mistral she made of his name an evil whine that held the threat of pain as a smell on the wind can promise rain he tried to bow his head but she kept her fingertips under his chin you sought guidance from my darkness abeloec helped me to my feet and held me close not for romance but the way all the fey do when theyre nervous we touch one another huddling in the dark as if the touch of anothers hand will keep the great bad thing from happening yes mistral said liar the queen said and the last thing i saw before the darkness swallowed the world was the gleam of a blade in her other hand it flashed from her robe where shed hidden it i spoke before i could think no her voice crawled out of the darkness and seemed to creep along my skin meredith niece do you actually forbid me from punishing one of my own guards not one of your guards but mine mine the darkness was heavier thicker and it took more effort to breathe i knew she could make the very air so heavy that it would crush the life out of me she could make the air so thick that my mortal lungs couldnt draw it in shed nearly killed me just yesterday when i interfered in one of her entertainments there was wind in the dead gardens doyles deep voice came so low so deep that it seemed to vibrate along my spine you felt the wind you remarked upon the wind yes i did but now it is gone now the gardens are dead dead as they will always be a pale green light sprang from the darkness doyle holding a cup of sickly greenish flames in his hands it was one of his hands of power id seen the touch of that fire crawl over other sidhe and make them wish for death but as so many things in faerie it had other uses it was a welcome light in the dark the light showed that it was no longer her fingertips that held mistrals chin upward but the edge of a blade her blade mortal dread one of the few things left that could bring true death to the immortal sidhe what if the gardens could live again doyle asked as the roses outside the throne room live again she smiled most unpleasantly do you propose to spill more of merediths precious blood that was the price for the roses renewal there are ways to give life that do not require blood he said you think you can fuck the gardens back to life she asked she used the edge of the blade to raise mistral up high on his knees doyle said yes this i would like to see she said i dont think it will work if you are here rhys said a pale white light appeared over his head small round a gentle whiteness that illumined where he walked it was the light that most of the sidhe and many of the lesser fey could make at will a small magic that most possessed if i wanted light in the dark i had to find a flashlight or a match rhys moved in his soft circle of light slowly toward the queen she spoke a little fucking after a few centuries of celibacy makes you bold oneeye the fucking makes me happy he said this makes me bold he raised his right arm showing her the underside of it the light was not strong enough and the angle not right for me to see what was so interesting she frowned then as he moved closer her eyes widened what is that but her hand had lowered enough that mistral was no longer trying to raise himself up on his knees to keep from being cut it is exactly what you think it is my queen doyle said he began to move closer to her as well close enough both of you she emphasized her words by forcing mistral back high on his knees we mean you no harm my queen doyle said perhaps i mean you harm darkness that is your privilege he said i opened my mouth to correct him because he was my captain of the guard now she wasnt allowed to simply hurt him for the hell of it not anymore abeloec tightened his hand on my arm he whispered against my hair not yet princess the darkness does not need your help yet i wanted to argue but his reasoning was sound as far as it went i opened my mouth to argue but as i looked up into his face the argument fell away from me his suggestion just seemed so reasonable something bumped my hip and i realized he was holding the horn cup he was the cup and the cup was him in some mystical way but when he touched it he became more morereasonable or rather his suggestions did i wasnt sure i liked that he could do that to me but i let it go we had enough problems without getting sidetracked i whispered what is on rhyss arm but abeloec and i stood in the dark and the queen of air and darkness could hear anything that was spoken into the air in the dark she answered me show her rhys show her what has made you bold rhys didnt turn his back on her but moved sort of sideways toward us the soft white sourceless light moved with him outlining his upper body in a battle it would have been worse than useless it would have made him a target but the immortal dont sweat things like that if you cant die i guess you can make as obvious a target of yourself as you like the light touched us first like that first white breath of dawn that slides across the sky so white so pure when dawn is nothing more than the fading of darkness as rhys got closer to us the white light seemed to expand sliding down his body showing that he was still nude he held his arm out toward me there was a pale blue outline of a fish that stretched from just above his wrist almost to his elbow the fish was headdown toward his hand and seemed oddly curved like a half circle waiting for its other half abeloec touched it much as the queen had done lightly with just his fingertips i have not seen that on your arm since i stopped being a pub keeper i know rhyss body i said its never been there before not in your lifetime abeloec said i glanced from him to rhys to him i said its a fish why a salmon he said to be exact i closed my mouth so i wouldnt say something stupid i tried to do what my father had always taught me to do think i thought out louda salmon means knowledge one of our legends says that because the salmon is the oldest living creature it has all the knowledge since the world began it means longevity because of the same legend legend is it rhys said with a smile i have a degree in biology rhys nothing you say will convince me that a salmon predated the trilobites or even the dinosaurs modern fish is just that modern on a geological scale abeloec was looking at me curiously id forgotten prince essus insisted on you being educated among the humans he smiled when youre reasoning things out you arent as easy to distract he tightened his other hand with the cup still gripped in it i frowned and finally stepped away from him stop that you drank from his cup rhys said he should be able to persuade you of almost anything he grinned as he said it if you were human i guess shes not human enough abeloec said youre all acting as if that pale tattoo is important i dont understand why didnt essus ever tell you about it asked rhys i frowned my father didnt mention anything about a tattoo on your arm the queen made a derisive noise essus didnt think you were important enough to be told he didnt tell her doyle said for the same reason that galen doesnt know galen was still lying in the dead garden all the other men who had fallen to the ground were still kneeling or sitting in the dead vegetation a soft greenish white glow began to form above galens head not a nimbus like that of rhys but more of a small ball of light above his head galen found his voice hoarse and had to clear it sharply before he said i dont know about any tattoos on rhys either none of us has told the younger ones queen andais doyle said everyone knows that our followers painted themselves with symbols and went into battle with only those symbols to shield them they eventually learned to wear armor andais said her arm had lowered enough for mistral to be comfortable on his knees again yes and only the last few fanatical tribes kept trying to seek our favor and blessing they died for that devotion doyle said what are you talking about i asked once we the sidhe their gods were painted with symbols that were our sign of blessing from the goddess and the god but as our power faded so did the marks upon our bodies doyle said it all in his thickasmolasses voice rhys picked up the story once if our followers painted their bodies to mimic us they gained some of the protection the magic that we had it was a sign of devotion yes but once long long ago it literally could call us to their aid he looked at the faint blue fish on his arm i have not held this mark for nearly four thousand years it is faint and incomplete the queen said from the far wall yes rhys nodded and looked at her but it is a beginning niccas voice came soft and id almost forgotten him standing so still to one side his wings began to gleam in the dark as if their veins had begun to pulse with light instead of blood he fanned those huge wings they had been only a birthmark on the back of his body until a few days ago when they had sprung from his back real and true at last they began to glow as if the individual colors were stained glass gleaming in sunlight that we could not see he held out his right hand and showed us a mark on the outer part of the wrist almost on the hand itself the light was too uncertain for me to be sure of what it was but doyle said a butterfly i have never held a mark of favor from the goddess nicca said in his soft voice the queen lowered her blade completely so that it went back to being invisible in the full black skirt of her robe what of the rest of you youll be able to feel it if you think about it rhys said to the others frost called a ball of light that was a dim silvergrey it held above his head much as galens greenish light had frost began unbuttoning his shirt he rarely went nude if he could avoid it so i knew before he bared the perfect curve of his right shoulder that there would be something there he turned his arm so he could see it the queen said show us he let her see first then turned in a slow half circle to us it was as pale and blue as rhyss had been a small dead tree leafless naked and the ground underneath it seemed to hint at a snowbank like rhyss salmon it was dim and not drawn in completely as if someone had begun the job but not finished killing frost has never held a sign of favor the queen said and her voice was strangely unhappy no frost said i have not i was not fully sidhe when last the sidhe held such favors he shrugged back into his shirt and began to button it into place he wasnt just dressed he was armed most of the others held a sword and dagger but only doyle and frost had guns rhys had left his gun behind with his clothes in the bedroom i noticed a bulge here and there under frosts shirt which meant he held more weapons than could be easily seen he liked being armed but this many weapons meant something had made him nervous the assassination attempts maybe or maybe something else his handsome face was closed to me hidden behind the arrogance that he used as a mask perhaps he was just hiding his thoughts and feelings from the queen but then againfrost tended to be moody rhys said let abeloec and merry finish what they began let us all finish it queen andais took in a deep breath so that even across the dimly lit chamber i could see the rise and fall of the v of white flesh in her robe very well finish it then come to me for we have much to discuss she held out her hand to mistral come my captain let us leave them to their pleasures mistral did not question he stood and took her pale hand we need him rhys said no andais said no i have given meredith my green men she does not need the whole world does grass grow without wind and rain doyle asked no she said and her voice was unfriendly again as if she would like to be angry but couldnt afford to be right now andais was a creature of her temper she always indulged it this much selfrestraint from her was rare to make spring you need many things my queen said doyle without warmth and water plants wither and die they stared at each other the queen and her darkness it was the queen who looked away first mistral may stay she released his hand then looked across the cavern at me but let this be understood between us niece he is not yours he is mine he is yours only for this space of time is that clear to all of you we all nodded and you mistral the queen said do you understand my geas is lifted for this space of time with the princess alone clearly put as always she said she turned her back as if she would walk through the wall then turned and looked over her shoulder i will finish what i was doing when i noticed your absence mistral he dropped to his knees my queen please do not do this she turned back with a smile that was almost pleasant except for the look in her eyes which even from here was frightening you mean do not leave you with the princess no my queen you know that is not what i mean do i she said danger in her voice she glided over the dead brush and placed the point of mortal dread under his chin you didnt come to ask the advice of my darkness you came to bid the princess to intercede for neryss clan mistrals shoulders moved as if hed breathed deeply or swallowed hard answer me mistral she said a whine of rage like a razors edge in her voice nerys gave her life on your word that you would not kill her people you he stopped talking abruptly as if shed nudged the point close enough that he couldnt speak without cutting himself aunt andais i said what have you done to neryss people they tried to kill you and me last night or have you forgotten i remember but i also remember that nerys asked you to take her life so that you might spare her house you gave your word that you would let them live if she died in their place i have not harmed a single one she said and she looked entirely too pleased with herself what does that mean i asked i merely offered the men a chance to serve their queen as a member of my royal guard i need my ravens at full strength joining your guard means giving up all family loyalties and becoming celibate why would they agree to either of those things i asked she took the blade away from mistrals throat you were so eager to tattle on me tell her now may i rise my queen he asked rise cartwheel i care not just tell her mistral rose cautiously and when she made no move toward him he began to ease across the room toward us his throat was dark in the flickering lights shed bled him any sidhe could heal such a small cut but because mortal dread had done the damage he would heal mortal slow human slow mistrals eyes were wide frightened but he moved easily across the dead ground as if he werent worried that she would do something to him as he walked away from her i know that my shoulder blades would have been aching with the fear of the blow only when he was out of reach of her sword did some of the panic leave his eyes even then they were that shade of tornado green anxiety far enough she said meredith can hear you from there he stopped obediently but he swallowed hard as if he didnt like that shed stopped him before he got back to us i didnt blame him the queen had magic that could destroy from this distance shed probably made him stop just so he would worry she might intend him no more harm but she wanted him to be afraid she liked for people to be afraid of her she has put metal chains of binding on all of the house of nerys so they can do no magic said mistral i cant argue with that i said they attacked us at court all of them they should lose their magic for a time she has given the men the chance to become her ravens the women she has offered to the princes guard his cranes cel is in seclusion locked away he needs no guard i said most of the women would not agree to it anyway mistral said but the queen had to be seen giving them all a choice a choice between becoming guards and what i asked i was almost afraid of the answer shed been carrying mortal dread i prayed that she hadnt executed them she would be forsworn before the entire court and i needed andais on the throne until she confirmed me as her heir the queen has bid ezekiel and his helpers to wall them up alive said mistral i blinked at him i couldnt quite follow it all my first thought was to protest that the queen was forsworn then i realized she wasnt theyre immortal so they wont die i said softly they will know terrible hunger and thirst and they will wish to die mistral said but no they are immortal and they will not die i looked past him to my aunt tricksy you i said very damn clever she gave a little bow from the neck so glad you appreciate the delicate reasoning of it oh i do and i meant it youve broken no oath in fact technically youre doing exactly what nerys gave her life for her clan her house her bloodline will live that is not living mistral said did you really think that the princess had enough influence with me to save them from their fate asked andais once i would have gone to essus to ask his help with you mistral said so i sought the princess she is not my brother andais snarled no she is not essus mistral said but she is his child she is your blood and what does that mean mistral that she can bargain for neryss people they have already been bargained for by nerys herself you are pixieing on the spirit of that bargain rhys said but not breaking it she said no he said and he looked so sad no the sidhe never lie and we always keep our word except our version of the truth can be more dangerous than any lie and youd better think through every word of any oath we give our word to because we will find a way to make you regret you ever met us he sounded more angry than sad do you dare to criticize your queen she asked i touched rhyss arm squeezed he looked first at my hand then at my face whatever he saw there made him take a deep breath and shake his head no one would dare to do that queen andais his voice was resigned again what would you give for a sign that life was returning to the gardens doyle asked what do you mean by sign she asked and her voice held all the suspicion of someone who knew us all too well what would you give for some hint of life here in the gardens a little wind is not a sign she said but would the beginnings of life here in the gardens be worth nothing to you my queen of course it would be worth something it could mean that our power was returning doyle said she motioned with the sword silver gleaming dully in the light i know what it would mean darkness and a return of our power what would that be worth to you queen i know where you are going darkness do not try to play such games with me i invented these games then i will not play i will state plainly if we can bring some hint of life to these underground worlds then you will wait to punish in any way neryss people or anyone else a smile as cruel and cold as a winter morning curved her lips good catch darkness good catch my throat was tight with the realization that if hed forgotten the last phrase others would have paid for her anger someone who would have mattered to doyle or me or both if she could have found them rhys was right this was a dangerous game this game of words for what shall i wait she asked for us to bring life to the dead gardens of course he said and if you do not bring life to the dead gardens then what then when we are all convinced that the princess and her men cannot bring life back to the gardens you are free to do with neryss people as you intended and if you do bring life to the gardens what then she asked if we bring even a hint of life back to the gardens you will let princess meredith choose the punishment of those who tried to have her assassinated she shook her head clever darkness but not clever enough if you bring a hint of life back to the gardens then i will allow meredith to punish neryss people it was his turn to shake his head if the princess meredith and some of her men bring even a hint of life back to these gardens then meredith alone decides what punishment shall be meted out to neryss people she seemed to think about that for a moment or two then nodded agreed you give your word the word of the queen of the unseelie court he asked she nodded i do witnessed rhys said she waved her hand dismissively fine fine you have your promise but remember i have to agree that there is at least a hint of life it better be some evidence impressive enough that i cant pixie out of it darkness because you know i will if i can i know he said she looked at me then it was not a friendly look enjoy mistral meredith enjoy him and know that he comes back to me when this is done thank you for loaning him to me i said and kept my voice absolutely empty she made a face at me dont thank me meredith not yet youve only bedded him once she motioned at me with the sword though i see that you have found what he considers pleasure he likes to cause pain i would have thought that he would be your ideal lover then aunt andais i like to cause pain niece meredith not be on the receiving end i swallowed hard so i wouldnt say what i was thinking i finally managed i did not know that you were a pure sadist aunt andais she frowned at me pure sadist thats an odd phrase i meant only that i didnt know you didnt like pain on your own body at all oh i like a little teeth a little nails but not like that again she motioned at my breast it ached where hed bitten me and i had a nearperfect imprint of his teeth though he hadnt broken the skin i would be bruised but nothing more she shook her head as if to chase away a thought then turned and the motion caused her black robe to swirl wide she grabbed the edge of it to pull it around herself she looked back over her shoulder one last time before she stepped into the darkness and traveled back the way shed come her last words were not a comfort after mistrals had his way with her do not come crying to me that hes broken your little princess and the piece of darkness where she had been was empty so many of us let out a sigh of relief at the same time that it was like the sound of wind in the trees someone gave a nervous laugh she is right about one thing mistral said and his eyes held regret i like causing a little pain i am sorry if i hurt you but it has been so long since he spread his hands wide i forgot myself i am sorry for that rhys laughed and doyle joined him and finally even galen and frost joined in that soft masculine sound why do you laugh mistral asked rhys turned to me his face still shining with laughter do you want to tell him or do we i actually blushed which i almost never do i kept abes hand in mine and drew us both across the dry brittle grass until i stood in front of mistral i looked at the blood that trickled dark across his pale neck and gazed up into his eyes so anxious i had to smile i like what you did to my breast thats just about as hard as i like it just this side of drawing blood with teeth he frowned at me you like the nail work to be harder than the teeth rhys said you dont mind bleeding a little from nails but only if youve done the preliminaries i said preliminaries mistral said and sounded puzzled foreplay abeloec said the puzzled look faded and something else entirely filled his eyes something warm and sure of itself something that made me shiver just from him looking at me i can do that he said then take off the armor i said what he asked get naked rhys called i can speak for myself thank you i said glancing back at him he made a little motion as if to say be my guest i turned back to mistral i gazed up into his face and found that his eyes were already beginning to fade to a soft grey like rain clouds i smiled at him and he smiled back a little uncertainly as if he wasnt used to smiling much get naked i said he grinned a brief flash of it then what we have sex im first abeloec said hugging me from behind i nodded agreed mistrals face darkened i could almost see clouds in his eyes not just the color of the irises but the actual image of clouds floating in the pupils why is he first he asked because he can be part of the foreplay i said she means once ive fucked her then you can do it rougher said abeloec mistral smiled again but this smile was different this was a smile that made me breathe harder you really liked what i did to your breast he asked i swallowed hard pressing myself against abeloecs body almost as if i were afraid of the taller man in front of me i nodded and whispered yes good he said and he reached for the leather fastenings that held his armor in place very good he whispered chapter the moment abeloec laid me down on a bed of castoff clothes our skin began to glow it was a thin layer of my guards shirts and tunics just enough so that i wouldnt pierce my body on the dead vegetation it amounted to all the clothing the men were wearing which hadnt been much and it left them all nude i could still feel the dry sticks crumbling leaves dry and withered crushed underneath me it wasnt the feel of the ground in winter no matter how cold the winter how deep the snow there is a feeling of waiting in the ground then a sense that the land is merely asleep and the sun will wake it and spring will come not here it was like the difference between a body that is deeply asleep and one that is dead at a glance your eyes may see no difference but if you touch it you know the ground that abeloecs body pressed me into held nothing no warmth breath life empty like the eyes of the dead that but a moment ago held personality and now are like dark mirrors the gardens werent waiting for reawakening they were just dead but we werent dead abeloec laid his naked body against mine and kissed me the height difference meant that all he could do was kiss me but it was enough enough to conjure that moonglow inside our bodies he raised up on his arms to stare down at my face his skin glowed so bright that again his eyes became like dark grey caves in his face id never met any sidhe whose eyes did not glow when their power came upon them his long hair spilled out around us and the white lines in his hair began to glow softly blue like before he raised higher on his arms almost in a pushup so that his body was suspended above mine on hands and toes pale blue lines glowed through the white of his skin flowing images of vines and flowers and trees and animals nothing stayed nothing lasted there werent that many lines and they didnt move that fast i should have been able to tell what kind of vine what fruit what animal but beyond small or large it was as if my mind couldnt hold the images i traced the blue with my fingers and it trailed over my hand tickled and teased across the white glow of my own skin and even staring at my own hand i couldnt tell you what plant it was that grew and flowered there it was as if i werent meant to see it or at least not to understand it not yet maybe not ever i stopped trying to make sense of the flowing lines and gazed down the length of abeloecs body where it stretched above mine he held himself above me like a shelter as if he could have stayed there forever and never tired i reached down his body worming underneath his steady strength until i could wrap my hand around the hard length of him he shuddered above me i should be touching you his voice was strained thick with effort but effort for what his arms and shoulders and legs were utterly still above me as if he were stone instead of flesh it wasnt his strength that gave his voice that thick sound at least not strength of body maybe strength of will i squeezed gently around his shaft and he was hard so terribly hard his breathing changed and i could see his stomach fluttering with the effort to stay steady above me how long has it been i asked i dont remember he said i stroked my hand up and over the head of him his spine bowed downward and he almost fell on top of me but then his arms and legs went back to their firm stance i thought the sidhe did not lie i do not remember exactly he said his voice was breathy now i slid my other hand down to cup his balls and gently play with them he swallowed hard enough for me to hear it and said if you keep doing that ill go and thats not how i want to go the first time i continued to play with him gently he was so hard quiveringly hard just holding him in my hands i knew that the phrase aching with need wasnt merely words he glowed and i could feel the power in him but he did not throb with it the way the others did it was a quieter power this what do you want the first time i asked and my voice had gone deeper thickening with the feel of him in my hands i want to be inside you between your legs i want to make you come before i do but i do not know if i still have that kind of discipline then dont be disciplined this time the first time dont worry about it he shook his head and the blue lines in his hair seemed to pulse brighter i want to bring you such pleasure that you will want me in your bed every night so many men meredith so many men in your bed i dont want to wait my turn i want you to come to me again and again because no one brings you as much pleasure as i do a sound made us both turn our heads we found mistral kneeling beside us hurry up and finish this abeloec or i will not wait to be second would you not worry as i do that you pleasure the princess abeloec asked unlike you ill have no second chance here abeloec the queen has decreed that this time is all i will ever have with the princess so no i am not so worried about my performance he ran his hand through my hair pushing deep so that his fingers brushed my scalp it made me cuddle my head against his hand he closed his fingers into a fist and was suddenly jerking my hair tight in his hand it sped my pulse in my throat tearing a sound from my mouth that was not pain my skin blazed to whitehot life we do not have to be gentle mistral said he leaned his face near mine do we princess i whispered no he pulled my hair tighter and i cried out i felt rather than saw some of the other men move toward us mistral pulled my hair tight again bending my neck to one side moving my body a little out from under abeloec i am not hurting you am i princess no all i could do was whisper i dont think they heard you he said he twisted his hand tight and sudden in my hair he put his lips against my cheek and whispered scream for me the blue lines crawled from my skin to his and again i saw that outline of lightning on his cheek i whispered what will you do if i dont scream he kissed me ever so gently against my cheek hurt you my breath came out in a shudder please i sighed mistral laughed a wonderful deep laugh with his face pressed against mine and his hand still tight in my hair hurry abeloec hurry or we will have to fight to see who is first he let go of my hair so abruptly that this motion too hurt a little and forced a sound from me mistral turned me back over to abeloec with my eyes unfocused and my breath either coming too fast or nearly stopping for a moment i couldnt quite tell my pulse seemed uncertan if i was afraid or thrilled but it was as if now that mistral touched me again he could not quite give up touching me he kept his fingers against the side of my neck as if he wanted to help my pulse decide i do not like to cause pain abeloec said his body was not quite as happy as it had been pain is not the only way to pleasure i said his dark eyes narrowed at me from the shine of his face you do not have to have pain to be pleasured i shook my head feeling the lingering ache where mistrals hand had been no doyles deep voice came out of the dark meredith likes violence but she also likes gentleness it depends on her mood and yours both abe and mistral looked at him the queen cares nothing for our moods mistral said this one will doyle said abeloec looked down at me and began to slowly lower himself toward my body for all the world like a pushup except that i was in the way his mouth found mine before his body pressed into me he kissed me and the blue was neonbright and flared with lines of crimson and emerald the lines of color flared down mistrals hand and it felt as if those lines were made of rope drawing his mouth to mine and drawing abeloec down my body he half knelt and half lay across my lower body he spread my legs so that his body spilled between them but it was his finger that found me first testing the waters i think his voice was strangled as he said youre still wet i would have answered but mistrals mouth found mine and i gave the only answer i could i raised my hips toward abeloecs searching hand the next thing i felt was his hands moving to my hips the tip of him of him rubbing against my opening mistral raised his mouth from mine and half whispered half groaned fuck her fuck her fuck her please and the last word was drawn out into a long sigh that ended in something close to a scream abeloec pushed himself inside me and only then did he begin to throb with power it was almost like some huge vibrator except this vibrator was warm and alive and had a mind and a body behind it that mind moved the body in rhythms that no mere mechanical aid could ever have produced i watched abeloec push in and out of my body like some shining shaft of light though it was undoubtedly flesh that went in and out of me soft firm vibrating flesh mistral grabbed my hair again pulled my head back so that i could no longer watch abeloec work his magic in my body the look on mistrals face would have frightened me if wed been alone he kissed me hard so hard that it was bruising i had a choice of opening my mouth to him or cutting my lips on my own teeth i opened my mouth his tongue plunged inside me as if he were trying to do to my mouth what abeloec was doing between my legs it was only his tongue but he kept pushing inside pushing until he shoved my mouth so wide that my jaw began to ache he shoved his tongue so far down my throat that i gagged and he drew back i thought he did it to let me swallow and catch my breath but he drew back so he could laugh he let loose a roll of masculine pleasure that spilled from his mouth and danced over my skin there was an echo to it that laughter an echo like distant thunder his pausing gave me a chance to concentrate on abeloec he had found a rhythm that plunged to the end of me and out in a rolling slide a rhythm that would have brought me eventually but even beyond that his body pulsed inside mine it was as if his magic throbbed with the rhythm of his body so that each time he plunged deep inside me the magic throbbed harder and vibrated faster i took the chance mistral had given me to say abeloec are you making your magic pulse in time to your lovemaking his voice came tight with concentration yes i started to say oh goddess but mistrals mouth found mine again and i got only as far as oh god mistral thrust his tongue so deep and hard into my mouth that it was like oral sex when the man is too big for comfort if you fight it it hurts but if you relax sometimes you can do it you can let the man have his way with your mouth without breaking your jaw id never had anyone kiss me like this and even as i fought to let him do it i thought about him being this forceful with other things and the thought made me open wider to him wider to them both they were both so skilled but in such opposite ways that i wondered what it would be like to have their full attention one at a time but there was no way to ask mistral to wait to give us room because i could barely breathe with his tongue down my throat let alone speak i wanted to speak i wanted to stop having to fight him to breathe my jaw was aching hard enough to distract me from abeloecs amazing fucking mistral had crossed that line from feels good to fucking stop we hadnt arranged a sign that would let him know i wanted him to stop when you cant speak you usually have some prearranged way to tap out i started pushing at his shoulders pushing like i meant it i wasnt as strong as a fullblooded sidhe but i had once put my hand through a car door to scare away some wouldbe muggers if thats an indication i had bloodied my hand but not broken it so i pushed and he pushed back he had his mouth so far inside mine that i couldnt even bite him i was choking and he didnt care i could feel the orgasm beginning to build i did not want abeloecs good work spoiled by the fact that i was choking nails could be used for pleasure or to make a point i set my nails in the firm flesh of mistrals neck and dug them in i carved bloody furrows in his skin he jerked back from me and seeing the rage on his face again i was glad we werent alone when i say stop you stop i said and i realized that i was angry too you didnt say stop because you made certain i couldnt you said you liked pain i was having trouble controlling my breathing because abeloec was still vibrating and moving inside me i was close i like pain to a point but not a broken jaw well need to lay some ground rules beforeyougetyour turn and the last word was a scream as i threw my head back and my body spasmed mistral caught my head or i would have smashed it against the hard ground abeloecs pleasure spread through me over me in me in waves waves of pleasure waves of power over and over as if here too he was able to control what was happening as if he could control my release the way hed controlled everything else the orgasm would roll over me from my groin to every inch of my body then it would start again spreading from between my legs over my skin in a rush that sent my hands seeking something to hold on to my body thrashing my entire upper body left the ground and smashed back over and over while abeloec held my hips and legs trapped against his body someone was behind me catching me trying to hold me down but the pleasure was too much i could do nothing but struggle and scream one long ragged scream after another my fingers found flesh to tear and strong hands held my wrist tight my other hand found my own body and tore at it another hand found that wrist pinned it to the floor i heard voices over my screams go abeloec just finish it now abeloec urged mistral and he did and suddenly the world was made of white light and it was as if i could feel his release between my legs feel it hot and thick and him buried as deep inside me as he could go i floated in that white light and found starbursts of red and green and blue then there was nothing nothing but white white light chapter i didnt pass out not completely not really but it was as if i were boneless helpless in the afterglow of abeloecs power my eyes fluttered open when the lap my head was resting in moved i found mistral above me his hands still holding my wrists still cuddling my head i want you hurt not broken he said as if he saw something in my face that he had to answer it took me three tries to answer glad to hear it i finally said he laughed then and began to move carefully from under me he laid my head on the dead earth gently apparently id disarranged our makeshift blanket because i could feel other patches of dry scratchy vegetation here and there against my skin i turned my head and looked for the others abeloec was crawling a little shakily toward my head as if he and mistral were going to change places it took me a moment to focus past abe farther into the dark beyond the darkness was shot with neon glow blue green and red the colors were everywhere some individual burning lines and some entwined like string wound into rope stronger thicker for being joined doyle knelt closest to us as if hed tried to come to me his sword was drawn as if there was something among us that metal could slay his dark skin was covered in lines of blue and crimson rhys was just beyond him covered in blue and red lines too and there were other figures in the dark covered in green and blue lines and images of flowering plants i caught a shine of long pale hair ivi was covered in dead vines and green lines of power brii stood near a tree hugging it or tied to it with green and blue lines but it was as if the tree had bent toward him its thin lifeless branches embracing his naked body like arms adair had climbed a tree and stood on one of the thick upper branches he was reaching up into it as if he saw things there that i did not i caught glimpses of other bodies on the ground covered in dead vegetation frost and nicca were kneeling farther away they had lines of blue only snaking over their bodies they were holding someones arms and legs it took me a moment to realize it was galen he was so covered in the bright green glow that he was nearly hidden from sight the others seemed to be enjoying the power or at least not to be in pain but galens body seemed to be convulsing almost as i had when abeloec brought me but even more violently mistrals face appeared above mine and i realized that he was holding himself above my body much as abeloec had earlier but he didnt kiss me as the other man had he made sure that the only thing i could see was his face my turn he said and the look in his eyes was enough to make me frightened not in fear of mistral but fear of what was happening something powerful and what would be the price one thing i had learned early was that all power comes with a price mistral i said but he was already moving down my body the wind was back a thin seeking wind that touched my body like invisible fingers the dead leaves rustled and the vines seemed to sigh in the growing wind i raised up enough to look down my body at mistral i called his name again he looked up at the sound of his name but there was nothing in his face that really heard me this was his one chance in a thousand years to have a woman when we left the gardens his opportunity would be gone if id known the others were safe then i wouldnt even have tried to argue with the look in his eyes but i wasnt sure they were i wasnt sure any of us were i didnt like not knowing what was happening he smoothed his hands along the inside of my thighs gentle caressing but that gentle movement spread my legs with him kneeling between them whats happening mistral are you afraid he asked but he wasnt looking at my face when he said it yes i said and my voice was soft in the growing wind good he said abeloec answered me i am the intoxicating cup like medb for the kings of old you have drunk deep i turned my head back to look at him where he knelt behind me i knew that medb had been a word for mead a sovereign goddess whom nine kings of ireland had had to mate with before she would let them rule but most of that was only stories no one would speak of her among the sidhe as if she were a real goddess a real person i had asked and been told only that she was the cup that intoxicates which had been another way of saying that she was mead id been left to believe shed never been real i dont understand i said abeloec smoothed his hand along my face i give the power of sovereignty to the queen as medb gave power to the kings i was forgotten because the world turned to chauvinism and there were no more votes for queens i was just accasbel denied my purpose some human literature says i am an ancient deity of wine and beer i founded the first pub in ireland and was a follower of partholon that is all i am now to history he leaned in close to my face and i lay back against the ground with his hands on either side of my face until today i have new duties just then mistrals fingers found my opening and i would have turned to look at him but abeloecs hands tightened on my face kept me looking at him while mistral began to explore me with his hand abeloec whispered above my face there was a time when without me or medb no one ruled in ireland or faerie or anywhere in the isles the sithen brought us here for a reason it brought everyone here for a reason including mistral dried leaves rushed across my body like brittle fingers tapping my stomach and breasts let us have our reason back meredith abeloec said it wasnt a finger touching me down there anymore though mistral hadnt entered me for someone who liked to cause pain he was being patient and gentle i whispered reason what reason to abeloecs face reason to be meredith a man without a duty is only half a man mistral shoved himself inside me in one long hard movement it spilled my upper body up off the ground tore a scream from my mouth abeloec released me and i could finally stare down my body at mistral mistrals head was flung back eyes closed his body was married into mine as deep as he could make it there were no lines of color on him anymore and i realized there were none on any of the three of us but there was something in the shining of his skin it took me a moment to realize that something was moving inside his skin it looked like a reflection of something but it was not a reflection of anything around us he stayed there frozen above me with his lower body as snug to me as he could get it and his upper body raised back on his hands and arms he opened his eyes and looked down at me and i saw clouds glide inside his eyes like windows onto some distant sky the clouds moved as if hurried by some great wind and i realized that that was what i was seeing inside his skin clouds storm clouds roiling inside his skin the wind was growing spilling my hair across my face sending dead leaves in small whirlwinds a storm was coming and i was watching it grow inside mistrals body mistral was the master of the winds master of the sky a storm god once upon a time the first lightning flash showed in his eyes once upon a time wasnt as long ago as it used to be chapter mistral drew out of me with a sighing shudder that ran down the length of his body seeing him affected to that degree made my breath short and fast at first i thought he had rain in his eyes to match the lightning then he blinked and i realized it was tears if we had been alone i would have questioned it talked about it but with this many other men around us i could not i could not point out that he was crying in front of them nor could i ask him why and hope to get a truthful answer but it meant a great deal to me that mistral master of storms cried after he tasted my body abeloec said softly its been too long mistral looked at him and he simply nodded with the shine of those few hard tears gliding down his cheeks he looked down at me and there was a gentleness on his face a raw pain in his eyes he kissed me and this time it was gentle i have forgotten my manners princess forgive me you can kiss me with force just dont choke me he gave a small smile and an even smaller nod then he laid his body carefully along the length of mine so that his testicles pressed against my groin and the hard length of him touched me from groin to my upper stomach he let his weight settle on top of me with a sigh then wrapped his arms around me he put his face to one side of mine and it was as if he let some great tension fall away from him it was almost as if he grew lighter at the same time that his actual weight became heavier i laid a soft kiss against the curve of his ear because it was the spot i could reach he shuddered against me again but because he was pressed so hard against the front of my body it made me shudder too the wind trailed his hair and mine across my face mingling the red and grey strands together almost in the way the neon glow of power had wound itself together stronger together than apart the clouds in his eyes spun so fast across them that it was almost dizzying to watch he unwound his arms from me and raised up enough to see my face i dont want to kiss down the front of your body i want to bite my way down it i had to swallow hard before i could answer in a breathy voice no blood no permanent marks and nothing as hard as what you did to my breast you havent done enough prep work for that prep work he made it a question abeloec said foreplay he had been kneeling above my head so still that i had forgotten he was there we both looked at him give us a little more room mistral asked i am the only one inside this circle with you and i must remain circle i thought then i realized that he was right the lines of blue green and red encircled the three of us everyone else was covered in them but they formed a barrier around the three of us it was a barrier that the wind could cross at will but there would be other things that could not cross it i wasnt sure what those other things would be but i knew enough of magical circles to know that they were meant to keep some things in and some things out it was their nature and tonight was all about the nature of things i ran my hands up mistrals back tracing the line of his spine playing along the muscles that held him just above me he closed his eyes and swallowed before he looked down at me you wanted something you i said that earned me a smile a real smile not about sex or pain or sorrow just a smile i valued that smile the way i valued frosts smile and doyles they had all come to me without a real smile as if they had forgotten how to do it by the standards that the other two men had set mistral was a fast learner i moved one hand around so i could trace his lower lip with my finger do what you wanted to do just remember the rules his smile held an edge of something that wasnt happy now and i wasnt sure if the parameters that id put on him were actually that taxing or if id reminded him of something sad no blood no permanent marks nothing as hard as what i did on your breast because i have not done enough foreplay for that yet it was almost word for word what id said to him good memory memory is all i have as he said it that raw pain was back in his eyes i thought i understood now he was enjoying himself and determined to enjoy himself but when he was finished there would be no more the queen would put him back in the lonely cell of her rules her jealousy her sadism would it be worse to have had this moment and then be denied again would it cause him pain to watch me with my men and not be a part of it it wasnt that i was so special to him or to them it was simply that i was the only woman with whom the guards could break their long celibacy i raised myself off the ground and kissed him i am yours he kissed me gently at first then harder his tongue thrust between my lips i opened my mouth and let him explore my mouth he thrust deep inside then backed off a little enough so that it was just a good deep kiss the feel of his mouth drew my mouth closer to his made my body rise up to press tighter against him sent my arms across his back pressed my breasts firm against his chest he made a small sound low in his throat and the wind suddenly felt cool against my skin he drew his mouth from mine and the expression in his eyes was wild storm clouds rode in his eyes but they had slowed so that it was no longer dizzying if i hadnt known what i was looking at i might simply have thought his eyes were the grey of rain clouds he laid his face in the curve of my neck he didnt so much kiss me as lay his lips against my skin his breath went out in a heavy sigh that spread warmth across my skin it made me shiver and that was it he set his teeth in the side of my neck and bit me it made me cry out and tense my fingers along his back to trail an edge of nail across his skin he bit my shoulder quick and hard i cried out for him and he moved again i dont think he trusted himself to hold my flesh in his mouth for very long i knew he wanted to bite down harder and i could feel the effort required to fight that urge in his lips his hands his entire body he was enjoying himself but he was struggling to keep his impulses in check he put his mouth into the side of the breast he had not marked and barely laid teeth i grabbed the side of his face not hard but it stopped him he lifted his gaze to mine his mouth half opened and i watched his expression fall i think he expected me to tell him to stop even if that had been what i meant to do i wouldnt have had the heart to say it but regardless it hadnt harder i said instead he gave me a wolfish grin and again i got that glimpse of something in him that would have made me hesitate to be alone with him but i was no longer certain if that was truly mistrals nature or whether centuries of denial had made him wild with need he set his teeth into my side and bit down hard hard enough that i writhed under him he moved just a little farther down my side to my waist and this time when i felt him begin to let go i said harder he bit me deeper this time bit me until i felt his teeth almost meet in my skin i cried out and said enough enough he lifted his face as if to stop completely i smiled at him i didnt say stop i just meant that was hard enough he moved to the other side of my body and bit me again without urging hard enough that i had to tell him almost immediately not to go farther he looked up at me and whatever he saw on my face satisfied him because he bit next to my belly button setting his teeth so hard and fast that i had to tell him to stop hed left a press of red teeth marks on my stomach there were red marks here and there on my body but nothing as perfect as that a perfect set of his teeth marks in the white flesh of my body looking at it made me shiver you like it he whispered yes i said the wind held an edge of dampness as it trailed across my skin he licked low on my stomach and the wind seemed to blow across that wet line almost as if the wind had a mouth too and could blow where it wished mistral pressed his mouth where he had licked and bit me hard and sharp enough to make me startle and raise my upper body off the ground enough i said and my voice was almost a yell the wind began to pick up blowing more dead leaves across my body streaming my hair across my face so that for a moment i couldnt see what mistral was doing the wind was damp as if it rode an edge of rain but it never rained in the dead gardens i felt his mouth laid on the mound between my legs resting on the tight curling hair i couldnt see but i knew what he was doing he bit me and i yelled enough i used one hand to push my hair out of the way so i could look down my body and see him he gave one quick flick of his tongue between my legs that one small touch sped my pulse and opened my mouth in a silent o you know what i want to do he said he spoke with his hands around my thighs fingers digging in just a little his face just above my groin so close that his breath touched me there i nodded because i didnt trust my voice on the one hand i didnt want him to hurt me on the other i did want him to come just to that edge of truly hurting me i liked that edge i liked it a lot i finally found my voice and it almost didnt sound like me so breathy so eager go slow and when i say enough you stop he gave that smile again that filled his clouddazed eyes with a fierce light and i realized it wasnt my imagination lightning played through the heavy grey clouds of his eyes it had gone away but now it was back and it filled them with a flashing white white light so that his eyes looked blind for a second the wind slowed and the air felt heavy thick and i felt an edge of electricity in the air he spread me wide using his fingers so strong so thick he licked the length of me back and forth until i writhed under his mouth and hands only then did he press his mouth over me only then did he let me feel the edge of his teeth around the most intimate parts of my body he bit down slowly so slowly so carefully i breathed out harder he obeyed he took as much of my flesh down there into his mouth as he could fit and bit me bit me so hard that it raised my upper body completely off the ground and i screamed for him but i didnt scream stop or enough i just screamed fullthroated spine bowing staring down at him with wide eyes and opened mouth i orgasmed for him from the feel of his teeth in my most intimate flesh i orgasmed for him and even through the pleasure of it i changed my scream to stop stop oh god stop even through that most overwhelming of pleasures i could feel his teeth going just a little too far when something hurts in the middle of orgasm you need to stop things usually only hurt when the afterglow begins to fade again i screamed stop and he stopped i fell back onto the ground eyes unable to focus fighting to breathe unable to move but even while my body lay helpless with the afterglow i began to ache i ached where his teeth had touched me there and i knew that it was just going to hurt more later id let my desire and mistrals send us too far over that fine edge his voice came i did not bleed you and i did not bite you as hard there as i did on your breast i nodded because i couldnt speak yet the air was so dense with the coming storm that it made it harder to breathe almost in the way the queen could make the air too thick to breathe are you hurt he asked i found my voice a little the ache was becoming sharper i had only a limited time before it was simply going to hurt i wanted him to finish before the pleasure truly did become pain he crawled over my body on all fours so that he wasnt actually touching me but he could see my face are you all right princess i nodded help me turn over why because if we finish this with you on top its going to hurt too much i was too rough he said and he sounded so sad lightning flashed first in one eye then the other as if it traveled from one side of his mind to the other the light blue lightning bolt on his cheek paled in the brightness of it he started to crawl off me as if he were going to stop i grabbed his arm dont stop bright goddess dont stop just help me roll over if you take me from behind you wont be brushing up against the part of me you bruised if i have hurt you so badly we must stop my fingers tightened on his arm if i wanted to stop i would say so everyone else has been too afraid of hurting me and even if you went too far i do like it mistral i like it a great deal he gave an almost shy smile i did notice i smiled back at him then let us finish what we started if you are sure in the moment he said it and meant it i knew that i would be safe alone with him if he was willing to pass up some of the first intercourse hed been offered in centuries for fear of my being hurt then he had the discipline to control himself in private consort preserve us but he had more discipline than i would have had how many men would have turned down the finish after a start like that not many not many at all i am sure i said he smiled again and something moved above us something grey was in motion near the high domed ceiling clouds there was a tiny knot of clouds up near the ceiling i looked into mistrals face and said fuck me mistral is that an order my princess he smiled when he said it but there was an edge of something that wasnt happy in his voice only if you want it to be he looked down at me then said i would rather do the ordering then do it i said turn over he said his voice did not have quite the firmness it had had earlier as if he wasnt sure i would obey i had recovered enough to roll over though i was slow he moved back until he knelt by my feet i want you on your hands and knees i did what he asked or ordered it put me looking at abeloec who still knelt motionless at the top of our makeshift blanket i expected to see lust or something to let me know he was enjoying the show but that wasnt what was in his face his smile was gentle peaceful it didnt match what we were doing at least not to me mistrals hands stroked my ass and i felt him rub against my opening the front of me was sore but the rest of me was eager youre wet mistral said i know i said you really did enjoy it yes you really do like it that rough sometimes i said the tip of him rubbed around the edge so close but not inside now he made it a question i lowered my upper body so that my lower body lifted toward him pushing against the feel of him only his slight movement backward kept me from taking him into my body i made a small sound of protest the wind held the smell of rain the press of silent thunder the storm was coming and i wanted him inside me when it came he laughed that wonderful masculine sound i take that as a yes yes i said i pressed my cheek into the brittle leaves my face and hands touching the dry ground i had to close my eyes against the push of dead leaves and plants i pushed my ass up at him and asked wordlessly that he take me i didnt realize i was saying anything out loud but i must have been for then i heard my own voice chanting please please please over and over soft under my breath my lips closer to the dead earth than to the man i was begging he pushed just the tip of himself inside me and the wind changed instantly it felt almost hot i could still smell rain but there was also a metallic smell the scent of ozone lightning the air was hot and close and i knew in that moment that it wasnt that i wanted mistral inside me when the storm broke but that the storm would not come until he was inside me he was the storm as abeloec had been the cup mistral was the heavy press of the air and that neckruffling promise of lightning i raised up and shoved my body onto him he actually stopped me with his hands on my hips no he said no i will say when i went back to pressing my upper body to the dry ground i said mistral please dont you feel it dont you feel it storm he said and his voice seemed lower than it had been a growling roll as if his voice held an echo of thunder in it i raised up but not to try to control him i wanted to see him i wanted to see if there had been other changes besides the growl of thunder in his voice he still glowed with power but it was as if dark grey clouds had moved in over that glow so that i saw only the shine of his power through the veil of clouds he stared down at me and his eyes flashed bright so bright that for a moment his face was half obscured by that white white light the brilliance faded leaving afterimages in my vision but without the lightning his eyes werent the grey of rain clouds they were black that blackness that rolls across the sky at midday and sends us all running for cover because just by looking at the sky you know that something dangerous is coming something that will drown you burn you concuss you with the power that is about to fall from the sky i shivered gazing down my body at him shivered because i wonderedwas i too mortal to survive this was his power going to burn along my flesh and hurt me in ways that i did not want it was as if abeloec heard me thinking he spoke in a low soft voice that made me look at him he was still kneeling in front of us but it was as if his pale skin were fading into the growing dark as if he himself were dissipating into the circle of power his hair was shot through with lines of blue red and green and those lines traced the circle that held us and on into the dark to the men beyond his eyes held sparks of all those colors but it was as if his power grew he began to be that power and not be as much abeloec i could tell that if he were not careful he would become only the lines of power that traced out into the dark earth and sky is a very old dance meredith he said do not fear the power it has waited too long for you to allow you to be harmed now i found my voice in a hoarse whisper look at him yes abeloec said he is the storm come to life i am mortal i thought he smiled but i couldnt be certain i could not see his face clearly though i knew he was only a few feet in front of me in this time and place you are the goddess the earth to meet the strike of the sky does that sound like someone who is merely mortal mistral chose that moment to remind me that he was there he bent over my body and bit me on the back as his body shoved inside me the combination of the two made me push myself tighter against him he bit me harder and i writhed against him trapped between his body and his mouth his mouth let go and he wrapped his arms around me his weight lay along the back of my body in a warm solid line i was supporting most of his weight for his hands played lightly over my breasts and stomach he was inside me but as he had done the first time once he was in he had stopped moving he spoke with his face next to mine it has been too long i will not last if you move like that i turned my head and he was close enough that when the light flashed in his eyes i was blinded for a second i closed my eyes and saw white and black explosions against my eyelids i spoke with my eyes still closed i cant help moving he sighed and didnt so much push himself farther inside me as writhe while he was inside me that made me writhe and drew a sound from him that was half pleasure half protest thunder rolled through the cavern echoing against the bare rock walls like some gigantic drumroll that seemed to thrum across my skin hush meredith quiet if you move i will not last how can i not move with you inside me he hugged me then and said so long since anyone reacted to my body he moved off my back so that he was again on his knees still with his body sheathed inside mine but he pushed his hips against me and let me know that bent over my body he had not been completely sheathed inside me because now the tip of him found the end of me and i realized he might be too long for this position if the man was too long entering from behind could hurt it didnt hurt yet but it held the promise of it as he pushed gently against the inner limits of my body the thought of what he could do to me was exciting and a little frightening i both wanted to feel him pound himself into me and didnt the thought was exciting but it was one of those pains that worked better in fantasy than real life he pushed the head of himself inside me gentle at first then more firmly as if he were trying to find a way deeper he pushed slow and firm and tight until i made a sound of protest thunder rumbled again and the wind gusted i could smell rain and ozone as if lightning had struck somewhere near though the only lightning had been in mistrals eyes how much do you like pain he asked and his voice held thunder the way that doyles could hold the growl of a dog i thought i knew what he was asking and i hesitated how much do i like pain i decided honesty was safest i gazed back over my body until i could see him and whatever words of caution i was about to utter died in my throat he was something elemental his body still held an outline a solidness but inside that solid line of skin were clouds grey and black and white boiling and writhing the lightning flashed in his eyes again and this time it rode down his body a jagged line of brilliance that filled the world with the metallic smell of ozone but it didnt affect my body like real lightning would have instead it was just a brilliant dance of light his eyes glowed in his face lit by strike after strike of bright white light about every third flash the lightning shot down his body and decorated his skin his hair had come free of its ponytail and that grey sheet of hair danced in the wind of his power like some soft grey blanket trapped on a wash line as the storm thunders closer as many times as id made love to warriors of the sidhe to creatures of faerie the sight of him behind me still stole my words id seen many wonders but nothing quite like mistral he asked again how much do you like pain but as he spoke the lightning flashed the glow filling his mouth and pouring out with his words i said the only thing i could think of finish he smiled and his lips held an edge of that glow finish just finish i nodded yes will you enjoy it i dont know his smile widened and his eyes flashed and that line of light sparkled down his body i was blind for a moment in the brilliance of it he began to draw himself out of me so be it he said in that deep rolling voice thunder echoed him along the roof and for a moment it seemed as if the very walls thrummed with him he shoved himself inside me as fast and hard as he could and he was too long i screamed and it wasnt all pleasure i tried not to but i began to writhe not closer but farther away crawling away from that hard sharp pain he grabbed my hair tight held me in place while he pounded himself into me i screamed and this time it held words finish goddess please finish go just go he jerked me up on my knees using my hair like a lever to press our bodies against each other he was still buried in me but the position was better it was a little less deep and didnt hurt he wrapped his other arm around the front of my body and held me tight against the front of his he tightened the hand in my hair drawing a sound from me that wasnt pain he spoke with his mouth pressed against the side of my face i know that i hurt you before but already your body forgives me so soon and you make pleasure noises for me he jerked my head back with his handful of my hair it did hurt but i liked it anyway i just did you like this he whispered against my face and i felt wind against my face yes i said but not the other he said and the wind buffeted us hard enough that we swayed for a moment i rolled my eyes past him and found the ceiling crawling with clouds clouds that could have been the twins of the ones moving under his skin he jerked my hair again brought me back to his face i thought i would come too soon and now i am taking too long you will not come until the storm does it was abeloecs voice but strangely not mistral loosened his hold on my hair so we could both look at the other man what i saw was eyes that spun with crimson emerald and sapphire as if they were full of liquid jewels his hair was flared out around him but not because the wind pulled it more like the tail of a bird or a cloak held carefully out by some invisible hands the lines of color glowed through that hair and went out into the dark like rope the ropes of glowing color found dark shapes outside our circle of power all the men out there in the dead gardens were covered in those lines i tried to see if they were all right but the thunder rolled through us and it was as if the world itself shook with it mistral shuddered around me inside me and that made me shudder he hugged me tight with both of his strong arms not hurting me for a moment not trying to if taking you from behind is too much then what else is left i have hurt you in front as well i leaned back against his body letting myself rest against him completely if youre strong enough to keep yourself up off my body while we fuck you wont brush the front of me off your body he sounded puzzled i will be facing up you on top but the only thing that touches me is what is inside me now if you are flat i will not be able to get as much inside you ill rise up to meet you then i asked are you am i what he asked and the lightning in his eyes blinded me for a moment strong enough i said with my vision full of bright white spots he laughed then and it was like a low rumble of thunder not just in my ear but along my body as if the sound traveled through his very bones and into mine yes he said yes i am strong enough prove it i said and my voice was a whisper that was almost lost in the sound of wind and thunder he let me move off him and helped me to lie down on what was left of our makeshift blanket if we had been about to make love in standard missionary position then i would have been more concerned about the blanket but if we did this right very little of me would be touching the ground i lay back against the hard dry ground for a moment my knees bent mistral hesitated kneeling between them lightning flashed in his eyes danced down his body so that it looked for a moment as if the jagged bolt went from his eyes and out his leg into the ground i heard a more distant crackle and saw the first lightning bolt dance in the clouds at the ceiling the smell of ozone came faint the scent of close rain was stronger mistral i said now enter me now i will brush against the front of your body he said it will hurt enter me and ill show you he lowered himself to me keeping his arms locked and his body above mine he slid himself inside me and before he was finished i moved up to meet him i raised my upper body in a sort of situp more like an abdominal crunch i couldnt hold the position forever but i could hold it a long time if i put my hands on either side of my thighs and held on it held me simultaneously in position and open wide i watched him push himself inside me by the white moonlight glow of my own skin and the distant flash of lightning that hed released into the clouds above it was almost as if now that the lighting was up there there wasnt so very much inside him he began to pump his body into mine just the long shaft of him in and out of my body while i held myself in a tight little ball and he held the rest of his body above mine i love watching your body move in and out of mine i said he lowered his head so that his hair trailed over me and he could watch his own body work in and out of mine yesss he breathed yesss he started to lose his rhythm and had to look away from the sight of our bodies locked together soon he resumed his long sure strokes thunder pounded the world lightning crackled and smashed into the ground the storm was coming he began to go faster harder smashing himself into me but from this position it didnt hurt from this position it felt wonderful i could feel the beginnings of my own pleasure growing inside me im going to come soon i said and it was almost a yell over the sound of wind and storm not yet he said not yet i wasnt sure if he was talking to me or himself but he suddenly seemed to give himself permission to fuck me as hard as he wanted he drove himself in and out of me with a force that rocked my body ground my ass into the leaves and made me cry out with purest joy lightning began to rain down from the clouds one whitehot bolt after another as if the clouds were screaming and this was as fast as they could throw lightning down upon us the ground shuddered with the beating of the lightning and the roll of the thunder it was as if the lightning was hitting the ground as often as mistrals body hit into mine over and over and over again he rammed inside me and over and over and over again the lightning struck the earth the world smelled metallic with ozone and every hair stood to attention with the electric dance of it he brought me screaming fingers digging into my own thighs holding my place holding my place while the orgasm shook me took me and my body spasmed around his my screams were lost in the violence of the storm but i heard mistral cry out above me a second before his body thrust inside mine one last time he came inside me and the lightning struck the earth like a huge white hand i was blinded with white light i dug my nails into my thighs to remind myself where i was and what i was doing i wanted his release to be everything he wished but finally i had to collapse to the ground had to let my legs unbend i lay on the dry ground panting trying to relearn how to breathe he collapsed on top of me still inside my body his heart was beating so fast that it felt as if it would spill out his body and touch me rain began to fall gently his first words were breathless am i hurting you i tried to raise my arm to touch him but still couldnt move nothing hurts right now i said he let out his breath in a long sigh good his heart began to slow as the rain fell harder i turned my face to the side so the drops wouldnt be hitting me full on id thought the weather inside the cavern would stop with mistrals orgasm but though the storm had ended there was still a sky above us a cloudy rainy sky it had not rained underground in faerie for at least four hundred years we had a sky and rain and we were still underground it was impossible but the rain on my face was warm a spring rain something gentle to coax the flowers out he raised himself up enough to pull himself out of my body and lie by my side i felt moisture on his face and thought at first that it was rain then i realized it was tears had the rain come because he cried or did one thing have nothing to do with the other i did not know i only knew that he cried and i held out my arms to him he buried his face against my breasts and wept chapter abeloec mistral and i got to our feet in the soft spring rain it took me a moment to realize that there was light now not the colored shine of magic but a dim pale light as if there were a moon somewhere up near the stone roof of the cavern i couldnt see the ceiling anymore it was lost in a soft mist of clouds where the stone had been sky someone whispered theres sky above us i turned to look at the other men who had been held outside the glowing circle of abeloecs magic i turned to find out who had spoken but the moment i saw the others i didnt care i didnt even care that it was raining or that there was sky or some phantom moon all i could think was that we were missing people a lot of people frost and rhys were white shadows in the dimness and doyle a darker presence by their side doyle where are the others it was rhys who answered the garden took them what does that mean i asked i took a step toward them but mistral held me back until we find out what is happening we cannot risk you princess he is right doyle said he walked toward us gliding graceful and nude but there was something in the way he moved that said the fight wasnt over he moved as if he expected the ground itself to open up and attack just watching him move like that scared me something was horribly wrong stay with mistral and abe frost with merry rhys with me i thought someone would argue with him but they didnt they followed him as they had followed him for a thousand years my pulse was thudding in my throat and i didnt understand what was happening but i was almost certain in that moment that the men would never obey me as they obeyed him i understood as he stalked over the softening ground with rhys like a small pale shadow at his side why my aunt andais had never made love to doyle never given him a chance to fill her belly with child she did not share power and doyle was a man whom other men followed he had the stuff of kings in him i had known that but i hadnt been certain until this second that the other men knew it too maybe not in the front of their heads but in the very bones of their bodies they understood what he was what he could be he and rhys moved toward a fringe of tall trees their branches stark and dead against the soft rainy twilight doyle was looking up into the trees as if he saw something in the empty branches what is that mistral asked i dont see abe began then i heard his breath draw in sharp what what is it i asked aisling i think frost whispered i glanced at frost i could remember some of the other men who had been touching the trees adair for example had climbed a tree i remembered seeing him up in the branches in the middle of all the sex and magic but i didnt remember seeing aisling after the magic hit us i saw adair climbing a tree but i dont remember aisling i said he vanished once we entered the garden frost said i thought he had been left behind in the room with barinthus and the others i said no he was not left behind mistral said i cant see what doyle is looking at you may not wish to abe said i know i dont dont treat me like a child what do you see whats happened to aisling i pulled away from mistral but he and abe were still between me and the line of trees move aside i said they glanced at each other but didnt move they would not obey me as they obeyed doyle i am princess meredith nicessus wielder of the hand of flesh and blood you are royal guards but not royal dont let the sex go to your heads gentlemen move do as she says frost said they glanced at each other but then parted so i could see unlike frost doyle would have known not to help me because now they werent obeying me they were obeying frost but that was a problem for another night this night this night i wanted to see what everyone else had already seen there was a pale shape hanging from the tallest branch of the tallest tree i thought at first that aisling was hanging by his hands dangling from the branch on purpose then i realized that his hands were by his sides he was dangling from the branch yes but not by his hands the rain started to fall harder the branch i whispered its pierced his chest yes mistral said i swallowed hard enough that it hurt there werent many things that could bring death to the high court of faerie there were tales of the immortal sidhe standing up after a beheading still alive but there were no stories about living on after your heart was gone some of the other guards hadnt wanted aisling to sleep in the bedroom with us feeling he was too dangerous to look upon his face had once been to fall instantly hopelessly in love with him even goddesses and some gods had fallen to his power once or so the old stories said so he had voluntarily kept most of his clothes on including the gauzy veil that he wore wrapped around his face only his eyes were left bare he was a man so beautiful that all who saw him loved him i had ordered him to use that power on one of our enemies she had tried to kill galen and almost succeeded but i hadnt understood what i asked of him or what i condemned her to see she had given us information but she had also clawed out her own eyes so she would no longer be under his power he had been afraid to even take off his shirt in front of me for fear that i was too mortal to look upon his flesh let alone his face i hadnt been bespelled but staring at the pale form hanging lifeless lost to twilight and rain i remembered him i remembered his skin golden golden as if someone had shaken gold dust across his pale perfect body he had sparkled in the light not just with magic but the way a jewel catches the light he had glittered with the beauty of what he was now he hung in the rain dead or dying and i had no idea why chapter the ground was soft under our feet as we walked toward aislings body the sharp dry vegetation had melted into the softening earth much more of this downpour and it would be mud i had to shield my eyes with my hand to gaze up at the body in the tree body just a body i was already distancing myself from him already i was making that mental switch that had allowed me to work murder cases in los angeles body it not he and absolutely not aisling the it hung there with a black branch thicker than my arm sticking out through the chest there had to be two feet worth of branch on this side of the body such force it would have taken to pierce the chest of any man like that a warrior of the unseelie court a nearly immortal being once worshipped as a god such beings do not die easily he hadnt even cried outor had he had he cried his death on the air and i been deaf to it had my screams of pleasure drowned out his cries of despair no no i had to stop thinking like that or i would run screaming is he abe began none of the men answered him or finished his sentence we all stared up wordless as if by not saying it wed keep it from being true he hung so limp like a broken puppet but thick and meaty and more real than any doll he was utterly still and limp in that heavylimbed way that not even the deepest sleep can duplicate i spoke into that rainsoaked silence dead and that one word seemed louder than it actually was how why abe asked the how is pretty apparent rhys said the why is a mystery i looked away from what hung in the tree out into the twilight of the gardens i wasnt looking away from aisling but rather looking for the others i tried to ignore the tightness of my throat the speeding of my pulse i tried not to finish the thought that had made me turn and search the dimness were there other men dead or dying in the dimness who else was pierced through by some magical tree there was nothing to see but the dead branches stretching naked toward the clouds none of the other trees held a gruesome trophy the tightness in my chest eased when i was sure that all the trees were empty except this one i barely knew aisling he had never been my lover and had only been one of my guards for a day i was sorry for the loss of him but there were others among my guards that i cared about more and they were still missing i was happy they werent decorating the trees but that left me wondering what else might have become of them where were they doyle spoke so close to me that i jumped i do not see any of the others in the trees i shook my head no no i looked for frost he stood close but not close enough to hold me i wanted to be comforted by one of them but it was a childs wish a childs wish for lies in the dark that the monster isnt under the bed i had grown up in a world where the monsters were very real you were holding galen and nicca was with you i said what happened to them frost brushed his sodden hair from his face the silver looking as grey as mistrals in the dim light galen was swallowed up by the ground his eyes showed pain i could not hold on to him it was as if some great force wrenched him away i was suddenly cold and the warm rain wasnt enough to keep it at bay i said when amatheon did the same thing in my vision he went willingly he just sank into the mud there was no wrenching force i can only report what happened princess his voice had gone sullen if he thought id criticized him then so be it i didnt have time to hold his hand that was vision mistral said sometimes on this side of the veil its not so gentle whats not so gentle i asked being consumed by your power he said i shook my head wiping impatiently at the rain on my face i was beginning to be irritated the miracle of it raining in the dead gardens wasnt enough to calm the cold fear i wish this rain would let up i said without thinking angry and afraid and the rain was something i could be angry at without hurting its feelings the rain slackened it went from a downpour to a light drizzle my pulse was in my throat again but not for the same reason it was a miracle that there was rain here and i hadnt meant to make it go away doyle touched my mouth with a callused fingertip hush meredith do not destroy the blessing of this rain i nodded to let him know i understood he took his finger away slowly i forgot that the sithen listens to everything i say i swallowed hard enough that it hurt i dont want the rain to stop we stood there everyone tense waiting yes aisling was dead and many more missing but the dead gardens had been the heart of our faerie mound once and were more important than any one life they had been the heart of our power when this place had died our power had begun to die i saw with relief that the warm spring drizzle kept falling slowly we all let out a breath be careful what you say princess mistral whispered i just nodded nicca stood up staring at his hands frost said as if id asked he reached out to me but before i could touch him he vanished vanished how abe asked just vanished as if he became air he was taken by his sphere of influence mistral said what does that mean i asked air earth i shook my hands at him as if waving away smoke between us i dont understand hawthorne was engulfed by the trunk of that tree over there rhys said he pointed to a large greyishbarked tree he didnt fight it he went smiling id bet almost anything that if we could identity it it would be a hawthorn tree galen and nicca did not go smiling frost said they have never been worshipped as deities doyle said so they do not know to relax into the power if you fight it it will fight back if you let it take you then it is more gentle i know that once upon a time some of the sidhe could travel through ground trees the air but forgive me guys that was a thousand years before i was born a thousand years before galen was born nicca is older but he was always too weak to be a god that may have changed abe said just as abes power returned doyle said abe nodded once so long ago that i dont want to remember i didnt just make queens i made goddesses what are you saying i asked he brought the horn cup in front of him the greeks believed in it too princess that the drink of the gods could make you immortal could make you a god but they didnt drink from it the drinking is he seemed to search for a word more metaphorical at times it was my power and medbs that gave the gods and goddesses of our pantheon their marks of power the colored lines princess they paint the skin rhys looked down at his arm where there had been that one faint fish now there were two one swimming down another swimming upward it formed a circle like a fish version of yin and yang the blue lines werent faint now they were bright clear blue deeper than a summer sky rhyss curls had been plastered flat by the rain so the face he turned to us seemed startled and unfinished you bear both marks now doyle said with his hair in a tight braid he looked as he always looked he stood in the middle of all the disarray like some dark rock i might cling to rhys looked up at him it cant be that easy try he said try what i asked the men were all exchanging some knowledge from look to look i didnt understand rhys was a deity of death frost said i know that he was cromm cruach dont you remember the story he told you doyle asked in that moment i couldnt remember all i could think was that galen and nicca might be dead or hurting and it was somehow my fault once i brought more than just death merry rhys said still gazing down at his arm with its new mark my mind started working finally celtic death deities are also healing deities according to legend i said according to legend rhys said he gazed up at aisling try doyle said to rhys again i looked at rhys are you saying you can bring him back from the dead the last time i had both symbols on my arm i could he looked at me and there was such pain on his face i remembered what he had told me now once his followers had worshipped him by cutting and hurting themselves sacrificing their blood and pain but he had been able to heal them then he lost the ability to heal and his followers thought he was displeased they decided he wanted the deaths of others and they began the sacrifices he had slaughtered them all to stop the atrocities slain his own people to save the rest he had never lost the ability to kill small creatures with a touch in los angeles hed recovered the ability to kill other faerie creatures with a touch and a word hed killed a goblin that way at least rhys gazed up at aislings still form ill try he handed his weapons to doyle and frost then touched the tree he seemed to wait a moment to see what the tree would do for the first time i realized that he was wondering if the tree would kill him too that hadnt occurred to me is it safe for rhys to do this i asked rhys looked back at me he grinned if i were taller i wouldnt have to climb i mean it rhys i dont want to trade you for aisling and i really dont want two of you hanging up there if i really thought you loved me i might not chance it rhys its all right merry i know where i stand he turned to the tree and started climbing doyle touched my shoulder you cannot love us all equally there is no dishonor in that i nodded and believed him but it still hurt my heart rhys looked like some white phantom against the blackness of the tree he was right underneath where aisling hung he was just about to reach out toward him when magic crawled across my skin stopped my breath in my throat doyle felt it too and yelled wait dont touch him rhys started climbing back down the tree sliding on the rainslicked bark rhys hurry i screamed the air around aislings body shimmered like a heat haze then exploded not in a rain of flesh and blood and bone but in a cloud of birds tiny birds smaller more delicate than sparrows dozens of songbirds flew over our heads we all fell to the ground guarding our heads frost put his body over mine protecting me from the fluttering twittering mob the birds looked charming but looks can be deceiving when frost raised up enough for me to see clearly again the birds had vanished into the dimness of the trees i stretched upward trying to see is the cavern wall farther away than it was i asked yes doyle said the forest stretches for miles now mistral said and his voice held awe they call it the dead gardens not the dead forest i said it was both once doyle said softly rhys explained this was a world at one time merry a whole underground world there were forests and streams and lakes and wonders to behold but it whittled down as our power was whittled away until at the end it was just what you saw when we entered a bare patch where a flower garden once grew surrounded by a fringe of dead trees he motioned toward the spreading trees the last time i saw anything like this inside any faerie mound was centuries ago abe hugged me from behind it startled me and i tensed he started to pull away from me but i patted his arm and said you startled me thats all he hesitated then hugged me close youve done this princess i turned enough to see his face he was smiling i think you helped too i said and mistral doyle added his deep voice tried for neutral and almost made it as much as it hurt him to say those words hed been convinced that the queens ring which now sat on my hand had chosen mistral for my king only later had i been able to convince him it wasnt so much mistral as the fact that he was simply the first sex id had inside faerie while wearing the ring doyle had accepted that but now he seemed to be wondering again doyle i said he shook his head at me for miracles such as this what is one persons happiness princess id almost broken him of calling me princess i had finally been meredith or merry to him but no longer apparently i touched his arm he pulled away from my touch gently but firmly you give up too easily my friend frost said there is sky above us frost doyle motioned outward with the gun in his hand there is forest to walk through he raised his face upward and let the warm rain fall on his closed eyes it rains inside the sithen once more doyle opened his eyes and looked at frost grabbing his arm dark against light how clear do you need your messages to be frost it seems that mistral did this i will not give up my hope darkness i will not lose it when it is so freshly won you should not either ive missed something rhys said doyle shook his head you have missed nothing now thats too close to a lie and we never lie said rhys i will not discuss this with you here doyle said he looked past rhys to mistrals tall figure it was a small look but enough to tell me of his jealousy look to your own power darkness abe said enough said doyle we must tell the queen what has happened look at your chest darkness abe said doyle frowned at him then looked down my gaze followed his it was hard to see against the black of his skin and in the uncertain light butthere are lines on your skin red lines i moved closer trying to decipher what abes power had drawn on doyles skin i started to reach out to trace the lines on his chest doyle moved out of reach i cannot bear much more princess your body is painted with your symbol again abe said it is not just mistral who is returning but it is he who is returning faerie to itself doyle said and i was ready to stand in the way of it for my heart would not let me lose this fight but that was before this wonder of the dead gardens come back to life and my sign of power returning i have served this court century after century as we lost all that we were how could i do less than serve the court as we begin to win back what was lost either my oath to serve means something or it never meant anything at all either i can do this for the good of our people or i have never been the queens darkness i either do this or i am nothing do you not see that abe went to him touched his arm i hear you so honorable darkness but i tell you that this power is a generous thing goddess is a generous goddess god is a generous god they do not give with one hand and take with the other they are not so cruel i have found their service most cruel nay you have found andaiss service cruel abe said voice soft a bird twittered out in the twilight woods a sound of settling in for the night sleepy and questioning a voice came out of the dimness i thought you a drunken fool abeloec but now i realize that it wasnt the drink making you so its simply your natural state we all whirled toward the voice queen andais stepped from the far wall where she had emerged earlier we had been more than careless not to realize she might come back abe dropped to one knee in the mud i meant no offense my queen yes you did she walked only a little way toward us then stopped grimacing i am happy to see the rain and clouds but the mud i could have done without we are sorry that you are displeased my queen mistral said the apology would sound better if you were on your knees she said mistral dropped to his knees in the mud beside abe their hair was too long wet and heavy it trailed into the mud i didnt like seeing them like that it made me afraid for them she waded through the now ankledeep mud until she could have touched them but she walked past instead she reached out to trace her fingers across doyles chest puppy dogs she said smiling doyle stood impassive under the caress of her hand though andais had made a torture of caresses she would tease and torment then deny them release shed made a game of it for centuries she touched frosts arm your tree is dark against your skin now she moved to rhys touching the dual fish she moved to me and i fought not to cringe away from her she put her hand on my stomach where the exact imprint of a moth stood like the worlds most perfect tattoo a few hours ago this moth fluttered struggling to escape your skin i looked down at where she touched hoping she wouldnt go lower she didnt like me but she might touch my intimate parts because she knew i loathed her sex and hatred always mixed well for my aunt my guards told me that it would become like a tattoo did they tell you what it was a mark of power she shook her head the others have the outline of a creature or an image but your moth looks real it is more like a photograph imprinted on your skin that is not something that abeloecs magic can give you this she pressed hard against my stomach means you can mark others it means that those you mark are lesser powers flocking to the warmth of your fire she curled her arm around my waist and pressed my body against the black robe of hers she whispered against my ear the men dont like this no they dont they dont like me touching you not one she licked the edge of my ear little she licked down the curve of my neck bit she bit me hard and sudden not to draw blood but to make me jerk she drew her head up and said quietly i thought you liked pain meredith not straight out of the box no thats not what i heard she let me go and walked around the group of us where are all the other men who vanished from the bedroom with you the garden has taken them doyle said taken them how taken them into tree and flower and ground he said not meeting her eyes as amatheon rose from the dirt will they return to us or was their death the price for this miracle she whispered it but her voice seemed to echo we dont know doyle said a bird began to sing again a high trilling cascade of music fell from the sky dancing over us and as if sound could be touch it wrapped us around in something beautiful something just out of sight it seemed a reminder that the dawn would come and death would not be forever it was the sound of hope that comes each spring to let you know that winter will not last and the land is not dead i could not help but smile mistral and abe raised their faces upward as if turning gratefully into a spill of warm sunshine andais began to back away as the last sweet note fell upon the air she backed toward the part of the wall that still held darkness as if the magics return could not touch it you will make of the unseelie court a pale imitation of the golden court that your uncle rules meredith you will fill the darkness that is our purpose with light and music and we will die as a people once there were many courts abeloec said some dark some light but all faerie we did not divide ourselves into good and bad as the christians do for their religion we were everything at once as we were meant to be andais did not bother to respond instead she simply said you have brought life to the dead gardens i will not try to pixie on my promise come to the hallway of mortality and save neryss people if you can bring that bright seelie magic into the other heart of the unseelie court and see how long it survives with that she was gone we waited for a few heartbeats then mistral and abe stood mud coating their lower legs no voice from the dark told them to get back on their knees i let out a breath i hadnt realized i was holding what did she mean when she said that our court has two hearts i asked abe answered once every faerie mound had a garden or forest or lake at its heart but every court also had another heart of power one that would reflect the kind of magic the court specialized in you have brought one heart back to life mistral said but i am not certain it is wise to reawaken the other the hallway is a torture chamber where most magic does not work its a null place i said but once meredith it was more i looked at the men more how things that were older than faerie older than us were imprisoned there remnants of power from the peoples we had defeated im not sure i understand mistral he looked at doyle help me explain this once there were creatures in the hallway of mortality that could bring true death to even the sidhe they were kept there to serve as methods of execution or torture or simply the threat of those things the queen did not care for them because as you well know she likes to do her own torturing watching some other being tear us limb from limb was not half so amusing to her as doing it herself and we healed better if she did it rhys said doyle nodded yes she could torture us longer and more often if the things did not help what kind of things i asked i didnt like how serious theyd gotten terrible things a glimpse of them would drive a mortal mad he said how long ago did these things vanish from the sithen a thousand years maybe more he said the forests havent been gone so long as that i said no not quite that long why are you all so worried because if you or the goddesss power through you can bring this about abe said motioning at the everexpanding forest then we must prepare for the fact that the second heart of our court can come back to full life as well perhaps merry is too seelie to bring back such horrors mistral said almost hopefully her two hands of power are flesh and blood doyle said those are not seelie magicks i came to the princess for aid for neryss people but i would not risk her now not for a house full of traitors said mistral if we save them they wont be traitors i said they still believe that your mortality is contagious rhys said they still think that if you sit on the throne we will all begin to age and die do you think that neryss court still has enough honor to realize that im trying to ensure that their rulers sacrifice wasnt for nothing nerys gave her life so her house would not die and i want that to mean something the men seemed to think about it for a moment finally doyle said they have honor but i do not know if they have gratitude chapter deity magic brought us here rhys said but how do we get out theres no door anymore to the dead gardens meredith frost said i looked at him ask the sithen to give us a door leading out of here do you think it will be that easy rhys said if the sithen wishes merry to save neryss people yes said frost and if it doesnt wish them saved or if it doesnt care frost shrugged if you have a better suggestion i am listening rhys spread his hands as if to say no i looked out at the dark wall and said i need a door that leads out of here the darkness grew less and a door a large golden door appeared in the cave wall i almost said thank you but some of the older magicks dont like to be thanked they take insult from it i swallowed and whispered its a lovely door carving appeared around the door frame vines drawn through the wood as if by an invisible finger thats new rhys whispered let us go through before it decides to vanish frost said he was right he was most certainly right but strangely none of us wanted to pass through the door until the invisible finger had finished drawing its vines only when the wood had stopped moving did doyle touch the golden handle and turn it he led the way into a hallway that was almost as black as his own skin if he stood still hed blend into the background rhys touched the wall we havent had a black corridor like this in the sithen for years its made of the same rock as the queens chamber i whispered id had so many bad experiences in the queens shiny blackwalled room that seeing the sithen turn black like that room frightened me mistral was the last one through the door when he stepped through the door vanished leaving a smooth black wall untouched and unyielding the hallway where mistral and merry had sex is turning to white marble frost said what caused this corridor to change to black i do not know doyle said he was looking up and down the black hallway it has changed too much i do not know where we are in the sithen look at this frost said he was staring up at the wall across from us doyle moved to stand beside him staring at what to me looked like blank wall doyle made a harsh hissing sound meredith call the door back why just do it his voice was quiet but it vibrated with urgency as if he were forcing himself to whisper when what he wanted to do was scream i didnt argue with that tone in his voice i called out i would like a door back into the dead gardens the door appeared again all gold and pale wood and carved vines doyle motioned mistral to take the lead mistral reached for the golden handle a naked sword in his other hand what was happening why were they frightened what had i missed mistral went through with abe behind him me in the middle and rhys and doyle following frost came last but before i passed thorugh the doorway abe stopped and mistrals voice came urgent from inside the dead gardens back go back doyle said we cannot stay here in the black hallway rhys was pressed against my back abe pressed against my front we were frozen between the two captains of the guards each trying to get us moving in the opposite direction we cannot have two captains mistral frost said without a single leader we are indecisive and endangered what is wrong i asked there was a sound from down the hallway a heavy slithering sound that froze my heart in my chest i was afraid i recognized it no i had to be wrong then a second sound came a high chittering sound one that could be mistaken for birds but wasnt oh goddess i whispered forward mistral now or we are lost doyle said it is not our garden beyond the door mistral said the highpitched birdlike sounds were coming closer outpacing the heavy slithering weight the sluagh the nightmares of the unseelie court and a kingdom in their own right moved fast but the nightflyers always moved faster than the rest of the sluagh we were inside the sluaghs hollow hill somehow we had crossed to their sithen if they found us herewe might survive or not do sluagh wait on the other side of the door doyle asked mistral urgently no mistral called back then go now doyle ordered abe stumbled forward as if mistral had moved suddenly out of the way we came through the door in a rush with doyle pushing from behind he was like some kind of elemental force at our backs it put us in a heap on the ground i couldnt see anything but white flesh and i felt the muscled weight of them all around me where are we frost asked rhys moved drawing me to my feet with him doyle mistral and frost were all on alert weapons out searching for something to fight the door had vanished leaving us on the shore of a dark lake lake may have been too strong a word the depression was dry except for a slimy skim of water at the very bottom bones littered the floor of the dying lake and the shore where we stood the bones shone dully in the dim light that fell from the stone ceiling as if the moon had been rubbed into the rock all around the shore the stone walls of the cavern rose steeply up into the gloom surrounded only by a narrow ledge before a steep dropoff into the lake bed call the door again meredith doyle said his dark face still searching the dead land yes and be more specific about our destination this time mistral said abe was still on the ground i heard a sharp intake of breath and glanced over at him his hand was black and shiny in the dim light what are these bones that they could cut sidhe flesh doyle answered him they are the bones of the most magical of the sluagh things so fantastical that when the sluagh began to fade in power there was not enough magic to sustain their lives i clung to rhys and whispered were in the sluaghs dead gardens yes call the door now doyle glanced at me then back to the dim landscape rhys had one arm around me the other hand full of his gun do it merry i need a door to the unseelie sithen on the far side of the dead lake the door appeared well thats inconvenient rhys whispered wryly but he tucked me closer against his body there is room to walk the edge if we are careful mistral said we can make our way between the cavern walls and the lake bed if we pick our way carefully around the bones be very careful abe said he was on his feet now but his left hand and arm were coated with blood he still held the horn cup in his right hand though nothing else hed left all his weapons behind in the bedroom mistral had dressed and rearmed frost was as armed as he had begun the night doyle had only what he had been able to grab no clothes limited how much you could carry frost bind abeloecs wound said doyle then we will start for the door it is not that bad darkness abe said this is a place of power for the sluagh not for us doyle said i would not take the chance that you bleed to death for want of a bandage frost didnt argue but went to the other man with a strip of cloth torn from his own shirt he began to bind abes hand why does everything hurt more sober abe asked things feel better sober too rhys said i looked up at him you say that like you know that for certain ive never seen you drunk i spent most of the fifteen hundreds as drunk as my constitution would let me get youve seen abe working hard at it we dont stay drunk long but i tried goddess knows i tried why then why that century why not he asked making a joke of it but that was what rhys did when he was hiding something frosts arrogance doyles blankness rhyss humor different ways to hide his wound will need a healer frost said but i have done what i can very well said doyle and he began to lead the way around the edge of the lake toward the soft gold shine of the door that had come because i called it why had it appeared all the way across the lake why not beside us like the last two times but then why had it come at all why was the sluaghs sithen as well as the unseelie sithen obeying my wishes the shore was so narrow that doyle had to put his back to the wall and edge along for his shoulders were too broad i actually fit better on the narrow path than the men but even i had to press my naked back to the smooth cave wall the stones werent cold as they would have been in an ordinary cave but strangely warm the lip of shore we inched across was meant for smaller things to travel or perhaps not meant to be walked at all the skeletons littering the shore were those of things that would have swum or crawled but nothing that walked upright the bones looked like the jumbledtogether remains of fish snakes and things that normally didnt have skeletons in the oceans of mortal earth things that looked like squid except that squid did not have internal skeletons we were halfway around that narrow bonestudded shore when the air wavered on its far side next to the door for a moment the air swam and then sholto king of the sluagh lord of that which passes between was standing there chapter sholto was tall muscled handsome and looked every bit a highborn sidhe of the seelie court his long hair was even a pale yellow like winter sunshine with an edge of snow to it his arm was in a sling and as he turned his head to the light a faint darkness like a stain of bruises touched his face kitto had said sholtos own court had attacked him they were afraid that bedding me would make sholto completely sidhe and no longer sluagh enough to be their king four robed figures stood behind him they fanned out some toward the golden door some toward us doyle said king sholto we are not here of our own choice we ask forgiveness for entering your kingdom uninvited i would have dropped to my knees if there had been room but the crumbling edge of black earth was only inches from my feet and my back was plastered against the stone wall there was no room for niceties on this path there was also precious little room for the guards to fight if they attacked us now we were going to lose a blade glimmered from the edge of one of the shorter cloaked guards as he spoke you are nude and nearly weaponless only something desperate would bring you here like this with the princess in tow it is the beginning of their invasion came a female voice from one of the tallest guards i knew that voice it was black agnes sholtos chief bodyguard and chief among his lovers at this court she had tried to kill me once before for jealousys sake sholto turned enough to look at her the movement revealed that wide pale bandages were all he was wearing on his upper body whatever they covered must have been a terrible wound enough agnes enough sholto silenced her rumbling echoes around the cavern the blackrobed figure of agnes that loomed over him glanced at me i had a moment to see the gleam of her eyes in the dark ugliness of her face the nighthags were ugly it was part of what they were one of the shorter robed guards leaned into sholto as if whispering but the echoes that hissed along the cave walls were not human speech the highpitched tittering of a nightflyer was coming from the humansize figure though it couldnt be a nightflyer for it walked upright sholto turned back to us are you saying that your queen sent you here no doyle said princess meredith sholto called we are within our rights to slay your guards and keep you here until your aunt ransoms you back darkness knows this as does the killing frost on the other hand mistral might have let his temper lead him astray and abeloec can turn up anywhere when hes lost in drink cant he segna the figure in the pale yellow cloak spoke in a rough voice aye he were unhappy when he sobered up werent you cup bearer id heard abe called that before as a term of derision but id never understood until tonight it was a reminder of what he had once been a way of rubbing his face in what he had lost you taught me to be more cautious about where i passed out ladies abe said and his voice was his usual casual amused bitter tone the two hags laughed the other guards joined in a chorus of hissing laughter which let me know that whatever the two shorter guards were they were the same kind of creature sholto spoke dont worry darkness the hags didnt help abe break his vow of celibacy for that is a death sentence to all the tearing of white sidhe flesh amuses them almost as much as sex the high twittering voice came faintly again sholto nodded at what it had said ivar makes a good point you are all wet and muddy and that did not happen here in our garden he motioned with his good hand at the caked drying earth and the water trapped feet below us clearly inaccessible i would ask permission to bring the princess off this ledge doyle said no sholto said she is safe enough there answer the question darknessor princessor whoever how did you get wet and muddy i know that it is snowing aboveground do not use that to lie the sidhe never lie mistral said sholto and his guards all laughed the high tittering mixed with the rumbling bassalto of the hags and sholtos open joyous laughter the sidhe never lie spare us that the biggest lie of all said sholto we are not allowed to lie doyle said no but the sidhe version of the truth is so full of holes that it is worse than a lie we the sluagh would prefer a good honest lie to the halftruths that the court we are supposed to belong to feeds us we starve on a diet of near lies so tell us true if you can how came you wet and muddy and here it rained in the dead gardens in our sithen doyle said more lies agnes said i had an idea i swear by my honor i began one of the hags laughed at that but i kept going and the darkness that devours all things that it was raining in the unseelie gardens when we left them id given not just an oath that no sidhe would willingly break because of the curse that went with the breaking but the oath that id demanded of sholto weeks ago when he found me in california hed sworn the oath that he meant me no harm and id believed him the severity of the oath silenced even the nighthags be careful what you say princess sholto said some magicks still live i know what i swore and i know what it means king sholto lord of that which passes between i am wet with the first rain to fall upon the dead gardens in centuries my skin is decorated with soil reborn dry no more how is this possible sholto demanded it is not possible agnes said she pointed one dark muscled arm at the door this is seelie magic not unseelie they conspire together to destroy us i told you the golden court would never have dared if they did not have the full support of the queen of air and darkness she pointed a little dramatically at the shiny door this proves it meredith doyle said softly make the door go away whispering will not make you my friend darkness sholto said i told the princess to make the door go away so that you would understand this is not seelie business agnes turned so suddenly that her hood fell back to reveal the dry black straw of her hair the ruin of her complexion covered in bumps and sores the hags hid their ugliness which was an exception among the sluagh most of them saw every oddity as a mark of beauty or power the hags hid themselves though as did the two shorter guards agnes pointed the long hand with its blacktaloned claws at me she did not conjure this door she is mortal and mortal hand never made this doorway princess if you would doyle said low but clear so that he couldnt be accused of whispering i spoke loudly so theyd hear me and the cave caught the echo of my voice so that it seemed to bounce along the walls i need the door to go away now please there was a moments hesitation as if the door wanted to give me a second to reconsider then when i didnt the door vanished sholtos guards shifted and agnes startled as if something had goosed her mortal flesh cannot control the sithen any sithen i would have agreed with you until a few hours ago i said how did you come here sholto asked i asked for a door to the dead gardens it never occurred to me that any door i could conjure would bring me to your home sholto king sholto agnes corrected me king sholto i said dutifully why would that request bring you to our garden princess meredith sholto asked doyle told me to get us back to the dead gardens i did just that i called a door to the dead gardens but i did not specify which garden and you know the rest sholto stared at me the triple gold of his irises molten metal autumn leaves and pale sunshine made his face beautiful but it did not make the look one bit less intense he stared at me as if he would weigh me with a look this cannot be true agnes said if it was a lie theyd have a better one than this sholto said do you still believe everything that a piece of white sidhe flesh tells you king sholto have you learned nothing from what they did to you agnes asked i wasnt sure what she meant but i guessed it had to do with the bandages he wore silence sholto said but there was something in his face the way he turned that spoke of embarrassment the last time id seen sholto he had hidden behind a mask of arrogance much as frost did whatever mask he had built to hide behind in court seemed to have shredded so that he now had nothing for his emotions to hide behind may we approach you king sholto i asked and my voice was clear but softer the tall elegant arrogant man whom id met in los angeles wasnt the same man who stood before me now shoulders slightly hunched no you may not agnes said in her strangely rich voice most nighthags spoke in a cackling voice as if theyd swallowed gravel sholto turned on her and the movement cost him for he nearly stumbled it seemed to feed his anger i am king here agnes not you me he thumped himself in the upper chest me agnes not you me i am still king here he turned to us the front of his bandages showed fresh blood as if hed torn stitches sholto was half highborn sidhe and half of the sluagh and the sluagh were even harder to injure than the sidhe what could have hurt him this badly bring her onto solid land darkness sholto said doyle led me forward carefully rhyss hand never left my other arm they eased me out onto the broader shoreline the others followed mincing their way onto secure ground doyle took my hand and led me forward very formally toward the waiting sluagh we had to come forward slowly because of the bones wed seen what theyd done to abe and we were both barefoot wed had enough injuries for the night how i hate you princess agnes said sholto spoke without turning around to look at her i am very close to losing my patience with you agnes you dont want that they move like shadow and light so graceful through the bone field that is our garden agnes said and you watch her as if she were food and drink and you were starving the comment made me look up away from the dangerous bones do not do this agnes he said but his face was naked to his need she was right about that look on his face it was more than just lust though it wasnt love either there was pain in his gaze like a man watching something that he knew he could not have and he wanted that thing more than anything else in the world what had laid sholto bare to the eyes of the world what had stripped him to this doyle stopped in a space of ground mostly clear of bones just out of reach of the sluagh or as far out of reach as we would get here the other men had followed a few steps behind us as if doyle had given them some signal that i hadnt seen so they wouldnt crowd sholto and his guards we were in the wrong we had invaded their land not the other way around so we needed to be the more polite i understood that but looking into sholtos face i felt like we had walked into the middle of something that had nothing to do with us i began to kneel and pulled doyle down with me i bowed my head not just to show respect but because i couldnt bear the look on sholtos face anymore i didnt deserve such a look i was wet splattered with mud i must have looked like something the cat dragged in out of the storm yet he stared at me with a desire that was painful to see id already agreed to have sex with him as he was part of the royal guard for the queen as well as a king in his own right he would have me so why did he look at me the way tantalus must have looked in hades you are princess of the unseelie court in line to be queen why do you bow to me sholtos voice tried to be neutral and almost achieved it i spoke still gazing at the ground my hand still resting in doyles we came to your lands accidentally but uninvited it is we who have trespassed we who owe you an apology you are king of the sluagh and though you are a part of the unseelie court you are still a kingdom in your own right i am only a royal princess perhaps heir to a throne that rules over your lands but you sholto you are already a king a king of the dark host itself you and your people are the last great host the last wild hunt they are a wondrous and fearsome thing the people that call you king they and you deserve respect in your own lands from anyone less than another high ruler i heard someone shift behind me as if one of the other guards would have protested some of what i said but doyles hand was peaceful under mine he understood that we were still in danger besides what i said was true there had been a time when the sidhe understood that you respected all the kingdoms in your care not just the ones that were blood of your blood get up get up and do not mock me sholtos words were inexplicably ragefilled i looked up to find that handsome face consumed with anger twisted with it i do not understand i began but he didnt give me time to finish the sentence he strode forward grabbed my hand and jerked me to my feet doyle came with me tightening his grip on my other hand sholtos fingers dug into my upper arm as he pulled me closer and raged inches from my face i did not believe agnes i did not believe that andais would allow such outrage but now i do now i believe it he shook me hard enough to make me stumble only doyles hand kept me from falling i fought to keep my voice even as i said i dont know what you are talking about dont you dont you he let go of me abruptly sending me stumbling back against doyle sholto dug his uninjured hand into the bandages at his chest and stomach tearing at them doyle turned his body so that i was on the other side of him and his body would be between me and whatever was about to happen i didnt argue with him sholto was moody but id never seen him like this did you come so you could see what they did did you want to see it he screamed the last filling the cave with echoes as if the walls themselves screamed back i could see what was under the bandages now sholtos mother had been a noble lady of the unseelie court but his father had been a nightflyer the last time id seen sholtos upper body bare without him wasting magic to make it look smooth and muscled and fully sidhe there had been a nest of tentacles starting a few inches below the breast area to stop just above his groin he had the full set of tentacles that the nightflyers used as arms and legs as well as the tiny suctiontipped tentacles that were secondary sexual organs it had been these little extras that had made me avoid taking him to my bed goddess help me id seen them as a deformity but that wasnt a problem now the skin where the tentacles had been was now just raw red naked flesh whoever had done it hadnt just chopped the tentacles off they had shaved them away along with most of his skin chapter the look on your face meredith you didnt know you really didnt know his voice sounded calmer half relieved half reinjured as if he hadnt expected it i forced myself to look away from the wound and at his face the eyes were too wide his mouth open as if he were panting he looked like he was in shock i found my voice but it was a hoarse whisper i did not know i licked my lips and tried to get hold of myself i was princess meredith nicessus wielder of two hands of power trying to be queen i had to do better than this i was huddled against doyle but pulled myself away if sholto could survive such a wound then the least i could do was not cower in the face of it the highpitched voice came from one of the shorter guards again and sholto spoke as if in response ivar is right the looks on all your faces make it clear none of you knew on the one hand i feel less betrayed on the other what it tells me about the politics at work here says its more dangerous for our court for both our courts i stepped toward him slowly the way youd approach a wounded animal slowly so you dont scare him more who did this i asked the golden court did this you mean the seelie he gave a small nod doyle said only taranis himself might be able to wrest you away from your sluagh no other noble at his court is powerful enough to take you like that sholto looked at doyle a long considering look that is high praise from the queens darkness it is truth the princess said it best the sluagh are the last of the wild hunts the last left in all of faerie you and your people alone still have the wild magic running through your veins it is not a small power king sholto we should have heard the battle even inside our own sithen frost said and there was a question in his voice sholtos eyes flicked to him then away again as if he suddenly found that he didnt want to meet anyones eyes segna the golds voice whined from out of her dirty yellow hood what cannot be taken with force of arms can easily be won with soft flesh sholto didnt tell her to be quiet he actually hung his head so that a sweep of his own pale hair shadowed his face i didnt understand what segna meant but it had clearly hit home for him i would not ask this of you doyle said but if taraniss people have harmed you then it is a direct challenge to our queens authority either he believes we will not retaliate or he believes we are not strong enough to retaliate sholto looked up then now do you understand why i thought queen andais had to know doyle nodded because if she had not given her permission then this attack makes even less sense wars have begun over less mistral said the comment earned him a glance from sholto the last time i saw you you sat in the consorts chair at the feet of princess meredith mistral bowed i was so honored i have sat in the chair and it was an empty honor have you found it so mistral hesitated then said i have found it everything i would hope it to be and more i fought not to glance back at him his voice was so careful i knew he saw something in the king before us that i hadnt seen until now he was desperate to know the touch of another sidhe he wanted to have anothers glow of high magic to match his own it hadnt occurred to me that sholto had been here in his own kingdom pining for me to keep my promise and offer him my body assassination attempts murders and more political machinations than i could keep track of had kept me from fulfilling it but i hadnt meant to ignore sholto i did not mean it to be an empty honor king sholto i said i mean to keep my promise to you now you will bed him now segnas voice again like a grating whine its what the seelie bitch said too that once he healed up shed bed him i stared up at him you allowed someone to do this to you he shook his head never agness voice more cultured more human than her sister hags sholto you have dreamt of being sidhe completely sidhe since you were small do not lie to someone who helped raise you i also wanted the wings of a nightflyer to come out of my back when i was small do you remember that she nodded that head seeming too large for the narrow shoulders you cried when you realized you would never have wings we want many things when we are children i admit that there were times when i wished they were gone he made a motion as if he would touch what was no longer there the way an amputee will try to scratch a ghost limb his hand fell away before it made contact with the raw ruin of his stomach how did they trap you and why did they do this doyle asked i am a king in my own right not just a noble of the queens guard if the seelie did not see me as an unclean thing i could have bedded one of their sidhe women long ago but i am considered a worse crime than a mere unseelie sidhe queen andais calls me her perverse creature and the seelie truly believe that i am a creature a thing an abomination to them sholto i whispered dont princess i have seen you flinch away from me too i moved toward him at first yes but since then i have seen you shining in your power with a play of colors in those extras so that they shone like jewels in the sun i have felt your body thrumming with magic and power your nakedness inside my body i touched his arm he didnt pull away you did not fuck him segna said no but ive held him in my mouth and if you hadnt interrupted that night we might have done more i had not enjoyed sholtos extra bits but once he had started to glow with power his magic responding to my touch i had seen him clearly for a shining moment seen him as handsome and seen that nest of tentacles not as a deformity but just as another part of him i doubted i could have slept in the same bed with him but sexsex had seemed like a good idea in that moment i tried to let him see that in my face now but perhaps it showed because he drew away and began to tell the story of the deception i should have known it was a lie he said lady clarisse offered to meet with me she sent a note saying that she had glimpsed me without my shirt and had not been able to stop fantasizing about it i leapt at the chance not stopping to question i wanted so much to be with another sidhe even if it was for only a night i didnt feel guilty very often few in faerie do but in that moment i knew that if i had taken him to my bed he wouldnt have been vulnerable to the seelies trick or maybe he would have been more vulnerable wed never know i tried to hug him without hurting the front of his body segna reached around and shoved me away do not touch her again sholto snapped at segna and his voice was full of a choking anger now shell cuddle you segna whined now shell touch you because the icky bits are gone now she wants you just like the other sidhe bitch she would have touched me that night in los angeles if you had left us alone he said agnes reached to the other hag and drew her back he is right segna we bear blame in this atrocity too a tear trailed down out of the sickly yellow of agness eye she turned away so i wouldnt see most of faerie cried when we cried and displayed any emotion out in the open it was only when we got close to a throne that we learned to hide what we felt we were meant to be a freer people than this lady clarisse sholto continued took me inside the seelie sithen she led me cloaked through back ways to her room then she told me that although the tentacles fascinated her she also feared them she said she could not bear to have the tentacles touch her while we made love here i was truly a fool i let her tie me up so i would not accidentally brush her with the parts she feared and said she craved he wouldnt meet anyones eyes again i watched his face redden even through the strands of his white hair he burned with embarrassment when i was helpless other sidhe slipped into the room they did to me what you see was their king with them doyle asked sholto shook his head he is not a king who does his own dirty work you know that darkness did the king know doyle said they would not have done this without his knowledge i said they fear him too much but by not being present he has left himself room to deny it sholto said if i could see what he hoped to gain from this i would believe it of him but what does this accomplish some of your people believed that queen andais did this to you allowed it to be done perhaps this atrocity was committed with that as the intent you are her strongest ally king sholto if you had left her side what then doyle asked the only reason for the king to want our queen shorn of her allies is that he means to make war and if any of faerie make war on another our treaty with america is breached we will all be cast out of the last country that would take us in if taranis caused that the rest of faerie would rise up against him and he would be destroyed we knew that taranis had done something almost as bad earlier in the year he had released the nameless a formless being it had been made of the discarded power that all the fey had been forced to shed in order to be allowed to remain in america one of the restrictions placed on us when president jefferson allowed us to immigrate the faerie had done two weirding spells in europe trying to control ourselves enough to live peaceably with the humans but we had done one more here i dont think any of the sidhe understood what we were giving up i was born long after the spell so that i knew our glorious past as stories legends rumors taranis had released that trapped magic tried to use it to kill maeve reed reed was the golden goddess of hollywood and once upon a time the goddess of cinema she had known his secret that he was infertile that the problem of his childlessness wasnt in the long string of wives that he kept replacing it was him and he had suspected it for a hundred years when he cast maeve reed out of faerie for refusing his bed she had done so on the grounds that the last wife hed put aside had gotten pregnant by someone else shed told the king to his face that she thought he was infertile and these many years later hed tried to take his revenge one of the things that prompted queen andais to call me back from exile had been her discovery from human doctors that she was infertile the ruler of a faerie land is the land and if they are not fertile not healthy the land and people die it is a very old magic and a true one if taranis had known about his infertility for a hundred years without revealing it then he had condemned his people to death knowingly they killed rulers for such crimes in faerie you are all entirely too quiet sholto said to us you know something something that i need to know we are not free to discuss it not openly doyle said you will not be allowed to be alone with him agnes said we are not such fools as that i cannot argue with agnes on this sholto said again he made that gesture as if he would stroke the missing bits i have put myself at the mercy of the sidhe once too often of late we cannot tell this tale without our queens permission doyle said it would earn us at the very least a trip to the hallway of mortality i would not ask that of anyone sholto said he lowered his head and a sound escaped him it was almost a sob i wanted to hug him but i didnt want to anger his hags any further besides they were partially right i could touch him now without flinching still i saw it for what it was something cruelly done an amputation i had felt those muscular tentacles on my body just a touch but they had been real and theyd had uses which he now had lost sholto spoke low the seelie said they were doing me a favor that if i healed without the deformity coming back the lady in question would keep her word and bed me for a night in sympathy i started to touch him where the bits had been then stopped because the wound was bleeding and raw and touching it must hurt but the tentacles are part of you it is like cutting off an arm or worse do you know how often i have dreamt of looking like them he motioned at the men at my back agnes is right i have dreamt of looking fully sidhe for so long and now it is as you say i have lost pieces of myself i have lost arms and more the queen does not know this doyle said are you certain of that darkness beyond doubt doyle started to simply say yes then stopped himself no i am not certain but she has not told us otherwise nor have rumors to the contrary touched our court wars have begun over less than this darkness wars between the courts of faerie doyle nodded i know agnes says that andais had to have given taranis her approval even if just tacitly or taranis would not have risked it do you think my hag is right do you think the queen allowed this to happen the sluagh are too important to the queen king sholto i cannot imagine a set of circumstances in which andais would risk such hurt to the sluaghs vows to her court i think it more likely that this was done at least partially in a bid to strip our queen of your might why didnt you tell the queen the court i thought she must know that she must have given permission i agreed with the hags i did not think even taranis would dare to do this without andaiss knowledge i cannot argue your reasoning but i do not believe she knows doyle said why didnt you tell me sholto i asked you once said to me that only the two of us understand what it is like to be almost sidhe almost tall enough slender enough almost but not quite pure enough to be accepted he almost smiled almost we may have had that in common but as i told you in los angeles no man had ever complained about your body only envious women i smiled at him about my breasts you were right that earned me a smile in return which given that awful wound made me breathe more easily but i am too short too human looking for most of the sidhe male or female to let me forget it i told you then they were fools sholto said he took my hand in his and raised it up for a kiss but when he tried to bend over me the pain stopped him in midmotion i pressed his hand to my cheek sholto oh sholto i had hoped to hear tenderness in your voice but not for this reason dont pity me meredith i could not bear it i didnt know how to respond i just held his hand against my face and tried to think of anything i could say that wouldnt make him feel worse how could i not feel pity when did this happen king sholto doyle asked sholto looked past me to the other man two days ago just before your second press conference the one during which two murders were committed rhys said sholto looked at him you caught your murderer though the human police dont know it yet i hear youre trying to let him heal from the torture before showing him to the human police our queen made a mess of him rhys said he is guilty sholto made it a question we believe so doyle said but you are not certain what was done to your stomach queen andais did to every inch of lord gwennin sholto winced and nodded one would do much to stop such pain even confess to something you did not do doyle said i looked at doyle then do you think gwennin is innocent no nor do i believe he acted completely alone andais was using his own intestines as a leash on him meredith he would have been a fool not to confess sholto pressed my hand to his face segna tried to interfere but agnes stopped her and the other two guards moved between sholto and the hags i caught a glimpse of one of the guards faces oblong eyes full of nothing but color thin lipless mouth and a face that was a strange mix of humanoid and nightflyer they were like sholto but no one would have ever have mistaken them for sidhe the eyes though the eyes were goblin eyes the guard stared at me with his face that looked only half formed the nostrils mere slits i did not look away i stared memorized his face for i had never seen another quite like it you do not find me ugly the guards voice held that edge of twittering almost birdlike but deeper no i said do you know what i am the eyes are goblin blood but the face is nightflyer im not sure about the rest i said i am halfgoblin and halfnightflyer ivar and fyfe are my uncles on my fathers side sholto said the second guard spoke for the first time his voice was deeper more human he gave me the full gaze of his face his eyes were the same oblongs of color a deep rich blue but he had more nose more lower jaw if hed been taller he might have passed for a goblin but the skin wasnt quite the right texture i am fyfe brother to ivar he gave the hags an unfriendly look our king felt the need of some male guards who were not conflicted about what to do with his body we guard it and that is all this insult was not for lack of our ability to guard agnes said you too will be helpless when he chases his next bit of sidhe flesh he wont want an audience and he will go with her alone enough agnes enough all of you sholto pressed my hand tighter against his face why didnt i tell you princess how could i admit that seelie did this to me that i was not warrior enough to save myself that i fell into their trap because they offered me what you had promised agnes is right in one thing i am near blinded by my desire to be with another sidhe so blinded that i let a seelie woman bind me so blinded i believed her lie that she was fascinated with my bits but afraid of them too he shook his head i am king of the sluagh and even bound i should have had enough magic to save myself from this he let go of me stepped back the seelie have magic that we do not frost said the sluagh have magic that the seelie have never possessed i said i touched sholtos arm he flinched but didnt pull away i squeezed his arm and wanted so badly to hold him to try to chase this pain away i rested my head against his bare arm my throat closed up and i was suddenly choking on tears i began to weep clutching at his arm i couldnt stop he pulled me away from him enough to see my face you waste tears on me why i had to struggle to speak you are beautiful sholto you are dont let them make you think otherwise beautiful now that hes butchered segna said looming over us pushing her way past the uncles i shook my head you broke in on us in los angeles you saw what i was doing with him why would i have been doing those things if he was less than beautiful to me all i remember from that night white flesh is that you killed my sister i had but by accident that night in fear for my life i had lashed out with magic i hadnt known i had it had been the first night that my hand of flesh had manifested it was a terrible power the ability to turn living beings inside out but they did not die they lived on impossibly on with their mouths lost inside a ball of flesh and still they screamed id had to cut her to bits with a magical weapon to finally end her agony i dont know what shadows showed on my face but sholto reached for me reached for me to hold me to give comfort and it was too much for segna she shoved the other two guards away as if they were straw before a storm wind she struck at me shrieking her rage suddenly there was movement behind me and in front of me all the guards moved at once but sholto was closest he used his own body to shield me so segnas razor claws sliced his own white skin he took the brunt of the blow meant for me and even what was left of that strike staggered me backward numbing my arm from shoulder to elbow it didnt hurt because i couldnt feel it sholto pushed me into doyles arms and pivoted in the same movement the movement was so fast that it surprised segna made her stumble nearer the edge of the lake sholtos good arm was a pale blur as he smashed into her the blow sent her over the edge she seemed to hang there in midair her nearly naked body revealed by the wings of her cape then she fell chapter she lay just above the low water impaled on a series of spiked bones jutting out of her from throat to stomach she hung there caught bleeding like a fish caught on some terrible hook i think sholtos guards expected her to simply draw herself off the spined ridge of the boned creature agnes especially seemed to be waiting patient unworried come on segna get up her voice was impatient segna lay there and bled her legs flailing exposing her most intimate parts as she struggled the hags wore a leather belt from which hung a sword and a pouch but that and their cloaks were all her body was both larger than a humans and more wizened as if she were a shrunken giant i saw the wide eyes the fright on her face she wasnt going to just get up sometimes being mortal i recognized real damage faster because on a visceral level i knew it was a possibility creatures who are immortal or nearly so dont understand the disasters that could befall them ivar fyfe go to her with due respect king sholto fyfe said i would stay here and send agnes down sholto started to argue but ivar joined the argument we do not dare leave agnes up here with you alone the princess will have guards but you will be unprotected agnes would not hurt me sholto said but he was staring at segna as if he were finally realizing just how bad it might be we are your guards and your uncles we would be poor at both duties if we left you alone with agnes now ivar said in his birdlike voice people always expected the nightflyers to have hissing ugly voices but ivar sounded like a songbird or how a songbird might sound if it could speak as humans do most of the nightflyers sounded like that segna is a nighthag agnes said a mere bone will not bring her down i tripped on such a bone coming into your garden abe said and raised his clothwrapped arm at her blood had soaked through much of the cloth the bones hold old magic doyle said some of them are things that hunted the sidhe and the other sluagh before they were tamed by your early kings do not lecture me about my own people agnes said i remember a time when black agnes was not a part of the sluagh rhys said softly she glared at him and i remember a time when you had other names white knight she spat in his direction we have both fallen far from what we once were go with ivar agnes go see to your sister sholto said she glared at him do you not trust me i once trusted the three of you more than any other but you bloodied me before the seelie got hold of me you cut me up first because you sought to betray us with some whitefleshed slut i am king here or i am not agnes you either obey me or you do not you will go down with ivar to help segna or i will see it as a direct challenge to my authority you are gravely wounded sholto said the hag you cannot win against me in this weakened state it is not about winning agnes it is about being king either i am your king or i am not if i am your king then you will do as i say do not do this sholto she whispered you raised me to be king agnes you told me that if the sluagh do not respect my threat then i will not be king for long i did not mean go with ivar now or it ends between us she reached out to him as if to touch his hair he jerked back and yelled now agnes go now or it will end badly between us fyfe threw back his cloak revealing his weapons and each of his hands touched a sword hilt ready for a crossdraw agnes gave sholto one last look that was more despair than anger then she followed ivar down the steep slope of the lake using her claws to dig into the soil so she wouldnt slide into the bones that spiked the earth ivar was already wading through the still water it came above his waist which meant the water was deeper than it had looked he had to strain to lay a hand over segnas heart between the hanging weight of her breasts he turned that lipless unfinished face to look at sholto and the look did not communicate good news agnes was taller than ivar and had an easier time in the water it came only to her thighs she waded to the other hag and when she reached her let out a wail of despair sholto collapsed to his knees on the side of the lake segna he said and there was real grief in his voice i knelt beside him touched his arm he jerked away every time i am with you someone i care about dies meredith ivar called up i am not certain she is dying gravely injured she may yet live agnes was petting her sisters face but i could see the gaping mouth the labored breathing blood bubbled from the chest wound when she breathed poured down her mouth it would have been death to most can she survive it i asked softly i do not know sholto said once it would not have been a killing blow but we have lost much of what we were abeloecs wound from the bones is still bleeding doyle said sholtos head drooped hiding his face in a curtain of that white hair i was close enough to hear him crying though so softly that i doubted anyone else would hear it i pretended not to notice as was only respectful for a king segna reached out to him she spoke in a voice thick and bubbling with her own blood my lord mercy he raised his face but kept his hair like a shield on either side so only i kneeling beside him could see the tracks of tears on his face his voice came clear and unemotional you would never have known the pain in his eyes from that voice do you ask for healing or for death segna healing she managed to say he shook his head get her off the bones he looked at fyfe go help them fyfe hesitated for a moment then slid carefully down the slope to join his brother in the still thick water the three of them managed to slide segna free of most of the bones one of them seemed caught on segnas own ribs and agnes snapped that spine so that they could lower her into their arms she was writhing in pain and coughing blood agnes raised a tearstained face we are not the people we once were king sholto she dies segna reached a shaking hand out to him mercy we cannot save you segna i am sorry said sholto for it now seemed clear that this was the case mercy she said again agnes said there is more than one kind of mercy sholto would you leave her to a slow death her voice managed to be both tearchoked and hot with hatred such words should burn coming out sholto shook his head ivars highpitched voice came it is your kill sholto their kill the kings and the princesss agnes said giving me a look of such venom that i fought not to flinch if a look could still kill among us i would have died from that look in her eyes she spat into the water she did not strike the blow i did sholto said as he came to his feet he actually stumbled and i caught him helped him stand he didnt jerk away which let me know he was badly hurt i could see the bleeding wound that segna had made but i didnt think it was that wound that made me him stumble nor was it the amputation that weakened him now there are wounds that never show on the body that are deeper and more hurtful than anything that bleeds my apologies sholto but the hag is right ivars high voice said reluctantly segna bled you both if the princess was not a warrior then she would be free of this but she is a sidhe of the unseelie court and all who claim that are warriors the princess has killed more than once in challenge fyfe said if she will not help finish segna then she will never be acknowledged as queen of the sluagh agnes said she stroked segnas face a surprisingly gentle gesture given her daggerlike talons i heard doyle sigh he moved close enough to whisper to me if you do not help make this kill agnes will spread the rumor that you are not a warrior and that would mean what i whispered back it could mean that when you sit on the throne of the unseelie court the sluagh will not come to your call for they are a warrior people they will not be led by someone who is unbloodied in battle ive been bloodied i said the numbness was sliding away and now the pain was sharp and tearing the wound was bleeding freely what i needed was to get medical attention not to wade around in slimy water ill need a dose of antibiotics after this what doyle and sholto both asked im mortal unlike the rest of you i can get an infection blood poisoning so after we crawl around in that water ill need antibiotics you can truly catch all that sholto asked ive had the flu and my father made sure i had all my childhood immunizations he wasnt sure how much i could withstand or heal sholto gazed at me studying my face you are fragile i nodded yes i am by the standards of faerie i looked up at doyle you know there are times when im not sure i want to be in charge here do you mean that if there was a better alternative than my cousin yes i mean it im tired doyle tired as much as i wanted to come back home to faerie im beginning to miss la almost as much to put some distance between me and all this killing i told you once meredith that if i could bear to give the court to cel i would leave with you darkness mistral said you cannot mean that you have not been outside faerie except for small trips you have not seen that there are wonders outside our hills he touched my face there are some wonders that will not fade when we leave here he had told me that he would give up everything and follow me into exile frost and he both when they first thought that the queens ring a relic of power had chosen mistral as my king doyle had broken down and said he could not bear it to watch me with another he had pulled himself together and remembered his duty as id remembered mine wouldbe queens and kings did not run away and hide and give their countries over to insane tyrants like my cousin cel he was crazier than his mother andais i stared up into doyles face and i wanted him wanted to run away with him frost came up beside us i gazed at my two men i wanted to wrap them around me like a blanket i did not want to climb down into that stinking hole and wade through razorsharp bones and dirty water to kill someone i hadnt meant to even hurt i dont want this kill it must be your choice doyle said softly rhys joined us if were talking about running away to la permanently can i come too i smiled at him touched his face yes you come too good because once cels on the throne the unseelie court wont be safe for anyone i closed my eyes rested my forehead against doyles bare chest for a minute i pressed my cheek against him held him tight so i could listen to the slow steady beat of his heart abeloec who had been quiet spoke next to my face you have drunk deep of the cup of both cups meredith wherever you go faerie will follow you i looked at him trying to hear all the double meanings in what hed said i dont want this kill you must choose abeloec said i clung to doyle for a moment more then tore myself away i forced myself to stand straight shoulders back though the shoulder segna had torn ached and stung if my body didnt heal itself id need stitches if we could ever get back to the unseelie court there were healers who could fix me up but it was as if something or someone didnt want me getting back there i didnt think it was political enemies either i was beginning to feel the hand of deity pushing firmly in my back id wanted the goddess and the god to move among us again all of us had wanted that but i was beginning to realize that when the gods move you either get out of the way or get swept along for the ride i wasnt sure getting out of the way was an option for me i caught the faintest scent of apple blossoms a smallwhat warning reassurance the fact that i wasnt sure if it was a warning of danger or a spiritual embrace pretty much summed up my feelings about being the goddesss instrument be careful what you wish for i looked at sholto with his wound seeping blood onto his bandages he and i had both wanted to belong truly belong to the sidhe to be honored and accepted among them look where it had gotten us i held my hand out to him and he took it he took it and squeezed it tight even in all this horror and death i felt in that one touch how much it meant to him to touch me at all somehow the fact that he still wanted me so much made it all the worse i tried to share life with you meredith but i am king of the sluagh and death is all i have to offer i squeezed his hand we are both sidhe sholto and that is a thing of life we are unseelie sidhe and that is a thing of death but rhys reminded me what id forgotten what had you forgotten that the deities among us who brought death also once brought life we are not meant to be split apart like this we are not light and dark evil and good we are both and neither we have all forgotten what we are what i am in this moment said sholto is a man who is about to slay a woman who was my lover and my friend i can think of nothing beyond this moment as if when she dies at my hand i will die with her i shook my head you wont die but you may wish you could for a moment only for a moment he asked life is a selfish thing i said if you pass through the sorrow outrun the horror you will begin to want to live again you will be glad you didnt die he swallowed hard enough for me to hear it i dont want to pass through this ill help you he almost smiled and it was like a ghost flitting across his face i think youve helped enough with that he let go of my hand and eased himself over the edge using his good hand to keep himself from sliding through the bones i didnt look back at anyone i just eased myself over the edge and followed looking back wouldnt make me feel better looking back would simply make me want to ask for help some things you have to do yourself sometimes what it means to lead is simply that you cant ask for help i found that the bones werent sharp on every point it was mostly the spines on the tops that were vicious i grasped softer rounderlooking bones using them as handholds it took all my concentration to get down to the water without losing my grip or cutting my hand the water was surprisingly warm like bathwater the soil underneath it was soft and mushy silt rather than mud the footing was uncertain and again i let myself sink into concentration on the task at hand i focused on finding footing avoiding anything that felt like a bone i did not want to think about what i was about to do segna had tried to kill me twice now but i couldnt hate her it would have been so much easier if i could have hated her chapter if i hadnt been afraid of getting stabbed on the bones i would have swum out to where sholto and agnes stood holding segna the other two guards ivar and fyfe were still in the water still close but not holding the fallen woman the water reached to my shoulders stinging in the claw marks that segna had made on me and plenty deep enough to swim in if it hadnt hidden those bones beneath its surface my blood trailed into the black water lost sholto was cradling segnas head and upper body as well as he could with only one good arm agnes was still beside him helping hold her sister hag above the water i stumbled on the soft bottom and went under i came up sputtering agness voice came clear to me as she said to sholto how can you want that weak thing how can that be what you want i heard earth sliding water moving i turned to find doyle and frost in the water wading toward me agnes yelled it is her kill or she will never be queen we do not come to kill for her doyle said frost said we come to guard her as your kings guard protects him his face was an arrogant mask his pale expensive suit soaked up the dirty water his long silver hair trailed in the water somehow he seemed more dirtied by the water than anyone else as if it spoiled his whiteandsilver beauty more grievously doyles blackness just seemed to melt into the water the fact that his long braid trailed in the water didnt bother him the only thing he worried about keeping clean was his gun modern guns shoot just fine wet but hed begun using firearms when dry powder meant life or death and old habits die hard i waited for them to reach me because i wanted the comfort of their presence while i did this what i really wanted to do was fall into their arms and start screaming i didnt want to kill anymore i wanted life for my people i wanted to bring life back to faerie not death not death i waited and let their hands give me solace let them lift me above the soft treacherous bottom and guide me through the water i didnt collapse against them but i let myself take courage from the strength of their hands a bone brushed my leg bone i said a ridge of bone by the feel of it doyle said are you hoping segna dies before you get here agnes asked voice derisive the tears shining on her face made me discount the tone she was losing someone she had lived with fought beside loved for centuries shed hated me before this now shed hate me even more i did not want her as my enemy but it seemed as if no matter what i did i couldnt avoid it im trying not to share her fate i said i hope you do agnes said sholto tears plain on his face looked at her if you ever raise a hand to meredith again i will be done with you agnes stared at him searched his face as she held segnas body she stared into the face of the man she loved whatever she saw there made her bow her head i will do as my king bids the words were bitter it seemed to tighten my own throat just to hear them they must have burned in agness throat swear it sholto said what oath would you have of me she asked head still bowed the oath that meredith gave that will do she shivered and it wasnt from cold i swear by the darkness that eats all things that i will not harm the princess here and now no sholto said swear that you will never harm her she bowed lower dry black hair trailing into the water i cannot make that oath my king why can you not because i mean her harm you will not swear to never hurt her he sounded surprised i will not cannot ivar of the bird voice said may i suggest your highness that she swear the oath to not harm the princess now so we can all move about freely we can deal with her treachery later once weve dealt with the urgencies of the present moment sholto clutched segna to him and her yellowed hands with their broken claws grasped at him you are right he said he looked at agnes who was still bent over the water and segnas body make what oath you will agnes she straightened up the water streaming from her hair i swear by the darkness that eats all things that i will not harm the princess in this moment may i suggest something king sholto doyle asked yes sholto answered though his eyes were on the dying woman in his arms black agnes should add to her oath that she will not harm the princess while we are here in your garden sholto just nodded and whispered do as he says agnes do the sidhe guards give orders to our king now she said do it agnes he screamed at her and the scream ended in a sob he folded his body over segna and wept openly she glared at me not doyle while she spoke and each word seemed dragged out of her i swear by the darkness that eats all things that i will not harm the princess while we stand in the dead gardens i think that is as good as we get from her frost said voice low doyle nodded aye they both looked at me as if they knew this was a bad idea i addressed their look aloud theres no way around this only through it we have to live through this moment to get to the next sholto raised his face enough to say segna will not live through this moment he hadnt been this upset in los angeles when id done something much more horrible to nerys the grey his other hag i didnt point this out but i couldnt help noting it they had both been his lovers but then again i knew better than most that you dont feel for your lovers all the same segna meant something to him and nerys had not simple painful true i looked past the dying hag to black agnes who watched sholto intently i realized in that moment that she didnt just weep for segnas death but like me remembered that he hadnt wept for nerys was she wondering if he would weep for her or did she already know that he had loved segna more i wasnt sure but i could tell it was a raw and painful thought that cut across her features she stared at the weeping king and her thoughts carved loss across her face she would not come out of this nights work simply mourning segna she seemed to feel the weight of my gaze because she turned she looked at me the grief in her face changing into a fine burning hatred i saw my death in her eyes agnes would kill me if she could doyles hand tightened on my arm frost stepped over the bones in front of us hidden by the water and put his broad shoulders in the way of agness look as if her look alone could somehow hurt me that time was past but there would be more nights and more ways of making one mortal princess dead she has given her oath sholto said in a choked voice it is all we can do tonight that last was some acknowledgment that he saw what we saw in agness face id liked to have believed that he could keep a tight enough rein on the hag but her look said there would not be a leash of honor or love stronger than her hate i didnt want to kill segna didnt want to end her life while sholto wept for her and now i knew that i must also kill agnes or shed see me dead i might not do the deed myself and it might not happen today but i would have to call for her death she was too dangerous too well placed among the sluagh to be allowed to live as i let the thought come all the way up to the front of my mind i didnt know whether to laugh or weep i didnt want to kill one hag and had hated killing the first yet i was already planning the death of the third frost and doyle lifted me over the hidden ridge of bones they half floated me to sholto where he cried over the hag they tried to let me go but i sank to my chin when they released me they grabbed me in the same moment both fishing me higher above the black water she must stand on her own two feet for this kill agnes said her voice holding some of the deadly heat of her look i dont know if im tall enough i said i have to agree with the hag fyfe said the princess must stand on her own for the kill to be hers frost and doyle exchanged glances still holding me between them let me down slowly i said i think i can touch bottom they did what i asked if i kept my chin pointed up i could just barely keep the dirty water out of my mouth we have no weapons with us that will kill the immortal doyle said nor we ivar said sholto looked at me his face raw with grief and i fought to meet that look he moved and a tiny wave slapped my face i began treading water so i could keep my head above the surface as i did so my leg brushed something i thought it was a bone but it moved it was segnas arm limp in the water my leg brushed it again and the arm convulsed the bones are a killing thing i said then segna said in a rattling voice thick with things that should never be in the throat of the living kiss me onelasttime sholto leaned over her with a sob ivar moved everyone back to give us room he made certain that agnes moved back too which meant that segnas body began to sink below the water i moved forward tried to help catch her as i treaded water i got a hand on her body felt the weight of her cloak wrap around my legs i felt her tense a heartbeat before her arm which was behind me now swept forward i had time to turn and put both hands on her arm to keep the claws from my side merry doyle yelled i had time to see her other arm sweeping up behind me i let go of the arm i was already fending off and tried to sweep the second arm away from me segnas body rolled under the water and took me with her chapter i had time to take a breath then we were underwater segnas face loomed under the dirty water her mouth opened screaming at me blood blossoming from her mouth my hands dug desperately into her arms too small to encircle them as i forced them away from me and she dragged me deeper into the water too late i realized that there were other ways to kill me than claws she was trying to impale me on submerged bone i kicked my feet to stay above the bone to not let her spit me upon it the point of bone held me on its tip and i kicked and pushed to keep it from piercing my skin segna pushed and fought against me the strength in her arms and body was almost too much for me she was wounded dying and it was all i could do to keep her from killing me my chest was tight i needed to breathe claws bones and even the water itself could kill if i couldnt push her off me all she had to do was simply hold me underwater i prayed goddess help me a pale hand shone in the water and segna was pulled backward my grip on her arms pulling me with her we broke the surface together both of us gasping for breath her breath ended in a spattering cough that covered my face in her blood for a moment i couldnt see who had pulled her back i had to blink her blood out of my eyes to see sholto with his arm across her upper body he held her onearmed and yelled get out meredith get out i did what he said i let her go and pushed backward trusting that there were no bones just behind me segna didnt try to catch me she used her newly freed hands to claw down sholtos arm making a crimson ruin of his white flesh i treaded water looking around for doyle and frost and the others there were no others i was paddling in a lake a deep cold lake no longer the shallow stagnant pool wed been wading in before there was a small island close at hand but the shore was far away and it was not a shore i knew i screamed doyle but there was no answer in truth i hadnt expected one for i could already see that we were either in a vision or somewhere else in faerie i didnt know which and i didnt know where sholto cried out behind me i turned in time to see him go under in a wash of red segna struck at the water where hed vanished with the dagger from her belt did she realize it was him she attacked now or did she still think she was killing me i screamed segna the sound seemed to reach her because she hesitated she turned in the water and blinked at me i pushed myself high enough out of the water so she could see me sholto had not yet resurfaced segna screamed at me the sound ending in a wet cough blood poured down her chin but she started moving toward me i screamed sholto hoping segna would realize what shed done and turn back to rescue him but she kept swimming weakly toward me he is only white flesh now she growled in that too thick too wet voice he is only sidhe not sluagh so much for her helping sholto obviously it was up to me i took a good breath and dived the water was clearer here and i saw sholto like a pale shadow sinking toward the bottom blood trailing upward in a cloud i screamed his name and the sound echoed through the water his body jerked and just then something grabbed my hair and yanked me upward segna pulled me through the water i could see that she was making for the bare island my naked back hit the rocks scraped along them as she struggled from the lake she pulled me with her until both of us were free of the water she lay panting on the rock her hand still tangled in my hair i tried to ease away from that hand but it convulsed tighter wrenching my hair as if she meant to take it out by the roots she started dragging me closer to where she lay i fought to get up on all fours so she wouldnt scrape more of my skin off on the bare rock in order to do so i had to take my gaze off her for an instant it was a mistake she jerked me down with that strength that could have torn a horse apart jerked me down onto my stomach i wedged an arm under my body to keep me off the rocks then i saw that she still held the dagger she pressed it to my cheek i gazed at her along the line of the blade she was lying down almost flat against the rocks ill scar you she said ruin that pretty face sholto is drowning the sluagh cannot die by water if he is sidhe enough to drown then let him he loves you i said she made a harsh sound that spattered her chin with more blood not as much as he loves the thought of sidhe flesh in his bed i couldnt argue with that the tip of her blade wavered above my cheek how much sidhe are you how well do you heal i thought it was a rhetorical question so i didnt answer it would she die of her wounds before she hurt me or would she heal she coughed blood onto the stones and it was as if she wondered the same thing she used her grip on my hair to force me onto my back dragging me closer as she did it i couldnt stop her i could not fight against such strength she crawled on top of me and put her blade tip over my throat i grabbed her hand wrapped both my hands around it and still trembled with the effort to hold her off me so weak she gasped above me why do we follow the sidhe if i were not dying you could not hold me off my voice came out tight with strain as i said im only part sidhe but youre sidhe enough for him to want you she growled glow for me sidhe show me that precious seelie magic show me the magic that makes us follow the sidhe her words were fatal she was right i had magic magic that no one else had i called my hand of blood as i summoned it i tried not to think about the fact that i could have done it sooner before she hurt sholto i wielded the hand of blood i could have made her bleed out from just a tiny cut and these were not tiny cuts i started to glow under the press of her body my body shone through the blood she was dripping on me i whispered not seelie magic segna unseelie magic bleed for me she didnt understand at first she kept trying to shove the blade into my throat and i kept holding her just off me she dug her hand into my hair so that her claws raked my scalp bloodied me i called blood and her wounds gushed the blood poured over me hot hotter than my own skin i turned my head away to keep my eyes clear of it my hands grew slippery with her blood and i was afraid that her knife would slip past my defenses before i could bleed her out so much blood it poured and poured and poured could a nighthag bleed to death could they even be killed this way i didnt know i just didnt know the tip of her knife pierced my skin like a sharp bite my arms were shaking with the effort to keep her off me i screamed bleed for me i spat her blood out of my mouth and still her knife wormed another fraction into my throat barely barely below the skin i wasnt hurt yet but i would be soon then her hand hesitated pulled backward i blinked up at her through a mask of her own blood her eyes were wide and startled there was a white spear sticking out through her throat sholto stood above her bandages gone his wound bare to the air both hands gripping the spear he pulled the spear out with a wrenching motion a fountain of blood spilled out of her neck i whispered bleed she collapsed in a pool of crimson the knife still clasped in her hand sholto stood over her and drove the white spear into her back she spasmed underneath him her mouth opening and closing hands and feet scrabbling at the bare rock only when she stopped moving completely did he take the spear out he stood swaying but used the tip to send her dagger spinning into the lake then he collapsed to his knees beside her leaning on the spear like a crutch by the time i staggered to him i wasnt glowing i was tired and hurt and covered in my enemys blood i fell to my knees beside him on the bloody rock and i touched his shoulder as if i wasnt sure he was real i saw you drown i said he seemed to have trouble focusing on me but said i am sidhe and sluagh we cannot die by drowning he coughed hard enough that he doubled over throwing up water onto the rock as he clung to the white shaft of the spear but it hurts as if it were death i embraced him and he winced covered in wounds new and old i held him more carefully clinging to him covering his upper body in segnas blood his voice came rough with coughing im holding the spear of bone it was one of the signs of kingship once for my people where did it come from i asked it was in the bottom of the lake waiting for me where are we i asked its the island of bones it used to be in the middle of our garden but it has become the stuff of legend i touched what id thought was rock and found he was right it was rock but the rock had once been bone the island was made up of fossils it feels awfully solid for a legend i said he managed a smile what in the name of danu is going on meredith what is happening i smelled roses thick and sweet he raised his head looked around him i smell herbs i smell roses i said softly he looked at me what is happening meredith how did we get here i prayed he frowned at me i dont understand the smell of roses grew thicker as if i were standing in a summer meadow a chalice appeared in my hand where it lay against sholtos naked back he startled away from the touch of it as if it had burned him he tried to turn too quickly and it must have pained the open wound on his stomach for he winced sucking in his breath sharply he fell back onto his side the spear still gripped in one hand i held up the goldandsilver cup so that it caught the light it was really only then that it sank in that there was light here it was sunlight glinting on the cup and warm on my skin for my life i couldnt remember if there had been sun a moment ago i might have asked sholto but he was focused on what was in my hand and whispered it cant be what i think it is it is the chalice he gave a small shake of his head how i dreamt of it as i dreamt of abeloecs horn cup and when i woke it was beside me he leaned heavily on the spear and reached toward the shining cup i held it out toward him but his fingers stopped just short of it as if he feared to touch it his reluctance reminded me that things could happen if i touched one of the men with the chalice but werent we in vision and if so would that hold true i looked at segnas body felt her blood drying on my skin was this vision or was it real and is not vision real came a womans voice who said that sholto asked a figure appeared she was hidden completely behind the grey of a hooded cloak she stood in the clear sunlight but it was like looking at a shadow a shadow with nothing to give it form do not fear the touch of the goddess the figure said who are you sholto whispered who do you think i am came the voice in the past she had always either appeared more solid or been only a voice a scent on the wind sholto licked his lips and whispered goddess my hand rose of its own accord i held the chalice out to him but it was as if someone else were moving my hand touch the chalice i whispered he kept his grip on the spear leaning on it as he stretched out his other hand what will happen when i touch it i dont know i said then why do you want me to do it she wants you to i said he hesitated again with his fingers just above the shining surface the goddesss voice breathed around us with the scent of summer roses choose sholto took in a sharp breath and blew it out like a sprinter then touched the gold of the cup i smelled herbs as if i had brushed against a border of thyme and lavender around my roses a blackcloaked figure appeared beside the grey taller broader of shoulders and somehow even shrouded by the cloak male as the cloak could not hide the goddesss femininity so the cloak could not hide the gods masculinity sholtos hand wrapped around the chalice covering my hand with his so that we both held the cup the voice came deep and rich and ever changing i knew the voice of the god always male but never the same you have spilled your blood risked your lives killed on this ground he intoned that dark hood turned toward sholto and for a moment i thought i saw a chin lips but they changed even as i saw them it was dizzying what would you give to bring life back to your people sholto anything he whispered be careful what you offer the goddess said and her voice too was every womans and none i would give my life to save my people sholto said i do not wish to take it i responded because the goddess had offered me a similar choice once amatheon had bared his neck for a blade so that life could return to the land of faerie i had refused because there were other ways to give life to the land i was descended from fertility deities and i knew well that blood was not the only thing that made the grass grow this is not your choice she said to me was there a note of sorrow in her voice a dagger appeared in the air in front of sholto its hilt and blade were all white and gleamed oddly in the light sholtos hand left the chalice and grabbed for the knife almost by reflex the hilt is bone it is the match to the spear sholto said and there was soft wonder in his voice as he gazed at the dagger do you remember what the dagger was used for said the god it was used to slay the old king to spill his blood on this island sholto replied obediently why the god asked this dagger is the heart of the sluagh or was once what does a heart need blood and lives sholto answered as if he were taking a test you spilled blood and life on the island but it is not alive sholto shook his head segna was not a suitable sacrifice for this place it needs a kings blood he held the knife out toward the gods shadowy figure spill my blood take my life bring the heart of the sluagh back to life you are the king sholto if you die who will take back the spear and bring the power back to your people i knelt there the blood growing tacky on my skin i cradled the chalice in my hands and had a bad feeling that i knew where this talk was going sholto lowered the knife and asked what do you want of me lord the figure pointed at me there is royal blood to spill do it and the heart of the sluagh will live once more sholto stared at me the look on his face full of shock i wondered if my face had looked that way when the choice had been mine you mean for me to kill meredith she is royal blood a fit sacrifice for this place no sholto said you said you would do anything the goddess said i can offer my life but i cannot offer hers sholto said it isnt mine to give his hand was mottled with the force of his grip on the hilt of the knife you are king the god said a king tends his people he doesnt butcher them you would condemn your people to a slow death for the life of one woman emotions chased over sholtos face but finally he dropped the knife on the rock it rang as if it were the hardest metal rather than bone i cannot will not harm meredith why will you not she is not sluagh she should not have to die to bring us back to life it is not her place if she wishes to be queen over all of faerie then she will be sluagh then let her be queen if she dies here she will not be queen and that will leave us with only cel i would bring life back to the sluagh and destroy all of faerie in one blow she holds the chalice the chalice my lord the chalice after all these years is returned i do not understand how you can ask me to destroy the only hope we have is she your hope sholto the god asked yes he whispered there was so much emotion in that one word the dark figure looked at the grey the goddess spoke there is no fear in you meredith why not i tried to put it into words sholto is right my lady the chalice has returned to us and magic is returning to the sidhe you use my body as your vessel i do not think you would waste all that on one bloody sacrifice i glanced at sholto and i have felt his hand in mine i have felt his desire for me i think it would destroy something in him to kill me i do not believe my god and goddess so heartless as that does he love you then meredith i do not know but he loves the idea of holding me in his arms that i know do you love this woman sholto the god asked sholto opened his mouth closed it then said it is not a gentlemans place to answer such questions in front of a lady this is a place for truth sholto its all right sholto i said answer true i wont hold it against you thats what im afraid of he said softly the look on his face made me laugh the laughter echoed on the air like the song of birds joy will suffice to bring this place back to life the goddess said if you bring life to this place with joy then you will change the very heart of the sluagh do you understand that sholto the god said not exactly the heart of the sluagh is based on death blood combat and terror laughter joy and life will make a different heart for the sluagh i am sorry my lord but i do not understand meredith the goddess said explain it to him the goddess was beginning to fade like a dream as dawns light steals through the window i do not understand sholto said you are sluagh and unseelie sidhe the god said you are a creature of terror and darkness it is what you are but it is not all you are with that the dark shape began to fade too sholto reached out to him wait i dont understand the god and goddess vanished as if theyd never been and the sunlight dimmed with them we were left in gloom it was the twilight of the underground of faerie these days not the aberration of the momentous sunlight that had bathed us moments ago sholto yelled my god wait sholto i said i had to say it twice more before he looked at me his face was stricken i dont know what they want from me what am i to do how do i bring the heart of my people back with joy i smiled at him the mask of blood cracking with it i had to clean off this mess oh sholto you get your wish my wish what wish let me clean off some of this blood beforehand before what i touched his arm sex sholto they meant sex what the look on his face so astonished made me laugh again the sound echoed across the lake and again i thought i heard birdsong did you hear that i heard your laughter like music this place is ready to come back to life sholto but if we use laughter and joy and sex to make it happen then it will be a different place than it was before do you understand that im not sure we are going to have sex here now yes let me wash off some of the blood and then yes i wasnt sure hed heard anything else id said have you seen the new garden outside the throne room doors in the unseelie sithen he seemed to have to fight to concentrate but finally he nodded its a meadow with a stream now not the torture area the queen had made of it exactly i said it was a place of pain and now its a meadow with butterflies and bunnies im part seelie court sholto do you understand what im saying that part of me will impact the magic we do here and now what magic will we perform here and now he asked smiling he was still leaning heavily on the spear the raw wound of what the seelie had done to him bare to the air id had enough of my own injuries to know that just the touch of air hurt when the skin was abraded the bone knife lay next to sholtos knees truthfully id thought it might vanish when the god and goddess went for he had refused to use it for its true purpose nevertheless sholto was still surrounded by major relics of the sluagh hed been visited by deity we knelt in a place of legend with the possibility of bringing his people to a rebirth of their powers and all he seemed to be able to think of was the fact that we might be having sex i looked in his face i tried to see past the almost shy anticipation there he seemed afraid to be too eager he was a good king yet the promise of sex with another sidhe had chased all the cautions from his mind i could not allow him to leap in though until i was sure he understood what might happen to his people he had to understand oror what sholto i said he reached out to me i took his hand to keep him from touching my face i need you to hear me sholto to truly hear me i will listen to anything you say he was willing to follow my lead id noticed that about him in la that the dominant frightening king of the sluagh became submissive in intimate situations had black agnes taught him that or segna or was he just wired that way i patted his hand more friendly than sexual what i bring to sex magic is meadows and butterflies some of the corridors in the unseelie mound are turning to white marble with veins of gold his face became a little more serious less amused yes the queen was most upset he said she accused you of remaking her sithen in the image of the seelie court exactly i said his eyes widened i didnt do it on purpose i said i dont control what the energy does with the sithen sex magic isnt like other magicks its wilder and has more a mind of its own the sluagh are wild magic meredith yes but wild sluagh and wild seelie magic arent the same he turned my hand palmup you bear the hand of flesh and the hand of blood those are not seelie powers no in combat i seem to be all unseelie but in sex magic it is the seelie in my blood that comes out do you understand what that might mean for your sluagh all the light seemed to drain from his face so somber now if we have sex and the sluagh are reborn you might remake the sluagh in your image yes i said he stared at my hand as if hed never seen it before if i had taken your life then the sluagh would have remained what they are a terrible darkness to sweep all before us if we use sex to bring life back to my people then they may become more like the sidhe or even the seelie sidhe yes i said yes i was relieved that he finally understood would it be so terrible if we were more sidhe he almost whispered it as if he spoke to himself you are their king sholto only you can make this choice for your people they would hate me for making this choice he stared at me but what other choice is there i will not spill your life away not even to bring life back to all of my kingdom he closed his eyes and let go of my hand he began to glow soft and white like the moon rising through his skin he opened his eyes and the triple gold of his irises gleamed he traced a glowing fingertip across the palm of my hand and it drew a line of cold white fire across my skin i shuddered from that small touch he smiled i am sidhe meredith i understand that now i am sluagh too but i am also sidhe i want to be sidhe meredith i want to be fully sidhe i want to know what it feels like to be what i am i drew my hand back from him so i could think without the press of his power against my skin you are king here you must make this choice my voice was a little hoarse it is no choice he said you dead and lost to all of faerie or you in my arms it is no choice he laughed then and his laughter too echoed across the lake i heard chimes or birds or both besides darkness and frost would kill me if i took you as a sacrifice they would not slay the king of the sluagh and bring war to faerie i said if you truly believe that their loyalties are still to faerie rather than to you alone then you do not see their eyes when they look at you their vengeance would be terrible meredith the fact that there are still assassination attempts against you only shows that some of the sidhe do not yet understand how shortleashed the queen has kept darkness and frost especially darkness he said his voice going low his face looked haunted he shook the thought away and looked back at me i have seen the darkness hunt if hell hounds yeth hounds still existed among us they would belong to the sluagh to the wild hunt and the blood of that wild hunt still runs through doyles veins meredith so you do not kill me for fear of doyle and frost he looked at me and for a moment let the veil drop from those glowing eyes he let me see his need such need as if it should have been carved in letters across the air it is not fear that impels me to spare your life he whispered i gave him a smile and the chalice still gripped in my hand pulsed once against my skin the chalice would be part of what we did let me wash some of this blood away then i will put my glow against yours his own glow began to fade a little his burning eyes cooling to as normal as they ever got it was hard to call his triplegold irises normal even by sidhe standards though i am hurt meredith i would have had our first time together be perfect im not certain how much good im going to be to you tonight im hurt too i said but well both do our best i stood up and found my body stiff with injuries i hadnt even realized id suffered small wounds that i must have received in the fight i will not be able to make love the way you wish it he said how do you know what i wish i asked as i made my way slowly across the rough and smooth of the rock you had quite an audience for mistrals turn with you the rumors have grown but if even part of it is true i will not be able to dominate you as he did i slid into the water it found every small cut and scrape the water was cool and soothing but at the same time it made the wounds burn i dont want to be dominated right now sholto make love to me let it be gentle between us if that is what we want he laughed again and i heard bells i think gentle is all im capable of tonight i do not always want rough sholto my tastes are more varied than that i was shoulderdeep in the water now trying to get the blood off me the blood began to dissolve in the water washing away almost more easily than it should have how varied are your tastes he asked i smiled at him very i dunked under the water in a bid to get the blood off my face out of my hair i came up gasping wiping the runnels of pinkish water from my face i went under two more times until the water ran clear sholto was at the edge of the island when i came up the last time he was standing using the spear like a crutch the white knife was tucked carefully through the cloth of his pants the way youd stick a pin through in then out so the point was exposed to the air he offered me his hand i took it though i could have gotten out by myself and i knew that bending over must hurt him he lifted me out of the water but his eyes never got to my face his gaze stayed on my body my breasts as the water ran down them there are women who would have taken offense but i wasnt one of them in that moment he wasnt a king he was a man and that was just fine with me chapter sholto lay naked before me id never seen him like that lying naked and waiting knowing that we didnt have to stop the first and only time id seen him completely nude hed still had extras but he had used his own personal magic then to make his stomach look like the perfect sixpack abs even to the touch i hadnt been able to feel what id known was there he was very good at personal glamour but then hed spent years hiding that bit of deformity now he lay back using his own pants as some small cushion against the stone the seelie had skinned him from just below his ribs to just above his groin id seen the wound but now it loomed larger the pain must have been a fearsome thing he had laid the white spear and the bone knife to one side of him i had set the chalice on the other side of him we would make love between the chalice symbol of the goddess and two symbols that were oh so masculine the air above his body wavered like heat off a road and the next moment there was no wound he was back to creating the illusion of that perfect sixpack of all my lovers only rhys had it for real you dont need to hide sholto i said the look on your face is not the look i want to see the first time we make love meredith take the glamour away sholto let me truly see you it is no more beautiful than what used to be there his voice was sad i touched the smooth skin of his shoulder you were beautiful you are beautiful he gave me a smile as sad as his tone meredith no lies please i studied his face he was as fair of face as frost who was one of the most perfect men id ever seen i said out loud the queen once called you the most perfect sidhe body she had ever seen you are wounded you will heal it has not changed the perfection of you the queen said that it was a pity that one of the most perfect sidhe bodies shed ever seen was ruined by such deformity okay maybe mentioning the queens words hadnt been a good idea i tried again i crawled to his face and leaned over to touch his lips with mine but it was a cold kiss and he barely responded i drew back what is wrong in los angeles even the sight of you clothed hardened my body tonight i am weak i gazed down the long length of his body to find that he was still soft and as small as he got he was one of those men that wasnt truly small even when soft a shower not a grower i had magic in me that could bring a man to life as it were but it was seelie magic i wanted to use less seelie magic in this union not more although sholto had made the decision to accept the risk i feared for the sluagh i feared them losing their identity as a people of course there were other ways to bring a man to life besides magic i crawled carefully on the bare rocks until i knelt by his hip you arent weak sholto youre hurt there is no shame in that to see you nude and not to react is shameful i gave him the smile he needed and said i think we can fix that magic he said staring down his body at me i shook my head no magic sholto just this i traced my hand over his thighs reveling in the smooth skin the fey didnt have much body hair but i think the fact that he was part nightflyer a creature that had no hair made him utterly smooth smooth as a woman and so soft yet terribly male from the bottoms of his feet to the top of his head i traced along the inside of his thighs and he spread them for me so that i could sweep upward and touch the silken skin between his legs he was still soft and loose as i rolled those delicate balls in my hand the touch bowed his spine sending his head back eyes closed but with the pleasure came a sound of pain the movement had hurt the butchered skin across the middle of his body what progress id made wilted in the face of such pain he threw his arm across his eyes and made a sound between a sob and a yell i will be useless to you tonight meredith i will be useless to my people i will not bring us back to life with death and i cannot bring us back with life i would wait until you were healed sholto if i could but this night is about bringing life back to faerie console yourself we will have other nights or days other times after you are healed to do what we want to do tonight we do what we must he uncovered his eyes and gazed down at me his face held such despair i cant think of any intercourse position that isnt going to hurt you and you dont like pain i said i did not say i did not like pain but not this much i stored that away for future reference i know there are limits for most of us beyond which pain is just pain i am sorry meredith but i fear i have reached that point with these wounds well see i said i leaned back over his body until i could kiss the front of him i drew him gently into my mouth the only other time id had him in my mouth he had been long and hard and eager tonight his body was quiet loose and still at first i was almost impatient but i let that go this was not a moment for impatience or hurrying this was sholtos first time with another sidhe this was one of his most treasured dreams and he was coming to it hurt and not at his best hed probably fantasized this moment and now none of his fantasies was coming true reality was a harsher mistress than imagination i let go of the impatience i stopped wondering what doyle and frost and the others must be thinking i let go the thought that my powers were growing and i had no idea what they would do next i let all the worries go and gave myself over to this moment i gave myself over to the sensation of him in my mouth i had been denied the chance to give oral sex to most of my lovers they didnt want to risk spilling their seed anywhere but between my legs wasting a chance to father the next heir to the throne a chance to make themselves king to my queen i didnt blame them but i loved oral sex and id missed performing it the few times id been able to persuade anyone he had already been excited big hard which was a pleasure all its own but i liked the feel of a man when he was small so much easier to take all of him in my mouth no straining no fighting all that length or width i rolled him in my mouth sucking gently at first but i wanted to enjoy all the sensation i could while he remained small so i increased in intensity i could feel him moving in my mouth the skin sliding the meat of him so easy to work with i sucked him fast and faster until he cried out enough enough i moved to the loose roll of his balls licking along the skin sliding all that silkiness between my lips and tongue i watched him grow larger as i played with his balls i rolled one testicle carefully into my mouth so i could play with all of it he was too big for me to try to take both in at the same time it would be too easy to injure such tender parts the last thing i wanted to do was cause him any new pain his eyes were wild as they looked down his body at me the gold of his eyes started to glow molten gold in the center amber shot through with sun then a pale yellowgold like elm leaves in fall one moment his eyes were all that glowed and the next that light exploded down his body as if white light were liquid running just under his skin his skin glowed even underneath the red ruin as if he were carved of rubies set in ivory with the sun glowing through the white and red of his body i moved over his body not with him inside but with a knee on either side of his hips i gazed down at him wanting to remember the beauty of him the first time the glow had spread to the tips of his hair as if every strand were dipped in moonlight he was a thing of light and magic but as i used my hand to help slide him inside me he was all silken skin and muscle i slipped the head of him inside me and found i was almost too tight id performed all the foreplay on him and received none for myself i was wet from the pleasure but tight so very tight he managed to gasp out youre not open enough is it hurting you my own voice sounded whispery no he whispered then i want to feel you force your way into me i want to feel each inch push inside while im this tight i wriggled my hips a little lower fighting for each delicious inch i was so tight that he touched every bit of me sliding heavy and slow over that spot inside me i meant to have him inside me as deep as hed go before my release but my body had other ideas it was as if my body being so tight around his made his body press just right just exactly right against that one spot one moment i was trying to be so careful easing him inside me and the next i was screaming my orgasm my body bucking around his the movement forcing more of me down the shaft of him faster than i would have managed without it and as long as i could keep pushing him inside me the orgasm kept going it kept on as i shoved him inside me and somewhere before the last inch of him went inside he started helping to push i sat on top of him with our bodies wedded as close as man and woman could be the orgasm dancing me above him i was aware vaguely that my skin was glowing a moon shine to match his own the wind of my own power blew my hair around my face garnets sparkling in fire my eyes glowed so brightly that i could see the colored shadows of the green and gold of my own eyes at the edges of my vision i screamed and writhed above him on wave after wave of pleasure this had not been planned or achieved with skill but more by luck a key sliding into a lock at the perfect moment our bodies took that moment and rode it i heard him scream my name felt his body buck under mine felt him drive himself home as hard and as fast as he could he hit the end of me and that orgasmed me again i threw my head back and screamed his name to the heavens he went still underneath me but i couldnt focus my eyes enough to see him not really my vision ran in streamers of colors i collapsed forward and forgot forgot that he was still hurt forgot that i was wearing the queens ring on my right hand the ring that had once belonged to a real fertility goddess i had a second to realize that the skin of his stomach under my hands was no longer raw but felt smooth and perfect i blinked down fighting through pleasures afterglow to see him his stomach was as flat and perfect as his illusion once had been but this was no illusion he had his tentacles back but as a tattoo so bright and lifelike that a glance made them seem real they were a picture drawn upon his skin i saw all that in three blinks of an eye but there was no next blink for the ring suddenly came to life it was like being plunged into water with an electric current in it it was not enough to kill but enough to hurt sholto yelled under me and not from pleasure i tried to take the ring away from his body but my hand seemed glued to his newly decorated skin the power blew out from us as if the magic spilled away over the bare rock i could breathe again sholto gasped what was that the ring he gazed down his body at me and my hand pressed to his abdomen his fingers touched the tattoo a look on his face of wonder and of loss it was as if hed been given his dearest wish and in the same moment experienced a loss that would haunt him forever i heard metal rolling along rock the sound made me turn the chalice was rolling toward us though the ground was utterly flat i looked to the other side and found the spear of bone rolling from the other side they were going to touch us at the same time hold on i said to what to me he grabbed my arms and my hand was freed from his stomach i grabbed his arms without thinking putting the ring against his bare skin again sometimes goddess pulls us by the hand down our path and sometimes she gets behind us and pushes off the cliff edge we were about to be pushed chapter wood metal flesh all of it hit us at once we were left clinging to each other in the center of a blast of power that splashed the lake up over the island we drowned for a moment then the world literally moved it felt as if the island bucked up and dropped down again the water cleared the earth stopped moving and the chalice and spear were gone we were left wet and gasping huddled naked together i was afraid to let go as if our arms around each other our bodies still wedded together were all that kept us from falling off the face of the earth voices came yells shouts i picked out doyles voice frost and agness harsh call the voices made us both turn blinking water out of our eyes on the shore which was a lot farther away than it had been before were all our guards we were back in the dead gardens of the sluagh but the lake was full of water now and the island of bones was in the middle of it doyle dived into the water his dark body cutting the surface frost followed him the other guards did the same sholtos uncles discarded their cloaks and hit the water after my guards only black agnes stayed on the shore i looked down at sholto i was still on top of him were about to be rescued he smiled up at me do we need rescuing im not sure i said he laughed then and the sound echoed against the bare stone of the cavern he hugged me tight and laid a gentle kiss on my cheek he breathed his words against my skin thank you meredith i pressed my cheek against his and whispered back you are most welcome sholto he buried his hand in my wet hair and said softly i have long desired you to whisper my name like that like what i asked face still pressed against his like a lover i heard movement behind us and sholto released his hold on my hair i kissed him on the lips before i lifted my body to see who had made the island first doyle of course it was doyle walked toward us he gleamed black and shining water dripping down his nakedness the light caught blue and purple gleams from his skin as he moved toward us the light seemed to dazzle on his skin and on the water reflected brilliance my skin was warm in the light sunlight it was sunlight again like noonday come to this shadowy place there was a green haze to the bare rock where sholto and i lay that haze took the shape of tiny stems reaching out over the rock anchoring themselves as doyle came to stand beside us his face struggled for an expression and finally settled on that stern face the one that had frightened me as a child when he stood at my aunts side somehow the expression wasnt nearly as frightening with him naked and given my now so intimate knowledge of him the queens darkness was my lover and i could never again see him as that threatening figure simply the queens assassin her black dog to fetch and kill i stared up at him still pressed tight in sholtos arms i sat up and his arms fell away from me reluctantly since i was still riding his body it wasnt as if he stopped touching me his hands slid down my arms staying in contact i glanced at sholtos face and found him looking not at me but at doyle sholtos face was defiant almost triumphant i didnt understand the look i glanced at doyle and saw behind that stern face a flash of anger for the first time in weeks i remembered how they had both found me in los angeles they had fought both convinced that the queen had sent each of them to kill me but there had been something personal about that fight i couldnt remember what they had said to each other that made me think they had some kind of bad history but i had felt it the looks they gave each other now confirmed that i was missing something some disagreement or challenge or even grudge between these two men not good rhys came up the slope of the rock dripping like wet ivory he stopped short of us all as if he also sensed or saw the tension what do you do when youre naked with one lover and another lover is standing there sholto was not my king or husband i took my hand from him and offered it to doyle doyle hesitated a moment his gaze on his rival and not on me then those black eyes moved to me his expression never truly changed but some breath of harshness left him or perhaps some touch of gentleness returned to him there was movement behind him and frost and mistral struggled up the slope they were dressed and weapons bulged everywhere frost actually caught mistrals arm as the other man slipped the clothes and weapons had slowed them down now they stood there frosts hand on mistrals arm mistral was almost on his knees from his slip but they had frozen staring at us they hadnt just caught a whiff of tension their reaction said clearly that there was bad blood between sholto and doyle doyle took my hand in his the moment he touched me the tightness in my chest which i hadnt even known was there loosened he lifted me upward off the other man sholtos hands all of his body let me go with such reluctance the sensation of him drawing out of deep within my body shivered through me only doyles grip kept my knees from buckling sholto raised his arms to help catch me his hands on my thighs doyle pulled me in against his body half lifting me over sholtos body sholto let me go otherwise it would have been like a tugofwar not seemly behavior for a king i stood there wrapped in doyles arms staring up at his face trying to decipher what he was thinking around me the tiny plants unfurled tiny leaves and the world suddenly smelled of thyme that sweet green herb scent that sholto had said he sensed when i was smelling roses the delicate herbs tickled along my foot as if reminding me that there were some things more important than love staring up into doyles face i wasnt sure that was right in that moment i wanted him happy i wanted him to know that i wanted him happy i wanted to explain that sholto had been lovely and the power had been immense but that in the end he meant nothing to me not when i had doyles arms around me but you cant say that out loud not with the other man lying behind you so many hearts to juggle including my own the herbs touched me again wound around my ankle i glanced down at the greenery and thought of my favorite thymes my gran had grown them in the herb garden behind the house where my father raised me so many varieties lemon thyme silver thyme golden thyme at that thought the plants around my ankle were suddenly tinged with yellow some of the leaves on some of the plants turned silver others became pale yellow and some that bright sunny yellow there was a scent of faint lemon on the air as if i had crushed one of the pale yellow leaves between my fingertips what did you do doyle whispered his deep voice thrumming along my spine so that i shivered against him my voice was soft as if i didnt want to say it too loudly i just thought that there is more than one kind of thyme and the plants changed he said i nodded staring at them i didnt say it out loud doyle i only thought it he hugged me i know mistral and frost were with rhys now they did not approach us and again i wasnt sure why they waited as if they needed permission to come closer the way they would have waited to approach queen andais i thought it was me they waited on but i should have known better sholto said behind me the sidhe do not usually stand on ceremony but if you need permission then i give it come closer mistral said if you could see yourself king sholto you would not ask why we stand on ceremony the comment made me look back at sholto he was sitting up but where he had been lying was an outline of herbs peppermint basil as i recognized them i smelled their perfumes but the herbs spreading out from where he had lain where we had lain wasnt what made the men stop sholto was wearing a crown a crown of herbs even as we watched the delicate plants wove like living fingers through his hair creating a wreath of thyme and mint only the most delicate of the plants entwining themselves as we watched he raised a hand and the moving plants touched his fingers as they had touched my ankle i was wearing an anklet of living thyme goldflecked leaves smelling of green life and lemons the tendril wrapped around his fingers like a happy pet he lowered his hand and stared at it the plant wove itself into a ring as we watched a ring that bloomed on his hand the delicate spray of white blossoms more precious than any jewel then his crown burst into bloom shades of white blue lavender finally the blooms spread across the island so that the ground was nearly solid with tiny airy flowers moving not in a breeze for there was none but nodding as if the flowers were speaking to one another a crown of flowers is not a crown for the king of the sluagh agnes shouted harsh from the shore she was on hands and knees hidden completely under her black cloak i saw the flash of her eyes as if there was a glow to them then she lowered her head hiding from the light she was a nighthag they didnt travel at noon ivar spoke but i couldnt see him sholto king we cannot approach you in this burning light his uncles were halfgoblin which depending on the type of goblin might make sunlight a problem but they were also halfnightflyer and that definitely made sunlight a problem i would that you could come to me uncles sholto said doyles arms tightened around me a warning be careful what you say sholto you do not understand the power of the words of someone whom faerie itself has crowned i do not need advice from you darkness sholto said and again there was bitterness in his voice the sunlight faded and a soft twilight began to fall there was the sound of splashing then ivar and fyfe came up upon the island they were nude except for enough clothing to hold their weapons they fell to one knee before him heads bowed king sholto ivar said we thank you for sending the light away sholto said i didnt you are crowned by faerie doyle said again your words perhaps even your thoughts will shape what will happen this night i said i thought only thought that there is more than one variety of thyme and it changed the herbs what i thought about became real sholto agnes called from the shore you have freed us from the light king sholto you have given us back the lost lake and the island of bones will you stop there or will you give us back our power will you remake the sluagh while the magic of creation still burns through you or will you hesitate and lose this chance to bring us back into ourselves the hag is right your highness fyfe said you have brought us back the magic of making wild magic creation magic will you use it for us in the dying light i watched sholto lick his lips what would you have of me he asked carefully i heard in his voice what was beginning to be in my mind a touch of fear you could police your words but policing your own thoughts that was harder so much harder call the wild magic ivar said it is here already doyle said can you not feel it his heart sped under my cheek i wasnt sure i understood exactly what was happening but doyle seemed both frightened and excited even his body was beginning to react pressed against the front of mine the two kneeling figures looked at doyle do not look to darkness sholto said i am king here they looked back at him and bowed again you are our king said ivar but there are places we cannot follow you if the wild magic is real again then you have two choices king of ours you can remake us into a thing of flowered crowns and noonday suns or you can call the old magic and remake us into what we once were darkness is right fyfe said i can feel it like a growing weight inside me you can change us into what she wants us to be he pointed at me or you can give us back what we have lost sholto then asked something that made me think even better of him than i already did what would you have of me uncles what would you have me do they glanced first at him then at each other then carefully down at the ground again we want to be what we once were we want to hunt as we once did give us back what has been lost sholto ivar held out his hand toward his king do not remake us in the sidhe bitchs image agnes yelled from the shore it was a mistake sholto yelled back at her i am king here i rule here i thought you loved me once but i know now that you only raised me to take the throne because you wished to sit upon it you cannot rule but you thought you could rule through me you and your sisters thought to make me your puppet he stood and screamed at her i am no ones puppet i am king sholto of the sluagh i am the lord of that which passes between lord of shadows long have i been lonely among my own people long have i wanted some to look as i do he slammed a hand into his chest it made a thick meaty sound now you tell me i have the power to do just that you have envied the sidhe their smooth skin their beauty that turns my head so have what you envy a wail came from agnes but it was too dark to see what was happening on the shore she screamed a horrible sound a sound of loss and pain as if whatever was happening to her hurt i heard sholto say softly agnes the sound in that one word let me know that he wasnt so terribly certain of what he wanted or what he had done what had he done his uncles abased themselves faces pressed to the herbs please king sholto we beg you do not remake us into sidhe do not make us only lesser versions of the unseelie we are sluagh and that is a proud thing would you strip us of all that we have kept over the years no sholto said and there was no anger in his voice now the screams from the shore had taken away his anger he understood now how dangerous he was in this moment i want the sluagh to be powerful again i want us to be a force to be reckoned with negotiated with i want us to be a fearsome thing i spoke before i could think not just fearsome surely i want us to have a terrible beauty then he said and it was as if the world held its breath as if the whole of faerie had been waiting for him to say those words i felt it in the pit of my stomach like the chime of a great bell it was a beautiful sound but so large so heavy that it could crush you with the music of its voice what have you done doyle asked and i wasnt sure whom he had asked it of sholto answered him what i had to do he stood there stark and pale in the growing dark the tattoo of his tentacles glowed as if outlined with phosphorus the flowers of his crown looked ghostly pale and i thought they would have attracted honeybees if it had not been dark bees are not nighttime creatures the darkness began to lighten what did you just think of doyle asked that if the sunlight had remained there would have been bees to feed on the flowers no it will be night here sholto said and the darkness began to thicken again i tried for a more neutral thought what could come to his flowers in the dark moths appeared among the flowers small ones ones to match the moth on my stomach small flashes of light showed above the island as if jewels had been thrown into the air fireflies dozens of them so that they actually glowed enough to drive back some of the dark did you call them sholto said yes i said you raised the wild magic together ivar said she is not sluagh fyfe said but she is queen to his king for tonight the magic is hers as well ivar said will you fight me for the heart of my people meredith sholto said i will try not to i said softly i rule here meredith not you i do not want to take your throne sholto but i cant help being what i am what are you i am sidhe then if you are sidhe and not sluagh run what i asked trying to move a little away from doyle and closer to sholto doyle held me tight and wouldnt let me do it run sholto said again why i asked i am going to call the wild hunt meredith if you are not sluagh then you will be prey no sholto let us take the princess to safety first i beg this of you doyle said urgently the darkness does not usually beg i am flattered but if she can call back the sun to drive away the night i must call the hunt now she must be the prey you know that i was startled was this the same man who had refused to sacrifice me just moments ago who had looked on me with such tenderness the magic was indeed working powerfully in him to make this change rhyss voice came cautious you wear a crown of flowers king sholto are you so certain that the wild hunt will recognize you as sluagh i am their king you look sidhe enough to be welcome in the queens bed right now rhys said sholto touched his flat stomach with its healed flesh and tattoo he hesitated then shook his head i will call the wild magic i will call the hunt if they see me as prey and not as sluagh then so be it he smiled and even in the uncertain light it didnt look particularly happy he laughed and the night echoed with it there was the call of some sweetvoiced bird sleepy from the distant shore sholto spoke again it is a long tradition among us lord rhys to slay our kings to bring back life to the land if by my life or my death i can bring my people back to their power i will do it sholto i said dont dont say that it is done he said doyle started moving us toward the other side of the island short of killing him we cannot stop him he told me you both reek of the oldest of magicks i am not certain that he can be killed right now we need to leave then rhys said abeloec was finally pulling himself up on the shore he still had his cup in his hand and it seemed as if the weight of it had kept him from coming sooner dont tell me i have to get back in the lake he said if shes touched with the magic of creation let her create a bridge i didnt wait i said i want a bridge to the shore a graceful white bridge appeared just like that cool rhys said lets go sholto spoke in a ringing voice i call the wild hunt by herne and huntsman by horn and hound by wind and storm and wreck of winter i call us home the dark near the roof of the cavern split open as if someone had cut it with a knife it split open and things boiled out of it doyle turned my face away and said do not look back he began to run dragging me with him we all began to run only sholto and his uncles stayed on the island as the night itself ripped open and poured nightmares behind us chapter we made the far shore but i tripped on a skeleton buried in the ground doyle picked me up and kept running gunshots echoed and i saw frost firing at agnes as she threw herself on top of him i had a glimpse of her face something was wrong with it as if her bones were sliding around under her skin i screamed frost as a glint of metal showed in her hand more shots sounded mistral was beside frost blades flashing doyle stop i shouted he ignored me and kept running with me in his arms abe and rhys were with him we cant leave frost behind i said doyle said we cannot risk you not for anyone call a door abe said doyle glanced behind us but not at mistral and frosts fight with the nighthag he glanced higher than that it made me look up too at first my eyes perceived clouds black and grey rolling clouds or smoke but that was only my mind trying to make sense of it i thought i had seen all the sluagh had to offer but i was wrong what was pouring down toward the island where sholto stood was nothing my mind could accept when i worked for the investigative agencysometimes at a crime scene if its bad enough sometimes your mind refuses to make an image out of it its just a jumble your mind gives you a moment to not see this horrible thing if you have the chance to close your eyes and not look a second time you can save yourself this horror will not go into your mind and stain your soul at most crime scenes i didnt have the choice of not seeing but this i looked away if we didnt get away then id have to look we had to get away doyle yelled dont look call the door i did what he asked i need a door to the unseelie sithen the door appeared hanging in the middle of nowhere just like before no doors sholto screamed behind us the door vanished rhys cursed frost and mistral were with us now there was blood on their swords i glanced back at the shore and saw agnes a dark still shape on the ground doyle started running again and the others joined us call something else abe said near breathless trying to keep up with doyles pace and do it quietly so sholto cant hear what youre doing what i asked you have the power of creation he panted use it how my brain wasnt working under the pressure conjure something he said and stumbled falling he rejoined us blood pouring down his chest from a new cut let the ground be grass and gentle to our feet grass flowed at our feet like green water it didnt spread over everything like the herbs on the island the grass sprang up in a path where we ran and nowhere else try something else rhys said from the other side of us he was shorter than the rest and his voice showed the strain of keeping up with the longer legs of the others what could i call from the ground from the grass that could save us i thought it and had my answer one of the most magical of plants give me a field of fourleaf clover the grass spread out before us wide and smooth then white clover began to grow through the grass until we stood in the center of a field of it white globes of sweetsmelling flowers burst like stars across all the green doyle slowed and the others slowed with him rhys said it out loud not bad not bad at all you think well in a crisis the wild hunt is of ill intent frost said they should be stopped at the fields edge doyle sat me down amid the anklehigh clover the plants brushed against me as if they were little hands fourleaf clover is the most powerful plant protection from faerie i said aye abe said but some of what is coming does not have to walk princess make us a roof meredith doyle said a roof of what rowan thorn and ash frost said of course i said anywhere that the three trees grew together was a magical place a place both of protection and of a weakening in the reality between worlds such a place would save you from faerie or call faerie to you like so many things with us there was never a yes or no but a yes a no and a sometimes the earth underneath us trembled as if an earthquake were coming then the trees blasted out of the ground showering rock and dirt and clover over us the trees stretched to the sky with a sound like a storm or a train barreling down but with a scream of wood to it it was like nothing id ever heard before while the trees knit themselves together above our heads i looked back i could not help it sholto was covered in the nightmares he had called tentacles writhed bits and pieces that i had no word for flowed and struck there were teeth everywhere as if wind could be made solid and given fangs to tear and destroy sholtos uncles attacked the creatures with blade and muscle but they were losing losing but fighting hard enough that they had given us time to make our sanctuary frost moved to stand so that his broad chest blocked my view it is not good to gaze too long upon them there was a bloody furrow down one side of his face as if agnes had tried to claw his eyes out i made as if to touch the wound and he pulled away catching my hand in his i will heal he didnt want me to fuss over him in front of mistral if it had just been doyle and rhys he might have allowed it but he would not have mistral see him weak i wasnt sure how he felt about abe but i knew he viewed mistral as a threat men dont like to look weak in front of their rivals whatever i thought of mistral that was how frost and doyle saw him i took frosts hand and tried not to act concerned about his wounds he called the hunt why are they attacking him i asked i warned him that he looked too sidhe rhys said i wasnt saying that just to stop him from doing something dangerous to us something warm dripped over my hand i looked down to find frosts blood painting my skin i fought the spurt of panic and asked calmly how badly are you hurt the blood was coming steadily not good i will heal frost said voice tight the trees closed overhead with a sound like the ocean waves rushing along a shore leaves tore and rained down on us as the branches wove a shield of leaves thorns and bright red berries above the shadow it cast made frosts skin look grey for a moment and it frightened me you heal gunshot wounds if the bullet goes through and through you heal nonmagical blades but black agnes was a nighthag and once a goddess is your wound of blade or claw frost tried to take his hand back but i wouldnt let him unless he wanted to be appear undignified he couldnt break free our hands were covered in his blood sticky and warm doyle was at frosts side how badly are you hurt we do not have time to tend my wounds frost said he wouldnt look at doyle or any of us he arranged his face in that arrogant mask the one that made him impossibly handsome and as cold as his namesake but the terrible wounds on the right side of that face ruined the mask it was like a chink in armor he could not hide behind it nor do we have time to lose my strong right arm doyle said not if there is time to save it frost looked at him surprise showing through the mask i wondered if doyle had never in all these long years called frost the strong right arm of the darkness the look on his face suggested so and maybe it was as close as doyle would come to apologizing for abandoning him to the fight with agnes in order to save me had frost thought doyle left him behind on purpose a world of emotion seemed to pass between the two men if theyd been human men they might have exchanged some profanity or sports metaphor which is what seems to pass for terms of deepest affection between friends but they were who they were and doyle said simply remove enough weapons so we can see the wound he smiled when he said it because of all the guards frost would be the one carrying the most weapons with mistral a distant second whatever youre going to do do it fast rhys said we all looked at him and then beyond him the air boiled black grey white and horrible the hunt was coming toward us like a ribbon of nightmares it took my eyes a moment to find sholto on the island he was a small pale figure running running full out with that sidhe swiftness but fast as he was he wouldnt be fast enough what chased him moved with the swiftness of birds of wind of water it was like trying to outrun the wind you just couldnt do it doyle turned back to frost take off your jacket ill make a compress were not going to have time for more i glanced back toward the island sholtos guards his uncles tried to buy him time they offered themselves as a sacrifice to slow the hunt it worked for a while some of that fearful boil of shapes slowed and covered them i think i heard one of them scream over the high birdlike chittering of the creatures but most of the wild hunt stayed on target that target was sholto he crossed the bridge and kept running goddess help us rhys said hes coming here he finally understands what hes called into being mistral said he runs in terror now he runs to the only sanctuary he can see we stand in the middle of fourleaf clovers rowan ash and thorn the wild hunt cannot touch us here i said but my voice was soft and didnt hold the certainty i wished it had doyle had ripped frosts shirt away and torn frosts own jacket into pieces small enough to be used as compresses how bad is it i asked doyle shook his head pressing the cloth in an area that seemed to run under frosts arm and into his shoulder get us out of here meredith i will tend frost but only you can get us out the wild hunt will pass us by i said we stand in the middle of things that they cannot pass through if we were not its prey then i would agree doyle said he was trying to get frost to lie down on the clover but the other man was arguing doyle pressed harder on the wound which made frost draw a sharp breath he continued but sholto told us to run if we were sidhe he has conjured it to hunt us i started to turn away but couldnt quite tear my eyes from frost once he had been the killing frost cold frightening arrogant untouched and untouchable now he was frost and he wasnt frightening or cold and i knew the touch of his body in almost every possible way i wanted to go to him to hold his hand while doyle tended his wound merry doyle said if you do not get us out of here frost will not be the only one hurt i caught frosts gaze pain i saw there but also something hopeful or good i think he liked that i was so worried about him get us out merry frost said between gritted teeth i am fine i didnt call him a liar but i did turn away so i couldnt watch it would have distracted me too much and i didnt have time to be weak i need a door to the unseelie court i said it clearly but nothing happened try again rhys said i tried again and again nothing happened sholto said no doors mistral said apparently his word stands sholtos feet had touched the edge of the field id made he was only yards away from the first of the clover the air above him was thick with tentacles and mouths and claws i looked away from it because i couldnt think while i was staring into it call something else abe said what i asked it was rhys who said where rowan ash and thorn grow close together the veil between worlds is thinner i looked up at the circle of trees that id called into being their branches had formed a lace of roof above us they still hushed and moved above us the way the roses in the unseelie court moved as if they had more life than an ordinary tree i began to walk the inside of the circle of trees searching not with my hands but with that part of me that sensed magic most human psychics have to do something to get themselves in the mood for magic but i had to shield constantly not to be overwhelmed by it especially in faerie there was so much of it that it became like the engine noise of some great ship and you ceased to hear it after a while though it was always there thrumming along your skin making your bones vibrate to its rhythm i reached out from behind those shields and searched for a place in the trees that feltthin i couldnt look simply for magic there was too much of it around me too much power flowing toward us i needed to cast out for something more specific the clover has slowed them mistral called this made me glance back away from the trees the cloud of nightmares rolled above the clover like a pack of hounds that had lost the scent sholto just kept running his hair flying behind him the nude beauty of him beautiful in motion like watching a horse run across a field it was a beauty that transcended sex simply beautiful for its own sake concentrate merry rhys said ill help you look for a door i nodded and went back to looking only at the trees they thrummed with power inherently magical and invested with further power because they had been called into being by one of the oldest magicks rhys called from across the clearing here i ran to him the clover tapping at my legs and feet as if patting me with soft green hands i passed frost on the ground where doyle sat holding his wound frost was hurt very hurt but there was no time to help doyle would take care of him i had to take care of us all rhys was standing by a group of three of the trees that looked no different from the others really but when i put my hand out toward them it was as if reality had been rubbed thin here like a goodluck penny rubbed in your pocket you feel it rhys asked i nodded how do we open it you just walk through rhys said he looked back at the others everybody gather around we need to walk through together why i asked he grinned at me because naturally occurring doorways like this dont lead to the same place every time itd be bad if we were separated bads one way of putting it i said doyle had to help frost to his feet even so he stumbled abe came and offered his shoulder to lean on still grasping the horn cup in one hand as if it was the most important thing in the world it occurred to me then that the goddesss chalice had gone back to wherever it went when it wasnt mucking about with me i had never held on to it the way abe did with his but then i had been afraid of its power abe wasnt afraid of his cups power he was afraid of losing it again mistral was backing toward us are we waiting for the lord of shadows or leaving him to his fate it took me a second to realize he meant sholto i looked toward the lake sholto was almost here almost to the tree line the sky behind him was totally black as if the father of all storms was about to break except that instead of lightning there were tentacles and mouths that shrieked he can escape the same way rhys said the door wont close behind us i looked at him dont we want it to i dont know if we can close it but if we can merry he would be trapped there was a very serious look in his one eye a measuring look it was the look that i was beginning to dread from all the men a look that said the decision is yours could i leave sholto to die he had called the wild hunt hed offered himself as prey hed trapped us here with his no doors did i owe him i looked at what chased him i couldnt leave anyone to that so be it doyle said from beside me but we can go through ahead of him mistral said we dont have to wait youre sure hell sense the door i asked everyone answered at once mistral said yes rhys said probably doyle and frost said i do not know abe just shrugged i shook my head and whispered goddess guide me but i cant leave him i can still taste his skin on my mouth i stepped in front of the men closer to the farther edge of the trees i yelled sholto were leaving hurry hurry he stumbled fell in the clover and rolled to his feet again in a blur of motion he dived through the trees and i thought hed made it but something long and white whipped around his ankle just before it cleared the magical circle it caught him in that instant when his body was airborne not touching the clover not inside the trees the tentacle tried to lift him skyward but his hands reached desperately for the trees he caught a limb with his hands and he was left suspended feet above the ground i was running forward before i had time to think i dont know what i planned to do when i got there but i didnt have to worry because a blur of movement rushed past me mistral and doyle were there before me doyle had frosts sword in his hands he leapt into the air in an impossibly graceful arc and cut the tentacle in two i smelled ozone a second before lightning crashed from mistrals hand the lightning hit the cloud and seemed to bounce from one creature to another illuminating them it was too much light i screamed and covered my eyes but it was as if the images were carved inside my lids strong hands were on mine pulling my hands away from my eyes i kept my eyes tight shut and doyles deep voice came clawing your eyes out wont help meredith its inside you now you cant unsee it i opened my mouth and screamed i screamed and screamed and screamed doyle picked me up in his arms and started running toward the others i knew mistral and sholto were behind us whimpers replaced my screams i have no words for what id seen they were things that should not have been things that could not have been alive but they had moved i had seen them if i had been alone i would have fallen to the ground and shrieked until the wild hunt caught me instead i clung to doyle and buried my nose and mouth against the curve of his neck keeping my eyes fixed on the clover and the trees and my men i wanted to replace the images that were burned inside me it was as if i had to clean my eyes of the sight of the hunt i breathed in the scent of doyles neck his hair and it helped calm me he was real and solid and i was safe in his arms rhys moved to help abe with frost doyle still had frosts sword naked and bloody in his hand held away from me the blood smelled the way all blood smells red slightly metallic sweet if these creatures bled real blood then they couldnt be what i had seen they werent nightmares what i had seen in that lightningkissed moment was nothing that would ever bleed real blood doyle told mistral to enter first because we didnt know where the doorway led the storm lord didnt argue he just did what he was told all of us including sholto followed his broad back between the trees one moment we were in the clover circle the next we were in moonlight at the edge of a snowbanked parking lot chapter there was a marked car and several unmarked cars sitting there inside cops and fbi stared at us eyes wide we had simply appeared out of thin air i guess it was worth a stare or two how are we going to explain this rhys asked softly the car doors started opening police of all flavors poured out into the cold then there was wind at our backswarm wind and a sound like birds if birds could be too large and too frightening for words oh god rhys said theyre coming through mistral sholto hold the door closed if you can give us time doyle said mistral and sholto turned to face that warm seeking wind doyle ran toward the cars i was still in his arms the others followed though frosts wounds caused him to follow slowly behind us the police were calling to us whats wrong is the princess hurt stay in your cars and youll be safe doyle yelled the closest car held two darksuited men one was young and dark the other older and balding charles fbi the younger one said you dont give us orders if the princess is in danger i can by your own laws said doyle the older one said special agent bancroft whats happening thats not geese im hearing a uniform that was st louis city one illinois state trooper and a local precinct cop joined us apparently when the rest of the police went away after wed last dealt with them here theyd left a little bit of everybody behind no one wanted to be left out i guess if you all stay in your cars you will be safe doyle repeated one of the younger uniforms said were cops were not paid to be safe spoken like someone who is not even close to his pension another officer said one with more weight around his middle jesus one of them said i didnt have to glance back for now frost had caught up with us hed bled all over rhys so that it looked like rhys was hurt worse abe was still bleeding from falling among the bones one of the uniforms touched his shoulder radio and started requesting an ambulance doyle yelled above the growing sound of wind and birds there is no time they will be upon us in moments who bancroft asked doyle shook his head and moved around the agent he laid me in the passenger seat of the car then opened the backseat door saying put frost inside rhys i will not leave you frost said the men laid him in the seat even as he protested doyle grabbed frosts shoulder and said if i die if all of us die if the others are gone into the ground for good then you must survive you must take her back to los angeles and not return i started to get out of the car then i wont leave you doyle pushed me back into the seat he knelt down and gave me the full weight of his dark eyes meredith merry we cannot win this fight unless help arrives we will all die you have never seen this wild hunt but i have we will give them sidhe to hunt and they will ignore this car you and frost will be safe i gripped his arms so smooth so muscled so solid i wont leave you nor i frost said struggling to sit up in the backseat frost doyle almost yelled it i do not trust anyone but you and me to keep her safe if it is not to be me then it must be you bancroft said get in and drive charlie the younger agent didnt argue this time he got behind the wheel i was still holding on to doyle shaking my head over and over one of the other cops had gotten a firstaid kit out of the car bancroft took it and crawled into the back with frost no i said to doyle i am princess here not you your duty is to live doyle said i shook my head if you die im not sure i want to he kissed me then hard and fierce i tried to melt into that kiss but he tore himself away and slammed the door in my face the doors locked i glanced at the agent who said we have to get you to safety princess unlock the door i demanded he ignored me and started the engine hit the gas just then wind slammed into the car so hard that it skidded the vehicle to the side charlie fought to keep the car in the parking lot and out of the trees drive bancroft yelled drive like a son of a bitch i looked then because i had to the wild hunt had broken through and it was like the moment in the cave as if the darkness had split open and was spilling out nightmares but the nightmares were even more solid now or maybe now that id seen them i couldnt unsee them a coat flew over my face and i was left scrambling at it dont look merry frost said his voice choked dont look put on the coat princess bancroft said well get you to the hospital i held the coat in my arms but turned to look back the police were shooting at the hunt mistral lit the sky with lightning and one of the police crumbled to the ground was he screaming the horror spilled over sholto and he was lost to it doyle leapt toward the tentacles and teeth the sword glittering in the moonlight i screamed his name but the last thing i saw before we drove into the dark was doyle lost under a weight of nightmares chapter frosts hand grabbed my shoulder pressing me against the seat merry please dont make doyles sacrifice in vain i touched his hand pressed it against me and there was more blood on it how can i let them drive us to safety and not fight it you must i am too hurt to help and you are too fragile i would willingly die with them but you must not die agent charlie had us on the narrow road driving a little too fast for the darkness and the snow he hit ice and skidded slow down or youre going to put us in a ditch bancroft said and you frost right you need to lie back and let me finish putting pressure on this wound you bleed to death and you cant keep the princess safe did you see it charlie said as he slowed down did you see it i saw it bancroft said in a strained voice he pulled on frost let me take care of the wound like your captain ordered frost let go of me slowly his hand pulling away i started drawing the trench coat over me i didnt know whose coat it was but i was cold cold in a way that the coat wouldnt help yet it was all i had agent charlie slowed at a sharp turn and i caught a glimpse of something in the trees it wasnt the wild hunt and it wasnt our men stop i said he slowed further almost stopped what what is it i saw them in the trees goblins goblins walking in single file cloaked for the cold bristling with weapons in the cold light of the moon they were walking away from the fight though some of them glanced back that was enough to tell me they knew what was happening and they were leaving my men to die drive bancroft said stop i ordered agent charlie ignored me the car picked up speed stop i repeated there are goblins out there they can tip the balance they can save my men were doing what your guard demanded bancroft said were going to a hospital i had to stop the car i had to talk to the goblins they were my allies they had to help if i asked it or be forsworn i reached over touched the agents face and thought about sex id never done this to a human before never used that part of my heritage for evil and it was evil i didnt know him didnt want him but i made him want me the agent slammed on the brakes throwing me into the dash and throwing the men in the back into the floorboards bancroft yelled what the hell are you doing agent charlie threw the car into park skewing halfway across the road he unbuckled his seat belt pulled me toward him and started trying to kiss me his hands everywhere i didnt care as long as the car was stopped bancroft came over the seat charlie for gods sake charlie stop i took advantage of the fight to reach across and unlock the door while the men fought almost on top of me i opened the door and fell backward into the road charlie tried to crawl after me bancroft slid over the seat and on top of his partner i got to my feet on the icy road huddling under the coat the goblins were there in the dark just outside the headlight beams two faces looked at me two nearly identical faces ash and holly the wind blew their yellow hair from their hoods i couldnt tell which twin was which in the uncertain light the only difference was eye color hail goblins i called one of them touched the other and nodded toward the dark they began to turn and leave i yelled i call on you as allies to deny me is to be forsworn the wild hunt is abroad and oathbreakers are sweet meat to them the twins turned back to us and the goblins who were only dark shapes behind them shifted in the dimness we did not make this oath one of them called kurag goblin king did and you are his people do you call your king a liar are you king now among the goblins holly i had taken a chance on that i wasnt certain which brother it was but id guessed based on the fact that holly had the worse attitude of the two he bowed his head in acknowledgment the princess sees well in the dark she merely has good ears his brother said you complain more ash started down the side of the road ignoring my plea and some of the others followed most stayed in the shadows along the roads edge there had to be nearly twenty of them it was enough to make a difference enough maybe to savemy men i heard a car door open behind me frost crawled out and fell into the snow and ice of the road i went to him but kept my gaze on the goblins this is not our fight holly said i need your help as my allies that makes it your fight i said or have the goblins lost their taste for battle you do not battle the wild hunt princess you run from it you join it you hide from it but you dont fight it ash said i could see his green eyes now his hood framed a face as handsome as any at the unseelie court goldenhaired only the pure pupilless green of his eyes and a bulkier body under the cloak betrayed his mixed heritage will you be forsworn i asked i clung to frosts hand in the snow no ash said but he was not happy about it we came out to see what the fuss was one of the other goblins said not get ourselves killed for a bunch of sidhe the goblin was almost twice as broad as any sidhe he turned into the light a face that was covered in hard round bumps get a good look princess he threw back his cloak so i could see more of him his arms were as covered as his face in bumps and growths marks of beauty among the goblins but these bumps were pastel colors pink lavender mint green not a skin tone that the goblins could boast thats right im half sidhe he said just like them but im not so pretty am i by goblin standards you are the more handsome i said he blinked eyes that bulged slightly from his face but you dont judge by goblin standards do you princess i ask as your ally for your aid i ask as a bloodoathed ally to your king that the goblins aid me call kurag and summon more goblins why dont you call the sidhe the bumpy goblin asked truth was i wasnt certain there was anyone left who would risk themselves against the great hunt for me nor was i sure whether the queen would let them she had been so unhappy with me when last we met are you saying that a goblin is a lesser warrior than a sidhe i asked avoiding the question no one is a greater warrior than the goblins he said ash said you dont know if the sidhe will come i was out of time to prevaricate further no i dont i admitted aid me ash help me as my ally help us beg holly said beg for our aid the goblins seek to delay frost said voice hoarse they seek to delay until the fight is over cowards i gazed up at the three tall goblins and the others waiting in the shadows i did the only thing i could think of i searched frost until i found a gun i pulled it free of the holster and got to my feet bancroft had finally handcuffed his partner to the steering wheel though agent charlie was still trying to get free and get to me bancroft joined us in the snow what are you going to do princess im going to go back and fight i hoped that in the face of my determination the goblins could do naught but join no bancroft said and started to reach across frost toward me i pointed the gun at him and clicked off the safety i have no quarrel with you agent bancroft he had gone very still glad to hear it now give me the gun i started to back away from him im going back to help my men shes bluffing the warty goblin said no frost said shes not he struggled to his feet then fell back into the snow merry bancroft get him to the hospital i aimed the gun skyward and started running back the way wed come i tried to think of summers heat tried to bring the idea of warmth to my shields but all i could feel was the ice under my feet if i was human enough to get frostbite id lose feeling soon ash and holly came up beside me one on either side they loped along while i ran my fastest they could have outdistanced me and gotten to the fight sooner but theyd only obey the letter of our agreement if i fought and asked for help then they had to help me but they didnt have to get to the fight one second before i did i prayed goddess help me and my allies to arrive in time to save my people i felt someone pounding up behind us but did not glance back it was just one of the larger goblins then hands silvergrey in the moonlight before i knew it i was cradled against a chest almost as wide as i was tall jonty the red cap was ten feet of goblin muscle he glanced down at me with eyes that in good light would be as red as if he looked at the world through a spill of fresh blood his eyes were a match for hollys it had made me wonder if the goblin half of the twins was a red cap the blood that dripped continuously from the cap on his head shone in the light little drops of it were flung behind him as he picked up speed and raced toward the fight the red caps had earned their name by dipping their caps in the blood of enemies once to be warlord among them you had to have enough magic to keep the blood dripping indefinitely jonty was the only red cap id ever met who could do the trick though he wasnt a warlord because the red caps were no longer a kingdom unto themselves ash and holly were forced to stretch to keep up with the much bigger man jonty was a small giant even among them they had been in charge of this expedition but goblins are a tough lot if they let jonty reach the fight first if they showed themselves weaker slower than him then they might not be in charge at the end of the night goblin society is survival of the fittest i cradled the gun carefully pointing it away from jonty no one got ahead of us no one else had the length of leg and the others were fighting just to keep pace such a big creature but he ran with the grace and speed of something lithe and beautiful i asked him why help me in his deep voice like gravel he said i swore a personal oath to protect you i will not be forsworn he leaned over me so that a drop of that magical blood fell upon my face he whispered the goddess and god still speak to me i whispered back you heard my prayer he gave a small nod i touched his face and my hand came away covered in blood warm blood i cuddled closer into the warmth of him he raised his eyes again and ran faster chapter the sky boiled with storm clouds over the small woods that bordered the parking lot the wild hunt wasnt a tentacled nightmare anymore it looked like a storm if storms could hover against the tops of trees and drape like black silk dripping between the trunks lightning flashed from the ground into the clouds mistral was still alive and fighting back who else green flame flickered through the trees and something hard and tight in my chest eased that flame was doyles hand of power he was alive as well in that moment nothing else really mattered to me not crown not kingdom not faerie itself nothing mattered except that doyle was alive and not so hurt he could not fight ash and holly put on a burst of speed so that they were ahead of jonty and me as we neared the open area closest the trees there wasnt enough cover to hide anything in the open field until from thin shadows goblins appeared they didnt materialize but emerged like a sniper hidden in his gillie suit in the field except that the only camouflage the goblins had was their own skin and clothes ash had called kurag goblin king as we ran to this place to do so he had bared his sword and put a hand on my shoulder to come away with blood to smear upon the blade blood and blade old magic that worked long before cell phones were a dream in a humans mind personally i wouldnt have wanted to run on the icy road with a bared blade but ash wasnt human and he made it all look easy ash and his brother ran ahead of jonty whoever got to the rendezvous first would lead the goblins without argument but i didnt care as long as we saved my men i didnt care who led i would have followed anyone in that moment to save them one of the brothers fell to talking with the waiting force it wasnt until the other brother got close enough for his eyes to flash crimson that i knew it was holly come back to jonty and me holly was struggling to breathe normally outrunning someone whose legs were almost as tall as he was took more effort than was pretty even for a warrior as formidable as he his voice held only a hint of the breathlessness that made his shoulders and chest rise and fall so rapidly the archers will be ready in moments we need the princess i am not much of an archer i said still cradled in the heat of jontys body and the blood the blood that flowed from his cap down to my body was warm warm as if it spilled from a freshly opened wound holly gave me a look that appeared irritated even in the forgiving glow of moonlight you carry the hand of blood he said he let that anger that was always just below the surface for him fall into his voice i nearly asked what that had to do with archers but the moment before i said it i did know oh i said unless kitto exaggerated what you did in los angeles to the nameless holly added i shook my head the warm blood creeping down my neck between my skin and the borrowed trench coat the blood should have been disturbing but it wasnt it felt like a warm blanket on a cold night comforting no kitto didnt exaggerate i said i didnt like that kitto had borne tales to the goblins but forced myself to accept that he was half theirs and still had to answer to their king hed probably had little choice in what he told them the full hand of blood holly said and his voice wasnt so much angry as skeptical hard to believe it lies in such a fragile creature look at my cap if you doubt her power jonty rumbled holly gazed upward but his eyes didnt stay on the cap long his gaze slid down to me and something in that look was both sexual and predatory i could feel the blood plastering the back of my hair my shoulders arms i must have looked like an accident victim most men would have found it frightening but holly looked at me as if id covered myself with perfume and lingerie one mans nightmare anothers fantasy he reached a hand up tentatively as if he thought either jonty or i would protest when we didnt he touched my shoulder i think he meant to merely get a touch of blood on his fingers but the moment his fingers brushed me a look of wonder came over his face he leaned in toward me the wonder being eaten by something that was part desire and part violence what have you been doing princess to feel like this i dont know what youre feeling so i dont know how to answer my voice was small of all the men id agreed to have sex with holly and his brother were the ones who gave me the most pause jontys arms tightened around me almost possessively that was both good and bad if all of jonty was in proportion then i could not satisfy him and live to tell the tale but it was hard to tell with the red cap his possessiveness might have had nothing to do with sex and everything to do with the blood magic holly drew his hand from my shoulder he began to lick the blood from his hand like a cat that has dipped its paw in your glass of milk his eyes fluttered closed as he licked she calls your blood he said in a low voice better suited for a bedroom than a battlefield yes jonty said and that one word from him had the same overly intimate tone i was missing something but did not want to admit that i didnt know what was happening or why they were so fascinated with the fact that touching me made the red cap bleed more at a loss i changed the subject if you want me to call blood from our enemies we need to get closer to the archers i fought to keep my voice matteroffact as if i knew exactly what was happening and either didnt care or took it completely in stride and who will hold you while you call blood so those dainty feet do not touch the cold ground holly said i will stand on my own i will hold you jonty said you are a goblin jonty goblins fight among themselves as sport which means it is likely there is at least a nick somewhere on your body if you have a wound even a small one when i call blood i will bleed you too i am no red cap to brawl for the sake of brawling i save my flesh for other things holly said he licked the last of the blood from his hand in a long smooth movement that should have been sensual but managed to be mostly just unnerving i will stand on my own i repeated your brother waves to get our attention jonty said then to holly and moved forward holly hesitated as if he would block our way but then moved aside speaking as jonty passed him i will see you survive this night princess for i mean to have you i remember our bargain holly i called back the smaller goblin hurried to keep up with jontys longer strides it was like a child running after an adult though holly wouldnt have thanked me for the comparison i hear reluctance in your voice princess and the sex will be all the sweeter for it do not torment her on the edge of battle holly jonty said holly didnt argue he just abandoned the topic for the time being the archers will cut them for you but you have to weaken them enough to bring them down he said to me i know what you want me to do you dont sound certain i didnt voice my doubts but this was a wild hunt a true wild hunt which meant it was the essence of faerie the creatures could bleed but how do you kill something that is formed of pure magic this was ancient magic chaos magic primeval and horrible how do you kill such things even if i bled them enough to bring them to earth could they be truly slain by blade and ax i had never heard of anyone fighting and winning against such a hunt of course i had never heard that the spectral hunts could bleed if cut sholto had called this one into being using magic that he and i had raised as a couple was it my mortal blood that had made the hunt vulnerable to bleeding was my mortality truly contagious as some of my enemies claimed following this idea to its logical extension meant that if i sat on the throne of our court it would condemn all of the sidhe to age and die but at this moment if my mortal flesh had made this hunt mortal in turn i was grateful for it it meant they could bleed and die and i needed them to die we needed to win this battle i would not spread my mortality through all of faerie but to have shared it with these creatures well that would be a blessing chapter the arrows cut the night sky like black wounds across the stars vanishing into the boiling black silk of the clouds we waited in the winter night for screams to let us know the bolts had found their mark but there was nothing but silence i stood on the ground pulling the borrowed trench coat around me i stood on hollys cloak which he had thrown on the ground to keep my bare feet from the rough ground and the cold the cloak gets in the way of my ax hed said as if he were afraid that i might think he was being gentlemanly then he moved forward to be with his brother and the other warriors only jonty and one other red cap stayed back with me though every red cap who had come out tonight a dozen of them had touched me before they went to take their place in the ranks they had laid their mouths in a strange sort of kiss against my shoulder where the coat hung heavy with blood from jontys cap one had caught the coat in his pointed teeth and torn it before jonty had slapped him away the ones who came after had widened the hole until the lips of the last few touched my bare shoulder where the blood had begun to dry to my skin i had neither offered the red caps the familiarity nor been asked jonty had called them and spoken in a gaelic so old that i could not follow it whatever jonty had said to them had turned their faces to me and the look in their eyes was that odd mix of sex hunger and eagerness that id seen in holly i hadnt understood the look and hadnt had time to question it but because it cost me nothing to have their lips pressed to my shoulder i allowed it then i noticed that each of the red caps who touched me began bleeding afresh after touching jontys blood on my body i was fighting an urge to scream my impatience at them but the red caps werent the ones delaying the other goblins squabbled about who would go where if kurag goblin king had come there would have been no arguments but ash and holly though feared warriors were not kings and all other leadership among the goblins is a constant state of struggle the goblin society represented the ultimate in darwinian evolution only the strongest survive and only the very strongest lead if i had been truly queen enough to lead them they would have done what i ordered but i didnt have their respect yet so i knew better than to try to lead here it would have undermined ash and holly and gained me nothing besides battlefield tactics wasnt my strongest suit and i knew that my father had drilled into me from an early age to know my strengths and weaknesses find allies who complement you hed said true friendship is a type of love and all love has power jonty leaned over me and said call your hand of power princess how do you know they are hurt we are goblins he said as if that settled it another line of green flame flickered through the trees and i was close enough now to see the black tendrils back away from it i didnt argue again but called the hand of blood i concentrated on my left hand it didnt emit a beam of power or anything like you see in the movies it was simply that the mark or key to the hand of blood lay in the palm of my left hand or maybe doorway was a better term i opened the mark in the palm of that hand and though there was nothing to see with the naked eye there was plenty to feel it was as if the blood in my veins had suddenly turned to molten metal my blood tried to boil with the power of it i screamed and thrust my hand toward the cloud i projected that burning tearing power outward i realized in that moment that it wasnt just the archers who were shooting blind i had never before tried to use the hand of blood on a target i could not see for a heartbeat the power turned back on me and every small scrape id accumulated in the past twentyfour hours bled each tiny wound bled like a fountain and i fought my body fought my own magic to keep it from destroying me lightning struck the cloud and illuminated it as it had inside the sluaghs mound but i wasnt horrified this time i was joyous a fierce triumphant joy if i could see it i could make it bleed i had the blink of an eye to spot my targets a breath to see that the tentacled mass was white and silver and gold not the black and grey and white it had been i had an instant to note that the hunt had a terrible beauty before i thrust my power toward that shining mass and screamed bleed green flame climbed up the trees and lightning flared behind it so that both powers met mine in the cloud at the same instant the cloud flashed green in reflected color i called for blood and black fountains of it exploded into the greenyellow flare the light died leaving the night blacker than before my night vision had been ruined from staring into the light something spattered against the left side of my face something that felt wet but carried no shock of temperature difference only two things feel like that water at body temperature and very fresh blood if i had been a warrior i would have whirled gun up but i turned slowly like a character in a horror movie who doesnt really want to see the blow before it falls all that met my eyes was the shortest of my red cap guards bithek someone had sliced open his scalp to spill blood in a gory mask down his face so that even his eyes were lost to the dark flow of it then he shook his head like a wet dog spattering me with warm drops i closed my eyes put up a protecting hand jontys chided bithek youre wasting the blood but so much cant keep it out of my eyes id forgotten that it was ever like this bithek growled i looked behind me at jonty and found him as bloody as the other guard it made me look around at all of them they were all covered in blood but even by moonlight and starlight i could see now that the blood welled from the caps on their heads your magic brings our blood princess jonty said i dont understand make them bleed for us the last red cap said i looked at him i cant remember your name i said for this magic i would follow you nameless princess meredith bleed our enemies and cover us in their blood i turned away from the red caps i didnt understand completely but trusted one mystery at a time later later i would unravel it all even facing away from the red caps i could still feel them it was as if their power complemented mine fed it no our powers fed each other they were like a warm battery at my back comforting energizing i threw that warmth that weight of power against our enemies i called their blood by the flash of lightning and the flicker of greengold flame i called their blood and knew that the red caps at my back bled with them i could feel it the ones who waited ahead of us bled too a goblin came running toward us in a blurring speed that would have done any sidhe proud he was no taller than me but had four arms to my two and a face that was noseless and strangely unfinished he dropped to his knees and would not meet my eyes he actually put two of his arms on the ground and abased himself striking because in goblin society the lower you go the more respect you feel for the person youre addressing i didnt usually get that kind of greeting from anybody he said a message from ash and holly aim your magic better princess before you bleed us all to death now i understood why he was abasing himself he had been afraid id take the message badly tell them ill aim better i said wryly he ducked his head bumping his forehead to the earth then sprang to his feet and raced back the way he had come i drew my magic back swallowed the hand of blood the pain was instantaneous grinding and sharp like broken glass flowing through my veins i screamed my pain wordlessly but kept the magic inside me i fought to visualize the creatures inside the cloud tentacles veined with silver and gold white and pure muscled magic i fell to my knees with the pain jonty reached for me and i hissed no dont touch me the magic wanted to bleed someone anyone and his touch would make him the target i closed my eyes so i could mentally draw the picture of what i sought when i could see it shining and writhing across the inside of my eyes i reached my left hand out again and threw that brokenglass pain into the image my pain intensified for a shining breathless moment all there was in that second was the pain so much pain then it eased and i could breathe againand i knew the hand of blood was busy elsewhere i kept my eyes closed so nothing else could catch my eye i was afraid that if i saw the goblin warriors again id bleed them by accident i knew what i wanted to bleed and that was above their heads in the sky i thought about all the beautiful things that could have flown above their heads did it have to be frightening there was such beauty in faerie why did it have to be nightmarish i heard the sound of wings whistling overhead and opened my eyes id fallen to the ground on top of ashs cloak though i didnt remember falling above us so close that the great white wings brushed jontys head were swans swans gleaming white in the moonlight there had to be more than twenty of them and had i seen what i thought i saw on their necks and shoulders chains and collars of gold it couldnt be this was the stuff of legends it was the nameless red cap who voiced my thought they had chains on their necks i heard the wild call of geese next they flew just overhead following the line the swans had taken i got to my feet stumbling on the edge of the borrowed trench coat jonty caught me but it didnt seem to hurt him or me i felt light and airy as if the hand of blood had become something else what had i been thinking just before the swans flew overhead that the beauty in faerie was too often nightmarish there was a flight of cranes then my fathers bird one of his symbols the cranes flew low and seemed to dip their wings at us almost in a salute they fall shouted bithek i looked where he pointed the storm cloud had vanished and with it most of the creatures there had been so many a writhing mass of them but now there were only a few less than ten maybe and one of them had already crashed through the trees a second fell earthward and i heard the sharp crack of the trees breaking under the weight like a cannon shot and men scattered too far away for me to know who was who was doyle safe was mistral had the magic worked in time inside my head i could finally admit it was doyle i most needed to survive i loved rhys but not like i loved doyle i let myself own that i let myself admit at least inside my own head that if doyle died part of me would die as well it had been the moment at the car when hed shoved frost and me inside and given me to frost if not me it must be you hed said to frost i loved frost too but id had my revelation if i could have chosen my king this moment i knew who it would be pity that i wasnt the one doing the choosing figures started toward us and the goblins parted to form a corridor for my guards when i finally recognized that tall dark figure something in my chest eased and i was suddenly crying i started walking toward him then i didnt feel the frozen grass under my bare feet i didnt feel when broken stubble cut me then i was running with the red caps jogging beside me i picked up the edges of the borrowed coat like a dress and held it out of my way so i could run to him doyle wasnt alone dogs huge black dogs milled around his legs suddenly i remembered a vision id had of him with dogs like this and the ground tilted under my feet vision and reality melding before my eyes the dogs reached me first pressing warm muscled fur against me where i knelt their great panting breath hot on my face as i held my hands out to touch them their black fur ran with a tingling rush of magic the bodies writhed under my hand the fur growing less coarse smoothing the bodies less dense i looked up into the face of a racing hound white and sleek with ears a shining red the other hounds face was half red and half white as if some hand had drawn a line down the center of it id never seen anything so beautiful as that face then doyle was standing in front of me and i threw myself into his arms he lifted me off the ground and hugged me so hard it almost hurt but i wanted him to hold me hard i wanted to feel the reality of his body against me i wanted to know he was alive i needed to touch him to know it was true i needed him to touch me and let me know that he was still my darkness still my doyle he whispered into my hair merry merry merry i clung to him wordless and wept chapter everyone lived even the human policemen though some were driven mad by what they had seen abeloec fed them from his cup of horn and they fell into a magical sleep destined to wake with no memory of the horrors they had seen magic isnt always bad the black dogs were a miracle they changed depending on who touched them abes touch turned the great black dogs into lapdogs to lie before a cozy fire white with red markings faerie dogs mistrals touch turned them to huge irish wolfhounds not the pale slender ones of today but the giants that the romans had feared so much these were the hounds that could snap the spine of a horse with their bite someone elses touch turned a dog into a greenfurred cu sith that loped off toward the seelie mound what would their king taranis think of its return hed probably try to take credit for it claim it as proof of his power in the midst of the return of so much that was lost other things much more precious were returned to me galens voice shouting my name turned me in doyles arms he was running across the snowy field with flowers following in his wake as if wherever he stepped spring returned all the rest who had vanished into the dead gardens were with him nicca appeared with a following of the winged demifey amatheon was there with the tattoo of a plow gleaming like neon blood on his chest i saw hawthorne his dark hair starred with living blossoms adairs hair burned around him like a halo of fire so bright it obscured his face as he moved aisling walked in a cloud of singing birds he was nude except for a piece of black gauze that hed wrapped around his face onilwyn was the only one who did not come i thought the garden had kept him until i heard another voice shrieking my name in the distance then i heard onilwyns frantic cry no my lord no it cannot be i whispered looking up at doyle watching fear cross his face too it is he nicca said galen wrapped himself around me as if i were the last solid thing in the world doyle moved so he could embrace me as well its my fault galen whispered i didnt mean to do it aisling spoke and the flock of birds sang as if they were moved to joy by the sound of his voice we reemerged in the hallway of mortality major magic doesnt work there thats why were all so helpless to stop the torture rhys said we came out of the walls and floors and trees and flowers and shining marble came with us aisling said the hallway is forever changed galen started to shake and i held him as hard as i could i was buried alive he said i couldnt breathe i didnt need to breathe but my body kept trying to do it i came up through the floor screaming he collapsed to his knees while i fought to hold him the queen was walling up neryss clan alive amatheon said galen did not take well to that after his time in the earth galen shook as if he were having a fit as if every muscle were fighting itself as if he were cold though fevered it was too much power and too much fear adairs glow had dimmed enough so that i could see his eyes galen said no prisoners no walls the walls melted away and flowers sprang up in the cells he hadnt understood how much power he had gained another shriek approached in the distance cousin doyle said galens exhortation no prisoners freed cel galen started to cry im sorry he said onilwyn and the queen herself and some of her guard are wrestling cel even now hawthorne said or he would be here already trying to harm the princess he is quite mad aisling said and he is intent on hurting all of us but most especially you princess the queen told us to run back to the western lands shes hoping hell grow more calm with time hawthorne said even by starlight he looked doubtful she has admitted before her nobles that she cannot guarantee your safety aisling said we should flee if we are going to hawthorne said i realized what he meant if cel attacked me now here like this we would be within our rights to kill him if we could my guards were sworn to protect and cel was no match for the strength and magic that stood with me now not alone he wasnt if i thought the queen would allow his death to go unpunished i would say stay fight doyle said one of the great black mastiffs nudged galen he reached for it almost automatically and it changed before my eyes it became a sleek white hound with one red ear it licked the tears from galens face and he stared at it in wonder as if he hadnt seen the dogs until that moment then came cels voice broken almost unrecognizable merry his screams broke off abruptly the silence was almost more frightening than the shouting and my heart was suddenly pounding hard in my chest what happened i called out andais walked over the rise of the last gentle hill following galens trail of flowers she was alone save for her consort eamon they were almost the same height their long black hair streaming out behind them in a wind that came from nowhere andais was dressed as if she were going to a halloween ball and you were meant to fear her beauty eamons clothes were more sedate and also all black the fact that andais arrived with only him at her side meant she didnt want extra witnesses eamon was the only one who knew all her secrets cel will sleep for a time she called as if in answer to a question we hadnt asked galen fought to stand while i steadied him doyle moved a little in front of me some of the others did too the rest looked behind us into the night as if they suspected their queen of treachery eamon might be on my side some of the time he might even hate cel but he would never go against his queen andais and eamon stopped far enough away that they were out of easy weapon range the goblins watched them and us from a tight huddled knot as if they werent sure whose side they were on i didnt blame them for id be going back to la and they would be staying here i could force kurag their king to lend me warriors but i couldnt expect his men to follow me into exile meredith niece of mine child of my brother essus greetings shed chosen a greeting that acknowledged i was her bloodline she was trying to be reassuring she was just so bad at it i stepped forward until she could see me but not beyond the protective circle of the men queen andais aunt of mine sister of my father essus greetings you must go back to the western lands tonight meredith said andais yes i answered andais looked at the hounds that still milled among the men rhys finally let himself touch them and they became terriers of breeds long forgotten some white and red others a good solid black and tan the queen tried to call one of the dogs to her the big mastiffs were what the humans called hell hounds though they had nothing to do with the christian devil the big black dogs would have matched the queens costume but they ignored her these wish hounds the hounds of faerie would not go to the hand of the queen of air and darkness had i been her i would have knelt in the snow and coaxed them but andais did not kneel to anyone or anything she stood straight and beautiful and colder than the snow around her feet two other hounds had come to my hands and they now bumped against me on either side leaning in to be petted i did it because in faerie we touch someone when they ask the moment i stroked that silken fur i felt better braver more confident a little less afraid of what was about to happen dogs meredith couldnt you return our horses to us or our cattle instead there were pigs in my vision i said not dogs she said her voice matteroffact as if nothing special had happened i saw dogs in a different vision when i was still in the western lands true vision then she said her voice still bland and faintly condescending apparently so i said ruffling the ear of the taller of the hounds you must leave now meredith and take this wild magic with you wild magic is not so easily tamed aunt andais i said i will take back with me what will go but some of it is flying free even as we speak i saw the swans andais said but no crows you are so terribly seelie the seelie would say otherwise i said go go back to where you came from take your guards and your magic and leave me the wreck of my son it was tantamount to admitting that if cel fought me tonight he would die i will go only if i can take all the guards who would come with me i said it as firmly and bravely as i could you cannot have mistral she said i fought not to look for him at my back fought not to see his big hands touching the huge hounds that his caress had brought into being yes i said i remember what you told me in the dead gardens that i could not keep him you will not argue with me she asked would it do any good the tiniest hint of anger seeped into my voice the hounds tucked themselves tighter against my legs leaning in for all they were worth as if they would remind me not to lose control the only thing that will call mistral from my side to yours in the western lands is if you come up pregnant if you become with child i will have to let go of any who could be the father if i become with child i will send word i said and fought to keep my voice even mistral was going to suffer for being with me i could see it in her face feel it in her voice i do not know what to wish for anymore meredith your magic runs through my sithen changing it into something bright and cheerful there is a field of flowers in my torture chamber what do you want me to say aunt andais i wanted the magic of faerie to be reborn but you are not enough my brothers daughter you will make of us only another seelie court to dance and parade before the human press you will make us beautiful but destroy that which makes us different i would humbly disagree with that said a voice from the crowd of my men sholto stepped forward his tattoo had become a nest of real tentacles again glowing and pale and strangely beautiful like some underwater sea creature some anemone or jellyfish it was the first time id ever seen him display his extra bits with pride he stood tall with the spear and knife of bone in his hands at his side was a huge white hound with different red markings on each of its three heads sholto used the side of the hand that held the knife to rub the top of one of the huge heads sholto spoke again merry makes us beautiful yes my queen but the beauty is stranger than anything the seelie court would allow within their doors andais gazed at sholto and for a moment i thought i saw regret sholtos magic rode him and power breathed off him into the night you had him she said to me simply yes i said how was it it was our coming together that raised the wild hunt she shivered and there was a hunger on her face that frightened me amazing perhaps i will try him some night sholto spoke again there was a time my queen when the thought of a chance at your bed would have filled me with joy but i truly know now that i am king sholto of the sluagh the lord of that which passes between lord of shadows i will no longer take crumbs from the table of any sidhe she made a sharp sound almost a hiss you must be an amazing bit of ass meredith one fuck with you and they all turn against me to that there was no safe answer so i said nothing i stood in the midst of my men with the weight and press of the hounds milling around us would she have been more aggressive if the dogs war dogs most of them had not been there was she afraid of the magic or the more solid form the magic had taken one of the small terriers growled and it was like a signal to the others the night was suddenly thick with growls a low chorus that shivered down my spine i petted the heads of those i could touch hushing them the goddess had sent me guardians i understood that now i thanked her for it cels guards who did not take oath to him you promised they could go with me i said i will not strip him of all signs of my favor she answered and her anger seemed to crackle on the cold air you gave your word i insisted the dogs gave another low chorus of growls the terriers began to bark as terriers will i realized in that moment that the wild hunt was not gone only changed these were the hounds of the wild hunt these were the hounds of legend that hunted oathbreakers through the winter wood do not dare to threaten said andais eamon touched her arm she jerked away from him but seemed chastened the wild hunt had been a great leveler of the mighty once you became their prey the hunt did not end until the quarry was dead i do not believe i am the huntsman i said it would be a bad night queen andais to be an oathbreaker doyles deep molasses voice seemed to hang on the night as if his words had more weight on the still winter air than they should have are you the huntsman darkness would you punish me for breaking faith it is wild magic your majesty there is sometimes little choice when it fills you you become an instrument of the magic and it uses you for its own ends magic is a tool to be wielded not some force one allows oneself to be overcome by as you will queen andais but i ask that you do not test these hounds tonight somehow it seemed doyle wasnt talking about just the dogs i will honor my word she said in a voice that made it clear that she did so only because she had no choice she had never been a gracious loser not in anything large or small but you must leave now meredith this moment we need time to send for the other guards i said i will bring all those who wish to come to you meredith sholto said i turned and there was an assurance in him a strength that had not been there before he stood there with his deformity plain to see he now made it seem just another part of him though a part that would have been as surely missed as an arm or a leg if it were gone had being stripped of his extra bits made him realize he valued them maybe it was his revelation not mine you would side with her andais said i am king of the sluagh i will see that an oath given and accepted is honored remember queen andais that the sluagh was the only wild hunt left in faerie until tonight and i am the huntsman of the sluagh she took a step toward him as if in threat but eamon pulled her back he whispered urgently against her cheek i could not hear what he said but the tension left her body until she allowed herself to lean back against him she let him hold her in the face of those who were not her friends she let eamons arms hold her go meredith take all that is yours and go her voice was almost neutral almost free of that rage that always seemed to bubble just underneath her skin your majesty rhys said we cannot go to the human airport like this his gesture seemed to note how many of the guards were naked and bloody the terriers at his feet gave happy barks as if it looked all right to them sholto spoke again i will take you to the edge of the western sea just as i took the sluagh when we hunted meredith in los angeles i looked at him and shook my head i thought you came by plane he laughed and it was a joyous sound did you picture the dark host of the sluagh on some human airplane sipping wine and ogling the flight attendants i laughed with him i hadnt thought about it that clearly you are the sluagh i didnt question how you got to me i will walk the edge of the field where it touches the woods it is an inbetween place neither field nor forest i will walk you will all follow and we will be at the edge of the western sea where it touches the shore i am the lord of the between places meredith i didnt think any royals could still travel so far rhys said i am the king of the sluagh cromm cruach master of the last wild hunt of faerie i have certain gifts indeed the queen said drily use those gifts shadowspawn and take these rabble from my sight shed used the nickname that the sidhe called him behind his back but that even she had never used to his face before your disdain cannot touch me tonight for i have seen wonders he held up the weapons of bone as if she had missed them before i hold the bones of my people i know my worth if id been closer to him i would have embraced him probably just as well that i wasnt as it might have ruined the power of the moment but i promised myself to give him a hug the moment we had some privacy i loved seeing that he valued himself at last i heard a sound like the breaking of ice frost i said we cant leave him behind didnt the fbi take him to the hospital doyle asked i shook my head i dont think so i looked out across the snow i couldnt see anything buti started moving and the hounds followed at my side i started to run across the snow and felt the first sharp pain in my cut feet i ignored it and ran faster time and distance shortened as they never before had outside the sithen one minute i was with the others the next i was miles away in the fields beside the road my twin hounds had stayed with me and half a dozen of the black mastiffs were there too frost lay in the snow unmoving as if he couldnt feel the dogs snuffling at him or my hands turning him over the drifts underneath him were soaked with blood and his eyes were closed his face was so cold i lowered my lips to his and whispered his name frost please please dont leave me his body convulsed and his breath rattled back into his chest death seemed to be reversed his eyes fluttered open and he tried to reach for me but his hand fell back into the snow too weak i lifted his hand to my face and held it there i held his hand there while it grew warm against my skin i cried and he found his voice hoarse he whispered the cold cannot kill me oh frost he raised his other hand and touched the tears on my face do not weep for me merry you love me i heard it i was leaving but i heard your voice and i couldnt leave not if you loved me i cradled his head in my lap and wept his other hand the one that i wasnt clutching brushed the fur of one of the huge black dogs the dog stretched and grew tall and white a shining white stag stood over us it had a collar of holly and looked like some yule card brought to life it pranced in the snow then ran in a white blur across the snow until it was lost to sight what magic is abroad this night frost whispered the magic that will take you home doyle spoke from behind us he fell to his knees in the snow beside frost and took his hand the next time i send you to a hospital you are to go frost managed a wan smile i could not leave her doyle nodded as if that made perfect sense i dont think the magic will last until morning rhys said they were all there trailing behind except mistral he was with the queen i supposed i hadnt even gotten to say goodbye but for tonight rhys said i am cromm cruach and i can help he knelt on the other side of frost and laid hands on him above where his clothing was black with blood rhys was suddenly formed of white light not just his hands but all of him glowing his hair moved in the wind of his own magic frosts body jerked upward leaving my lap and our hands he fell back against doyle and me and said in a voice that was almost his own that hurt sorry about that said rhys but im not a healer not really there is too much of death in my power to make it painless frost touched his own shoulder and chest taking his hands from out of doyles and mine if you are not a healer then why do i feel healed old magic rhys said the morning light will find this magic gone how can you be certain doyle asked the voice of the god in my head tells me so no one questioned after that we just accepted it as true sholto led us to the edge of the field and forest the dogs moved around us some choosing their masters others making it plain that they did not belong to anyone here the ones that chose among us followed as sholto walked but the other black dogs began to fall back and vanish into the night as if we had imagined them the hound at my side bumped my hand for a pat as if to remind me that it was real i wasnt certain the hounds would stay but they seemed magically to give each of us what we needed tonight galen walked surrounded by dogs circled by sleeklooking greyhounds and a trio of small dogs dancing at his feet they made him smile and helped chase the shadows from his face doyle moved in a circle of black dogs they fawned and capered about him like puppies the terriers followed rhys like a small army of fur frost held my hand over the back of the smallest of the greyhounds he had no dog at his side only the white stag that had run into the night but he seemed perfectly content with my hand in his the air was warm and i looked from frosts face to sholto and found that sholto was walking on sand one moment we were walking in snowcovered fields at the edge of the trees and the next moment sand sucked at my feet water swirled over my bare toes and the bite of salt let me know that i was bleeding i must have made some small sound because frost picked me up i protested but it did me no good the greyhounds stayed at his side dancing around us half afraid of the curl of ocean and seemingly worried that they couldnt stay in contact with me sholto led us up on dry land the threeheaded dog and the bone weapons had vanished but somehow i didnt think they were any more gone than the chalice was from me true magic cannot be lost or stolen it can only be given away we stood in the darkness hours before dawn i could hear the rushing of cars on the highway nearby we were hidden by cliffs but that would change as the dawn grew near surfers and fishermen would come down to the sea and we needed to be gone before then use glamour to hide your appearance sholto said i have sent for taxis they will arrive very soon what magic is it i asked that lets you find taxis in la at a moments notice i am the lord of that which passes between merry and taxis are always going between one place and another it made perfect sense but it made me smile all the same i reached for sholto and frost let him take me though not just with his arms the thick muscular tentacles wrapped around my body the smaller ones playing along my thighs somehow finding their way under the borrowed trench coat next time you are in my bed i will not be half a man i kissed him and whispered against his lips if that was you as only half a man king sholto then i can hardly wait to have you in all your glory he laughed that joyous sound that had brought the singing of birds in the sluaghs dead garden i thought there would be no answer here but suddenly over the sighing of surf came singing one birdsong after another sliding in joyous celebration in the dark it was a mockingbird singing for sholtos laughter we stood for a moment on the edge of the western sea with the mockingbirds song pouring over us as if happiness could have a sound sholto kissed me back hard and thorough leaving me breathless then he handed me back not to frost but to doyle i will return so i can bring the rest of the guards who wish to come into exile with you doyle cuddled me in against his body and said beware the queen sholto nodded i will be wary he began to walk back the way we had come somewhere before he vanished from sight i saw the white shine of a dog at his side everybody remember that the glamour is supposed to hide the fact that were naked and bloody rhys said anyone who doesnt have enough glamour to pull it off stand next to someone who does yes teacher i said he grinned at me i can cause death with a touch and a word i can heal with my hands for tonight but damn conjuring this many taxis out of thin air now thats impressive we walked up to the line of waiting taxis laughing the drivers all seemed a little puzzled to find themselves in the middle of nowhere waiting beside an empty beach but they let us get in we gave the taxis the address of maeve reeds holmby hills house and they drove they didnt even complain about the dogs now that was magic
