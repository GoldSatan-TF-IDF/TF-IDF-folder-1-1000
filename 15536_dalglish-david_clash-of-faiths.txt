clash of faiths david dalglish prologue the murmurs of the crowd were a welcome relief to darius as he sat in the corner his greatsword leaning against the wall beside him the rest of the tavern seemed boisterous enough the occupants receiving plenty of attention from the serving girl he however had received only a single glare upon his request for water perhaps he should have ordered some ale along with his bread to win her over but he would not pretend to nurse a drink forbidden to him he was a dark paladin of karak and lost faith or not he would still act like it to kaide one of the bigger men shouted raising his glass the rest took up the cry and then drank the name was familiar enough to darius though he wondered what the man had done to earn such drunken admiration no doubt hed filled their pockets with coin such lawless men in the north they wanted money alcohol and women give them any of the three and you were a better god than karak or ashhur would ever be temaryn come to join us in our merriment called out someone at the bar darius glanced at the door and he felt his heart jump dressed in the black platemail of his order was another paladin a longsword sheathed at his thigh and a heavy shield on his back his hair was long and brown perfectly matching his hazel eyes darius recognized him at once bloody abyss he muttered looking for a way out of the tavern you know i cant temaryn called back approaching the drunkard with a grin on his face but i hear the mad thief left a pot of gold at our doorsteps i take it every lesson i have ever taught will soon be thrown to the swine course not said the drunk youll get your share of tithes but until then well drink ourselves hey whats the matter temaryn was no longer paying him the slightest attention darius sighed and waved the other dark paladin over his elbow bumped his greatsword tilting it so the hilt lay across his lap just in case he couldnt talk his way out i dont believe it temaryn said pulling a chair opposite him and sitting what brings you here of all places i take it this is your assigned village darius asked avoiding the question one of several never enough shepherds for the sheep as im sure you know the stronghold has me run a loop here in the vale have you tried the bread yet nothing special but they have some fantastic honey to go on top only butter darius said his voice barely a mumble betty temaryn said snapping his fingers the serving girl came over and smiled honey please and some bread for myself of course she said giving him a smile darius could only dream of getting i dont know what they do to it temaryn said but youll never get honey anywhere else in all of dezrel like right here in helmshire darius felt his nerves relax but only slightly temaryn remained at ease the grin on his face never faltering but his hand though stayed near the sheath of his sword habit or conscious thought the temaryn he remembered from the stronghold was an easygoing but faithful man it could be either temaryn leaned back in his chair and he seemed to relax even more so how are things in what was that little place called durham darius thought of the two dark paladins and the priest that lay dead slain by his hand at his false tribunal fine he said fine thats it im hearing stories of a thousand wolves held at bay by two paladins amazing warriors of both karak and ashhur allied together against the entire might of the wedge surely you dont mean to tell me the simpletons around here are exaggerating your fantastical exploits there was something calculated about his laughter something insidious about his question darius tensed but he forced himself to remain calm you know the people as well as i he said as betty arrived with a second plate of thick bread slices along with a small cup filled with golden honey darius refused the offered honey earning himself a frown were allowed few indulgences in our lives temaryn said as he drizzled the honey across his bread you should learn to accept them if you say so temaryn took a bite you still havent told me about durham darius shifted his hand inching closer to his greatsword wolfmen crossed the river not a thousand only a few hundred we stood against them myself and the rest of the village nearly twothirds of the people died so i doubt too many are singing our praises what of this paladin of ashhur darius swallowed his name is jerico yes he helped as well temaryn fell silent for awhile instead focusing on his bread when the first slice was down he sucked the honey from his fingers then leaned back in his chair i must admit i was sent to durham to find you wed heard a pretty outlandish story and the stronghold wanted me to look into the matter supposedly you had turned against karak and abandoned your faith needless to say i found this hard to believe i remember you from our training the world would turn upside down sooner than you abandoning karak a grim smile crossed dariuss face to my shame i must admit my faith in karak is less than it was he said but it is still strong good temaryn said taking another bite of bread so was it difficult killing this jerico no no difficulty at all well not much of a surprise hes not dead temaryn put down his meal and pushed it away so pheus was right when he spoke of your friendship with the enemy he wanted your head on a platter darius and im not exaggerating by much darius chuckled at the word enemy yes he did want that that is why i killed him the humor finally left temaryns face his hand closed around the hilt of his sword and darius did likewise i never believed it temaryn said you fallen it made no sense even worse slaying priests and dark paladins of your own faith nonsense i thought but pheus vanished as did nevek and lars i hoped it wasnt you you were never my friend but you were an inspiration an example of how much strength one could gain through the power of faith now look at you do you have any excuses you wretch no excuses said darius only a warning keep your sword sheathed you were never as good as i temaryn never were and never will be temaryn stood flinging his chair back his shield and sword were in his hands the blade consumed by dark fire karak has abandoned you the paladin cried the rest of the tavern went deathly silent you are nothing without him but he is at my side at all times draw your sword darius show me your lack of faith so i may kill you in good conscience darius stood grabbed his greatsword and hefted it high above his head no black fire consumed it karaks gift a fire burning with strength equal to that of their faith was absent from him seeing the mocking superiority in temaryns eyes darius tensed knowing he had no choice he didnt want to kill a brother in faith but he would not die either is that the proof you need he asked quietly it is temaryn lunged his whole body extended to maximize the reach of his thrust darius smacked it aside pivoted and sent his sword crashing into his opponents shield at the sound of their collision the rest of the tavern erupted with noise people knocking over chairs and jostling one another to get out of the way such a battle was beyond them and none wanted to be caught in the middle temaryn took back the offensive he knocked aside the table between them and closed the distance his sword slashing and cutting with mechanical precision there was no surprise to it no fluidity dariuss enormous sword positioned perfectly to block every time with karaks strength temaryns sword hit his with a jolt but he would endure temaryn had no innate sense of battle no real talent for it darius however he stepped closer feinted a thrust and then swung for the dark paladins knees temaryns shield dropped and though it blocked the swing it gave darius the opening he wanted his elbow smashed into temaryns face hard metal armor shattering his nose and splattering blood across the dark steel temaryn fell back screaming and darius swung again his greatsword slashed through the exposed underarm tearing tendons and causing him to drop his shield blood dripped to the tavern floor it is not too late darius said turn back dont make me add another sin to my burdens why temaryn asked his wounded arm clutched against his side if you know this is sin then why because i will not go to karak as i am i will not be a sinner for him to burn for an eternity i must find a way to make amends my faith will not go unheard youre mad and youre wounded go now temaryn lifted his sword i will not run from you he said i will not go to our god as a coward you may have lost your faith you may have turned your back upon karak but i will not i will not he charged and darius cut off his head with a single swing as the body collapsed darius sheathed his blade and turned to the tavernkeeper take whatever price needed to clean this up he told him gesturing to the bag of coins tied to temaryns waist give what is left to the next servant of karak who comes the tavernkeeper an overweight man who was sweating with fear only nodded darius retrieved the head and put it back atop the body using the weight of temaryns shield to hold it in place the next you see me i will not be the shamed lost paladin he whispered i will be a prince of karak a wayward son returned home the stronghold has twisted what we know of him it has lied and tricked me out of his blessing my faith is strong i will fight the chaos of this world until karak himself must speak my name and acknowledge my deeds pray no more brethren try to stop me he kissed temaryns forehead placed a coin atop it to pay for his meal and then left the tavern a sharp pain woke jerico from his restless slumber delirious he looked about confused as to where he was and where he was going the ground was in motion below him but he felt unable to move tied not tied he realized he was in a net made of thick rope that was a strange place to be why am i in a net he asked aloud something hard struck his head and he screamed colors danced before his eyes and someone spoke though the words were just a jumble compared to the ringing in his ears shaking his head he tried to remember hed been traveling in the north alone on the road when hed met an old man except it hadnt been an old man hed been hey bellok hes awake again jerico twisted his head to stare through the gaps in the net there was the older man though not as old as hed first looked his hair was nearly white but he walked with his back straight and his skin wasnt wrinkled he carried a staff in hand and he waved it at jerico another sleep spell and he might be out for a day or two we best not risk it a dull tingle alerted jerico to the uncomfortable position of his arm beneath him he shifted pulling his weight off it the movement earned him a kick in the side which his platemail thankfully absorbed worse was the pain that awoke in his oncesleeping arm feeling like a thousand ants crawling through his veins biting him would someone like to tell me whats going on he asked his head pounded and his stomach lurched with every bob of the net from what he could see the net was attached to a thick branch carried on either side by two large men shut up said the big lug behind him kicking again this time the boot connected with his head the world spinning he vomited much fell through the gaps of the net but some stuck to the rope and it smeared against his cheek what a mess the notsoold man named bellok said dont worry the sickness is just a residual effect of the spell youll feel fine soon enough wonderful jerico muttered can i speak or will i get kicked again let him talk bellok said hes no wizard his words cant hurt you i just want him to stop moving said the man at jericos feet hes too damn heavy if id known i was going for a ride id have taken off my armor no one seemed amused by jericos joke which disappointed him if he could get them to laugh he could get them to like him instead he saw two brutes carrying him neither cracking a grin plus bellok walking beside him jerico turned his attention to bellok figuring him the most talkative of the bunch so bellok right where am i going again i heard rumors of kaide being a cannibal so before anything else please tell me im not about to be roasted over an open fire bellok rolled his eyes and made a loud scoffing noise please disgusting rumors with hardly a grain of truth you will not be eaten paladin if hearing so puts you more at ease jerico relaxed well if he was going to die at least itd be in a normal sane way he really didnt want to meet ashhur having just been someones substitute for dinner the net shifted what had been a flat dirt path below suddenly became heavy vegetation they passed through bushes the thorns scratching him through the net he thought to ask his two captors to lift him higher then thought better of it the last thing he wanted was for them to decide to drop him even lower instead bellok vanished for a minute then returned picking burs from his robe wherever they were going it was no longer on a standard road damn forest the man muttered so where is kaide jerico asked more of his memory returning someone had spoken the name and bellok had confirmed it when he mentioned the cannibal rumor if he interpreted his blurry past correctly it had been kaide who told the rest of the men to take him after theyd flung nets atop him and beaten him senseless of course where they were taking him was another good question he doubted hed get an answer to kaide is busy bellok said a look of distaste crossing his face shagging some young tart said the lug behind him kaide cant turn down a little fun whenever we pass by a village the lasses are practically flinging themselves at him and someday one of those lasses will pull a dagger and claim herself a bounty of gold bellok said glaring why would a girl do that asked the other guy carrying him you cant hump gold well thought jerico that explained belloks distaste and also confirmed why he hadnt gotten a laugh from either of the two lugs he knew donkeys with better senses of humor and wit now that he thought about it so where are we going jerico asked i hope not anywhere fancy i must look a mess what with the beatings and all for someone an inch away from death you seem in rather good spirits bellok said anything to stave off that final inch for once bellok smiled youll definitely be one of our more amusing captures of that im certain jerico fell silent well this kaide person had had captives before he wasnt sure if that was good or bad what happened to the other captives he asked the lug behind him leaned down and his foul breath washed over jerico we ate them jerico shifted his weight again this time waking up his other arm and reigniting similar pain throughout the sleeping limb fantastic he muttered he kept quiet as the minutes passed spending the time in prayer with ashhur he didnt feel in any immediate danger and his god gave little warning in his mind strange the two captors carrying him were on the slow side but they didnt seem particularly vile beyond their smell bellok was intelligent and appeared to take no joy in the situation what had happened to the rest who had beaten him though they probably deserved a good walloping of ashhurs mercy and by god hed be glad to give it were here bellok said jerico found himself unceremoniously dropped to the ground landing hard on the twisted root of a tree biting down his cry he pulled aside the net to stand both big lugs had drawn swords and they pointed them at him jerico frowned the men might be stupid but they certainly took care of their weapons nothing funny said one you run we gut you he wont run bellok said gesturing for jerico to follow jerico didnt have the heart to tell him he was a bad judge of character instead he took in his surroundings which were meager deep in the forest it appeared kaides men had built a small cluster of homes in cleared areas of pine they were small a single floor with one or two windows and a door they looked like a strong storm could blow them away cozy jerico said as bellok led him toward the nearest of the homes this is no time for joking bellok said glaring if you value your life you will listen and respond in an appropriate manner griff adam you two guard the door what if he tries something funny one of them asked whether it was griff or adam jerico hadnt a clue now that he was free of the net the two looked like brothers if not twins only the scars across their faces and arms failed to match i may not care for ashhur but i know how his warriors behave dont worry inside paladin jerico stepped inside bellok following the house was dim lit only by the open window a fire burned in the fireplace the smoke drifting up a small chimney in one corner was a bed and lying atop it was a young woman buried up to her neck in blankets a man sat beside her on a stool his grey hair tied in a ponytail there was something familiar about him his hardened face lurking in some recent memory kaide jerico said remembering that mans face peering down at him ordering the rest of the men to take him youre their leader the man stood tearing his attention from the woman his eyes were red and he looked like he hadnt slept in days forgive me for our first meeting he said but you have no choice in this matter and neither do i sandra is dying i need you to save her jerico approached the bed making sure he kept his movements calm two long dirks hung exposed from kaides belt their edges wickedly sharp jerico still wore his platemail but unarmed hed be at a serious disadvantage if this kaide knew at all how to wield those blades given his reputation jerico had a feeling he did trying to put such things out of his mind he turned his attention to sandra her skin was pale her forehead beaded with sweat her hair was also grey almost silver no doubt if the color returned to her face and her small lips smiled shed be beautiful removing his gauntlets he set them on the floor what is wrong with her he asked pulling his gorget off his neck and putting it beside his gauntlets shes been burning with fever for days kaide said sandra cut herself on some thorns bellok added just regular cuts but theyve grown infected and no matter what we do it continues to spread check her arms if you wish you could do nothing jerico asked im good at destroying things not fixing them bellok said frowning my sister is not a thing kaide said a hard edge in his voice jerico found himself impressed by the sheer authority it carried quiet he said let me have a few moments of silence jerico pulled down the blanket sandra slept in her shift the short sleeves leaving her arms exposed he took one in hand and turned it looking at the marks the skin around them had gone purple the cuts themselves angry and red no wonder shes overwhelmed with fever he thought can you heal her kaide asked as jerico closed his eyes the bandits voice was soft but had no hesitation no quiver this was a man who had seen death and often i can do nothing jerico said all i do is through ashhur and i assure you nothing is beyond him he closed his eyes and prayed he felt the closeness of his deity and warmth spread across his hands clutching sandras arm he pictured the healing light plunging into her skin banishing the wounds and pouring a cold fire across her fever the woman shivered at his touch a ringing sound filled his ears then his prayers completed and everything went silent dizziness overcame him and he leaned against a wall to remain standing taking a deep breath he opened his eyes to see the results sandra still slept but the cuts on her arm were but faded lines soon to be nothing but scars already her skin had warmed in tone and her sleep looked restful instead of pained you did it kaide said a smile crossing his face jerico chuckled not i remember kaide waved a dismissive hand jerico stepped aside so the man could rejoin his sister as he held her hand jerico plopped to a sit still feeling dizzy it sure didnt help that his entire body ached from the clubs that had beaten him as well as the kicks from griff and adam bellok patted kaide on the shoulder ill go tell everyone shell be fine he said kaide nodded and then the wizard left so kaide jerico said feeling like he should resume conversation he wasnt sure what his current predicament was and he wanted to get a far better idea im surprised you were here your uh men gave me the impression you were occupied elsewhere a grin tugged at the corner of kaides mouth there are twenty women who will readily claim to have bedded me tonight makes it difficult to track my whereabouts wouldnt you think you keep this secret from your men would you trust those two with any plan of yours jerico shrugged good point well now that your sister is better i feel like i best be going kaide squeezed sandras hand kissed her fingers and then stood no he said his hand falling to the hilt of a dirk im afraid thats not the case jerico tensed i will tell no one of this place whatever you are i will bear no ill will especially since what was done to me was to save a loved one even if you could have just asked i fight a war kaide said and he gestured toward sandra and in a war you dont let go of any advantage griff adam get in here the two stepped inside surrounding jerico oh hey boss said one didnt know you was back i am kaide said he stared at jerico watching waiting please take jerico to his room and make sure the locks are tight hes to be fed and welltreated no beatings asked the other no beatings much appreciated said jerico they each grabbed him by an arm and led him from the house nearby was another building this one noticeably lacking any windows the two lugs shoved him inside and slammed the door shut he heard a loud thud most certainly a bar of some kind locking into place the door had a single slit and the room dimmed as someone stood before it grinning well treat you like royalty he said laughing so take your royal shits in that corner with the bucket and youll get your royal meal at sundown thats when well take the bucket the slit closed as something pressed over it sealing jerico in darkness well jerico said scratching his neck i think i preferred the wolfmen thanks ashhur he leaned against the wall opposite the bucket closed his eyes and slept d arius stood in an open field facing the west the sky was an ugly yellow and filled with clouds they growled with thunder and lightning streaked pale blue across the horizon wind blew against his bare skin for he was naked as the day he was born he wished for his sword and armor but didnt know where they were darius cried the thunder its rumbling forming an unearthly voice cold and deep he saw a face in the clouds and it was the face of his god karak darius said falling to his knees forgive me my failures but my faith is only for you the face laughed no mirth no amusement only contempt strong of faith yet without wisdom and full of doubt you bow to me but then ignore my words you swear allegiance and then disobey you are nothing to me darius once you were but no longer no darius cried as the wind howled stealing away his voice i will not be abandoned i will not die as i am i have served you every day i have served you then obey the clouds formed a funnel which struck the far distant plains it grew wider and wider until it stretched for miles the sound of its approach was like that of a thousand dragons roaring in fury before it darius felt small pathetic he begged and wept for salvation but the swirling grey monster tore into him shredding his skin and striking him with stones his feet left the ground and then he was flying flying his screaming woke him in his bedroll at some point his thrashing had knocked his blankets aside and he shivered in the cold night air above him the stars twinkled through the naked interlocking branches no clouds no storm nearby his campfire had died down to embers rolling over he meant to add kindling and wood but then it burst to life in the newly granted light he saw a darkrobed man sitting beside it his legs crossed beneath him nightmares darius darius startled and he grabbed his sword despite knowing it would do no good hed struck this man before only to watch the steel bounce off pale skin as if it were made of stone velixar karaks prophet laughed as if he were privy to his thoughts is that how you work darius asked by interfering with my dreams at times yes said velixar but not tonight do you think i would take an interest in you without reason karak watches you and he gifts you with his divine presence you should be honored the prophet poked at the fire with a stick as if he had suddenly forgotten darius was there darius watched him for a moment trying to decide if he lied or not the mans face pale thin and lit by red eyes that glowed with fire changed with every passing second by the time he turned around and smiled he appeared a new man his cheeks wider his lips thinner and his chin longer the eyes remained the same what did our lord say asked the man with the everchanging face he wished me to obey as i said you would one day darius glared he said to obey him not you you do not speak his will youve led us astray all of us youre a relic a man lost in a different time velixar resumed poking the fire with his stick talking all the while serve karak through serving me even children can understand this concept you have felt karaks fury yet you still deny you failed him still believe that you know his true heart and will you amuse me darius as much as you disappoint me sit awhile with me by the fire reluctantly darius stabbed his sword into the dirt and did as he was asked he swore the air grew colder around the prophet and he felt his insides twist at their proximity as he sat velixar pointed to the fire where hed drawn several runes with his stick the flames swirled deepened and then suddenly opened onto a vision of another place one also filled with shadows and fire standing amid a great chasm of men his obsidian armor gleaming was temaryn he wielded a flaming sword in one hand and a whip in the other do you see velixar asked he rules in the abyss purifying the wretched given to our lord i will not judge you for sending him to karak for his soul is secure and he is in his place you however darius could not look away from the horrific image this was the future awaiting his order temaryn looked pleased enough and he lashed the sinners with his whip while crying out for repentance and obedience the vision changed and he saw a hundred things that he could not remember the moment after they passed only feel the lingering terror and anguish through it all the dead marched sang and burned with clockwork precision true to his god the abyss was a place of order above all things and then he saw himself up to his knees in a lake of fire he was naked and bleeding from many open sores a man in shining armor towered over him his very skin wreathed in flame his movements trailing shadow removing his helmet this tormenter looked up from the vision and straight into dariuss eyes it was him only stronger more faithful darius cried out and he tore his eyes away from the sight kicking his foot he scattered the fire ending its heat in the sudden silence a distant wolf howled you must choose velixar said his voice barely above a whisper only two fates await you and you have seen them both pretend to wisdom or bow to those with understanding you will cleanse or be the tormented there is no other fate left velixar stood stepped into the shadows of the forest and then was gone darius sat there feeling drained everything else hed seen was already fading from his mind all but that last image of himselfboth versions they stared up at him one in pain one lost in ecstasy he could almost imagine them pleading for him to make the right choice darius fell to his knees bowed his head and cried tears to his god he begged for wisdom he begged for guidance but all he heard was the silence and the distant cry of a wolf jerico stirred as blinding light hurt his eyes blocking it with a hand he tried to decipher who stood at the door to your feet paladin he heard kaide say jerico stood groaning as he did his platemail groaned along with him he wished to oil it down but could not he refused to even take it off so far the other men hadnt demanded it of him and he didnt want to risk losing it now as he stepped out still shielding his eyes he realized it wasnt daylight that hurt him but burning torches at either side of his door what is the hour he asked the stars are out one of the two lugs grumbled behind him still guarding the door what hour you think it is jerico turned and smiled at the yellow and red blob that his eyes showed ever so helpful griff its adam sorry cant see your scars too well it seemed like adam grinned but then a sharp pain struck jericos throat he collapsed to one knee and coughed take his armor kaide ordered as jerico fought to regain his breath i dont want it turning a blade should we need to subdue him jerico tensed and he almost resisted in the end he knew it was pointless halfblind hungry and disorientated he would prove no challenge lifting his arms he let adam tug at the straps pulling his armor off careful he said youll dent it it seems dented enough by your own travels kaide said as the breastplate thudded to the dirt you should feel better not carrying that around anyway now follow me jericos sight was finally coming around and he glanced about the forest dwellings he saw the light of fires burning in several homes and a few more outside in a ring the sound of laughter met his ears so he figured it couldnt be too late into the night the amount of people he heard and saw surprised him at least a hundred formed this motley bunch did something happen to sandra he asked as they returned to where the woman had been kept just be quiet kaide insisted he pulled the band from his hair releasing the ponytail shaking his hair free he sighed and put a hand on the door behave yourself and respond kindly sandra has woken and she wishes to thank you he pushed it open then gestured for jerico to enter as he did kaide followed and shut the door behind them already sandra looked worlds better her arm was bandaged its linen clean she smiled at their entrance confirming jericos earlier suspicion about her beauty her room was lit by a fireplace but it had dwindled down allowing a chill to enter kaide took to tending it as if he wanted no part of the proceedings are you the paladin sandra asked her voice was thick with the northern accent and it masked how tired she clearly was jerico nodded trying to make sense of things hed been dragged from a windowless prison to be thanked would he be sent back afterward hardly seemed an appropriate reward but kaide had further plans for him that was obvious would sandra know any of it no of course not shed been out at the time of his capture and he had a feeling her brother had not filled her in i am jerico said bowing thank you she said smiling she sat up tugging her blanket so it remained wrapped tight about her i doubt im worthy of such a noble gesture though i bow to all beautiful women jerico said glancing at kaide sure enough he was glaring death which made it all worthwhile if sandra was flattered she kept it in check if you say please sit by my bed none of the men here my brother included are much use for conversation too dull too focused they havent seen the world have you i think you should get some rest kaide interrupted the hours late and i have slept for days sandra said glaring please give us our privacy or do you think a paladin of ashhur will murder me in cold blood the same day he saved my life jerico found himself liking the woman more and more so be it kaide said nearly growling with rage he flung another log into the fire not caring that he scattered it jerico waited until he left chuckled and then took kaides place at getting it roaring dont judge him too harshly she said he has a temper is all i dont think thats all jerico said gently pushing the errant log aside so he could layer on more kindling i take it he blindfolded you before bringing you here jerico laughed if you consider being dragged here unconscious in a net as blindfolded then yes i was sandra fell silent and jerico berated himself for his sharp tongue it certainly wasnt her fault the fire finally going strong he stood and closed his eyes enjoying the warmth his room had felt like ice when hed been awoken dread filled his stomach as he thought of the coming night without blankets or a fire hes keeping you in the windowless room isnt he she asked quietly he is no fire no blankets and no bed jerico looked her in the eye you seem familiar with your brothers accommodations i hope those who came before me all deserved the same treatment her neck flushed red that was uncalled for she said i wished to thank you and hear of the citadel the waters of the gihon and the peoples in the lands beyond mordan yet youd call me a jailor instead jerico felt petty but he was tired grumpy and unable to stop himself youre sister to one and forgive my lack of tales for my prisons not as comfortable as yours sandra she sat erect in her bed her jaw trembling with anger get out she said jerico rolled his eyes there were a million ways he could have handled the situation better but of course hed screwed them all up please im sorry its just i said out kaide the door opened so fast jerico wondered if the man had been pressing his ear against the other side he held his dirks in hand and seemed disappointed that he had no reason to use them lets go he said grabbing jericos arm and pulling back to your room jerico bowed once more to sandra and then allowed himself to be led back to his prison when inside he shivered against the wall enveloped once more in darkness he tried to sleep but could not even with how slow time crawled it was not long before the door burst open yes jerico asked off your ass adam said come on now hurry with a blade pressed against his back jerico was pushed back into the night and toward another building the door was opened and they shoved him inside within was a bed a fireplace and a slender window too small for him to crawl through courtesy of the woman adam said shutting the door he heard the sound of locking then whistling as adam wandered away jerico checked the bed for lice or fleas and found none impressive well jerico the paladin said finding it disturbingly easy to talk to himself given his lack of company it looks like youre not that terrible at talking to women after all he knew that was false of course but it was nice to pretend otherwise the following day passed full of tedium and boredom jerico ate his meals when they were brought to him and filled the rest of his hours with exercise and prayer he wanted both his muscles and his faith sharp should any chance at escape present itself so far his captors didnt seem to have any intention to kill him so he remained patient it wasnt like he had anywhere else to go not with dark priests and paladins scouring the north theres a disturbing thought jerico muttered thinking of kaide selling him to someone from the stronghold for a nice sack of gold or would he be worth only silver questions hed never get adequate answers to his personal pride wanted karaks servants hurling entire treasuries at people to bring him down but that seemed unreasonable maybe just a few thousand gold thatd at least be something worth bragging about not that he had anyone to brag to adam and griff alternated guard duty broken up by the occasional third man named barry an impatient and illtempered man barry was actually the worst of the three the twins as hed discovered would at least joke around however poorly when he spoke to them through the hole in his door barry only shouted for him to shut up must you always be talking in there the man once asked around midday im praying jerico replied then pray into a pillow or something tired of hearing it jerico spent the next hour praying directly in front of the door and his lamentations were loud and heartfelt he even prayed for barrys soul and only the iron will of a paladin kept him from breaking into laughter at the angry shouting that caused come nightfall he heard only silence he wondered if theyd left him without a guard no one answered his occasional question through the window he saw the occasional person milling about nearly all of them male he wondered if kaide recruited only unmarried men or if they kept their families somewhere else presumably safer jerico added that to the list of other questions he expected to never receive an answer to the best information he could get out of adam and griff was their last name irons when the stars were at their fullest the door opened without a single knock for warning sandra stepped inside then closed the door behind her jerico sat on his bed feeling ragged and dirty itd been days since he bathed and despite the moderately improved living conditions he was still not the cleanest brushing a hand through his hair he smiled then remembered to bow kaide still thinks you will run she said as if struggling to think of something to say will you not going to lie if i thought i could id already be gone you havent tried breaking down the door or digging through a wall youve made no effort to escape you speak in blusters how do you know she smiled at him because youre a paladin thats just not what you do is it or have the stories ive heard all been a lie jerico shrugged depends on what stories what about the one with you and the wolfmen the paladin groaned that one made it all the way up here sandra seemed intrigued by his annoyance she sat in a chair beside his small fire shifting her skirt to the side her dress was thick and cut high practical for the rough terrain surrounding the area i think all of mordan will be talking about that one for a while though the paladins name has changed several times but i still think it is you and whys that ive seen your shield jerico shrugged seemed pointless to argue it i wasnt alone he said and the men with me fought bravely many dying to protect others we fought a few hundred wolfmen killed most and chased the rest off meanwhile more than half the town died it wasnt some epic victory not the true version of the story anyway sandra shifted in her seat i liked the one i heard better it described you as a man with hair made of fire and a shield of pure light you would point it at your enemies and the light itself would strike them down i heard not a man died not a woman or child touched jerico thought of the horrors hed seen and the many graves hed dug id rather talk of something else he said like what she asked oh why your brothers keeping me captive that might be a fun story to hear sandra rolled her eyes thats something id rather not talk about either she said forgive me for pressing the issue anyway standing sandra looked away for a moment as if collecting her thoughts what do you know of lord sebastian hemman she asked at jericos shrug she continued not many know anything about him outside our lands by law he rules much of the north he draws his wealth from our fields our mountains and the sweat of our brow when kaide could take it no longer when he was given no choice he gathered his friends and struck back fascinating jerico said trying not to sound condescending but what does this have to do with me youll see soon enough she said kaides off chasing rumors of sebastians knights traveling the road through the forest youll be needed when they return why did you come to talk to me jerico asked before she could exit the door is it guilt a sad smile marred her beautiful face im here because i wish things were different she said im here because i want you to know we are not butchers thieves and cruel people you kidnap rob and attack men loyal to the king jerico said your brother breaks hundreds of laws oh and his thugs beat me with clubs forgive me for not warming up to him sandra left refusing to argue the point jerico slammed a fist against the wall when she was gone help me out ashhur he whispered i dont have a damn clue what im doing an hour or so passed a disturbing silence compared to the previous day and night all commotion had died down sandra said kaide had gone after some of hemmans knights and he must have taken the entire camp with him if there was ever a time to escape it was now i want no part of this he said leaning against the door in the dark he could see little through the slit still there appeared no guard and he heard no nearby noises putting his hands against the door he tested the locks strength it budged but only a little stepping back he kicked it once twice and then slammed his shoulder against it the wood groaned and the noise seemed thunderous in the quiet preparing another charge he just barely stopped in time before impaling himself on the tip of a spike that pressed through the doors slit i must admit sandra said from the other side im disappointed move aside sandra i wont be kept prisoner the metal tip remained i have a bow as well she said even if you kick down the door you wont escape ive learned plenty from my brother jerico i know the vital spots to kill a man you arent leaving not until he gives you his blessing im sorry jerico sighed and he slumped down into the chair sandra had occupied it seemed absurd knowing hed have to subdue a single woman to make his escape but armed with a spear and a bow she was quite capable of killing him more importantly hed have to hurt her to protect himself and that was something he wasnt willing to do to strike at a woman just because he didnt like his current sleeping accommodation hardly the actions of the champion of mankind he was supposed to be very well he said wondering how in the world hed ended up in such a predicament ill behave good the tip vanished and he saw her eyes peer at him through the door he could tell she was smiling you better not tell anyone about this he said everyone who will listen dont worry youll even make it outside in this tale before i wrestled you to the ground and beat you unconscious with my bare hands should earn a few chuckles around the campfire jerico laughed deciding he easily liked her most of all his jailors so far to prepare himself for bed jerico knelt and began his prayers barely a few minutes in he heard distant shouts stopping he went to the small window and tried to see torchlight flickered through the trees and a crowd of men appeared walking along a path a couple veered his way and he stepped back from the window a short while later the door opened and in stepped kaide a wicked bruise bled across his brow blood stained his clothes outside he said there isnt enough room in here shit its bad jerico i hope you can handle it jerico gestured for kaide to lead the way and then followed the outlaw around a large central campfire he saw ten bodies lying in a circle to keep them near its warmth they all had various wounds some minor some severe jerico circled them taking in the damage surrounding him were the rest of the men talking quietly to themselves and watching him intently you assaulted armored knights he said turning to kaide all of these are by swords they injured themselves breaking the law and attacking innocent men innocent one of the ruffians asked and two others had to grab him to keep him from attacking jerico will you heal them kaide asked should i they exchanged a look jerico didnt know what to think or what to do part of him just wanted to alert kaide to the reality of his situation in the end it didnt matter the bandit leader stared him in the eye and called his bluff if you are who i think you are you would never sit back and watch a man die do not argue with me risking my men death just to waste my time and satisfy your pride do your duty paladin jericos stare hardened but then he turned away kaide was right it didnt matter if these men were murderers or thieves he would not watch them suffer needlessly circling the fire once more he sought out the worst of the wounded and knelt beside a bearded man with a cut across his belly the man held his fists pressed against it keeping his entrails from spilling out let go jerico said putting his hands atop his fists close your eyes relax and let go the man reluctantly obeyed jerico closed his own eyes and gave himself to ashhur in prayer light shone from his fingers at their contact pouring across the skin it knitted the flesh together healing the wound done jerico stood took a deep breath to steady himself and then went to the next two of the ten were already dead by the time he could go to them several others had mortal wounds wounds he sealed with his faith the rest with minor cuts or broken bones he treated last torn muscles he mended and broken bones snapped together amid the cries of their owners at last jerico collapsed to his knees and stared into the fire cold sweat dripped down his neck and his head pounded nearby sandra went from man to man wrapping what remained of their cuts with bandages and giving slings to the men whod broken arms or fingers so they might not strain their tender appendages well done kaide said after chatting with a couple of the men who had only minutes before been at deaths door thanks jerico said still not opening his eyes he felt ready to vomit though he didnt know if he had anything in his stomach to empty something slapped his shoulder and he opened an eye to see a waterskin he took it and drank then turned to the side and vomited it all back up coughing he prayed for the dizziness to stop at durham hed handled worse but that day felt centuries away he was tired from the road nursing bruises and desperate for food and drink an empty shell he lay on his back and stared at the stars through the naked canopy of branches kaide sat beside him acting unbothered by the vomit nearby he took his own drink from the waterskin and then offered it a second time jerico weakly waved it away they were ready for us kaide said his voice was soft and it lacked the hard edge itd had before only reason we lived was because we came at them from both sides dont think they realized just how many have sworn to my name still they wore heavy armor like yours half my men have nothing but clubs tree branches do you know what it takes to bring someone down with only that gods damn it all the gore we left inside that armor he fell silent for a moment took a drink left twelve men back there dead or too far gone to survive the trip back couldnt even bury them didnt have the time could only burn them im sorry jerico said he wasnt sure if he was but it felt like the right thing to say you need to be there with us kaide said still not looking at him my sisters told me who you are what youve done those knights you could have taken out half of them by yourself and my friends my wounded he wiped at his eyes quick subtle there would have been time for them jerico rolled onto his knees waited for his stomach to settle and then stood ashhur help him was this all he would ever be good for healing the wounded and presiding over the dead i dont know what god you worship if any he said but i will pray over your dead if you would allow it kaide nodded itll do a lot of the men good you have my blessing there were about sixty of them gathered around the two graves nearly all sporting cuts and bruises four men had taken turns shoveling and another had whittled down stakes to place above them with a single letter cut into the wood to mark their names when the bodies were in place and the dirt ready to fall jerico stood before them he felt their eyes watching him felt their confusion anger and doubt let us pray jerico said beginning the burial ritual when he was done they shoveled the dirt back into the grave and kaide led jerico back to his room when he laid down on the bed he heard muttered talking then nothing curious jerico forced himself back up and to the door a slight push was enough to confirm what he thought the door was unlocked stay or go he wondered what is right in the end he returned to his bed and slept ashhur had guided him there for a purpose he had to believe that for all other possibilities frightened him left him alone and adrift in the land of dezrel as sleep came to him he vowed to find out the reason and attack it with all his might but his dreams were not of duty or vengeance but of sandra smiling at him with her sad smile for several days darius saw no sign of velixar and this heartened him greatly he always felt his lowest in the prophets presence as if he stood before a standard that he could never hope to achieve velixar had the faith of a man who spoke with deities while darius could only wander the wilderness road glad for the moments of silence on the third day he heard the heavy sound of hoofbeats coming from the south and he stopped to await their arrival they might be bandits knights or riders from the stronghold no matter what he would neither run nor hide only face them in the open and meet any challenge issued ahead the road curved and around that curve came six knights in worn platemail they were not of the stronghold that was obvious enough darius saw the symbol on their shields that of a yellow rose but didnt recall its significance he raised his hand in greeting expecting similar in kind instead the horsemen encircled him their swords drawn identify yourself their leader shouted darius chuckled wondering if he was supposed to be intimidated i am darius of the stronghold paladin of our mighty god karak and who might you be the knight lifted the visor of his helmet to reveal his face his hair was dark and he had a scar running along the bridge of his nose sir gregane knight of our lord sebastian hemman weve been tracking a group of bandits and they struck not far from here do i look like a bandit put your swords away before i am offended a nod from gregane and the men sheathed their blades my apologies said the knight we have been ambushed many times and feared you were part of another bandits and rebels are men of chaos you should remember that knight before you ever question the allegiance of a paladin of karak as gregane nodded again a second knight leaned in and murmured something to him in a low tone very well gregane said turning his attention back to darius our lord has been seeking one of your faith i ask that you ride back with us to his castle and if i refuse gregane glanced at the rest of the riders i would strongly recommend against doing so he said darius sighed very well they had no spare horse and could not carry two with how burdened each of them were with their heavy armor one dismounted and offered darius the reins her names esme after my wife said the knight treat her well she has a temper the horse or your wife darius asked as he adjusted the saddle both he said with a grin ill send a rider for you isaac gregane said stay off the road bandits might still be near they rode north darius in the center of the formation most kept to themselves for which the dark paladin was thankful he had no desire for conversation not while he pondered the reason for his audience never before had he been to the castle of the yellow rose and it didnt seem that lord hemman requested him by name no doubt he wanted some sort of religious guidance though why no members of the faith would be with him at the castle seemed odd perhaps they were all hunting their new favorite prey the thought reminded him of jerico and he wondered how the paladin fared had he fled north as darius had suggested or turned about to head south what of the dark paladins had they found him yet he hoped not deep down darius still felt the bloody conflict might end that it was no true war but the various lords ladies and kings would turn blind eyes to conflicts of faith so long as it did not disrupt their people or bathe their streets with blood darius knew his brethren would be too careful for that they emerged from the forest about an hour later the castle not far in the distance its walls stretched out for a mile beyond the castle itself sealing in several pastures with crops and cattle along with numerous wells darius eyed the walls they were short and made of dark stone ladders would easily reach the top and battering rams would make quick work of their gates but that wasnt their point they were for holding off uprisings of peasants and raids by bandits who lacked even the most basic of siege weaponry the castle was equally unimpressive save for one thing as darius entered through a gateway following the knights along a beaten dirt path he saw the great rose painted across the face of the castle it drooped to one side and a single petal fell twirling in an unseen wind vines grew across the face of the walls adding texture to the painted petals darius couldnt begin to imagine how they painted it nor kept its color vibrant as a defensive foundation it was basic square and crenellated along the tops sir gregane announced their arrival and the castles doors were flung open young boys appeared leading away the horses once the knights dismounted darius kept an eye out for priests and paladins of either faith but saw none if lucky he might appear before sebastian offer some vague advice and then be gone follow me gregane said but first your sword i go nowhere without it not even before kings and queens i will not disarm myself before your lord especially when i am brought here as a guest the other knights tensed but gregane seemed unoffended very well keep it sheathed on your back i cannot promise you safety otherwise darius gestured for him to move along they stepped into a short hallway past several doors leading to the lower and upper floors of the castle then they were inside the grand room with rows of tables for feasting at the foot of a single throne made of stained oak a man sat on it thin and wiry with his dark hair reaching far past his neck flecks of gray shone in the black sebastian hemman darius said not waiting for introductions i am darius of the stronghold faithful paladin of karak and i bring with me his blessing sebastian sat ramrod straight in his chair and at the announcement he bowed his head slightly and gestured to a table that had a meager offering of food you may eat and drink if youd like said the lord his voice was soft calculated perhaps when business is done darius said he remained standing even when the other knights bowed in reverence darius would bow to no one nor call them lord his kind served karak and karak alone i have never been fond of empty pleasantries nor stalling words to feel out anothers true thoughts let me state this plainly i have come because you have summoned me let me know why so i may perform my function and then go on my way if i so choose impatient words sebastian said but ive found your kind often is sometimes i think karak sends those gifted with golden tongues to his priesthood and the blunt muscle to the stronghold darius grinned no one will ever accuse me of a bronze tongue let alone golden i have my sword and that is enough tell me sebastian why am i here are there no others of the faith to counsel you we once had a priest here but he has left with business he swears is most urgent lord hemman took a drink of wine from a cup at his side still in no hurry to move things along but the seventh day approaches and we have no one to administer the offerings nor have we had for several weeks would you preside over this for my people tomorrow that was it darius tried to contain his temper hed basically been kidnapped and brought before their lord all so he could perform a function even the youngest of the faith could handle if that is what you require i accept but i have matters i must attend and cannot stay long yes of course now that that is settled sebastian clapped his hands ordering everyone out gregane opened his mouth to protest but the lord silenced him with a glare the servants vanished shutting the door behind the knights when they were alone sebastian stood and he seemed to visibly relax forgive me that tedious business he said eagerness bleeding into his voice it has been weeks since any worshipper of ashhur was here but i thought it best to hide the reason for your arrival just in case castle walls have ears after all and mine are no exception i see darius said though he didnt if not for the morrows service why was he here a ball of lead formed in his stomach for of all the ideas he had none were pleasant the lord moved to a door behind his throne and he opened it with a key wrapped around his neck taking a nearby torch he stepped inside beckoning darius to follow heart in his throat he did the air was heavy and the floor damp they descended into a dank dungeon the only sound that of the flickering torch and a distant dripping of water at the bottom of the stairs was a cell and inside that cell was an older man strapped upright to the wall with iron who is this darius asked already dreading the answer answer me it is a brave man who will make demands in a lords dungeon sebastian said but that is your nature i suppose i have always been a faithful supporter of karak ashhur appeals to the peasant folk the simple minded who need promises of greatness in death who need a doctrine that elevates them as equals to gods karak knows better it is order the world needs a king his lords and their subjects that is the divine sequence enough darius said wishing to hear no more of the mans simplification of a doctrine he knew better in his sleep answer my question his name is pallos sebastian said opening the cell door my men captured him along the road and have brought him here before he left laius one of your priests assigned to be my counsel spoke whispers of a war he told me of the citadels fall and of the great cleansing that sweeps across dezrel of course i would not dare steal from you a rightful execution besides if the priests of ashhur received word they might make my life difficult darius stepped into the cell his throat dry the paladins name was so familiar pallos that was it darius had promised jerico that he would warn pallos of the silent war should he encounter him again it seemed such a warning was no longer necessary the older man looked up at him his eyes still lucid despite the thinness of his body and the darkness of his cell leave me darius told sebastian i wish to have words with this man of things youd best not hear of course the man bowed and stepped back keeping his torch high so its light might still shine on them both who are you pallos asked his voice cracking my name is darius of durham at the name pallos tensed against his shackles have you turned against me he asked has the entire world i warned jerico but did he listen he counted you his friend and he still does darius said his voice dropping to a whisper i had not the heart to kill him he lives pallos at least last i saw him the world is dangerous though so i cannot know for certain palloss mouth dropped open and he looked torn between hope and distrust darius knew the man had no reason to believe him everything he said could be a trick or a cruel torture to be later revealed as a lie i dont believe it he said at last i thought for certain karak would call you to kill him he did and you refused darius sighed this was hardly something he wished to go over again for the wound still stung yes i did praise ashhur pallos whispered i doubt ashhur deserves much praise his paladins are being butchered day by day and now i find you here chained to a wall and starved half to death palloss eyes twinkled but he refused to argue what now the older man asked darius glanced back at the lord what now indeed here he was before a man declared to be his enemy by the highest members of his faith could so many be wrong even karaks very prophet insisted the followers of ashhur were an enemy and that darius would only know karaks strength when he embraced that reality he looked to pallos the mans skin hung on his bones and his fingers shook without ceasing sweat dripped from his heador was it water from the ceiling he tried to decide what was right he thought to pray to karak but he suddenly felt afraid of his deity it wasnt that he would receive no answer in fact the opposite what if karak called him to kill what if darius still stubbornly clung to an image of his god that was untrue you will die no matter what i do darius whispered he pulled his greatsword off his back and held it in his hand they will leave you here starving chained until another priest or paladin comes along they will torture you make you scream and beg they might even force you to denounce your faith to cry out in pain that all your beliefs are a lie i cannot save you pallos but i can grant you death here now it will not be done in anger i will lessen the pain as much as i can your blade pallos said acting as if he never heard a word it does not burn my faith is still strong darius said will you accept my mercy you hold faith pallos said a smile covering his face i do see that but is it in the god you think you serve enough darius said his voice rising karak is my lord my protector my strength i offer you this in kindness give me an answer i will not murder you only save you let me hear the words the old paladin let his head fall i hear you he said do what must be done i know what fate awaits me in the hereafter darius stepped to the side closing both hands around the hilt of his sword he heard pallos whispering a prayer to his god and the sound knifed through his heart i do no wrong he whispered i perform no sin in this i take no joy he swung his greatsword cleaved through palloss neck and struck stone on the other side as it did darius saw a black flame burst from his sword it terrified him and he refused to think of it and locked it far away inside his mind a single cut sebastian said grinning well done darius darius did not bother to contradict him i must go find lodging he said distracted nonsense the lord beckoned him to follow you will stay with me here in the castle ill not have you go seeking an inn as if i turned away an honored guest consider it another part of my service to karak if you wish the keeper of the dungeon a heavyset man who had remained hidden in the shadows stepped out at their departure darius glanced back once saw him unhooking the body for burial and then looked away valessa hated the wilderness she felt exposed without the comforting crowd of the city to blend in and vanish every noise seemed louder every footfall breaking a twig or leaf when in cities though she yearned for the outdoors to be away from prying eyes that were ever watchful in truth she was generally unhappy wherever she went though she was reluctant to admit it must he have fled to the north she asked ducking her head underneath a branch the top of her hood rustled its leaves and she felt several break off and fall upon her and her horse wouldnt you if you knew the might of karak chased after asked her companion a smaller slender woman named claire they both wore heavy gray cloaks over their outfits plain clothes hiding tightly interwoven leather armor i wouldnt bother running valessa said id at least be willing to face my tribunal and die with honor dying in betrayal to karak has no honor no matter what manner of death valessa drew a dagger and stared into its perfect sheen true there was nothing honorable about the deaths they brought they were the gray sisters and they killed in secret and in silence claire pulled back her hood and shook her blonde hair loose days warm she said the most in two weeks at least just means winters about to arrive in force valessa grumbled what you hate winter now claire laughed ive always thought blood looks beautiful spilled across white snow that and its easy to blame a death on the frost if were careful enough and dont use a blade keep your wire and poisons to yourself claire my knife is enough to shit she hadnt been paying attention only trusting her horse to follow the road at the last moment she saw a thin coil of rope hidden beneath an unnatural pile of leaves yanking on the reins valessa reared her horse back trying to avoid it but it was too late the rope snapped its knot closing in on her mounts front two legs the horse shrieked as its body was brutally jarred to one side its legs unable to properly balance valessa leapt clear to avoid being crushed underneath she rolled spun and drew a blade in each hand her eyes already surveying the area for assailants show yourself claire called out still mounted so far no one revealed their presence an unwatched trap valessa asked were not far from sebastians castle bandits have been making his life miserable from what i hear this may be just a nuisance valessa kept her body in a crouch ready to move at a moments notice her curved daggers never wavered in her hands her horse continued to make noise as it struggled to stand tiring of the distraction claire pulled out a small crossbow that had been attached to her belt and fired the bolt sunk into the horses throat valessa watched knowing it would not take long for the lethal poison to end the creatures pain its breathing turned heavy its head fell and finally they could hear the forest was eerily silent around them if there were critters about they remained low and hidden valessa felt the hairs on her neck rise and she knew she was being watched but from where my horse can bear two claire said spinning her mount in place so she could check all directions we can race along or flee back south traps might be set in either direction valessa said her voice low she took a careful step toward claire then another what were they waiting for two women riding alone and they were smart enough to treat them as dangerous prey whoever these bandits were they were either cowards or too intelligent for their own good valessa certainly hoped for the former stay still a mans voice shouted to her right she spun a man camouflaged with mud stepped from around a tree he held a bow in hand an arrow notched but not pulled at ready another man followed behind him holding a heavy club only two claire asked whose service are you in the man with the bow asked karak valessa answered no your lord we have no lord but karak she said starting to lose whatever patience she had the men stepped closer and she spaced out the distance between them she could be at their side in a second two at most so youre not with lord sebastian the man with the club asked claire rolled her eyes no valessa said were not he jabbed the other with his elbow i tolds you he said we just killed them ladies horse how was i supposed to know they was riding along like they was messengers you two are bandits i take it valessa asked the two men seeing that she did not appear angry calmed were warriors of kaide goldflint not bandits the two gray sisters exchanged a look is that so valessa said pardon me i would hate to insult such mighty men please put your weapons down i would feel terribly upset if one of us was hurt through another accident the closer one lowered his bow but the other kept a tight grip on his club he was staring at her daggers she realized she certainly didnt look the helpless maiden realizing this she abandoned her stance and a smile crossed her face an easy wellpracticed mask were ladies of the south she said my weaponsmaster taught me a few things but i can only do so much with these little blades hate holding them honestly fighting is for the men aye it is said the bowman he approached and he bowed clumsily forgive us we meant no harm to your horse but were fighting a war and sometimes accidents can hap valessa rammed her elbow into his throat silencing him her first slash cut the string from his bow her other hand sliced in opening his belly a twirl and both daggers ripped gashes across his chest mouth hanging open he stared at her dumbfounded as he died she heard a twang followed by a sharp whistle and knew claires crossbow was at it again turning to the man with the club she found him slumped against a tree a bolt sticking out of his left eye he tried to say something but the poison was already working through his body paralyzing him valessa wiped the blood from her daggers and sheathed them checking herself she found shed stepped in where her horse had shit itself upon death muttering she scraped her boot clean on the road then kicked the man shed killed when we find darius he doesnt die immediately she said frowning at her boot i want time to make him suffer dark laughter cut through the forest and both women startled at the noise standing in the shadow of a tree his eyes shimmering was a pale man in black robes i know you claire said and the chill in her voice was frightening youre the one who claims to be karaks prophet whom the priests call velixar the man smiled his face gradually changing as he did valessa tried to act calm but before her stood a legend her knees suddenly felt weak and her heart pounded in her chest the man with the everchanging face the voice of the lion was truly before her i have heard stories of you valessa said offering a low bow though i never thought i would be gifted with your presence few consider my presence a gift then they are not loyal to karak velixar smiled but his eyes were analyzing them both peering into her in a way that left her feeling naked and uncomfortable valessa looked to the dead bodies nearby and for some reason felt embarrassed by them why are you here he asked claire started to answer but valessa cut her off she would not lie about her mission not to one as ancient as the prophet we hunt for the failed paladin known as darius we are to be his executioners no tribunal he had his tribunal claire said he killed them we need no further testimony no trials the stronghold has cast him out and declared him a traitor velixar seemed amused by the words but that amusement never touched his eyes they burned like fire and valessa struggled to look away then you two are gray sisters the priests ghosts in the night i should have known the honor of a tribunal would be beyond your handling we do the work of karak same as you claire snapped the ire in her voice stirred something inside valessa and she shook her head as if struggling to wake from a dream will you help us she asked weve traveled from mordeina and the north is vast darius might hide anywhere and it is best we deal with this soon before he might further damage the faithful help you velixar laughed no sisters i will not help you i recognize your cloaks your garb and though you may not remember it i dipped inside your dreams last night that is why i am here i come bearing a command leave darius to me he is mine to teach and to discipline as i desire we cant abandon our mission claire said she was openly glaring now and valessa tried to figure out why she knew little of the prophet only vague stories many of them surely exaggerated to be ordered away from a kill was disheartening true but claire looked like shed been ordered to commit treason you are disobeying the order of your god velixar said his deep voice rumbling the priests have decided otherwise claire said and that was then valessa remembered the council of stars you have no authority over us she said she felt her palms sweating as she clutched her daggers the priests gathered and high priest multhar multhar was a coward and a fiend who beat children for his sexual perversions velixar said his hands shook with rage none of you hear the words of karak none of you have stood in awe of his majesty and strength i was there sisters one of the first men ever given life from the dust i was there as he battled ashhur when he was so close to victory our god gave me eternal life even as he was imprisoned by the elven whore he gave me this mantle and i have carried it for centuries you damn fools do you think i care about the opinion of a single man or his councils claires horse backed away at the violent fury of his voice and valessa felt a desire to fall to her knees and beg for forgiveness but she was stronger than that and her own fury rose up no one dared challenge her faith it is no matter claire said you are a prophet indeed but the words of prophets are slippery and often confused the stronghold in its wisdom has demanded dariuss death and we shall deliver it if you disagree then go to our high enforcer and let him hear your anger slippery velixar asked confused hear me the time comes when war will bathe all of dezrel when even the faithful will be tested angels and demons will bleed from the sky cities will burn and i will be made a prince over the army of karak this future approaches and is closer with every breath you take do you think in that newly come age you will stand before me and declare me false declare me confused valessa stood tall and despite the hammering of her heart in her chest she spoke calmly and with authority in that day we will serve karak no different than we do now we will not bow to you you are not karak even if you speak for him we have heard karaks words in our own way and we will do our duty a man slaughtered fellow members of the faithful and we will bring vengeance upon him do not try to stop us velixar shook his head all his anger was gone replaced with a mixture of sadness and disappointment you two are faithful he said that i can tell it is a shame you have no wisdom i have given you my warning darius is mine and mine alone interfere and i will bring the wrath of the lion down upon you and we shall see which of us karak truly favors with that he was gone vanishing in a blur of shadows that trailed to the sky like dust claires horse neighed seeming more at ease after the prophets vanishing bravely spoken claire said guiding her horse over and offering valessa a hand she accepted it feeling as if she were waking from a nightmare i pray we did no wrong she said do not worry hes a phantom of another age the world has moved on though i fear he still lingers in past wars and sacrifices if you say so valessa said sitting behind claire atop her horse still he is powerful i have no doubt about that and i doubt your poisons will do anything more than make him mad well claire said gently nudging her horse onward in that case we can always cut off his damn head i dont care how immortal he thinks he is no one lives through that thinking of his gaze and those eyes which burned like fire valessa didnt feel quite so certain after jerico finished his morning meal kaide stepped inside without knocking he leaned against the wall beside the door his arms crossed eyes hard jerico pretended not to notice you didnt try to escape kaide said was i supposed to you cant be happy with my keeping you here to be honest im not happy about it either but you saved the life of my friends last night if given the choice of keeping them alive or letting you loose well surely you understand my choice jerico sighed do you think me an idiot he asked i can see what is before me i understand and i dont blame you doesnt mean i like it or that i think youre in the right there are other ways then why did you not try to flee did you know i posted a guard in secret jerico shook his head no kaide when i leave this place i will leave in daylight standing tall and my shield upon my back not like a thief not like a coward besides i have nowhere else to go kaide looked away and he seemed lost in thought jerico returned to his bed and sat upon it he missed his armor particularly his shield still vulnerable as he was he would not act it before the bandit leader ashhur was still with him no matter the state of the rest of the world with him he would show no fear you are a paladin kaide said suddenly your word is law to you correct i dont lie and i dont break promises jerico said just not my style then fight for me he said give your word you wont leave and you can be free to roam the forest you alone could frighten many a knight and to have you there in the conflict those i left behind they might still be alive no jerico said shaking his head i wont lift my mace for you but i will promise to stay until i have your leave if youll let me come and go as i please you have my word kaide didnt look happy and his frown looked strong enough to cut stone some of my men worship your god he said they want you to counsel them give one of your whatever sermons will you you heard my demands fine give me your word jerico stood and offered his hand i will stay offer my wisdom and help keep your men alive all i ask is that you listen and lie to me not as i will not lie to you your kind can sense lies kaide said is that not what the stories say they do kaide took his outstretched hand and shook it by the wrist then you know i speak truth help me protect those i care for and you will be no prisoner excellent jerico said a smile spreading across his face i was about to go insane cramped in here when do i get my shield and armor back kaide opened the door and stepped out i dont remember saying anything about that he said and winked jerico opened his mouth closed it and realized he should pay more attention to the deals he made never was much for politics he muttered to himself kaide led him to the main campfire where the rest of the men were eating some gave him a strange look but most appeared happy to see him given how many of their wounds he tended jerico figured he at least deserved a bit of common courtesy jerico has agreed to help us of his own volition kaide said to the men he is no prisoner and i expect you all to treat him like one of our own he gonna fight one of the burlier ones asked can he fight asked another familiar voice jerico turned and saw adam glowering nearby a mace and a shield jerico said grinning at him thats all id need to get that nose of yours broken in a more appealing direction the rest laughed and jerico was surprised to see adam did too took nearly six of us to take this bull down he said smacking jerico across the back and that was with a damn net to help better you with us than locked in a cabin like an unfaithful woman jerico will only be using his healing arts kaide said sounding none too pleased about it he glanced at jerico and there was a spark of hope in his eyes though maybe he will help in your training theres only so much i can teach you sods and my training is nothing compared to what the citadel offers offered jerico said kaide gave him a funny look then shrugged either way hell be giving his sermons soon though it will be up to him when he stopped and jerico followed his gaze a horse approached from the forest path though its rider was not the soldier or bandit he expected instead it was a young boy still a year or two from having the first hairs sprout from his chin he rode to the fire and hopped down before the horse was even settled kaide he cried rushing up to the man what is it kaide asked a deathly seriousness coming over him whats wrong its beth the boy said she she kaide put his hands on the boys shoulders holding him still as tears overwhelmed his ability to talk jerico stepped beside him and whispering a prayer put his hand on top of the boys head calming emotions poured into him so when kaide spoke he had rapt attention listen to me ricky he said take a deep breath right now and then let it out good dont look at anyone else just at me tell me whats wrong no tears just talk ricky sniffed but he stared ahead and did as kaide asked beth got bit by a spider he said first ma thought it was nothing but it made her veins red like a strawberry and it went all the way up her arm ma says we shouldve cut it off but we didnt and shes getting worse and her hand its its enough kaide said youve done fine tell me wasnt there a paladin there gahal or something like that hes gone ricky said shaking his head we got no one thats why ma sent me to you she said she wants you there for beth before she goes kaide patted the boy on the head then stood he looked to jerico who didnt even need to think before answering you know i will he said your sister aint going anywhere kaide said motioning for another of the men to come take care of the boy as well as stable the horse you understand me ricky rest up and eat something he hurried toward the southern edge of their camp and jerico followed you gave me your word kaide said as they entered a small stable with only three horses i plan on keeping it too can you ride a horse jerico grabbed a saddle and set it atop the largest of the three learned plenty at the citadel he said feeling a sting just saying the places name yes i can ride and ride fast how far is beths village place called stonahm six hours ride four if we push the horses to their limit id rather not kill one creature trying save another jerico said as he mounted my beth is no creature kaide said fury in his eyes forgive me jerico said stepping back then well see just how strong these beasts are my shield where is it kaide shook his head im traveling alone with you on horseback while leaving my little fortress lets not test my trust any further than i already am now ride you bastard and try to keep up he kicked the sides of his own horse and bolted down the path as if the hounds of the abyss were at his heels jerico whispered a soothing word to his own mount offered a prayer to ashhur and then was off in chase the hours passed kaide in the lead jerico trailing they left the forest within the first half hour bursting onto open plains like wanted men which in a sense they were though jerico derived little pleasure from the comparison as he thought of it now without a path jerico relied on kaide to lead the way the hooves thundered below them and jerico prayed no animal holes or hidden rocks tripped either of them as the day wore on the plains turned to hills and they wound through their centers the grass which had been thick and tall enough to scratch at the bottoms of his feet steadily shrank when the hills ended jerico saw the first of the farmland there jerico shouted pointing to a distant village beyond kaide shouted back a shift of direction and they found themselves on a worn dirt road following it they crossed between the fields all lowcut and freshly harvested they stopped at a stream to let their horses drink and catch their breath would that we could ride all day without stopping kaide muttered it has to be done jerico said knowing it would be little comfort how old is beth if shes big enough she might fight off a bite unless the spider was a black fiddler kaide put his back to him instead tending to his horse when he said nothing jerico pressed on who is she kaide why do we ride beths my daughter he said ill speak no more of it jerico opened his mouth to ask a question thought better of it and instead tended his own mount they rode in silence the only sound that of their horses hoofbeats and heavy breathing in the distance jerico caught sight of a white line of smoke just behind a cluster of hills that broke the monotony of the fields he glanced over and saw kaide staring at it and he knew stonahm was near the road led them there and even if it didnt seem possible kaide urged his mount ever faster bandit and paladin they thundered into the dirt streets of the village wheres beth kaide shouted at no one in particular already a crowd gathered and it was obvious to jerico that kaide was respected if not revered he bit his tongue and resolved himself to say nothing he would not judge only listen and learn here kaide shouted an older man his hairline receding and his blue eyes showing hints of a murky white the people parted and the two followed the old man into a thatched hut inside was dark and smelled heavily of herbs and incense jerico fought the urge to cough shes been bitten said the man gesturing to where a young woman slept on a bed blankets pulled up to her neck im sure ricky told you as much ive drained it best i can but its beyond my healing im sorry kaide i tried i really did but sometimes it seems like the gods seek a life and nothing can stop them from taking it no god will steal her from me kaide said kneeling beside his daughter beth beth can you hear me hasnt stirred for at least an hour the old man said carefully settling into a chair near the bed sleeping more than me even oh hrmph where are my manners he stood and offered jerico his hand my names kalgan pleasure to meet you jerico he said of the citadel citadel kalgan glanced back at kaide is it did you truly find a healer for her i did kaide said standing when he looked to jerico his face was a cracked mask the emotion behind threatening to break loose at any moment do your duty paladin jerico stepped close to examine the girl she looked twelve maybe thirteen her hair was dark the same color kaides must have been before the early gray took over she had a round face large cheeks and a hint of a scar underneath her chin which arm he asked as he pulled down the blanket the left said kalgan he neednt have asked the fingers of her left arm were black and blue the veins a violent red as they snaked up to her shoulder all across the arm were small black lesions black fiddler he muttered behind him kaide swore i thought as much kalgan said sighing i feared to speak it aloud though you may think me foolish didnt want to make it true by saying it jerico chuckled at the superstition as he tried to remember details of such a bite from his time at the citadel his lessons on healing magic had been sparse and mostly focused on a single detail if his faith was strong and the injured still alive then anyone could be saved whether she would keep her arm however was another matter entirely kaide he said making sure he kept his voice calm i may ask you for something you will immediately refuse i ask you to think on it instead and to trust me can you do this what are you talking about just tell me i said will you do it he turned and the stern look on his face was enough to make kaide back down for her kaide said please just save my little beth jerico closed his eyes and as he whispered the first of many prayers he touched beths arm to his sensitive mind it was like touching fire he gritted his teeth and endured hed healed broken bones and bleeding wounds the size of fists he would not be defeated by the poison of a spider light shone from his touch and it spread jerico dared look only once but it was enough to make him shudder the light faltered whats wrong kaide asked quiet jerico said through clenched teeth the healing magic danced through the flesh of her arm like long trails of light in his minds eye everything he touched was burdened with death tainted black he tried to flood it with light to give of his strength to power the healing as with everything there had to be sacrifice and it came from him he gasped at the effort broken limbs were just thin mendings of bone cuts were malleable skin this though this was giving life to the dead sweat poured down his head and he heard ringing in his ears kaide he said his voice labored i cannot do it its been too long her arms begun to rot shell live i swear on my life shell live but i must remove it her arm kaide said but no shes just jerico glanced back to see kalgan putting a hand on kaides shoulder the bandit leader swore again then looked away do it he said but i will hold you to your oath give me a knife the work was fast and brutal jerico had no time for subtlety the arm was like an anchor pulling her body toward death fever and rot slowly crawling upward he cut it off at the elbow freeing her from it blood spilled across the bed when the arm was removed completely he pressed his hands against the stump and begged to ashhur for strength he should have cut the arm immediately he knew but hed had to try to save it first that attempt had sapped much of his energy so that even breathing proved difficult now he needed just a little bit more for some venom remained past the cut like an embedded thorn not for me jerico prayed not for me for her he never heard it never felt it but kaide gasped behind him as did the old man jerico counted to ten then opened his eyes beth still slept but already color was returning to her body what little red that had shown in her veins was gone taking the severed arm jerico wrapped it in a bloody blanket and handed it to kalgan burn it he said his hands shook as he held it burn it and remember why it had to be done without a word kalgan slipped out of the room unsure if he could stand jerico shoved himself to a sit adjacent to beths bed giving kaide room to go to her beth kaide said taking her remaining hand and kissing her forehead im here daddys here you can sleep but you arent going anywhere on me do you hear daddy couldnt daddy couldnt take it youre all thats left all right so you stay strong kaide collapsed into the chair kalgan had sat in no doubt remaining at her side during much of her illness was she lefthanded or right jerico asked his eyes closed and his head leaning against the wall right kaide said and he laughed mirthlessly should i thank ashhur for that small favor how about the big one she lives she breathes and shell love you as much now as she ever did before an arms just an arm they heard commotion from outside the hut from his time in durham jerico knew that in such a small village every member would be aware of beths brush with death and no doubt word of her survival would spread like wildfire if they had anything to spare for a feast theyd surely prepare it now youre right kaide said after a lengthy pause forgive me nothing to forgive kalgan stepped back inside and he looked much relieved to have the severed arm gone i must say jerico i usually scoff at the little things others insist are miracles from the gods but your arrival is surely one such miracle to have one of our paladins die only for another to come in our hour of need die who died jerico asked kalgan glanced at him raising his bushy eyebrows hed been with us only a few weeks young lad named galahall did you know him jerico shook his head younger than me most likely how did he die troublesome that but ive always said the dealings between gods should be left to the gods themselves he fought a paladin of karak over what im not sure i can only assume it was important jerico bolted to his feet losing his balance as he did kaide caught him looking bewildered whats the matter he asked the dark paladin jerico asked is he still here kren yes why jerico looked to the thin door of the hut imagining the commotion outside in the minutes that had passed surely everyone in the village had heard the same story that of a paladin coming and healing sick little beth a paladin of ashhur we need to go now jerico said but it was already too late the door was kicked open and there stood a man in the black armor of karak a roaring lion painted in yellow across his shield his sword was still sheathed but his hand rested upon it ready to draw jerico stood to his full height his right hand leaning against the wall to keep himself steady youre young jerico said for he thought of nothing else to say kren sneered he was a handsome man his brown hair falling far beyond the reach of his helmet shadows of a beard grew about his chin you come without weapon and without armor kren asked surprised was this a ploy or a disguise surely you have not cast aside your faith if you can heal the bandits girl such sad sport is this i dont need either to handle a young pup like you jerico said wishing he felt as bold as he sounded but this is a house of healing would you disgrace your hosts by spilling blood across this floor enough kaide stepped between them and he glared at kren what is going on here he asked what madness draws you to challenge a man you have never met this has nothing to do with you kaide step aside not until i hear something that makes some damn sense kren drew his sword a serrated blade that swarmed with dark fire he pointed it at jericos throat their time is at an end he said karak has called for war what paladins of ashhur are left are few i will not lose such an honor as to have slain two of their kind this man has saved the life of my sister and my daughter consider the honor denied they glared at one another the tension thick enough to cut jerico knew what was about to unfold and he could not allow it with such close quarters and without any armor kaide didnt stand a chance he would not save beths life just for her to wake to her fathers slaughter the dark paladin was preparing for an attack no time left to think jerico glanced at the walls the hut was old and appeared used only as a house of healing its walls were thin aged boards with rusted nails swallowing his pride he grabbed kaide from behind flung him to the side and then dove the other way his shoulder hit the wall first followed by the rest of his body the wood cracked and boards tore loose jerico rolled along the grass clenching his teeth against the pain of a dozen cuts across his exposed arms and legs pulling out of the roll he spun to see kren giving chase the gathered crowd shouted their disproval for they knew jerico must be the stranger that had come to heal beth as jerico watched several men tried to block krens way only for one to be cut down and two others shoved aside despite their anger the villagers were unarmed men and women what could they do against a man fully armored and wielding a blade of dark flame jerico glanced down at himself good question what could he do unarmed and unarmored versus such an opponent still no others would die for him let him pass jerico shouted i stand here on open ground face me dog of karak reluctantly the crowd relented and kren burst forth running as fast as he could in his armor jerico tensed mobility was his only defense even with superior faith he had no item to project that power through negating any other potential advantage he might have had kren tried to gut him without slowing his charge no doubt trusting his armor to protect him should they collide jerico twisted avoiding just in time krens feet skidded across the ground and he changed directions before jerico could dodge again blood splashed over them both as the blade wounded his chest crying out in pain jerico fell to one knee avoiding a blow that would have taken off his neck lunging he wrapped kren in a grapple attempting to lift him from his feet krens shield jammed into his shoulder and the weight was too great unable to complete the tackle jerico shifted again positioning his leg behind krens knee the hilt of krens sword rammed down on the top of his head forcing through the pain he shoved again knocking the dark paladin to his back by now the crowd had reformed and they were hurling insults and hissing at kren as jerico pinned krens sword he wished the crowd would do something useful like tossing him a shield he managed a few solid blows before kren pulled his shield high enough to protect himself the dark paladin struggled unable to lift his sword with jerico pinning his wrist but armored as he was and his face now protected jerico knew he had little chance to do any more damage unless hoping surprise would be on his side he shifted so that his left knee pinned the blade fire burned into his flesh and he screamed but he did not relent with both hands he clutched krens shield pulling it aside kren turned his head expecting another blow but that wasnt jericos plan instead he grabbed the inner handle attempting to wrestle away control kren fought but as jerico gained further control he saw a blessed sight the light of his faith burning across the outer surface of the shield peeling away the lion and turning the black paint to gold i will break you kren screamed youre a blasphemy i will burn you with fire doing a good enough job already jerico thought his entire left knee throbbing in unbearable pain as the light swelled on his shield jerico lifted it higher trying to press it against krens flesh before he could kren released the shield completely and his fist smashed against jericos leg while filled with the fury of his god heretic the dark energies swirled through his already wounded leg bursting burnt flesh and shattering the bones of his knee jerico fell back his mind white with pain on pure instinct he clutched his shield before him his only defense kren rose to his feet blood dripping from his nose and one side of his face burned from where his cursed helmet had begun to melt from the proximity to the holy shield my faith is stronger kren said his upper body rising and falling with each labored breath give ashhur my contempt when i send you to him not today kaide said having hidden amid the crowd his dirk slipped through a gap near krens lower back piercing his spine kaides other arm wrapped about krens neck holding him in place so he could not retaliate after a moment kaide let him go the paladin dropped his eyes lifeless seeing this jerico let go of the shield and collapsed kaide was over him in a moment examining his knee you with the pain so great jerico struggled for every word you stabbed him in the back i did kaide said cutting off jericos pant leg so he could see the wound better not honorable jerico laughed delirious amid the pain this worlds life or death kaide said frowning like i give a damn about honor his vision fading jerico closed his eyes and tried to focus on his breathing around him he heard murmured sounds of people talking carry him someone said most likely kalgan gently please hands grabbed him and he screamed i said gently watch for his leg gods what a mess that was the last jerico heard before he blacked out completely the numbers gathered for the offering stunned darius it seemed like the entire countryside had come to hear his words and receive karaks blessing every time he glanced out from behind the curtain he felt his chest tighten and panic swell in his throat the crowd waited in the courtyard warmed by the thick clothes they wore and the few scattered fires built among them meanwhile darius remained in the castle thinking of excuses for delay when the service began he would step out onto a balcony and overlook the crowd from above as if he were their king theres so many darius said checking for what seemed like the tenth time of course sebastian said adjusting his cloak service is obligatory or at least it was until our priest left and we had no one to administer the offerings are you nervous son do not call me son darius said harsher than he meant i am a warrior for karak and will not be insulted so of course of course i meant no offense its only a term of endearment for someone younger than i darius looked to the curtain and he listened to the impatient murmurings of the crowd seemed strange to him for service to be mandatory but hed heard of smaller towns having such rules so it wasnt that unusual sometimes to cultivate faith the faithless needed to be forced onto the path of righteousness youre right he said i am nervous ive taught only in small villages out there how many a thousand two last census count four thousand and three hundred at least within walking distance those too far away must give their tithes along with their taxes but dont worry darius ill be at your side the whole time you darius asked why not sebastian grinned at him it does good for the simple folk to see me beside you it lets them know that we are their lords the masters of their lives to turn on one of us is to turn on the other i will have no traitors to karak in my household darius struggled not to react but what do you do when the priests of ashhur come the lord rolled his eyes i say pretty words toss them a few coins and pretend to mull over having a second service for ashhur their stays are not long liceridden beds and stale bread usually ensure that though im not above a knife in the dark im sure you understand darius stood and he pulled aside the curtain i do he said stepping out onto the balcony the crowd quieted and they looked up to see a stranger for a moment he said nothing only scanned faces judging reactions most were impatient or bored he saw plenty that clearly wanted nothing to do with giving offerings to karak many still talked not caring if they disturbed others forced faith thought darius was this its culmination if he walked among them he wondered if hed find even a handful as faithful as his flock had been back in durham welcome to the seventh day darius said his voice failed him and only the first few rows even knew he spoke battling his nerves he swallowed took another step toward the balconys edge and let his voice cry to the winds welcome to the seventh lift your voice and let me hear your faith in our mighty god the halfhearted murmurs nearly broke his heart only those near the front cried out and they were so few no he thought perhaps their previous priest was a calm quiet man faith in crowds was like a fire once it started to burn itd spread with incredible speed he had to ignite it in this day we kneel to karak and present our offerings for his protection his strength and his blessings in this day we of the faithful receive our reward for our loyalty are you faithful people of the yellow rose a bit more energy this time as they shouted yes darius smiled he felt his nerves sliding away this was no different than durham they needed to see his own faith feel his own energy pouring out of him and he would give it i asked are you faithful more shouts they were waking up now leaving their slumber to join the lion then let us pray darius drew his sword flipped it about and stabbed it into the balcony hands on his hilt he bowed his head but something was wrong the crowd murmured and immediately he knew hed lost them what was it opening his eyes he realized his error his sword bore no flame even the common folk knew that its strength mirrored that of his faith what is the meaning of this sebastian asked standing beside him with his hands clasped behind his back darius opened his mouth to lie then stopped no he would not profane his soul before thousands of witnesses my faith in karak is strong as ever he said just loud enough for sebastian to hear but i fear i have displeased my god and he has denied me his blessing lord hemman stepped away a single motion of his hand sent guards rushing in surrounding him down below the crowd erupted with confusion darius kept his sword where it was though his grip on the hilt was strong enough to make his hands hurt he eyed the guards waiting for one to make their move do not make me cut you down while they watch sebastian said no matter if you deserve it or not by karak how could i be so foolish now release your sword darius thought to resist but hed never make it out of the castle alive more than ever he felt revealed of his failure sebastian could give near exact count of the amount of men and women that had just seen the proof of karaks displeasure with him he would not go to the abyss not as he was as you wish he said letting go of his sword and stepping away calmly sebastian said to his guards they took darius by the arm and led him away and it wasnt until they were out of sight of the crowd that they clasped his hands behind his back and bound him darius repeated a litany of faith to karak as sebastian stepped back to the crowd lifted his arms and resumed the offerings as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened h ours later darius sat in the cold darkness his hands chained to the wall his arms ached from the uncomfortable position but he refused to let it bother him he would not give sebastian the satisfaction even worse was the jailor he lurked in the corner barely visible in the smoldering light of a torch whenever darius tried to move or groaned with pain the man would open his mouth to laugh though hed make no sound someone perhaps even sebastian had removed his tongue this jailor would tell no secrets and make no bargains the door creaked and then light pierced the darkness darius closed his eyes and prayed for the thousandth time to karak for forgiveness well this is certainly interesting sebastian said when darius opened his eyes he saw the lord standing at the entrance to his cell torch in hand unnecessary is a better term darius said perhaps i hope you know where you are youre chained in the same cell pallos was when you executed him in the name of karak im sure theres some irony here though i wont know it yet until you tell me your story i have no story to tell i am a faithful servant of karak then karak has refused your service sebastian said stepping closer to the bars why is that paladin how did you fail i did not fail sebastian laughed as darius blushed ashamed of the outburst what was happening to him that he would lose his temper so easily you humiliated me before my people sebastian said pacing before the cell his footfalls echoed with maddening consistency some now claim the offerings are extra taxes clothed in the garb of faith others want your head for they decry you an imposter ive spread a few rumors of my own my favorite is that you were pretending to be a paladin to make an assassination attempt on my life so long as no one understands whats really going on i can manipulate this to whatever outcome i desire and what outcome is that darius asked feeling too tired for games what do you want with me i did you no wrong you heard my words you know i speak truthfully of my faith in karak this isnt about you boy said sebastian and he grinned at dariuss reaction at the term this is about the rest of your kind ive sent riders in search of the nearest priest or paladin of karak that might know who you are and what it is youve done to soil your name what will they tell me when they return what does the stronghold think of the paladin named darius darius closed his eyes and leaned his head against the cold stone theyll say i am a murderer he said theyll say i have turned against karak and betrayed my order did you eyes still closed he shook his head i dont know anymore sebastian chuckled then i dont know either i wont pass judgment on you just as i passed no judgment on pallos your own kind will come for you and do with you as they wish until then youll stay here im sure the stronghold will reward you well darius said as sebastian turned to leave thats what really matters i know the lord glanced back and smiled why that thought never crossed my mind sleep well darius the door slammed shut and the darkness returned once more in that darkness karaks prophet laughed sleep now velixar said waving an arm at the mute jailor the burly man slumped in his chair and passed out stepping out from the shadows the prophet crossed his arms and sighed his red eyes irises of fire chilled dariuss blood and sent shivers up and down his spine so this is where i find you you who i thought held such promise locked in a dungeon chained to a wall so you cannot even kneel in prayer to your god pathetic what do you want come now dont act the idiot with me even if you did seem somewhat dimwitted to sebastian you know what i want i am no deceiver no creature of lies i told you my desire when we first met and im not one prone to change darius did everything he could to not meet that gaze you want me to learn from you to accept your word as the word of karak i still refuse prophet velixar laughed and there was nothing pleasurable in the sound yes because the world certainly agrees with you tell me why am i the one with karaks power and you the fool locked in a cell why do the rest of the faithful refuse your wisdom if even that egomaniacal sebastian sees through your lies what hope have you for the rest of dezrel always questions darius said how do i learn from you when you say nothing velixar walked over and brushed a pale finger across the jailors forehead i ask questions to show you have no answers and will do so until you finally open your eyes and realize it the man in black shivered such wonderful dreams this man has seen the dark side of this world darius more than you could ever know if anyone understands dezrels need for order it is him will you help me escape darius asked feeling unclean as he did escape no dont you see this place this moment personifies you perfectly karak stands at the gate ready to free you and you simultaneously plead for aid while denying him his truths you cannot have both darius you cannot hold back karak with one hand and reach for his help with the other darius felt too tired too lost to argue he regretted even asking death at the hands of his brethren seemed better than going with the man with the everchanging face still what if velixar was right what if he truly spoke the will of his god velixar knelt before the gate appearing to be in no hurry the sun had set and the jailor slept they had all night do you know where you first erred velixar asked darius rolled his eyes more questions always questions i suppose youll say when i refused to kill my friend he said his voice full of sarcasm no that was just a symptom of a greater failure it is when you treated him as your equal as your friend call me a liar and doubt my wisdom but did you ever do the same to jerico you overlooked his lies you forgave his belief in the false god you treated him as one of your own and in turn spat in the face of karak ashhur is the enemy you cannot serve karak and refuse that simple truth no darius said wishing he could call for the guards no youre wrong karak doesnt want murder he doesnt want bloodshed he wants order he wants peace velixar stood all trace of humor left him when he spoke there was no mockery no anger instead darius heard something all the more frightening certainty my eyes are everywhere he said i watched you kill the paladin pallos answer me this one question truthfully and i will let you be what happened when you killed him what happened when your blade cleaved through palloss neck darius fought against the memory he had tried to think it made no sense that it had been a hallucination a delusion a deception the weight of it crushed him and when he looked into velixars eyes he knew he could not lie so he said nothing for what else could he say but velixar knew no smiles no bragging he spoke quietly almost gently your blade burned with karaks fire didnt it at that glorious moment you felt the presence of your god darius felt tears slide down his face i did he said his voice cracking you took the life of a paladin of ashhur and karak blessed you for it the truth could not be any simpler do you still deny me he wanted to he needed to shaking his head darius clung to the last vestige of his faith killing jerico would have been wrong he said you will never convince me otherwise velixar put his back to him and as the shadows swirled about he spoke i will not be the one to convince you darius you will do that on your own when you do i will be waiting and i will welcome you back to the glory of karak with open arms the shadows thickened and then velixar was gone darius jolted as if hed been asleep the whole while tears remained on his face in the corner the jailor snored damn you jerico darius whispered i hope you live i hope you live a thousand years for the suffering i must endure he slept not long and not comfortably his dreams were dark and karaks contempt filled them with shadows and fire kalgan sat beside him when jerico came to his consciousness swimming to the surface amid an ocean of pain how long jerico asked lying very still which kept the pain at its least just a few hours kalgan said youre tougher than you look thanks i guess water a bony hand pressed against his back as he sat up every movement made his leg ache but he was thirsty and refused to let the pain control him he accepted a small wooden cup and drank it tasted strangely bitter but he downed it anyway theres a few herbs in there to help you kalgan said taking back the cup some youve heard of and some i doubt youve ever seen before youll sleep well and itll dull the pain ignore any strange hallucinations it gives you already he felt his head turning light and he tried to protest i shouldnt things like that spare me jerico even in your sleep you moaned with pain jerico breathed in deep and tried to relax best he could tell he was back in the same hut and when he glanced left he saw the patched up hole that had been his exit earlier beth was gone and he hoped that meant her recovery was going well your ability to heal kalgan said settling into his chair and resting his hands on his lap can you use it on yourself in a way jerico said his throat felt dry despite the drink and his tongue thick his pain was dulling though which was nice it requires concentration and if the pain is bad which it is i thought so you wont be going anywhere for a few days i suspect youll be up and about faster than any man has right to but it wont be today i already told kaide as much kaide jerico started to sit up but his stomach lurched and the whole room swayed as if the world had begun to shake he lay back down deciding such complicated actions like sitting up or talking could probably be done slowly or later yes he seemed quite worried for you not that youd get better but that youd run off i told him you had a few days to recover and i considered that generous most men would have never walked again and those that did would use a cane your kneecap is in pieces paladin as for the flesh around it well i wouldnt look if i were you not until youre ready to use ashhurs magic to remedy it not magic kalgan laughed and jerico chuckled along with him despite his sour mood call it what you want but kren did something to your leg when he touched you that much im certain i thought of cutting it off completely to be honest if i hadnt seen what youd done for beth id have already brought out the knife how is beth jerico asked after a moment to catch his breath he felt a heaviness settling over him like an invisible blanket weighted on all sides he wanted to lie still and do nothing but he refused to cooperate still asleep but in her own bed poor girl to suffer such a cruel fate from a little thing like a spider some parts of life are lost to her but shes resilient got that much from her father shell find a way to thrive and the people of this village love her dont worry about her fate just concentrate on your own ignoring kalgans earlier advice jerico sat up again his eyes didnt want to open but after a moment he rubbed them with his fingers and then pulled aside his blanket seeing his leg he turned to one side and vomited kalgan cursed up a storm whatd i tell you kalgan said he left then returned with a handful of dirt and sawdust to scatter atop the vomit does it smell of rot jerico asked pulling the blanket back over no for that i guess you can be thankful jerico laughed aye thankful if you dont mind im going back to sleep do you want me to splint the leg jerico thought of the black tissue around his swollen kneecap the blue veins streaking outward in all directions no he said dont touch it ashhur help me i dont want to think of the pain jerico slept and when he awoke again night had fallen several new blankets lay over him and despite their cover he felt cold all over kalgans chair was empty beside him kalgan he asked anyway his jaw trembled but at least his head felt somewhat clear from whatever concoction of herbs the old man had given him no one responded and that was fine hed need silence for what would follow please be with me ashhur he whispered as he shoved blanket after blanket aside shivers assaulted him and he knew without a doubt he was with fever no matter hed manage swallowing down his fear he pulled away the last blanket revealing his leg this time he refused to look away from the swelling bruises and puss his leg shook along with the rest of his body and the movement awoke spikes of pain that nearly made him pass out gritting his teeth he gently touched his knee with his fingertips closing his eyes he began his prayers to his deity the broken bones would have to wait for the curse of karak was embedded in his flesh if itd been delivered to his chest or throat hed have been killed within an hour if not instantly at his leg safely away from his lungs and heart hed survived but it was only a matter of time it was that curse he needed to banish he tried to focus on it as he had done with beth but he felt drained empty every shake of his fingers added to the pain and his concentration repeatedly faltered he wanted to lie down and sleep away the hours but he knew it would only get more difficult with time please jerico whispered panic starting to creep into his heart i dont know if im the last i dont know what happened at the citadel but you cant have abandoned us i just i cant believe that send me to my death if so but otherwise heal this damned leg of mine i cant do it on my own i cant krens words echoed in his head strangely powerful my faith is stronger perhaps so but it wouldnt matter he wouldnt let such a young whelp like him win he wouldnt let him claim his leg let alone his life even if he had to demand the healing from ashhur once more jerico prayed unable to hear his own words through the blood pounding in his ears he prayed until he felt no pain heard no sound felt no chill sleep took him f our days later jerico limped through the streets of stonahm since healing beth hed been treated the hero and his belly was full of mulberry pie and sweet autumn cider he wasnt completely sure it lacked any spirits but he hoped ashhur would be lenient good to see you about a man cried and jerico waved back politely not having a clue as to his name slowly he headed toward the northern reaches of the town the grass was much taller and it felt uncomfortable brushing against his knee he ignored it north of the town was a pond fed fresh water from a small stream which often dried up completely until heavy rains came in the spring the stream kept the water fairly clean and the people of stonahm cut the grass low about swimming and bathing in its waters jerico found a log by the side and sat down beyond relieved to take the weight off his leg waiting there for him was beth dressed in a pretty yellow dress thought you might not show she said smiling at him whys that because youre old old people dont heal as fast as young people thats what kalgan says jerico laughed that so kalgan may be right but youre wrong about me im hardly old see any grey hairs on my head she rolled her eyes obviously not impressed with his defense jerico laughed again then quieted his eyes fell on her left arm which was hidden by a long sleeve that while matching in color was clearly a new addition reaching over he carefully folded the sleeve twice revealing the stump ending at the elbow you shouldnt hide it he said ma says she blushed and looked away ma says if i dont the boys wont like talking to me and no one will want to marry me he gently tucked a finger underneath her chin and forced her to look at him smile and those boys will see nothing but how beautiful you are her blush deepened are you ready for your exercises she asked jerico took in a deep breath then sighed yeah lets do it beside the log was a simple creation jerico had asked kalgan to make for him it was a heavy stone with a hole in its center through that hole kalgan had threaded strong rope forming a second loop along the top it was that loop jerico stuck his foot through sliding it up to his ankle shifting his weight on the log until he was comfortable he nodded to let beth know he was ready any song in particular youd like she asked sing your favorite im sure ill enjoy it the second day hed been bedridden though his skin had mostly healed and only the bones needed to be knit back together beth had recovered from the bite and come to him to express her thanks while he lay there still battling fever shed sung softly to him several times hed drifted off to the sound of her voice and awoken later to hear the same crystalline beauty because of her injury shed been excused from nearly all her chores so when hed begun preparing his recovery shed offered to help beth sang a song of a highwayman in love with a forest maiden and the whole while jerico struggled to lift the stone he pretended the pain was an enemy but if it truly was an enemy it was defeating him krens blow had eradicated much of his muscle and while hed tended it best he could the newly healed flesh still felt withered unreliable sweat dripped down his neck as he lifted again and again sometimes pulling it an inch or two off the ground sometimes not even budging it whenever he could he focused on the lyrics instead of his pain by the time beths song ended he slumped leaning back on his arms enough he said i need a moment to breathe beth nodded and said nothing as he recovered jerico glanced at her and finally decided to ask about something that had been bothering him that boy ricky he came to us in the forest when you were bitten i thought i heard he was your brother yet later kaide said you were his only child left jerico felt awkward asking and was relieved when beth rolled her eyes clearly having had this conversation before rickys not my real brother nor is ma beverly my real mother jerico nodded hed met beverly a plain but kind woman who was rickys mother shed come to thank him for what hed done once kalgan had allowed people to visit what happened to your mother beth brushed a strand of hair behind her ear do you want another song she asked jerico nodded faster tempo if you would this time she sang a ditty thatd be right at home in a tavern and he forced the stone from the ground every single repetition his knee burned and the muscles of his lower leg quivered but he did not relent when the fifth song was done they called it quits with beths help jerico limped down to the pond and splashed water across his face and neck then dipped his leg below the cold surface after another few minutes he tried to stand on his own he wobbled beth went to steady him but he pushed her away should have taken kalgans offer up for a cane he muttered hed made his way to the pond just fine and by ashhur he was going to walk back to town as well maybe i should have sung shorter songs she said as jerico took another pained step then i would have made you sing more of them im not daft girl at her angry frown he laughed sorry youre right tomorrow i wont push myself so hard i promise you said that yesterday and you had to rest three times on the way back i did didnt i you did and you broke your promise again today some paladin you are jerico feigned a hurt look and then he took another step and feigning was no longer required step by step they made their way back to the village jerico had every intention of collapsing back in his bed and sleeping for ten hours but as they reached the edge of town he heard a sound that made his stomach harden whats going on jerico asked his voice low knights from yellow castle beth said please jerico go back my father says he gently pushed her aside and turned the corner a man and a woman were there the woman standing before the door to her home which was shut behind her already parts of her dress were torn the man towered over her wearing chainmail and carrying a sword that swung from his hip still sheathed her kissed her on the neck as she pleaded with him to stop tithes and taxes the knight said you know you need to pay the lord his due when she turned away from him he slapped her with his hand which still wore a gauntlet the metal bruised her face and blood dripped from her swollen lip jerico took a step closer unnoticed by either stunned he looked about they were not in hiding at least three people walked past and they kept their eyes ahead refusing to even look anger swelled in jericos chest he turned back around the corner a fire in his eyes beth saw him and paled please you cant interfere you cant i can he hobbled to a pen currently empty of animals which were still out in the fields resting against one side was a shovel and he took it its handle was long sturdy maybe not as potent a weapon as his mace but itd do beth stepped back chewing on her fingernails limping around the corner jerico thought he must look the most pathetic savior but it didnt matter he would not stand by and watch no matter the reason no matter what the rest of the village thought or did the womans blouse was mostly torn exposing one of her breasts the knight had cast aside his gauntlets one hand holding her wrist against the house the other feeling wherever he wished jerico limped closer the woman saw him and her eyes widened he swung the flat side of the shovel connected with the back of the knights head which slammed forward striking the door his legs went weak and he collapsed onto his rear the woman stood shocked still sobbing cover yourself jerico said to her and go to friends or family now she pulled at her dress and rushed away too scared to say a word jerico stood before the knight holding the shovel in both hands he kept his movements still not wanting to reveal the weakness of his knee you bastard the knight said spitting blood ill gut you for that this is lord sebastians land his town and his fucking taxes were you looking for coins down her blouse the knight grinned revealing redstained teeth you really think youre gonna walk away from this youre a farmer with a shovel he stood and drew his sword his stance was uneven his balance clearly shaken no doubt from the blows to his head jerico shifted planting his weight on his good leg i used the flat side as a warning jerico said but this irons heavy and the sides are sharp the next time i hit you it will leave more than a bruise the knights sneer showed how worried he was taking a step closer he swung a simple overhead chop jerico blocked it with the handle of his shovel wielding it much as he would a staff the wood was thick and though the sword cut an indent it was far from breaking through twisting the shovel jerico pushed away changed its angle and then struck him on the return swing the metal end smacked into his exposed face this time blasting free a tooth im warning you jerico said that was still the flat side the knight collapsed against the side of the house holding his free hand against his mouth he said something but it was muffled against his wrist jerico twirled the shovel hiding the pain he felt even the act of swinging put horrible pressure on the joint if the man managed to tackle him bring him to the ground jerico would have little chance of wrestling free he couldnt let him regain his confidence what was that jerico asked keeping his outward image perfectly calm instead of answering the knight charged no doubt hoping for surprise jerico had read him with ease though the knight had basic training but was used to relying on his armor and sword to bully about simple farming people against someone like jerico his attacks were obvious his strategies transparent flipping the shovel about jerico jammed the metal into the dirt bracing it the knight rammed himself against the other side of the handle which slipped underneath the metal of his breastplate the knight gasped blood and spittle flying from his lips the sword dropped from his hands and then he rolled off to the ground his teeth clenched against the pain jerico walked without a limp to where the sword lay and took it he tossed the shovel aside get up jerico said walk out of this village and go back to wherever you belong the knight rolled onto his knees and vomited jerico smacked his rear with the flat of his blade glaring the knight staggered to his feet and headed south jerico watched him go standing perfectly still until he was out of sight when he was gone he leaned all his weight on his good leg and let out a gasp jerico beth asked having stayed far away during the fight go find whoever that woman was jerico said make sure shes all right but go she stepped back her mouth open the anger in his voice left her stunned turning she ran jerico looked at the sword glad to see no blood anywhere on its blade by now others had gathered around whether from guilt curiosity or anger he didnt know but he knew how he felt seeing the people who had stood by and done nothing he hurled the sword at them take it he shouted let someone claim it as his own and maybe next time use it he limped back to his hut and on his way not a soul dared meet his eye once there he gathered what few things he had kalgan arrived not much later youre leaving he said and it was not a question i am youre not healthy we both know this where is it youll go jerico sighed back to the forest with kaide i made a promise i wont break it now but the wildwoods are miles away and on that leg the walking will strengthen it as well as if i stayed here jerico glared at him he felt tired exhausted and drained more than anything he felt fury at the people there whether it was fair or not he would stay no longer jerico was no fool he knew these things happened but at least someone could have stepped in someone could have summoned a crowd provided witnesses ill prepare you some food kalgan said he opened the door but his hand remained against it as if he were reluctant to leave what you did it might put us in danger then i hope you deal with it better than you did that knight stinging words and he regretted them immediately kalgan looked at him with sad eyes fair enough he said shutting the door behind him before jerico could apologize he struck the wall with a fist and once more wished the citadel remained if only he could return be in the company and comfort of his brethren theyd know what to do theyd know what path was right beth lingered outside when he stepped out youll need a guide she said kalgan says your horse is still here and you can ride it back let me go with you he almost said yes does your ma know youre here her guilty look was enough wanting no more reminders of kren the knight or his injury he took her by the shoulder and kissed her forehead stay here he said and be strong beth looked ready to cry but she was made of sterner stuff than that goodbye jerico she said hurrying away jerico found his horse and followed the road for several hours letting the agony of his knee and the wind through his hair pull him away from that last pained look shed given him just before turning to run the story had spread like wildfire throughout the north and the ears of the gray sisters were always attentive it might be him claire had said the first time they heard it sitting together in a crowded tavern at a crosssection of the main roads leading to the mountains how could he be that stupid though valessa had asked denouncing karak to an entire crowd of gatherers i dont believe it theyd headed for the castle of the yellow rose just in case for the drunk teller of the story had been adamant that the man remained there imprisoned on the way they heard another telling this one less embellished a dark paladin with no flame valessa said weve found him perhaps darius thought leading worship would restore his faith in the eyes of karak claire said as they rode it doesnt matter no fire no faith karak still wants him dead do we go in unknown or demand an audience with sebastian valessa bit her lip hes in custody and his punishment ours we go and reveal our nature to their lord itll be his head if he tries to deny us our rightful prisoner itd been three days since the event if the stories were to be believed the wind was cold the road hard and rocky as they rode toward the castle at the gates two guards stopped them demanding names and reasons for their visit im claire and this is my sister valessa claire said going with their standard cover as for our occupation lets just say you soldiers would greatly prefer no valessa said interrupting her she leapt off the back of their horse not worried that the guards drew their weapons she threw back her hood and stood at her full height i am valessa sister and servant of karak come from mordeina to speak with your lord sebastian hemman let us through and escort us if you must our business is urgent and we will not discuss it here have you any proof of this asked one of the guards seeming less impressed than the others proof valessa asked smiling at him valessa claire warned still astride her horse valessa ignored her and instead approached the doubting guard slipping her hand down her shirt she pulled out a pendant from beneath her armor it was the face of a lion its mouth open its teeth bared you wonder if i serve karak she asked if i am his powerful servant listen closely dimwitted man and i will speak to you your proof her gaze held him there was a charm in her words and power in her eyes the others watched as she slipped beside him ran a finger along his neck and then brushed his ear with her lips she took in a soft breath and then unleashed the fury of karak it was not her voice that screamed but that of the lion the others clenched their hands against their heads but the guard stood still his mouth open blood dripped down his neck spilling from his ears when the roar ended he collapsed hell live valessa said as the others lifted their swords though hell never hear from that ear again would anyone else like proof they let the gray sisters through along with an escort of six nervous soldiers inside the castle they waited several minutes until at last a knight came forward and gestured for them to follow they came before lord sebastian hemman sitting on his throne soldiers at either side of him valessa snickered at the protection so cute greetings ladies of karak sebastian said rising consider me honored to have such revered guests come to my home i hope the guards at the gate did not trouble you no trouble valessa said and claire turned her head to hide her smile i must confess im not familiar with your order are you paladins or perhaps priestesses we are what we are and that is none of your concern claire said her humor vanishing know only that we speak for the stronghold and for karak word has come to us of a prisoner and we believe him one we have hunted for the past weeks leave me sebastian said to his soldiers holding up a hand for the two women to pause the soldiers began filing out and none looked too happy with leaving their lord alone no gregane he said stopping one of the knights you stay the burly knight stepped back staying at the right hand of his lord the man you seek sebastian said when the rest were gone would you care to tell me his name the gray sisters exchanged a look and claire shrugged darius valessa said his name is darius and he once hailed from the stronghold sebastian stroked the hairs of his chin as he leaned back in his seat have you come to find him he asked or kill him does it matter claire asked it does for you see i had a very strange visitor last night his words of caution are difficult to shake valessa felt her stomach tighten and she did not miss claires eyes narrowing in anger this visitor valessa asked was he a man with many faces and eyes that burned like fire sebastian looked surprised but he hid it well he was and he told me that while orders were initially given to execute darius circumstances have changed he said id soon receive new orders from the stronghold signed by the hand of the high enforcer let me guess claire interrupted those new orders would hand darius over to him the prophet sebastian shrugged something to that effect valessa bit down a curse she turned to claire and lowered her voice to a whisper the commoners must never know of conflict between servants of karak she whispered do we dare challenge velixars authority sebastian is no commoner surely a lord understands that even servants must sometimes quarrel my ladies if i may interrupt sebastian smiled at them and something opportunistic glinted in his eyes that made valessa wary what is it claire asked no pretense of politeness in her words now for all i know last night was just a strange dream and gods are known to work in mysterious ways ashhur may have come in the guise of his enemy to save the life of a traitor for example to be prudent i will wait some time for new orders but until then i know of another who is an enemy of karak whose death i think would benefit us all valessa felt her anger grow at both the lord and the prophet we are not assassins to be directed as you wish claire seethed i understand i am simply suggesting a wise use of your time while i wait for new orders now should you perform this duty and return without me having heard word from the stronghold he let his voice trail off as he took a drink of wine the sisters exchanged another glance valessa could tell claire wasnt happy about this but short of executing sebastian there werent too many options currently available to them i knew we should have come unnoticed claire whispered who is your target the one that is such an affront to karak valessa asked sebastian downed the rest of the glass licked his lips and set it aside my older brother arthur he lives in his castle quite the recluse but those of his retinue spread word of how the worship of karak in our lands is unlawful our enforcements unfair and the tithes the people pay unjust his castle is small but wellguarded and could withstand a siege for at least a year the castle of caves they call it but you two ladies i know where the castle is claire said now give us your word that when we return darius will be ours to deal with as we desire if no orders have been delivered to me stating otherwise claires smile was rigid as stone of course wait valessa said before they could be excused i wish to see darius first with my own eyes sebastian frowned lady i can assure you that he is in our custody and properly taken care of she shook her head my own eyes sebastian that is my demand and i will not relent the lord glanced at gregane who nodded very well sebastian said standing follow me but you must come alone gregane will have his eye on you at all times no tricks any attempt made on dariuss life will be treated as an attempt on my own both of which you could never stop valessa thought but instead she smiled and followed him past his throne and into the dungeon below it was dark damp and smelled of blood and piss she caught the jailor hiding in the corner as if frightened to be seen in the presence of his lord valessa gave him little thought for her attention was reserved for the man chained to the wall darius she asked approaching the bars careful gregane said his sword drawn he is a dangerous man after all valessa knew that wasnt why he kept his blade at ready but pretended otherwise she tilted her head waiting for her eyes to adjust to the dim light the bound man didnt seem like a paladin of karak he looked pale tired with his eyes sunken into his face he was halfnaked wearing only torn underclothes in the light of day he might have been handsome but down there he looked deserving of only pity but she had no pity for a betrayer my my darius said laughing they sent a gray sister after me am i that great a threat to karak that i must die in secret you revealed your lack of faith before a crowd of thousands valessa said while in full armor no less still bearing the crest of the lion for that alone you should die perhaps i thought killing nevek and lars was the greater crime but what do i know there you have seen him sebastian said clearly impatient may we return to more pleasing environs are you not here to kill me darius asked he laughed again such a shame what happened sister have you lost your courage her hand reached for the dagger at her side but gregane was there holding her wrist i wouldnt do that he said valessa glared debating she was in the dungeon of a castle with a hundred soldiers waiting on call was it really worth dying over a pathetic failed paladin forgive me she said pulling her arm free of his grasp i have little patience when in the presence of heretics heretic for the first time darius spoke in anger heretic what heresy have i committed what blasphemy have i spoken against karak i worship him still with all my heart consider me lost gray sister and consider me a failure but do not dare presume to understand the nature of my faith valessa didnt know what to say so she stated the most obvious argument against him then why does karak not bless you why does he deny fire to your blade she stepped closer and gregane followed the light of his torch bathed over darius and for the first time she saw his blackened hand and gasped you bear the mark she said her voice nearly a whisper i know the black hand that is not given lightly save your lies nothing you say can disprove the truth of karak burned into your flesh darius fell silent and she waited for an answer he offered none turning she glared at sebastian you play dangerous games she said daring to interfere with the will of karak ill do as you ask this one time only because even in mordeina we hear of your reputation as a faithful servant but do not test me and do not dare betray me is that a threat gregane asked but sebastian only smiled of course milady he said now let us return to the light when they reentered the throne room a knight stood beside claire looking angry and impatient lord hemman if i could have a word he said but sebastian cut him off show respect sir mark i have guests not yet dismissed speak out of turn again and i will have your tongue the knight looked flustered but obeyed would you like to stay here for the night sebastian asked as valessa joined claires side we should begin our ride claire said the castle of caves will take us time to reach even on horseback until we meet again neither bowed as they left is darius there and alive claire asked as they exited the outer gate he is did you speak with him i did he bears the mark of the abandoned claire it covers his entire hand never have i seen one so hated by karak claire nodded then it will be good to get this business done and execute such a faithless traitor valessa frowned at the word faithless so strange she heard the desperate faith in dariuss voice no one was as skilled a liar as that to put on such a performance she didnt want to imagine the turmoil that must be within his soul the sooner the better valessa agreed wishing to think no more on the matter t he women are dangerous gregane said when the gray sisters were gone perhaps it would have been better to hand over the paladin now even the faithful are willing to make deals to reach their ends sebastian said waving dismissively i captured darius not them and i will consider this my reward arthurs been a thorn in my side long enough he glanced over to where sir mark waited hands behind his back and his head bowed what is it he asked annoyed the people of stonahm the knight began theyve rebelled against your rule sebastian poured himself a cup of wine and sipped it he felt his veins turn to ice as the words sank in how so he asked at last id come for tithes but instead of handing them over one of their men assaulted me when my back was turned i was beaten and sent away with orders never to return you were there for tithes and just tithes i assume of course milord sebastian hurled the glass which shattered against the knights breastplate the wine splashed across the armor staining it purple do not treat me like an idiot mark you mistook tits for tithes again didnt you get out of my sight sir mark flushed and still dripping turned and exited the room sebastian sat back in his chair and snapped his fingers a servant lurking behind a curtain heard and he quickly came with another glass what must be done gregane asked i have arthur harassing me from his castle kaide from the forest one i cant get to and the other i cant find this will not go on if the peasants think for even a moment they can get away with challenging my authority a fullblown revolt will not be far behind give me a hundred men gregane said i will teach them a lesson the whole north will talk about sebastian accepted the cup from the servant and filled it with more wine to stonahm he said before downing it go put fear into the heart of the north jerico had wondered how hed find his way back to kaides hideout but his worries were unfounded reaching the forest was easy enough the path simple and often traveled at the edge of the trees he set up camp and slept making sure his fire burned long and with plenty of smoke when he awoke the next morning his horse was gone huh he grunted realizing the absence he hadnt been alerted by ashhur to any danger so he assumed it was members of kaides band his supplies lay beside him and he prepared his morning meal while the few remaining birds sang in the bare treetops after awhile he sensed eyes watching him and he grinned youve taken my horse he called out the least you could have done was take me with him a pause and then the bandit stepped out from hiding he was hardly the thief he expected ricky jerico asked the boy nodded he stood erect as if willing himself to appear taller more mature i had to make sure you was you he said well i am i jerico said care to lead me back to camp ricky gestured and jerico slung his pack across a shoulder and followed no one thought you was coming back ricky said but they left me here just in case you did theyre all killing soldiers so no one could stay and watch killing soldiers jerico asked ducking underneath a low branch they followed no path just pushed through the brush and leaves deeper and deeper into the woods dont think you can get me to talk he said im smarter than that of course i certainly dont mean to offend jerico gave him a moment to cool off then continued beths fine by the way i dont know if anyone told you kaide told me ricky shot a glance behind him and for a moment he looked like the young indecisive kid he was thank you he said did it for her not you but youre welcome anyway the camp was silent as they entered empty as ricky had said where are they jerico asked if theyre fighting perhaps i can help ricky grew flustered too far to walk and you couldnt even if you wanted to the door to one of the cabins opened and it turned out the camp wasnt completely empty our hero returns sandra said and she laughed at jericos overexaggerated bow i could never stay away from you for long he said shooting her a wink ricky rolled his eyes then yawned long and loud jerico remembered the boy had stolen his horse during the night as well as how far the walk had been from there to the forests edge have you been up all night he asked kaide says sometimes men have to go days without sleep and sometimes men go days without food or water but it doesnt help them none go to sleep ricky i didnt come all this way just to run off again besides sandras here shell stab me if i try anything ricky relented casting one last watchful eye on the two of them before vanishing into his cabin im not sure i feel safe around you alone sandra said jerico opened the door to his own little hut and tossed his supplies inside dont worry too much with this limp i doubt i could catch a crone catch me i wouldnt run paladin id knock you flat and crush your testicles for the attempt and you dont want to imagine what kaide would do afterward would he make me tonights supper sandra laughed but the laugh died when he limped toward the stable your leg she said does it hurt much jerico shrugged its bearable he said ill pray over it soon like i should have this morning much of the pain is just weakened muscle and lingering effects of a curse at the stables he found his horse tied and fed and the saddle properly removed patting the horses side he took a breath and steadied himself his knee throbbed the rough travel through the forest feeling like itd removed every bit of progress hed made the past few days he put on a tough show though and tried to minimize the limp as he walked back to the center of the hideout he made it halfway there before he leaned against a home and groaned tilting his head back with his eyes closed let me see the leg sandra said her playful tone gone sighing jerico rolled up his pant leg and even he winced at the sight a purple bruise covered the entire knee the bones were healed though the surface of his kneecap was oddly shaped as if it hadnt smoothed out upon rejoining the surrounding skin was swollen red and when she pressed her fingers against it he let out a gasp damn fool sandra said you walked all the way through the forest on that it felt better at the time get to your bed or beside the fire if youd like i need to start it soon anyway when kaide and his men return theyll be eager for a feast to celebrate their victory and if they lose jerico asked as he accepted her help leaning half his weight upon her then theyll need food and drink to toast the memory of the fallen either way well need meat the two hobbled to his cabin and she laid him down on the bed the relief was immediate join me when you wish sandra said shutting the door behind her as she left finally alone jerico spent time in prayer pouring healing magic into his knee he knew he should have stayed in stonahm he was traveling on a leg mere days after an injury most would take months to recover from but the way the people of the village had looked at him as if he had been in the wrong protecting that woman he didnt want to feel those eyes upon him anymore as he prayed the pain subsided and the swelling lessened he sighed with relief didnt look like hed added any permanent damage when finished he ate the last rations from his pack then stepped outside the air had a bite to it and the burgeoning fire sandra built called out to him grabbing a blanket off the bed he laid it down beside the bonfire ill keep quiet so i dont wake you sandra said as she tossed on another log much appreciated the crackling of the fire soothed him and he was halfway asleep when he heard sandra say his name jerico thank you for saving my niece welcome he said eyes still closed he felt her lingering nearby though so he opened an eyelid and looked over she was staring at his leg still exposed since he had not rolled down the pant leg after his prayers the man kren why did he attack you jerico let his head drop back to the dirt kaide told you about that i take it guess theres no reason to hide it he attacked me because i might be all thats left karaks paladins have begun a secret war one i fear weve already lost my brothers my home his voice trailed off and he listened to the fire burn dont you hate them for it sandra asked i shouldnt ashhur forgive me i often do but i shouldnt i cant hate sandra itll destroy everything i am maybe that makes me a fool maybe thats why the world will soon move on without me but i wont hate them pity yes remorse sadness ill even kill if i must and bloody my hands to protect the life of another but i wont hate it took her a long while before sandra could respond after everything thats happened i fear my brother knows only hatred then ill pray for him if youd like please do her footsteps trailed off as she left the fire unattended jerico prayed for them both as hed promised and then did his best to forget it all so he might sleep the sound of arguing woke him sometime later jerico sat up his hand reaching for the weapon he no longer had shaking dirt and leaves from his hair he glanced at the sky to gauge the time late afternoon his knee felt stiff but the pain had lessened standing with his weight on the other leg he waited for the men to arrive sandra joined him not long after carrying a slab of salted meat theyre angry she said her voice low do you think assume nothing jerico said helping her set up the spit only hope for the best and pray against the worst despite his words jerico also thought a rough defeat had befallen them but it seemed that was not the case when the first of many men appeared they lacked a single wound upon their bodies it doesnt matter that i couldnt have killed them all bellok grumbled as he and kaide walked toward the bonfire packed together and unaware i would i have wiped out half of sebastians men before they even knew jerico kaide said seeing the paladin he approached with his back to bellok who clearly did not appreciate the interruption the rest of the men were joining them all grumbling amongst themselves most ignored him though a few the irons twins in particular did their best to greet him warmly i took too long building the fire sandra said im sorry ive just begun and what youve got wont be enough kaide said adam go grab us something more to eat i think all of us could use a bit of blood in our bellies be better if we had blood on our blades instead adam muttered as he headed off to one of the buildings such dour moods jerico said what is so terrible we had our ambush prepared bellok said sitting on a heavy log beside jerico we expected only a handful of knights but instead a good forty marched toward us with my magic alone i could have you could have cooked one inside his armor maybe two kaide said drawing his dirk and stabbing it into the log he sat on we were outnumbered and they were armed and mounted wed have been slaughtered we had surprise one of the men muttered they cant stand toe to toe with us griff hollered and the rest of the men echoed approval is that what you want kaide asked to have charged out of the forest and died just to kill a few random knights which of you in your plain clothes and leather boots would have withstood a single blow from their swords which of you has the strength to crack a chestplate of iron with only a wooden club the men fell silent until adam reappeared holding a slab of meat i coulda he said kaide looked up at him and for the first time since returning he smiled i dont doubt that adam all of you i dont doubt you but i dont want to lose you no matter what the advantage wasnt ours one day it will be and well break their necks and send their horses running to the four corners of dezrel bet if jerico was with us jerico didnt catch who said it but kaide did you got something to say barry of the many men gathered the shortest of the lot stepped forward a thin man with a long beard when he spoke jerico recognized him as the amusingly cranky jailor from before yeah i do i bet if jerico was with us youd have given the order you wish we all was him dont you wish we had training fancy armor and weapons that cost more than everything we ever owned put together its been three years kaide whens the time gonna be right when we ever gonna make them pay for what they did to us at ashvale the crowd fell silent and the chill in the air was colder than itd been all night paying no heed to the fire jerico glanced between them wondering if hed need to intervene his place or not he wouldnt watch one of them murder the other of course i wish i had knights kaide said his voice deathly quiet of course i wish for weapons armor and horses i wish lord hemman was dead and i could piss on his corpse while the whole world watched but that dont matter none id trade every single one of those wishes to have lisbeth in my arms one more night you got a problem with how i lead then you go right ahead and leave in the following silence sandras soft voice carried the power of a thunderclap none of you are here because of my brother youre here because of sebastian because of what he did i havent forgotten have you barry have you forgotten the smiling face of your little mary barry stepped back as if ashamed im sorry kaide you too sandra i do miss my girl but i got boys and a wife at stonahm they been waiting three years for me to come home what we done all this time weve hurt sebastian cost him some coin but were no closer to taking back our home were no closer to victory this aint a war we can win its not even a war were a fly buzzinground the ears of a horse just biting barry left for his room jerico watched him go while the rest of the men looked the other away kaide muttered a curse under his breath conversation took awhile to restart but when it did it was on a hundred other things than the failed ambush that night the smell of cooking meat wafted over them and jerico felt his own stomach growl what is it youre cooking jerico asked adam who was turning the spit leftover knight adam said grinning enough kaide said im tired of that damn joke it was never funny the bandit leader stood and left when it seemed no one would follow jerico looked to sandra go she said i know him hell want to talk but only to someone he trusts will listen jerico stood and limped after i prefer to be alone with my thoughts kaide said as jerico approached he leaned against a heavy pine outside the ring of their homes his back to the fire we paladins are known for being intrusive that you are no humor in his voice just barbs jerico shrugged it off you wanted my help once you still do kaide glanced at him with redveined eyes do i of course but you heard the men what does it matter were just flies jerico crossed his arms and leaned against another pine relieved to remove some weight from his knee he watched kaide for a while saying nothing he always considered himself a good judge of character many times hed encountered outlaws and they had a vibe about them that kaide lacked none of the rest seemed quite right with it either this wasnt a ploy for coin this wasnt a man taking something because he could or because he thumbed his nose at authority something more was at stake ashvale what had happened at ashvale i want to help you jerico said but i have to believe im doing the right thing tell me why you do this tell me the reason you fight who were you before this started who was i kaide laughed and he looked to the darkening sky i was kaide goldflint son and heir to a fortune a fortune stolen away from me by lord sebastian hemman will that suffice jerico shook his head no it wont what happened there three years ago barry said help me understand kaide rubbed his eyes with his fingers sebastian controlled much of the north but hed never laid claim to the rough lands nestled against the elethan mountains a few of us my father in particular spent years scouting the land setting up exploratory mines searching for veins when we found them we kept it secret and acted fast my father set up a guild uniting several towns together sebastian was furious but our lands were our own and our mining guild spent enough bribes in mordeina to keep the king from siding against us we endured heavy taxes taxes you couldnt imagine but we still had our land our homes and our wealth three years ago that ended that coward didnt even send in his knights for he feared king baedans punishment so instead he rounded up thousands of homeless and poor in mordeina and gave them deeds to our land he convinced them they were legit told them of our wealth and sent them on their way you cant imagine the bloodshed that followed we tried to make peace with the first few giving them jobs or minor parcels of land but they kept coming theyd spent all they had believing sebastians lie left with nothing they would rather die kaide sighed and die they did still it wasnt enough so come winter sebastian finally sent in his knights they didnt kill a soul only came for more taxes every bit of food they took they slaughtered our animals they burned our storehouses the winter was harsh and he came after the first snow by the time we could get a messenger to mordeina the king had already been convinced by sebastian that bandits were running amok because our lands were lawless ungoverned we received no aid and without food and no game to hunt jerico put a hand on kaides shoulder as the man closed his eyes and looked away to hide his tears we starved my mother and father they were too old i lost a brother my wife every one of these men here they lost children family or friends and what we had to do to survive am i cursed man jerico am i doomed in death for what i did to survive to keep my sister and little girl fed the stories jerico said his voice almost a whisper kaide the cannibal the bandit leader said laughing darkly come spring we were too weak to fight back more crowds filled the roads north carrying deeds and this time sebastian came with the kings authority to enforce them every last man woman and child of ashvale was sent south to make a living elsewhere you founded stonahm jerico said piecing it together i dont want sebastian to know where we live kaide said nodding i dont want him to strike those we love thats why theyre so far away we have all said goodbye to our wives and families seeing them only when it is safe this we endure to make sebastian pay it may seem we have no chance but i have one last secret one i cannot tell even you not yet some of the men dont even know but if we can stir up enough anger kill enough knights i know we can retake our home jerico closed his eyes and thought over the words with ashhurs gift he could sense anytime a man lied and hed not once felt that betrayal every word was truth theyd been systematically assaulted starved and removed from their lawful home if there was ever a rightful cause it was kaides what do you mean retake your home jerico asked suddenly realizing the true meaning of the words those people currently in ashvale are thieves and robbers kaide insisted ive watched the roads and weve intercepted every shipment of food possible same for the gold they send south to lord sebastian one day well have enough strength enough people to march north and take our lands back jerico shook his head ill help you train your men and lead them into battle but only against sebastians knights i wont help you murder the people who took your homes they thought they were the lawful owners kaide the law told them they were right and both lords and kings agreed youd have me forgive them id have you let it go youre an honorable man youve already sworn your life to vengeance must you yearn to repeat the bloodshed done against you kaide shook his head you cant understand you werent there watching helplessly as your loved ones withered and starved you dont fall asleep to red dreams filled with such hatred even karak would be put to shame but ill accept your help and gratefully tomorrow morning begin the training i have a few weapons we stole from the knights but truth be told i havent given most out yet for fear no one knows how to use them with you i can make sure they dont put the pointy end in themselves were in the right on this jerico outlaw or not sebastian needs to suffer outlaw jerico said and he chuckled is there such a thing as an outlaw paladin sounds like a contradiction hardly kaide said smacking him across the shoulder i have a feeling every true paladin is already an outlaw in this world kaide led him back to the fire where the rest of the men were busy eating starting tomorrow hell be your trainer he shouted to them and come our next ambush hell be right there with us standing against our foes does this mean i get my armor and mace back jerico asked as the men cheered halfheartedly kaide laughed his good humor finally returning all yours you wont regret this jerico not at all jerico prayed he was right in the darkness darius called out for the prophet i am here velixar said stepping out from the shadows and into the light of the single torch beside him the jailor slept and with a touch velixar made sure he stayed that way darius hung his head he couldnt even look at the man in black when he spoke but he saw no other way he had to find out denying velixar without proof without certainty only risked him remaining a fool one chance he said his dry throat cracked his voice ill give you one chance but that is all i will listen and see if karaks truth is with you do you tire of this cell velixar asked approaching the bars do you tire of your chains even swallowing hurt itd been a day since hed had a drink and he felt so tired so thirsty his back throbbed with every beat of his heart his arms felt like torn twisted limbs never to regain their natural shape yes i do velixar smiled if only you could feel the cage about your soul as keenly as you feel those chains be free darius a wave of his hand and the door opened another and his bindings became like shadow his flesh falling right through them dariuss back popped as he twisted left and right gasping in pain as his muscles fired off random spasms despite the pain it felt deliriously good to stand he took an unsteady step toward velixar then another the prophet held out his hand and darius took it there was no warmth to the grip sustenance first velixar said his everchanging face smiling then learning the torch flickered and died and in the dark they walked forward darius felt a momentary sickness and then he was beneath open stars he shivered at the cold they stood on a tall hill and when he glanced back he saw the castle of the yellow rose wait here velixar said i must gather your things the guards took from you another portal of shadow ripped open before him and then he stepped through leaving darius alone is this your will darius whispered as he shivered is this what you want karak my god please show me your way im tired of being lost he looked to his blackened hand and he wondered if the mark would ever be gone several minutes later velixar returned tossing down a chest it must have weighed a ton and it thunked heavily against the grass but the prophet showed no strain at all nearby is a stream he said the cold will not harm you though it will be unpleasant consider it symbolic once youve cleansed yourself come back and put on your armor i would see the man you once were standing before me darius stumbled in the direction velixar pointed and sure enough he found a small stream winding its way south through the hills he caught his reflection cast by moonlight atop the water and the sight gave him pause he looked a dead man sleepdeprived and hungry itd been only a week he knew but even before the castle dungeon hed been eating poorly and sleeping little he cast a pebble across his reflection to scatter it then stepped in the water was cold enough to hurt but he clenched his teeth and fought his shivers hed endured far greater trials in his faith to his god he would not falter now when he finished bathing he ducked his head under completely feeling the chill seep into his bones shocking the exhaustion from his veins when he emerged his entire body shook but he did not care after putting his clothes back on he walked to velixar the prophet smiled and his red eyes seemed to glow brighter he gestured to the open chest put on your armor darius did so one piece at a time showing no hurry the water had left him numb and his shivers lessened with every minute in the light of the moon he felt calm almost peaceful if not for velixars presence he might have felt completely at ease putting on his armor etched with symbols to karak the lion as well as ancient runes proclaiming his might he felt once more the champion hed been only one thing mattered and he knew what it was velixar knew as well and he offered the hilt of dariuss sword karak is not a god of miracles said the prophet you have made but a single step on a very very long road i offer you your blade your means to bring wisdom to this chaotic world if you accept you must swear to heed my words as truth to know that our god speaks through me and me alone do not take this lightly darius think on it if you wish i can return you to your cell and leave you to the fate this world would bring you darius shook his head he would face this future reveal the truth of his god there would be no return to a prison not outward not within my sword is my soul he said stepping forward and taking the handle and it has always belonged to karak exhilaration shot through him as his fingers closed about the leather the dark fire was not much just the faintest shimmer even newly anointed paladins could outmatch but to darius it was a brilliant blaze of the greatest significance it flickered and burned across his blade unable to survive the weakest of winds but it was there and every time the air calmed it returned darius laughed even as tears ran down his face you are beloved in karaks eyes velixar whispered come it is time we take another step down his road he created another portal of shadows and taking dariuss hand led him through to the other side darius knew not what to expect nor did he try to guess for the moment he was trying to abandon all his previous teachings to rely only on what appeared to be truth and what the prophet confirmed he would accept everything with an open mind until velixar failed a single false word or moment of doubt and he would seek karak in his own way at least he thought he might feeling the distant touch of his god deep in his chest and seeing that fledgling fire on his greatsword made him wonder if he was already decided his life already bought and earned his promise to velixar he had not made it lightly where are we darius asked as they stepped out it seemed they had not traveled far for the terrain remained the same just rocky hills with withering grass and the occasional barren tree before him was a heavy cluster of bushes marking the outline of a small grove quiet and listen velixar said he did and the sound of moaning reached his ears taking a step forward he pushed through the bushes within he found a man lying on his back bleeding from gashes across his arms and legs his hands were gone the bone still exposed his eyelids were peeled despite his training despite his experience with bloody combat darius still found himself on the verge of vomiting what grotesquery is this he asked now is not the time for questions velixar said joining him in the ring he gestured to the mutilated man do you not understand that is the nature of your failure you seek answers to things that do not matter look at him say i found him tortured by bandits and brought him here for succor or perhaps he tortured himself bearing a guilty soul and he sought me out to help him with his sickness i might have done this to him myself but you will never know will you yet you ask and ask and do you know what is happening while you do velixar pointed to the man he suffers he bleeds tell me does any of that matter in the face of his torment darius looked into the mans eyes unsure if the man saw him back he looked lost in a daze moaning lightly as he lay there his stubs shook and the sight of exposed bone made darius shiver with unease the pain it had to be excruciating what is it you want from me he asked the prophet to learn to understand this is one of the greatest lessons i can offer you here now realize the many paths before you and then make your choice the man jerked back his head and suddenly his moans turned into bloodcurdling screams what did you do darius asked having drawn his greatsword without realizing it i was numbing his pain velixar said but no longer the choice is before you i will not intervene the sword shook in dariuss hand he saw the fire upon its blade wither and die looking back to the man he knew the lesson velixar wanted him to learn it burned in his gut he wanted to refuse to deny its wisdom but how could he hearing such horrific screams lifting his sword he closed his eyes and prayed for forgiveness from karak down came his blade right through the mutilated mans throat he silenced the screams he ended the pain the blood on his blade burned away in dark fire so close velixar said in the sudden silence but i saw your lips i heard your prayer there is nothing to forgive darius do you not understand the intent darius whispered it is all in the intent your intent was to end pain to stop suffering there is no sin in killing do not even ashhurs paladins kill you must be purer you must embrace karaks ultimate truth darius stared at the corpse and he felt cold fingers like the touch of a ghost tracing the curves of his spine and what is that he asked fearing the answer only in absolute emptiness is there order and we serve a god of order follow me once more we must take another step no guilt thought darius as he tore his eyes away from the corpse no forgiveness seeking the cause was pointless he had to react to the way things were was that not what hed always chided jerico about ashhurs paladins fought for a world that didnt exist he on the other hand bled for the real world but there was no comfort in these words no strengthening of his heart with such understanding instead he felt another part of himself die burn the sick branches with fire darius thought one of karaks few axioms otherwise that which might live will also die just how much of his understanding of the world of karak was nothing but dead branches accepting velixars offered hand he took another step and appeared at the outside of a log cabin to either side of him stretched acres of flat land some recently tilled some left fallow where are we now he asked there is light in the window velixar said gesturing look through and tell me what you see darius did feeling fresh dread clawing at his throat by candlelight he saw a mother and father through the warped glass kneeling beside a bed wrapped underneath covers was their child a young boy with hair even redder than his fathers feeling himself the invader on something private he looked away i see a family in prayer he said the words heavy on his tongue they pray to ashhur velixar said not karak not to any true god every night theyre tucking their child away with lies and delusions do you know what they pray for protection safety a long healthy life for that child do you think ashhur hears do you think he acts we are here and ashhur is not we are truth and he is falsehood another choice before you darius i pray you have learned enough to choose what is right intent darius said again and his sword hand shook and what would your intent be velixar asked no more suffering no more fear salvation from loss heartache betrayal hunger and lies velixars eyes flared with color as if he could not contain his excitement are you strong enough he asked darius looked to the door he thought of the nameless family inside of the wounded man hed killed and the desires of his god in the end he knew what he must do please he prayed to karak everything i am i have sworn to you i will not doubt i will not disobey give me a sign show me the way and i will follow without question he opened his eyes and the dark fire on his blade fully consumed the metal prayer answered choice made he pushed open the door the family screamed the father fought they died and the fire burned all the hotter when darius stepped back out his armor stained with blood he threw down his sword and fell to his knees with a sob velixars hands were on his shoulders his cold cheek pressed against dariuss as his whole body shuddered with tears we are what the world lacks velixar whispered in his ear we are what the world needs banish your guilt you are no longer one of them you are better you are a child in the eyes of karak and have been made anew darius heard the words and with strength born of desperation he clung to them in his mind all the while he pushed away the images the blood as his heart burned he thought of jerico and how the simple act of saving him had thrust him onto this path damn you jerico he thought as velixar set fire to the cabin with a wave of his hand damn you to the abyss are you hungry velixar asked darius thought it impossible but his stomach groaned and he weakly nodded very well pick up your sword and we will find you a meal darius grabbed the hilt of his greatsword deep inside in a part of him that felt very small he hoped it would lack the fire of faith that it would remain plain steel and nothing more when he lifted it into the air it burned strong as ever and that small piece of him burned along with it just a dead branch meeting its proper fate j erico spent the morning teaching the men how to hold a sword it seemed like it should have been the most basic of things but instead he learned how militaristic his childhood had been where weaponry and training had been daily rituals higher jorel he said readjusting the mans grip beside him adam clutched the hilt with both hands his meaty fists dwarfing the metal just one jerico said well look into getting you a bastard sword perhaps but for now just use one feels better using two adam said its too heavy using just one another man pat agreed theyre balanced for one jerico said trying very hard not to roll his eyes if it feels heavy it means you need to strengthen your arm and that wont happen if you keep using two trent what did i say about your feet thinking back jerico decided he had never given his instructors even a pittance of the respect they deserved hed hoped to have the men spar but getting them to grip the weapon tight but not too tight with just one hand and at the right angle from their bodies felt like trying to teach a pack of dogs how to dance on two legs sure they could do it but it wasnt coming natural seriously pat jerico said turning back stop crossing your legs i got to piss pat said looking ashamed jerico opened his mouth then closed it realizing he had no clue how to react he wanted to ask why he hadnt said so why hed waited why he hadnt just wandered off taken care of business and come back instead he gave him a dumb stare then waved a hand hurry up he said praying for the hundredth time for patience when we get to spar griff asked jerico caught him giving adam an evil look and he knew then and there that when the twins sparred both would end up needing stitches for days you get to spar when i know neither of you will kill the other jerico said harsher than he meant hey jer like this another man asked and jerico rushed down the line to doublecheck everyone was shifting about trying to make things perfect the paladin kept seeing a hundred things wrong and it felt like the past half hour had been nothing but fixing error after error after error goddamn piece of shit pat screamed from further into the forest jerico spun grabbing his mace from the corner of his eye he saw the men turning with him several nearly cutting their neighbors or dropping their blade from the sudden surprised reaction he nearly felt like crying not much more than farmers kaide had told him before they started no kidding pat came rushing back to them but instead of being under attack he was running as fast as he could while trying to remove his shirt and pants whats going on jerico asked baffled then the smell hit skunk adam and griff swore in unison damn pat you go and piss on one asked jorel jerico pressed his nose shut with his fingers his eyes watering at the smell as pat neared the rest gave way not wanting to get too close what is going on out here kaide asked stepping out from his cabin he frowned sniffed and then pulled his shirt up to his nose damn it pat a streams southwest of here get in it and dont come out until you see the moon sorry pat said his eyes running his face red the rest of the men were laughing at him and jerico couldnt help but chuckle no matter how bad he felt for pat cant you do something about that kaide asked joining jericos side i can heal broken bones and torn flesh jerico said rubbing his nose but that evil is beyond me they both laughed and were still laughing when they heard the sound of hooves thundering across the ground when they saw the pale look on the riders face their laughter died him the man screamed pointing at jerico he did this jerico looked to kaide and he shrugged not understanding calm down ned kaide said offering his hand to help the man dismount ned did so still glaring at jerico when the paladin neared to listen kaide shot him a look so he stepped back until he was out of earshot enough practice jerico said realizing the rest of the men were still lingering about take a break and put your weapons away carefully as they scattered muttering amongst themselves jerico watched kaides face outwardly he showed little sign but his eyes hardened and his whole body turned rigid at last he hugged the rider then approached jerico who didnt fail to notice the mans hands balled into fists whats going kaide struck him in the mouth then kicked the back of his sore knee jerico went down screaming in pain the bandit leader landed on top of him an elbow crushing his throat you bastard kaide said his voice quiet cold you just couldnt leave things be could you always have to interfere i dont understand jerico said his words cracking you will youre coming with me to stonahm ill let you see what a fucking mess youve made word spread to the rest of the camp but given how limited they were on horses only one other could go with kaide and jerico the short man barry is my family all right he asked ned as they saddled up tell me is she all right the rider refused to say even when barry grabbed him by the shoulders and screamed in his face look me in the eye he cried shaking him why wont you look me in the damn eye itd taken two men to pull him off now he rode behind jerico and kaide head down and refusing to say a word the hours crawled and when they stopped to let their horses rest not a shred of conversation was spoken between the three as they neared stonahm there was no denying the cloud of smoke in the sky nor where it was rising from shes all right ned said upon seeing the smoke i know it shes all right and my boys too kaides glare was cold enough to freeze the skin on jericos neck jerico felt some relief as they finally rode into the village the smoke was only from a few homes not all of them as hed initially feared people milled about looking as if theyd just survived a battle seeing kaides approach they began to gather jess barry screamed wheres jess two boys pushed through the crowd and they leapt into barrys arms as he dismounted jerico remained on his horse feeling lost people were shouting and crying all at once a mixture of anger and heartbreak kaide tried to soothe them but soon gave up wheres beth he asked repeatedly i said wheres beth with the others said a farmer kalgans looking over them come on kaide said jerico dismounted and followed leading his horse behind him the wounded had been too many to fit into a single hut so they lay spread out on blankets in the open air jerico feared to count how many kalgan walked among them his clothes and hands coated with blood when he saw their approach he looked at them with dull expressionless eyes in the corner barry wept over the still body of his wife while his two boys clutched him tightly kaide kalgan said shaking his head i dont know what to say he pointed to where beth sat on the blankets staring into nowhere kaide called her name and when she saw him she burst into tears jerico stood feeling the intruder as the father ran to his daughter do you remember what i said kalgan asked trying futilely to wipe his hands on his robe do you remember i do jerico said feeling a knot swell in his throat good i hope you remember until the day you die kalgan went on his way jerico looked about he saw at least seven dead and thrice that wounded on every street at least one building had been burned and in the distance he saw the torched remains of an entire field of crops the lump in his throat swelled and he had to struggle to keep his hands from shaking after a horrific wait kaide finally kissed his daughters head and returned you attacked one of sebastians knights kaide said his glare full of fire you struck him beat him down and then sent him on his way you damn fool this is what youve done he was going to rape i dont care kaide shouted one woman one rape do you know what they did here a hundred knights came with swords and armor burned their food took every woman they pleased and killed whoever resisted one woman you fucking paladin all that to stop the rape of one woman a hundred women can now blame you a hundred women he choked up and jerico looked to beth with newborn dread even her he asked there were tears in kaides eyes when he looked back even her they stayed in the homes of people that would take them for jerico that meant he had none so he slept in the hut that had been his during his injury he lay inside feeling drained beyond belief hed knelt and prayed with any who would accept it but even those with severe injuries seemed hesitant normally he would have felt anger but instead he felt only sadness shouting to them how hed been in the right felt hollow and selfish no matter his healing touch he could not bring back the dead nor remove the painful memories theyd endured i wasnt wrong jerico murmured trying to sleep night had finally come and no one had been happier to see the rise of the moon than him free of his armor he tried to relax and force his mind from the hundred horror stories hed had confessed to him he tried to forget barrys wail forget that single look of betrayal beth had given him when shed turned his way unable to help it jerico felt tears slide down his face the door to his hut opened for some reason jerico knew who would be there close the door he said i would hate for anyone to see you like this barry stood at the entrance in one hand he held a bottle in the other a knife i aint afraid of what theyll say the man said his speech slurred from the alcohol you think i care he stepped further in and the door shut behind him jerico sat up glancing toward his mace and shield if he acted quick he could still retrieve them but he didnt what are you here for barry he asked you he said he sniffed and his red eyes were heavy with tears my jess they say she ran the others the ones that didnt fight it but no jess ran stupid woman she ran and now wholl raise my boys me he laughed the bottle swinging loosely in his hand im no good never been was lucky enough to get jess whyd you do it jerico dont you ever think every damn peasant boy knows you leave a lords knights well enough alone boys but you you he waved the knife and he took an uncertain step toward him jerico remained still refusing to look away from that pained gaze are you here to kill me barry barry laughed maybe maybe not dont think even the gods know what im gonna do but i know what i want to do i want to jam this knife so far down your throat you choke on my elbow you were supposed to help us jerico you were supposed to help us jerico stood slowly to make sure barry knew he posed no threat from the corner of his eye he watched the unsteady knife so far it wasnt poised to stab not yet but close tell me what you want he said tell me so i may grant it barry pointed the knife at him i want you to know you was wrong i want to hear it from you i want a goddamn apology dont you get it this is all your fault and i wont let you say otherwise i wont let you jerico took a deep breath he would not lie not now not ever he doubted anything he could say would comfort him so he spoke the truth and prayed it would be enough im not sorry he said not for saving that woman not for doing what we both know was right the only thing im sorry for is that i wasnt here to protect everyone that i couldnt have died with my shield on my arm and my mace in my hand standing against those knights be they a hundred or a hundred thousand im just one man barry one man foolish weak exhausted and alone take my life if you want it i wont stop you barry flung his bottle to the ground where it shattered you think you can talk yourself outta this you think i wont do it i will i fucking will you wont kaide stepped inside his dirk drawn he glanced at the broken bottle then at jerico go back to your boys barry kaide said id hate for you to do something youll regret for the rest of your life barry wavered and he looked like a mouse caught between two cats the knife shook in his unsteady hand he aint worth it he said putting away the knife his shoulder bumped into kaides as he walked out of the hut i thought he was but he aint kaide watched him go then shut the door behind him thank you jerico said forget it hes right you know you dont tease a boar then turn your back to it you let this entire village suffer and for what so you could play the hero feel better about yourself what you stopped happens every day in every single village across dezrel its shit its wrong but sos a hundred other things we close our eyes clench our teeth and endure until we have the strength to fight back you ask the impossible kaide if i see an innocent suffering harm ill stop it i wont keep my hands still because i fear the reactions of an evil world kaide rolled his eyes such prepared proud words that dont mean shit were not you what do you think would have happened if this village had fought back i have no delusions said jerico ill die one day probably soon and itll be defending someone without the strength to defend themselves just because i die doesnt mean it was wrong to do so if your private war against sebastian never succeeds does that mean you were wrong to fight him we must fight and fight so that this dark world knows hope one day maybe it will even know victory i pray to ashhur it does kaide crossed his arms and looked away his voice softened this is as much my fault as yours either way if not for my rebellion sebastian might have ignored this or only sent a few to find out who had struck at the knight jerico put a hand on kaides shoulder blame the evil on those who committed it he said not yourself not others sebastian sent the knights and the knights themselves burned looted and raped if you must feel wrath then direct it at them kaide looked at him with an expression akin to wonder do you really feel no regret no remorse are you not even human jerico chuckled even though he felt ready to collapse from his exhaustion i do more keenly than you could know i could have protected her kaide beth wanted to come with me but i refused i told her to remain here when the knights came when they she could have been safe i was angry bitter i should have said yes i should have the way she looked at me she knows it too im sorry kaide i should have stayed i could have given myself up and spared the rest of the village and not fought ill die to protect others if that is what it would have taken then yes the bandit leader walked to the door and he rested his weight against it as he thought you confuse me paladin but at least i know i can trust you this is the last straw sebastians gone too far stories of this will spread throughout the north and we must fan the flames of rebellion while we still can tomorrow morning we ride i have one ally and he must be spurred into action the time for secrecy and stealth is over and who is this ally jerico asked kaide glanced at him a tired grin on his face arthur hemman sebastians disgraced brother barry remained behind to oversee the rebuilding efforts as well as bring in more men from the forest hideout food would be scarce but kaide had kept a small amount of gold from being distributed and he told barry to use all of it to prevent them from starving no loved one of mine goes hungry he had said before they rode northwest not now not ever again they packed light kaide insisting they could fill their packs on the trip there ive given nearly every village at least one satchel of gold he said as they rode if theres a man more beloved in the north than i id like to meet him nothing says loyalty like stolen coin jerico said kaide glared but let the matter drop he was right about the supplies jerico soon found out they stopped at three different villages and the men and women warmed immediately to their presence when they heard kaides name after the third they avoided the towns for their packs overflowed with waterskins and salted meats and kaide wanted no more risk of sebastian hearing of his ride where is it we go jerico asked near the end of the first day as they stopped at a spring for their horses to rest and drink they call it the castle of caves kaide said though its more a prison than anything arthurs been holed up there for years wary of guests and allowing in only those he approves always living in fear of his brothers assassins though ive heard only rumors of any actual attempts arthurs never done anything outward to give sebastian justification for open battle between them you said arthurs disgraced how so kaide stroked the neck of his horse who was still breathing heavily from the ride not sure hes the older brother and should have inherited the northlands instead of sebastian something ill happened between arthur and his father right before he died i dont know what and theres plenty of rumors saying sebastians actually to blame the wealth and power passed over him arthur could have fought for it but instead he retreated to his castle it wasnt until i came to him revealing sebastians dishonorable actions in ashvale that he agreed to help me in any way will he do so now kaide chuckled he wouldnt even give us steel weapons for fear they could point back to him hes a careful man but i feel theres honor in him im hoping you can instill a bit of fire into his heart since you paladins seem talented at that i dont want secrecy any longer i want a war youre certain he should have been the rightful lord without a doubt kaide said jerico nodded good enough for me let us hear what he has to say they continued northwest toward the great ocean that formed the western edge of all of dezrel the ride was long two weeks of hills broken by intermittent forests at least the road was wellcared for and remained so by the many people they encountered on their way plenty of trade in the north kaide had said at one point after theyd sneaked off the path to remain unseen by a large caravan guarded by sebastians men our towns practically survive off it makes the winters particularly harsh durham was the same said jerico but we at least had the river no rivers here kaide said his knife hand twitching at the sight of the loaded wagon just blood and gold twice more they had to shy off the path as they approached the castle of caves through no fault of sebastians men either dark paladins or priests rode with the standard of karak upon their horses jerico kept off the road watching them pass i never heard reason for our hiding kaide asked one night as they camped all forces of karak hunt for my kind jerico said the words foul on his tongue i fear im the last the citadel has fallen and with it went the vast bulk of my order whoever is left is like me alone and in hiding youre terrible at hiding then im at the side of bandits who would look for a paladin there kaide laughed now i wonder how much of a reward could i get for turning you over im a good barterer maybe i could fund an entire mercenary army with what theyd pay especially if youre the last jerico threw his bread at him youre not amusing kaide shot him a wink if you say so at a fork in the road they traveled west instead of north the path immediately grew wilder much of it covered with a thin layer of dying grass the land which had evened out for a few miles once more rose into many clusters of hills atop the tallest loomed a castle built of gray stone that it jerico asked pointing thats it before they could reach the gate a patrol rode out to meet them four men on horseback they appeared on edge but kept their swords sheathed as they formed a circle about them their crimson armor bore the standard of the hemman family except the rose was violet instead of yellow what brings you to the caves asked their leader ive come for a stay in your dungeons kaide said all smiles tell your lord the man from ashvale comes and has brought a guest the gruff man seemed unimpressed keep your weapons at your sides he said if you want to see our dungeons them come with me instead of leading them to the main gate they veered off the path at a hurried pace jerico wondered what was going on but then the horsemen pulled up my thanks for the escort kaide said kneeling down in the grass take care of our horses will you his hands searched and then he lifted up a trap door hidden underneath a layer of dirt jerico looked around realizing the men had them surrounded and hidden with the bodies of their horses tight fit with your armor kaide said sitting down and then sliding in feet first i trust youll manage and then he vanished into the tunnel tightening the straps that held the shield against his back jerico took a deep breath and then followed the tunnel was steeper than he expected and he more fell than crawled into it when his feet touched solid ground the trapdoor closed above them in the darkness they heard thuds as the men covered up the entrance no torches kaide said not for a while just take careful steps and keep your hand against the wall instead jerico pulled his shield free and held it before him the bluewhite light bathed them both easily illuminating the tunnel hrm kaide said raising an eyebrow that works too lead on jerico said id hate to keep our gracious host waiting keep the sarcasm to a limit kaide said as he walked ahead his left hand still touching the wall as if he feared the light of jericos shield could fade at any time the whole while the floor slanted sharply downward arthurs not much for joking of any kind terribly serious man but not much to do about that now hes always had me come through this tunnel ever since i began my raids on sebastians men like i said before hes a careful one is this cave natural jerico asked inspecting the walls closer this one probably not theres at least twenty tunnels i know of im sure the early ones were but even those have been worked and extended in the span of minutes the entire castle could vanish underground and i pity the poor sods stuck trying to chase after them around a curve the tunnel expanded immensely they entered what seemed like a great hall of an underworld king stalactites some at least twenty feet in length stretched from the ceiling like teeth in the jaws of an ancient beast in the light of his shield the rocks sparkled showing a hundred different crystals jerico had never before seen on either side of their path the stone ended abruptly and jericos light could not pierce the darkness below the stone bridge had a single rope running across its center both ends firmly nailed and kaide grabbed it to steady himself step carefully kaide said and he laughed at jericos blank stare what you arent afraid of a little fall are you jerico glanced into the chasm and a shiver ran through him not before today he said put your shield away if youll feel better just use the rope to guide you id rather see the bandit shrugged if i was to fall to my death id prefer not to see the ground coming up to you though the paladin ground his teeth youre not helping kaide walked along the stone bridge across the chasm eventually vanishing beyond the reach of the shields light praying to ashhur for the steadiest footing known to man jerico began crossing the bridge was several feet wide and it felt sturdy enough when he stepped but the stone itself was wet for water dripped from ceiling as if it were a lazy rain the thought of a single slip a lost grip on a rope all leading to a very very long fall you still alive kaide called out his voice echoing yes jerico said unable to muster a worthy retort to such a stupid question halfway across he felt something smack against his shoulder he immediately froze and had to choke down his cry so kaide would not hear it was a rope just a rope though what it hung from he had no clue deciding that just for once they could have used the front gate he continued when reaching the other side jerico hurried the last few steps beyond relieved to be inside another much smaller tunnel kaide clapped him on the back then pointed back toward the bridge feel that rope he asked when i first came here i was told that if you pulled it and held itd collapse enough stones from the ceiling to crush the bridge into a thousand pieces like i said i pity the fools trying to give chase through here jerico pushed further ahead into the tunnel wanting nothing more to do with the chasms he hoped kaide didnt notice the slight shaking of his shield as he held it aloft for light how much farther he asked not far sure enough the cave angled upward then ended with an iron door there was no handle of any kind and when jerico pressed against it it lacked the slightest give locked and barred from the inside kaide explained just in case someone gets too clever bang on it a few times the jailor will hear jailor kaide looked at him as if he were dimwitted i said we were visiting the dungeons didnt i jerico struck the door with his fist hurting his ears with the loud clang of his platemail striking metal after a wait and an impatient gesture from kaide jerico did so a second time a tiny slit in the door opened up letting in a beam of light that fell upon jericos breastplate the man from ashvale kaide said stepping in front of the paladin and a friend you know the password i know you oneeye and you know me now open the damn door was that the password jerico asked as the slit shut and they heard a heavy thud as the bolt on the other side was removed nah i just like messing with oneeye one time he kept me waiting for an hour while he tried to convince arthur that the king of mordan was down here whyd he think that because thats who i told him i was the small circular door opened flooding the tunnel with light kaide exited first then offered jerico a hand as the jailor dropped the door shut behind him jerico took in his surroundings sure enough they were in a dungeon albeit a small one he saw only two cells and both were empty the walls were packed dirt instead of stone the jailor himself was an ugly man with true to his name only one eye the other was missing and without an eye patch the vacant slot made his face all the more grotesque is milord expecting you oneeye asked i dont know should we go ask him if he is oneeye scratched his head guess thats all right you go find out if he is id hate to bug him if he aint thats a good man kaide said smacking oneeyes shoulder with an open palm stay sharp i heard something big following us in the tunnel i think its a dagadoo you seen it too oneeye clutched his club tightly with both hands i heard it you can too if you listen quietly enough come on jerico kaide led him toward the stairs out of the dungeon dagadoo jerico asked kaide shrugged hes been hunting it for a year now oneeyes a halforc you know jerico glanced back at the big lug who crouched atop the closed tunnel door with his ear pressed against the metal does that explain the you know that and more two guards stood at the top of the stairs each holding a spear they appeared to have been waiting for them and without a word one gestured for them to follow they walked through the castle which appeared plain and open compared to the earthen beauty of the caverns at last they reached the lords hall which was just the throne two benches and many many guards kaide the lord of the caves said upon their arrival standing to greet the man arthur kaide said bowing low jerico did likewise arthur was a tall man with a heavy beard when he stood it was with the perfectly straight posture of a man who had spent years among fighting men his green eyes were youthful though his beard betrayed a hint of gray i see you have brought a guest arthur said his deep voice booming in the enclosed room greetings paladin of ashhur i ask the privilege of your name jerico of the citadel your grace the citadel ive been hearing rumors of its collapse is there any truth to the matter or are the peasantfolk spreading lies no lies jerico said quietly arthurs face softened accept my condolences no man should lose his home perhaps some other time you may tell me the story of how it happened if you even know it if you wish milord forgive me for the intrusion kaide said but matters have pressed me beyond courtesy sebastian has gone too far arthur his knights descended upon stonahm killed many burned our crops and raped our wives and daughters twice now he has brought ruin to my home and i will stand for it no longer arthur sat down on his throne plain wood stained a dark brown his hand stroked a crease in the wood a habit of thought i have never denied my brothers occasional brutality he said sounding distracted but this is beyond that this was unprovoked nothing but a vicious display to enforce his rule stories of it should be reaching your hall very soon if they have not already ive sown with gold and coin a hundred seeds of rebellion and now is the time for them to sprout the people are ready to rise against him they just need a name a leader to call them to action and i wonder why is that not you arthur asked leaning back in his chair the common folk love you they tell stories of such generosity that show either they are mad to believe them or you are mad to have done them you would have me depose my brother and then what set you up as a lord of some sort hand the realm over to you so i may return to my caves or will those same people yearning for rebellion find the stories changed so that i am now the villain i seek vengeance against sebastian kaide said struggling to remain calm that is all i desire you know this aye i do and i know that vengeance is blinding and once it is met a hole remains what will you see when your sight returns ill see my daughter kaide said softly the one sebastians men ravaged only two weeks prior my men will lay down their arms and we will return to our homes ill fill that hole you speak of with the love of my beth the only child i have left of my precious wife my wife whom your brother killed do not doubt my loyalty my aims or my honor it is you who should have ruled the north you who could have prevented all of this i ask that you do so now arthur pressed his knuckles against his lips as he thought his eyes flickered between the two of them jerico felt the air about him thicken and the guards seemed nervous no doubt kaide speaking of arthurs denied inheritance was a grievous breach of protocol sebastian has thrice my number of soldiers he said at last he has all the coin all the wealth and all the land can your simple villagers make up for that can they wield weapons on a battlefield pay for our food and lay siege to the castle of the yellow rose the slightest smile curled at kaides lips just because we might not win doesnt mean we are wrong to fight claim your inheritance arthur jericos mouth dropped a little he couldnt decide if kaide had learned from what hed said or simply felt like using it because it furthered his cause the paladin almost felt betrayed though he knew it silly to think so the words had their effect on arthur though far more than they had on kaide the lord sat up straighter in his chair and he motioned for his guards i will need time to think on this he said for you have given me much to think on until then you will stay as guests in my castle and have what little comforts i can afford sir cyan please take them away with me said a darkhaired man stepping from behind the lords throne ill escort you to your rooms their accommodation was simple but acceptable with the two to share a room they flipped a coin to see who got the bed kaide winning jerico eyed the coin suspecting trickery but kaide refused to say either way denying the paladin the chance to know if he spoke truth or lie do you think arthur will join us jerico asked as he spread sheets across the cold floor and began taking off his armor hes easily manipulated so long as you can tug at his sense of honor your earlier words did that pretty well i think nice to know i was needed kaide chuckled consider yourself emotional support that and having a paladin at my side does wonders to elevate my own status in the eyes of arthur trust me on that it makes it harder for him to see me as just a rugged lawless bandit even if that is what you are youre free to leave at any time jerico fluffed his pillow then lay down on the floor to test its comfort it was far from comfortable one day the paladin muttered as kaide took out the coin and rolled it across his knuckles mischief glinting in his eyes one day ill take you up on that why have we come here darius asked as high above the stars twinkled and you complain of my questions velixar said walking beside him surely you can think of why we return before them stretched the town of durham dariuss place of teaching for over a year it was there he had tended his flock and there hed first met jerico a hundred memories flooded him as the two walked through the quiet streets time had erased the bloodstains but not the vicious claw marks across the many buildings wolfmen had torn through the village and darius had stood against them side by side with jerico theyd been heroes he knew and his name was retold in stories all throughout the north he thought of that night and of the pure calm hed felt at jericos side thered been such a wonderful simplicity to it all the wolves had been his enemy jerico his friend and together they fought until death but what would velixar have called for and what did he want now is it because of jerico darius dared ask everything we do in one sense or another is because of him velixar said frowning because of your failure to kill him to be exact if youre to ask questions learn to ask better ones they stopped in the center of town darius looked to homes seeing a surprising number of new ones after that night hed talked with jerico of the survivors merely a third of what they had been still they had rebuilt and now slept in peace though he wondered how many dreamt of dark shapes crossing the river yellow eyes glinting i wish you could sense it velixar said closing his eyes and lifting his arms to the sky even in death the power of life lingers on not just for mankind either a shame the bodies of the wolves were burned they would make excellent servants for karak they reached the center of town and there velixar stopped he seemed too pleased with himself for darius to feel comfortable in the distance wild dogs began howling as if they sensed the presence of the prophet do you know why i have brought you here velixar asked i can think of many reasons therefore i cannot say why you let ashhurs paladin teach here unchallenged unquestioned you let his lies spread let his frailties be viewed as strength tonight you shall rectify this error call the town bring them before you and in the dead of night show them truth the prophet turned and began walking toward the distant forest that outlined the gihon river will you not stay he asked this is your test velixar said looking back before the nights end i will return pray i am pleased with what i find when i do darius watched him go and felt relieved when he was gone for the first time since the dungeon he was alone even when he prayed he felt velixars presence lingering like an intruder at least now he could breathe rectify my error he muttered looking about easier said than done in the deep of night all would be asleep time to wake them up he took his sword and stabbed it into the dirt before him clutching the hilt he harnessed the power of karak in one of the few ways he knew how his voice multiplied in volume thundering over the town as he gave his call to me he cried to the center i am darius returned and my news is grave three times he let out his cry until certain everyone would hear and obey no doubt they felt fearful of another attack by the wolfmen let them what waited by the river was far more dangerous than any wolf darius asked a familiar voice of the first to arrive was jeremy hangfield the wealthiest landowner of the village he wore heavy robes tied with a gray sash at his side was his daughter jessie clutching his hand tight jeremy darius said tilting his head in respect im glad youve come i will need your help in convincing the rest convincing them of what instead of answering darius shouted again urging the villagers to hurry he beckoned them closer with his arms as he spun he took in the faces former friends acquaintances for a moment he thought there were still many lagging behind perhaps even sleeping but then realized the extent of the damage the wolfmen had inflicted twothirds of the town jerico had claimed after taking count that horrible night so many faces he did not see and his heart ached for their fate how many had been of his own congregation worse how many had died with their faith clutching a lie i know you all as you know me darius began hed always been comfortable speaking to crowds hed even joked with jerico about it his faith had given his words a fire the other paladin could not match but tonight tonight he felt timid quiet once he might have spoken and trusted his words to be heard but now he shouted as if he feared the sounds of the night would drown him out i am darius paladin of our great lord karak i come to you with a heavy heart and a heavier conscience many of you once gathered about when i lectured and to you i apologize for my absence this night will be kindest to you so do not fear what i have to say to those who knelt with the paladin jerico it is you whom i speak to with greatest urgency come inside jeremy said his voice low tell me first what danger wakes us in the night dont do this here you look a man feverish and ill no darius screamed i am here because i must be i have no choice no choice the darkness walks this night and it brings a fire more dangerous than the teeth of wolves it brings the fires of the abyss forgive me people of durham for my weakness i let a liar become my friend i let falsehoods be spoken next to my truths in cowardice i did not act but i must now those of you who would worship ashhur i tell you your god is false what he teaches is lies and delusions a doctrine made for a different world not our own bend your knee and swear to karak judgment has come do not hesitate do not question bend the knee angry murmurs spread through the crowd few bowed and even they seemed upset enough of this madness jeremy said grabbing dariuss arm you disturb our rest for this get back darius shoved him aside and he pulled his greatsword free of the earth its fire burned across the blade but not just the blade his blackened hand was consumed as well a dark flame wreathing his exposed skin burning away the gauntlet if you will not bow you must leave tonight he cried no delay no waiting for the sake of your very lives i demand this of you durham belongs to karak now if you would still live your lives in chaos then go elsewhere the crowds anger increased tenfold this is our home they shouted our land darius looked to them and in their eyes he saw only fear and confusion symptoms of chaos do not misunderstand me he said he pointed his blade at jeremy i once lacked courage no longer i will slay all those who neither bow nor flee no more words no more arguments you all have heard and know i speak truth whats the matter with you asked a man pushing to the front of the crowd darius recognized him as jacob wheatley a poor farmer he held a heavy club in hand just one of many that had come to his gathering armed with simple weaponry wasnt so long ago you stood here and defended us you saved us from the wolves and now youre telling us to leave you dont have to leave darius said not if we bow i aint bowing darius you saved my life and i owe you but nobody forces me to do nothing i dont like karak aint my god if you still say we go then i might have to use this club here on your thick skull what are you doing darius asked as jacob tensed holding the club before him like a sword youve seen what i can do you know i am better than you what hope do you have hope that youll learn some damn sense darius looked to the crowd even those that had bowed their faith loyal to karak had stood anger trembled in his breast this was what velixar wanted wasnt it this was his way and look what it cost him the souls he had were gone and the rest were ready to fight unknowingly fighting for ashhur or was this another lesson what would velixar say when he walked into this unruly mob and saw only enemies or would he say anything at all before the bloodshed began im saving your lives darius said his voice dropping im saving your souls for that i will do everything i must bend the knee jacob i beg of you jacob shook his head i wont he said you wont do it i know you well enough you wont a direct challenge the others were watching waiting none had the armor or weaponry to face him but with their numbers they had a chance to bury him if they attacked as one but that would need bravery and a communal sense of defense damn fools he would not let them have it he would not be made a liar his words were his vow with a single step he lifted his greatsword and swung it cleaved through the club as if it were straw a second step and he smashed jacob in the face with the hilt of his sword the farmer went down blood gushing from his nose before anyone could move darius put the tip of his blade an inch from jacobs neck even at that distance the mans skin started to redden from the heat of the dark fire enough darius said glaring at the crowd what else must i do to prove myself to you you wont jacob said but his voice quivered i will but why you saved me before darius dont you remember dont you the wolfman had been on top off jacob its teeth already sunken into flesh darius had cut off its neck before it could finish and then taken jacob back to town jerico had then saved his life with hands that healed a look at his own hand and darius saw only fire hed saved jacob and now he was ready to kill him once more he looked to the crowd and he knew not what to say these were his charges these were the people hed sworn to defend what was it hed told jerico his path was hard and he didnt always enjoy it but no parent wished to punish their child no farmer wanted to cull the weak or ill that might bring down the rest of the herd as he looked he saw jessie staring at him tears in her eyes her father looked ready to explode the town was uniting and it was in hatred of him please he whispered dont hate me i do what i must what you must indeed velixars voice floated on the wind and its sound put a chill into his heart no time left go he said taking his sword and stabbing it once more into the dirt forget my words forget everything your lives are at stake i am not alone you fools now run run the urgency in his voice finally sent them moving at first they only rushed and he had little doubt that many intended to bar their homes and wait out the night along with whatever nameless fear he warned them of but that wouldnt last already he heard the sound of deep laughter and in it was such joy darius refused to turn refused to look he heard the sound of an explosion followed by wood raining down upon the ground another and then another screams joined it all the while he knelt in prayer to karak begging for strength begging for understanding begging for their souls at last darius stood tears in his eyes all around him durham burned people ran for their fields ran for the forests soon they too burned a great wildfire that blotted out the very stars with its heat and smoke velixar walked amid the blaze a dark prophet come bearing judgment with a wave of his hand fire spread with a few words from his lips lightning struck blasting apart feeble wooden structures more screams cries for help darius pulled free his sword and as he listened to a nearby woman burn alive he stared at the fire of his blade the strength of his faith it had lessened but only a little his heart felt like a bleeding wound but he clutched to velixars words with whatever strength he had left what this world needs he whispered even as his tears fell darkness struck him and he collapsed to one knee blinded he heard a sudden roar its power overwhelming words echoed in his head coming from everywhere and nowhere we are what this world needs the time for choice is over the time for mankinds failure is done we must save them we must save them all order my beloved paladin bring this world order his blindness left him and feeling coldly detached he looked up to the smokefilled sky hovering over the village like a phantom image in the reflection of a pool he saw the face of a lion karak had come to him and spoken the honor left him shaken the words left him numb looking around he saw the town he had once saved now lost to fire is this your will he whispered so be it my faith is great the road is narrow and harsh few will walk it but i will i will follow your prophet forgive my frailty karak forgive my doubt i am one man mortal and weak but i will be strong i will remember we do this for them always for them faith in ashhur was like a plague a single instance could spread only one thing would stop it and at last he knew the prophets desire burn the sick branches darius thought fully understanding the gift bestowed upon his bladeupon blades of all paladins sworn to his mighty god burn them with fire a knocking stirred jerico from his uneasy sleep before he could sit up kaide was already at the door weapon in hand he put his fingers to his lips and then motioned for jerico to answer the paladin did so cracking the door enough to let in the light of a candle held by a servant milord wishes an audience with you he said me jerico asked still groggy now most apologies for disturbing your rest but yes i must insist dress if youd like but do not worry about formality jerico shut the door and gave kaide a confused look formality itd be a strange trap and for little reason kaide said with a shrug id go but just in case bring your mace id rather bring my shield the bandit shrugged whatever im going back to bed jerico flung his shield on his back clipped his mace to his belt and then exited the room the servant gave him a funny look and when he saw the mace he frowned no weapons he said i am no threat to your lord jerico said if you wish you may ask him this didnt seem to appease the wiry servant much but he gestured for the man to follow they wound their way through the halls of the castle which felt more like interlocking caves than hallways after many turns they came upon an area of the castle in the open air arthur sat on a bench carved of stone staring at the moon milord said the servant the paladin wishes to keep his shield and mace what say you fearing assassins arthur said and he chuckled he was in his bedrobes and he gestured to his flimsy attire i assure you i am little threat it is not you i fear jerico said nor your men the world is no longer safe to my kind no matter where i go but if you insist i will return to my room and lay down my arms arthur waved him off come sit with me in the moonlight jerico did still unsure of the reason for their meeting the bench was long and surprisingly comfortable the air was chill for no torches burned nearby lest they obscured the stars jerico crossed his arms to keep in his heat sleep refuses to find me arthur said his head leaned back so he could gaze at the sky and if i cannot sleep then the petty part of me refuses to let others i could use a man to talk to jerico someone honest they say that paladins of ashhur are incapable of lies that your god would strike you dead for even the lightest fib what say you to that id say you repeat childrens stories i speak truth by choice arthur not by fear of lightning bolts from the sky arthur chuckled it must be grand to have all your answers given to you to the abyss with politics and fiefdoms what ashhur says you do youre not much different than any of my knights are you this time it was jericos turn to chuckle if ashhur gave me orders in the same way you order your knights perhaps it would be so easy but even if he did it would not truly make a difference if you ordered your knights to abandon their families and march to their deaths how many would do so all of the good ones and how many is that arthurs smile widened not nearly enough but what of you how much would you sacrifice all that i have said jerico hrmph easy to say of course middle of the night everythings calm and every foe is a hundred miles away but what do you do when confronted with such a terrible choice what do you do when honor tells you one thing and your gut tells you another jerico shifted and he turned his attention from the stars to the troubled lord what bothers you he asked arthur sighed you and your friend come to me demanding action as if it is that simple youre simple people of course a paladin who worries only of his god and a bandit who thinks only of his vengeance i have no god i seek no vengeance i must do what i think is right not just for me but for the people of my lands well jerico said gesturing to the empty surroundings you dragged me out here to talk so lets talk help a simple man out either that or let me go back to bed ill kick kaide out here to tell you a few stories kaide bores me arthur said motioning for a servant to bring him something to eat a young woman appeared blondehaired carrying a tray of sliced fruits arthur took a plate and told jerico to take what he liked the paladin grabbed half an apple and began absentmindedly chewing it kaide is hes like a rabid dog at times arthur said eating a handful of grapes hed tell me to send every soldier i had rushing the gates of my brothers castle to the abyss with whether or not wed win hed slit my throat in a heartbeat if it got him to sebastian advice from him is pointless i know what he wants and what hell say but you to be honest paladin i havent a clue why youre with him it sounds like the makings of a very bad joke a bandit and a paladin into a tavern they go jerico said and he laughed and your guess is as good as mine what the next line might be i help because i feel i should kaide might be willing to go too far for what he wants but at least his cause is just your brothers actions against him there is no excuse for murder and bloodshed done in the name of greed greed is a tricky thing arthur said might not greed guide my own actions here what if i care not for righting my familys wrongs what if i want power and will use a misguided homeless bandit to further my ends if you have that fear arthur then you are most certainly not that kind of man arthur scratched at his beard i forfeited my right to my fathers holdings honor would say i keep to what i did years ago what sebastian has done it is foul yes but is war any better hes killed a few but hundreds will die if i muster my men and the peasant folk to fight for me he sighed and fell silent jerico gave him time to think but when it seemed apparent he would not continue he prodded him with another question why did you forfeit your right as firstborn he asked whatever you speak stays with me and you may refuse if you wish i only ask so that i may help if i can arthur tossed the rest of his grapes to the floor and he rubbed his eyes i lose more sleep over that than anything else paladin my father was getting old and his mind was failing him i pray you never endure anything similar a cruel fate watching a proud intelligent man torn down piece by piece until nothing is left but a child there were times he was still himself but mostly anyway i talked with a servant i trusted and procured a simple poison it would only make him sleep for a few days that is all but i hoped that during that time i could take control of my birthright but i was caught turned in by that very same servant my father would hear no reason for never did he believe his mind was breaking outwardly arthur remained calm as if his face were that of a statue instead of a living man his voice kept steady but his eyes were watering and he made no pretence at hiding it when he wiped them he went to his grave thinking i had tried to kill him all because i didnt want to wait the few months it would take for him to grow bedridden the way he would look at me so angry so confused he was like a child even then a child betrayed father almost ordered me hanged but sebastian intervened if i would only return to my private lands and relinquish any claims to my inheritance he looked to jerico as if surprised hed said as much as he had i lost much because i tried to take what was not yet my own sebastian rules the land is not mine should i spill so much blood for a few farmers and outlaws jerico crossed and uncrossed his arms trying to think through his tired hazy mind i think i think i could use a drink he said a sound plan arthur gestured and the blonde serving girl returned this time holding a tray with two cups and a steel pitcher jerico accepted a cup and he squinted at the liquid the girl poured into arthurs do you not drink wine the lord asked water please jerico said putting the cup back on the tray the girl smiled at him but something about her look prickled the hairs on his neck it wasnt that she seemed frustrated or angry no her face remained absolutely perfectly controlled if not pleasant like glass impressive for a servant girl forced awake to attend her lord halfway through the night wait jerico said grabbing arthurs cup with one hand and the girls wrist with the other ive change my mind he said please drink with me arthur of course said the serving girl smiling sweetly at him jerico accepted his cup and once it was poured he lifted it to his lips immediately he felt the warning of ashhur sound in his mind he looked to the girl who stood perfectly still as if waiting for her dismissal arthur he said lowering the cup can you please tell me her name her why thats step into the starlight girl i cant see you well enough without as the moonlight fell upon her beautiful features arthurs face hardened and that look alone told jerico that she was a stranger dont run jerico started to say when she pivoted smacking him across the head with the metal tray he rolled with the blow desperate to remain beside arthur upon hitting the ground he spun kicking his leg out the girl leapt and his leg smacked against the hard stone of the bench he screamed how dare you arthur roared guards guards wouldnt be there in time jerico knew her hand shot out chopping arthurs throat his cry for guards choked down and blood dripped from his lips the tray clattered to the ground as she drew a dagger but jerico would not allow it shield pulled free he lunged flinging himself in the way the dagger clanged against it and the assassin cried out from the pain of contact do not interfere paladin the woman said taking a step back jerico readied his mace and kept his shield high he watched her waiting every muscle in her body tensed time was not on her side she couldnt dance about nor try to misdirect her target was arthur and so long as jerico lived he would stand in the way she shifted her weight twice twisting her extended foot in a way to feint one direction then leap the other jerico nearly fell for it but at the last moment flung his mace in the way it struck across her shoulder and he heard the snap of bone despite this she did not scream nor stop a dagger in her other hand she thrust for arthurs throat arthur caught her wrist with both hands and wrenched her arm as she twisted he kicked out snapping his heel against her knee when she crumpled he kicked again this time the arm jerico had wounded jerico stepped between them again ready with his shield but arthur pushed him out of the way as the assassin tried to stand he smashed his fists into her head i am no fat lord for you to stick like a pig he said as he kicked her stomach blasting a cry of pain from her lips in my own home you come with poison and blade youll hang woman hang she rolled over her dagger pressed against her own throat hang a corpse then she said before slicing her face contorted in pain as the life left her eyes jerico stepped back as the guards arrived forming a protective circle about their lord arthur pushed them aside and he clapped jerico across the back i owe you my life he said any boon name it and its yours jerico looked to the corpse then shook his head i will name no boon just let me return to rest all i ask of you is that you do what you think is right concerning your brother arthur nodded and he pointed to the dead womans body i have lived these past years fearful of an assassin he said but never did i think sebastian would actually do it i always doubted no longer he wants my head then ill take his he wants poison in my veins then ill bleed his out on the field of battle go rest paladin and worry no more my decision is already made jerico glanced once more at the woman absently wondering of her name there were tears in valessas eyes as she rode from the castle of caves together shed insisted they go together i can handle a single disgraced lord claire had said ill return by morning and no one will be the wiser but come morning she was still inside this might not have caused valessa to panic it wouldnt be the first time her partner had had to improvise but bells signaled a ceremony of some kind and as the nearby farmers gathered valessa had walked among them her heart in her throat last night an assassin tried to take the life of your lord arthur had called out to the crowd from atop the walls of his castle she failed and took her own life before she did she gave one last request i grant it now and with that he flung a body over the edge a rope tied about its neck valessa covered her mouth and choked down her cries the rope snapped taut jerking claires lifeless body side to side no hood covered her face and her eyeballs popped loose hanging by red threads from her skull valessas hands shook you bastards shed whispered as the rest of the crowd cheered you bastards this assassin was sent to me by the one i used to call my brother but sebastian is that no longer he is a fool and a coward to send knives in the dark because he fears the slightest threat to his rule so be it i reclaim my birthright i am arthur hemman eldest son of my father arthos hemman and the north shall be mine but that was not the worst standing there beside arthur was a man she did not recognize but that did not matter she recognized his armor and his strange shield a paladin of ashhur somehow someway one had survived and no doubt hed been the one to keep claire from completing her task her rage grew both arthur and this paladin needed to die but she could do nothing now such a simple assignment sebastian had made it seem all so she could take the life of darius as she fled the city her hatred grew so many were to blame sebastian for not cooperating the paladin for protecting arthur darius for his failures bringing them to the north in the first place arthur for not dying like he should have leaving her task unfulfilled she had enough hate for everyone and as a gray sister she had the power to act on her hate torn between finding sebastian and acquiring reinforcements from the stronghold she rode south knowing she had plenty of time to decide before the roads forked come her second night slumbering beside the road her choice was made for her valessa she startled instantly alert she expected a man kneeling beside her but instead saw only a serpent coiled at her feet given the weather she knew it should have been sluggish and in hiding but instead it slithered toward her its red scales gleaming in the moonlight when it reached her side it coiled up once more and its mouth opened bloodied fangs dripped poison valessa swallowed tensing she would give it no reason to strike no reason at all the serpent struck anyway its fangs sinking into her hand as its poison flooded into her her sight vanished and all sound became the deep whispers of the man in black i call you to me he said your task is at an end as i have said come join us at the seventh altar near stonefield i await you there with darius at my side youve taken the traitor she said unsure if he would hear her or not all her senses were awry and the sound of her voice was very far away traitor no longer and to be punished no more the stronghold has sent another and you will hear from him the wisdom of your high enforcer they believed your lies the truth is sufficient even for one such as i do not tarry gray sister and tell me where is claire the darkness before her eyes seemed to quiver and her anger flared as she imagined it was the effect of velixars laughter she died i believe killed by a paladin of ashhur the darkness turned to red as if from a distant land she felt her right hand throb with pain a paladin could it be hurry valessa we have much to discuss and then it all was gone and she startled once more in her bedroll rolling up her sleeve she looked to her hand two punctures still bled in her palm but they showed no sign of venom damn you prophet she whispered as she bandaged the wound surely there are better ways to send your messages probably but not one that would amuse him as much she and claire had openly defied him for a man who had walked the land for centuries he was certainly one to have developed a long memory her nights were lonely as she rode the village of stonefield many miles southwest she crossed dying farmlands and wondered at the madness that would drive a lord to declare war at the onset of winter he must expect a swift victory she thought sebastian would be wise to hide in his castle but he wasnt that wise if he was he would have given her what she wanted dariuss head now it would be denied to her if the prophet spoke true she feared he did every inn she visited told the same story which somehow traveled faster than her arthur hemman had declared war on his brother and even now gathered his forces on the twelfth night she rode into the ancient altar in ages past it had been a shrine to karak looming over a patch of bare ground where no grass would ever grow was a worn statue of a lion reared onto its haunches below it was sacrificial ground no doubt unused for at least a century stones formed a ring and as she stepped inside she felt cool air brush against her neck even now with the runes carved into the circle long faded power remained dormant in them focusing the will of karak at the feet of the lion stood the prophet darius at one side an elder dark paladin she didnt recognize at the other valessa did her best to keep her anger in check i received your message she said lifting her bandaged hand for a man known to haunt dreams i expected better i needed to ensure you came velixar said smiling it might have been meant to disarm her but instead she felt her hands shifting to the hilts of her daggers no doubt spiders looked that way as they crawled toward their captured prey welcome gray sister said the unknown paladin stepping forward and bowing on one knee i am honored to meet you at last i am mallak third to carden in succession of high enforcer your name is wellknown to me even if your face is not valessa bowed in return she recognized his name for many times shed received orders from him always through proxy of course hidden notes and trusted servants a gray sisters stay in the stronghold was never long and rarely revealed to other paladins should a dark paladin succumb to weakness or lies it would be the sisters that came for them after all looking at mallak she realized shed always pictured him as older despite his gray hair mallak had a youthful look to him ruined only by the many scars across his face he looked a veteran of battle and he stood tall and spoke firm like one of his stature should not darius his sunken eyes stared at her as if he were within a dream and she just a phantom he didnt believe in honored as well she said turning her gaze to velixar and so here we are i assume with darius still alive that you spoke no lie and the stronghold forgave him not forgiven mallak said glancing at darius only that his tribunal has been put on hold we will not execute a member of the faithful it is rare one will fall so far as we believe darius did and then be received once more by karak but it appears to be the case my faith in karak has never wavered darius said a bit of life flaring in his eyes doubt comes to us all valessa said just like it does to me now he killed fellow members of the faith members who now reign in the abyss velixar said putting a hand on dariuss shoulder as darius will one day reign your arguments go beyond your station gray sister any further and you will appear to be questioning the very will of your god valessa fumed but bit her tongue she nodded so be it she said then why am i here or is it only to be reprimanded and sent away the paladin velixar said did you ever learn his name i did not a shield darius asked did he hold a shield that glowed valessa thought back to claires hanging itd been morning and in the sunlight any glow would have been difficult to see but yes she said it looked strange to me then but that must be it it glowed as the enemys weapons glow velixar turned to the lion statue and he lifted his arms to the night sky here he said his voice lowering this is where we will bring him at the altar of karak he will be sacrificed let his blood flow over dariuss sins banishing them forever who then would doubt my students faith i would valessa thought glaring then let us go to where the paladin hides mallak said grabbing his greatsword and drawing it the fire on the blade burned strong sucking in the starlight so that the darkness seemed to thicken you saw him last at arthurs castle no he will not be there not by the time we arrive arthur marches for war will jerico go with him darius asked his eyes remained downcast as he spoke as if afraid to meet her eye if so we must go to the battle sebastian has been a loyal friend to karak mallak said there is more at stake than one last paladin of ashhur we must ensure sebastians victory with whatever power we have with our swords and the prophets sorcery we can turn the tide of any battle to our desire we will need to hurry valessa said the ride here was long and arthur will surely have begun marching it will be many weeks until he reaches the castle of the yellow rose velixar argued sebastian wont stay she said shaking her head hell march out i know it hes been eager to fight his brother for years now hes left his cave hell came riding out with his entire host if you are right we have little time mallak said let us rest this night for i see valessa is tired come morning we will ride i travel at night velixar said as will darius rest now and then follow the main roads listen to the whispers of the common folk they will tell you where the armies march and where they will meet as for us we will always be near with that he turned and darius followed him away as the man in black stepped out of the circle valessa felt the very air warm as if velixar were a fire giving off cold instead of heat i hope i show no disrespect in saying i do not trust him she said when certain the prophet was far enough away mallak tilted his head and looked as if he were examining her your faith is strong he said and you are wise in many things but you are wrong to doubt karaks hand i have met him only rarely but every time he has spoken with wisdom and cunning it was he who brought low the citadel though the rest of the world hears only the name of xelrak he has given us a great victory and if he assures me karak has redeemed dariuss soul then i will believe him valessa shivered as she thought of darius it still feels wrong she said did you not see dariuss eyes he looks like a dead man or at least diseased mallak led her from the sacrificial circle to where he had tethered his horse at the base of a tree indeed he does said the paladin as he untied his mount but he has much to atone for im sure the guilt of his failures weighs heavy on him and will until he executes the paladin what was his name jerico yes jerico with his death dariuss atonement will be complete valessa accepted his offered hand and she sat behind him as he rode out to where she had tied her own horse following her quick gestures to lead him there but what of nevek pheus lars i heard rumors of other dark paladins going missing too what of those potential murders mallak stopped his horse so she could dismount as she untied her horse the strong rope wrapped around a low branch she heard the paladin draw his blade this fire is for healing as much as cleansing she heard him say she turned about and the frightening power in his eyes sent her to one knee we lost good men to him but i will not lose another if he has truly returned let him fight let him suffer and walk karaks hard road but should he stumble or turn against all karak holds dear he swung the sword once cutting the tree limb valessa had tied her horse to it fell to the ground with a thud having barely slowed the blade as it cleaved through the air i follow your orders not those of the prophet she said her head bowed speak the word and i will turn on velixar himself i know girl now hurry i saw an inn a mile back and i would like to sleep on a soft bed while i still can she mounted her horse tightened her cloak about her and then let him lead the way kaide was surprised by jericos silence as they rode back toward stonahm hed expected questions doubt maybe even rudimentary discussion of battle tactics but instead the paladin remained lost in thought and this made him wonder when required the two traded their mounts for fresh horses at a nearby village with every farmer eager to help out with arthurs war as they called it arthurs war only now did they accept it even though hed spent years spilling the blood of sebastians men sure theyd given him their support but only when he dumped bags of stolen gold at their feet at every village he told them of the coming conflict and made a quick speech rallying them to battle before moving on trusting them to find and link up with arthurs vanguard were making good time kaide said as they rode out from another village saddled up on yet another new pair of horses kaides was a chestnut mare and he liked the beasts energy still jerico said nothing as they camped for the night only a two day ride from stonahm he finally asked jerico what was the matter you badgered me into talking he said grinning at the paladin i think its my turn now ashvale jerico said still staring into their fire what happens to the people there if we win when we win i suppose ill leave that up to arthur half a smile cracked on the paladins face im no fool kaide arthur will give you what you want as reward for helping him sway the people to his cause what will you ask of him will you butcher the people who live there now send them away without homes what kaide leaned back and tossed another stick onto the fire he watched it burn as he chewed on his words you want to know what kind of man i am he said at last thats what this comes down to isnt it when jerico nodded he sighed i dont know anymore jerico there was a time id have burned down every building with the people inside to reclaim my home but weve made a new home now its only the fire in my gut that urges me on i may never take back ashvale just as i will never bring my wife back to life but i can hurt the man who did it i can make him suffer as i suffered he took away my home my lands and my wealth ill do the same to him revenge is never spare me kaide said glaring i know what revenge is i live with it night and day what will you tell me that ill feel hollow inside when im done youre wrong ill feel elation ive lost friends family and spilled sweat and blood to achieve what arthur now marches toward ill feel complete paladin does that answer your question jerico nodded sadly i think it does he stood to leave but kaide stopped him with two words the citadel jerico glanced over his shoulder and he stood very still what does that have to do with anything he asked you are no different than i you lost your friends your home everything youd ever known would you tell me that if given the chance you wouldnt hunt down and kill the man responsible would anything i said change your mind the paladin fell silent kaide knew hed struck home he wouldnt lose a valuable ally not now you feel it burning in your gut dont you he said quietly i know the feeling let me give you what you want the people talk to me tell me whispers of stories they might be afraid to speak in the daylight i know the name of the man who destroyed your home stay with me and ill tell you then you can decide for yourself just what type of man you are jerico brushed his red hair away from his face then touched his shield as if needing its strength ill help you he said i still think youre in the right and ill pray to ashhur that when the battle is done youll be a better man than i fear just promise me one thing and what is that jerico looked him in the eye and there was a force there that made kaides throat tighten never ever tell me that name i promise good jerico smacked him upside the shoulder and he grinned as if a heavy weight had left his chest a few days more until stonahm yes i hope you realize that i barely had time to teach your men how to hold a blade let alone kill anyone with it you better have something in mind for them other than standing in the front lines when sebastians knights come crashing in one of these days youll stop thinking im a fool kaide said tossing a nearby stone at him it clanked off the paladins armor one of these days itll be right do so but until then i work with what i have another rock this one larger jerico failed to duck in time and as he rubbed his eyebrow kaide laughed you may be a big lug in armor he said but even this fool knows to strike where a mans weakness is mines my forehead its big enough jerico smiled when the battle starts you stay at my side he said id hate for you to get killed off on your own kaide shot him a wink we may lose this entire war and ill still survive trust me on that ive eaten the flesh of the dead sebastian has nothing nothing that can frighten me now youve really done it now bellok said the wizard looking positively annoyed is that so kaide asked grinning as the rest came up to greet them you started a war without me im disappointed the two laughed and then louder as adam and griff wrapped them in bear hugs we get to fight they cried in unison jerico slipped to the side content to let them celebrate he caught beth watching him while waiting for her father to be free he smiled at her but she looked away when kaide called to her she ran and wrapped her arm around his chest hugging him tightly her stump remained at her side as if she were afraid to touch him with it well need to move out soon kaide said after kissing the top of her head theres several places the two lords might choose to meet and i want us there before either side can discuss matters with the other you really think theyd make a truce bellok asked no kaide said his grin ear to ear but i want to be there just in case sebastian sends an envoy ill enjoy sending him back in pieces father beth said and he kissed her forehead once more pay no attention to what i say he whispered now go on to your room and leave us be you entered this dark world of adults sooner than you ever should have she blushed but did as she was told jerico watched her exit wishing for even the tiniest of smiles to soothe his lingering guilt he received none jerico kaide said pulling his attention away you know more of this than i we need to march and prepare supplies come give us a list will you jerico helped much as he could detailing necessary provisions to bring with them from the obvious to the obscure kaide frowned as he listened and rebuked several things they could not get in time well make do without he said how many we have with us ready to go they been comin in from all over adam said burly men thugs farmers rapers the whole lots ready to beat some heads wonderful kaide said his expression anything but how many three hundred bellok said and adams right theyre the sort even we might normally turn away not today give them a stick if we have to well club sebastian down from his castle walls jerico excused himself feeling no longer needed as they continued he stepped out into the town where many still lingered about the home hoping for any word their expressions did not match their earlier joy upon seeing kaide though he felt the outsider a necessary tool and that was all he thought of the flock he had taught in durham and longed for such a connection would any care to hear the word of ashhur from him or was the word of kaide a word of war the only thing they desired will ashhur be with arthurs war a farmer called out as he walked for the village outskirts i pray he is jerico said committing to nothing further than that he walked until he reached the pond and he found the log hed sat upon when training his leg it wasnt so long ago but it felt like a separate age sitting down he grabbed a few nearby rocks and began skipping them across finally alone for the first time in weeks he closed his eyes and listened for the words of his god all he heard were the soft sounds of the night birds rustling the blow of the wind through the grass and the trickle of the small stream feeding into the pond jerico the paladin looked back to see beth standing behind him holding her stump she looked ashamed but she met his eye despite the effort it clearly took yes beth he asked can we talk he shifted and gestured for her to sit beside him on the log she did so i she stopped and jerico let her take her time the sun had begun to set and he watched the colors im sorry she said at last i shouldnt be mad i am but it was so awful jerico they shed begun to cry and he shushed her you have no reason to apologize he said not to me but you just wanted to help she said shaking her head with her lone hand she wiped at her tears i shouldnt be mad not when you wanted to help her name was sally the lady you protected i thought you should know what happened to her he asked when the knights returned what did she do beth looked away and she shivered as if she were cold she ran never again she kept screaming screamed even before they reached the village they chased her and she she never came back jerico felt the words knife through his heart he rubbed his eyes with his fingers feeling a headache building in his forehead all my fault he whispered damn it its all my fault no you cant think not her beth you i could have said yes i could have spared you all of this ill never forgive myself and i can see it in your eyes that you know it too she fell silent and already jerico felt his frustration grow beth was only on the cusp of womanhood barely able to handle her own problems let alone his he should have kept his mouth shut and carried such a burden on his own that was his purpose in the world after all she had enough to worry about besides his guilt i dont mean to be she said at last her arm wrapped around his waist and she leaned against his chest her tears wet his shirt im sorry i dont mean to be so angry the whole time it happened i kept hoping youd save me like you saved sally its not fair blaming you please dont hate me for it jerico please i could never hate you jerico said he watched the sun set as he waited for beth to cry it all out every tear hardened his heart against the men who had done such a thing to her it wasnt right but he didnt care hopefully ashhur would forgive him because for once grace and forgiveness were the furthest things from his mind but most of all he felt his guilt and sorrow fading away if she could forgive him for such a mistake then that would be enough for him to forgive himself im sorry he whispered for everything ive failed at for letting you letting everyone suffer i handled it horribly and could have done something to keep that knight from leaving shamed and furious ill do better ill find a way dont give up on me yet i wont she said as she pulled back sniffing and turning away as if embarrassed will you help my dad fight i will for as long as i believe it right to do so i was there that winter she said what we had to do it was will my father go to the abyss for it for you know what he ate he could see the question in her eyes the true words she meant to say what we ate ashhur turns no soul away he said no matter the past its forgotten murderer or priest pious or thief all are children in his eyes i dont think your father will be condemned forever not for that and neither will you her relief spread across her face and she hugged him this time unworried about her stump of an arm promise youll come back to visit she asked i promise and thank you beth cheer up next time i do see you she said forcing a smile youre much more fun to be around when youre in a good mood jerico laughed ill keep that in mind go on to bed i need some time alone to pray she left and once more he felt the sounds of the night envelop him heed the voices of children jerico said as the evening star pierced the hazy purple sky he focused on it as if it were ashhur and could hear every word i hope this is what you want no more doubt no more worries i go to war and i ask your blessing upon it he stood and grabbed his shield and mace which he had put at his feet the shield shone brilliant in the night and he smacked the front of it once for reassurance before returning to stonahm to sleep come morning he and three hundred others rode west to where they believed arthur would be s ir gregane stared at the map of the north and frowned i hate maps he muttered pointing at a section of sharp interconnected triangles is that forest and if so how dense his second in command a knight named nicholls leaned over and scratched at his chin ive hunted there once he said the lands mostly flat and the trees are thick at times theres many gaps though as if the woods and grass couldnt make up their mind who got to grow where i think thats what the cartographer meant to imply the flap of their tent shook in the wind and gregane turned and jammed his sword through the fabric pinning it to the ground the ground is flat he said returning to the table youre certain of this as i can be two years after being there the two men were alone in the tent by sir greganes orders in that privacy with a man who had once been his squire he could finally discuss and strategize without fear too many were vying for favor in sebastians eyes under the assumption that once arthurs lands were conquered a new lord would need appointing to rule some were already trying to sabotage his command or cause greater casualties and delays than there might be otherwise when defeating the renegade brother it seemed gregane was the only one who understood sebastian would appoint no one but himself to rule all of the north what do you truly think gregane asked nicholls shrugged and pointed at the map itll be difficult for our cavalry to maneuver depending on where we meet and they might have ambushes planned hence why theyve chosen the area at least its far from any town gregane said still staring at the map as if he might bore a hole through and see into arthurs mind the lord had sent a rider alerting gregane and his commanders that arthur sought to meet on a field of battle in the area known to the locals as the green gulch gregane had promised an answer the following day and then sent out scouts to check the terrain it would be at least a day or two before he heard back from them and the knight found his patience wearing thin as the night waned id have preferred it if we had chosen the location nicholls admitted but assuming arthur holds to his word we couldnt have hoped for better ground to fight itd take months to starve him out of his caves if at all given how many damn hidden paths and vaults hes dug into it gregane nodded when hed marched out granted command by lord sebastian hed expected to be heading toward a lengthy siege with his five thousand men a tenth of them mounted cavalry hed figured arthur would use his castle to make up for his vastly inferior numbers such a plan while sure to be an eventual victory for gregane posed far greater danger than open combat the plain folk were without a doubt supporting and aiding arthur the longer the brothers conflict lasted the worse itd get for sebastian if it comes down to the green gulch a potential siege or a fight at a river crossing ill take the flat ground said gregane nicholls rolled up the map and stored it in a chest of greganes things what of the scouts he asked learn what we can from them but unless they discover battlements and trenches already built well not break our word will arthur renege this could be a ploy gregane shook his head ive served the hemman family since long before arthoss death i know arthur hes honorable and will do what he thinks is right he would never renege upon an agreed battle what of his rebellion against sebastian i assume he thinks it is right too gregane sighed and he yanked his sword free and gestured for nicholls to leave careful with your thoughts he said that road leads to danger we serve the lord of the north and right now that rightful lord is sebastian hemman all else matters not of course nicholls said saluting when he was gone gregane scowled his anger toward nicholls was misplaced and he knew it the younger knight had only voiced a gnawing doubt that he himself had been trying to ignore arthur the older brother was the one who should have ruled if not for forsaking his claim arthur the one who ruled all aspects of his life with honor and patience he slammed his fist atop the table banishing such treasonous thoughts sebastian was lord that was that gregane couldnt toss a bag of coins to beggars then demand it back the following year it was foolish and neither could arthur try for similar such threats to the norths stability needed to be ended and quickly his duty wasnt to like it only do it come battle he would defeat arthur and bring him bound to the yellow castle for his lord to decree his fate a cold wind blew and he shivered the tent flap rustled and he turned thinking it only the wind instead a man in black robes stood before him his pale face smiling and his eyes alive with fire gregane reached for his sword but stopped when the man said a single word halt despite his struggle gregane could not move it was as if a hundred invisible chains had latched to his body he stared at the intruder feeling anger and panic swelling in his chest his heart pounded the sound thunderous in his ears i mean you no harm said the man in black and i stop you not out of fear or malice but to prevent you from doing something you might regret if you remain calm i will release you unsure how to answer gregane stared at the man and did his best to show that he was under control apparently it worked for the intruder waved his hand and the chains were gone who are you he asked crossing his arms to fight against the impulse to draw his blade i am velixar voice of the lion prophet to our glorious god karak i come offering counsel and my aid i have enough men whispering in my ears yes but i offer no whispers and most important of all my voice speaks truth gregane swallowed truth he thought he highly doubted it still if this was a holy man of karak he had to tread carefully sebastians loyalty to their deity was well known throughout the north then tell me what you wish to say and i will take it into consideration consideration velixar chuckled though gregane could not begin to guess the reason for his amusement when men with wisdom speak you should listen and obey my dear knight not pretend not take it into consideration gregane found himself entranced by the prophets face at first hed thought he imagined it but he realized the mans features were slowly shifting as if his face were a liquid in constant miniscule motion his blood ran cold as he wondered just what really lay behind that mask as you say gregane said trying to play it safe then speak and i will listen much better i have seen many battles sir gregane sir gregane ive seen many and started more i know the minds of men the simple strategies they employ let me stay at your side and i will help you crush arthurs rebellion the norths worship of karak must not be disrupted in any way gregane thought of that priest standing beside him come the battle and he knew any orders he gave would not be suggestions once more he felt another clawing at the prestige that was to be rightfully his and staring into those red eyes he knew within lurked a man who would laugh at the very notion of honorable combat we go to meet arthurs men he said we have agreed to a place and will arrive within a few days march would you accompany us or wait for our arrival it was a gamble he knew but he had a feeling such a man would not casually walk among the living his very presence seemed counter to daylight i will await you there the priest said his smile growing show me where gregane knelt before his chest opened it and pulled out his map carefully he unrolled it upon the lone table of his tent placing weights on all four corners to keep it open with every bit of his self control he willed himself to believe with absolute certainty the lie he spoke here he said pointing to a place labeled deer valley several miles east of the green gulch a valley velixar asked we will leave them nowhere to run and our horsemen will run rampant through their lines the prophet nodded in approval my faithful and i will await you there my good knight your cooperation will never be forgotten i promise the promise felt just as much threat but gregane kept his face composed the rigid gaze of a commander velixar stepped out from the tent once he was gone gregane collapsed to his knees tore off his armor and called out for one of his servants to bring him a very very full pitcher of wine jerico rode into lord arthurs camp with his head held high as beside him kaide busily counted and made estimations finding the army had taken little questioning considering every farmer and trader seemed to know of its location as they neared theyd encountered villages arthurs men had passed through accepting gifts of food and supplies from there theyd found the army with ease kaides group had been stopped at the outer edges of the camp but the guards were aware of their coming and let them pass i hate the way they look at us bellok said guiding his horse between jerico and kaide like filthy rabble are you saying were not kaide said but he didnt smile at his own joke instead too busy glancing about at the tents nervous to meet arthur again bellok asked or have your men embarrass you jerico added glancing back to the farmers thieves and bandits that formed their diminutive group most seemed intimidated by the armored soldiers that watched them trot toward the center of the camp marked by arthurs enormous tent atop a cluster of hills no kaide said frowning i count only a thousand maybe fifteenhundred i hoped for more more might come bellok said but he sounded like he doubted it at the commanders tent they halted and dismounted a soldier guarding the entrance motioned to a field in the far distance weve prepared a place for your group said the man thats a damn long walk kaide said we have some food to spare and the land is flat do you have a problem jerico and kaide exchanged looks so be it kaide said bellok spread the order then join us inside as they went to enter the guard refused to move instead he pointed to the mace shield and dirks the two wore your weapons he said another look between them no they said in unison the guard didnt seem flustered in the slightest surrender or no audience the tent flap opened and lord arthur stepped out long enough to gesture them inside as well as whisper a word to the guard the guard shot them an annoyed glare but held his tongue a fire built in the center of the tent made the interior feel warm and welcoming the smoke escaping through a hole in the very top where the poles came together a table was on one side adorned with maps and sheets of parchment detailing numbers and supplies on the other side was arthurs bed the lord walked over to the table and sat in the only chair i must thank you arthur said leaning back given how quickly i prepared my forces i feared i would have no choice but to take from the villagers we passed to keep my men fed instead i find myself given more than my fattest soldier can eat never did i think the hearts of the people had abandoned my brother so the hearts of most can be bought with coin kaide said and ive spent every day since ashvale buying hearts using sebastians own gold arthur let out a bitter chuckle i see i pray you never turn on me kaide it could be disastrous for us both when will your entire force be assembled jerico asked trying to bring the conversation to the tasks at hand when it already is paladin are you disappointed jerico was unsure of what to say so kaide said it for him yes we are what challenge will we be to sebastians men with only what a thousand fourteen hundred not counting retainers squires and the women lurking about waiting for night to fall i summoned those loyal to me to fight and now you act disappointed id hoped the legendary bandit would make up for that how many men did you bring me kaides face remained passive as stone three hundred three hundred the lord laughed surely the might of the people rises up against my brother three hundred armed with what pitchforks knives enough jerico said what is it you plan to do arthur the lord gestured to the map and the two looked over it its location marked with an embedded dagger they saw his proposed site for a battle green gulch kaide asked sir gregane has already sent a rider agreeing to the place well meet at midday and fight each other on an honest field of battle kaide looked ready to fall over honest field of battle were going to be outnumbered and you want to march south into a scattered forest full of level ground and fight an honest battle would you throw this war away so easily men fight wars kaide a skilled proud man fighting a worthy cause can defeat ten sworn to something they do not believe how many men have you killed with just your few with surprise with stealth abandon the designated spot and march with all haste toward the cities take murkland take valewood with them in your control sebastian will have to come running and by then we might already have a second army headed for his castle arthur waved him off you appealed to my honor to start this war now ask me to cast it off when you find it inconvenient a victory here means the end of our conflict with no villages burned no lives lost other than fighting men sworn to such a fate now enough of this you have your three hundred what is it you would like to do with them i can find a place among my ranks not the front lines of course they heard commotion from outside and then bellok entered adjusting his robes itll do he said to kaide referring to the encampment he turned to lord arthur oh and the irons twins might have knocked one of your soldiers unconscious well several of your soldiers no one died i promise arthurs eyes widened may i ask the reason bellok bit his lip and glanced at kaide id suggest not suffice to say your men will not speak ill of those two again nor their mothers nor the animals they ride on arthur rubbed his eyes and looked ready to dismiss them all my men kaide said bringing his attention back to the map i have a plan for them though it might insult your honorable tendencies where will you set up your lines arthur gestured to a small white space there runs a gap of nearly half a mile between the trees my men will be stationed along the tree line that should keep sebastians mounted knights from running us over kaide looked at it and gestured for bellok to do the same the wizard ran a hand through his white hair and then nodded in approval itll work he said what will asked arthur i think it best you not know kaide said i have my tricks just as you have your noble honor until we reach the gulch well march with you but continue on when you begin setting up lines arthur looked none too pleased with this but he did not argue sir gregane is leading sebastians forces he said hes a good man and knows how to fight whatever you do prepare for it to not work as you expect other than that from where we believe them camped well have about a halfdays preparation before he arrives can you do what you hope to do in such short time i could do it in less bellok said shooting the lord a grin just who are you again arthur asked the card i have hidden up my sleeve kaide said bowing low now by your leave id like to return to my men go he waved them on but when he saw jerico about to leave he stopped him yes milord jerico asked i heard plenty of opinions but none from you what say you to all this i dont know kaides plan hes hidden it from even me as to where you battle the advantages are as you say and will be better if you can dig even a single trench beforehand how many men do you expect to fight four to five thousand the two stood there a moment in the quiet and then arthur began to chuckle i march men to their deaths all for a cause i cannot win thats the truth of this isnt it jerico shrugged if that is so then why do you continue arthur sat in his chair and leaned back eyeing the paladin i looked into you jerico to see what i could find the citadel theres a story spreading though how it fell no one seems to agree your paladin friends are vanishing and some whispers even say they are gone completely yet here you are still fighting why is that jerico shrugged its the right thing to do aye arthur said and for once he smiled it is after hiding in caves for years it feels good to stand tall and do just that i dare say it is about damn time will you fight at my side or will you join kaides dogs lurking at the edges i dont even know what kaide is doing until i do i must stay with him i think hell need my help more than you will in fact im certain of it i did help train his men after all arthur laughed you did how did that go i lasted a day before i wanted to break my vows to ashhur involving decency and murder arthur stood and he clasped jericos hand and shook it stand tall and fight bravely he said consider me honored to have known you and have you fight against my brother wherever you may be jerico smiled and he did his best to push away all thoughts of the coming battle ashhur be with you he said leaving the tent to speak with kaide and find out just what chaos he had in mind darius and velixar camped alone several miles from deer valley velixar never slept but he often vanished for long periods of prayer it was then darius would sleep rarely did he feel rested come morning nightmares haunted him always of the abyss he felt its heat beneath his skin in the darkness he saw what would be his fate his torture and release upon accepting his rightful place in the eyes of his god with fire and flame he would cleanse the sin from the wretched but in his dreams he suffered with the sufferers despite everything velixar insisted yet those dreams were still better than having velixars burning eyes upon him or to hear his cold words whispering promises and assurances he wanted rest needed it badly but this time as the stars rose the prophet did not leave for prayer will you need a fire he asked as the two sat in the center of their modest camp darius nodded winter was fast approaching the last remnants of autumns warmth in retreat a fire sprang forth between them with a wave of velixars hand and darius leaned closer to it his arms hunched and his head low you know what must be done velixar said watching him from beneath his hood come tomorrow it will all end the last consequence of your failure will be faced amid arthurs army lurks the paladin i am sure of it no mere soldier will bring him down that honor must be yours what will you do when you meet him in battle darius thought of the man hed always considered his friend however strained their friendship had been because of their opposed deities what would he do it doesnt matter he said refusing to look velixar in the eye i will do what karak asks of me karaks will has often proved elusive to you i would have an answer paladin darius looked up and he felt a weight upon his heart as he spoke i will kill him i will cut his head from his shoulders and hold it high for all dezrel to see my faith is to karak my god above all others let him go to ashhur or karak or wherever his soul shall spend eternity a smile spread across velixars everchanging face you have learned much darius enough that i would consider you both pupil and friend i know your heart is still troubled do not think me blind to your struggles but freedom comes soon bear no guilt for what must be done think not of him as your friend nor as an enemy he is an obstacle in your path blocking the narrow road in this you must know what karak has called for you cannot doubt my words since your childhood karak has demanded this of you that you let nothing stand in the way of your faith not death not life not love not weakness and not pride faith darius you have it stronger than most alive and that is why i offer you a gift if you would accept it darius felt a shiver travel up his spine and he tried to blame it on the weather what is your gift he asked let me see the mark on your hand darius pulled back his sleeve and held out his sword hand the skin remained black as charcoal and looked as if it had been recently charred it caused him no pain other than a constant remembrance of his doubt and weakness back in durham velixar put his own hands atop it his touch like ice karak marked you for you went to him seeking your fate if you spared jericos life velixar said now you have seen it and lived it all the while bearing karaks shame you doubted his will you tried to bring mercy to an enemy that deserves only annihilation tell me once more the fate you saw i would fall at his feet darius said and he felt tears building in his eyes id be beaten bloodied and like a dog i would beg for death i free you from that fate velixar said i free you from karaks mark your faith has returned and it will grow stronger than ever know karaks love has come into you know his presence in his greatest way velixars hands shimmered violently everywhere the mark touched flared with pain as if darius had plunged his hand into fire his arm shook his stomach twisted but he had not eaten in a day and he had nothing to expel a vision came over him shocking with its strength and power he saw himself and at first he thought it taking place in the abyss given the fire surrounding them but then he saw grass and trees bodies lay about cut down by blades on his knees his mace lost his shield broken knelt jerico one last chance he heard himself say yield to karak or face his judgment jerico stared at him his face full of anguish and sorrow he said nothing only shook his head darius felt himself dip into the body of the vision becoming one with it sensations nearly overwhelmed him the heat of the fire the ache of his muscles from the fight and the taste of blood on his tongue most of all though he felt pure total exhilaration he lifted his sword wreathed with black flame so thick it hid the blade completely it felt light as air in his hands his mark which had marred his skin was gone jerico looked to the blade then closed his eyes karaks judgment darius heard though he knew not who said it it comes for all he swung the sword as it connected with jericos neck the vision shattered and he felt himself returning to his true body he lay on his back in the grass shivering from the cold to his left the fire had dwindled down to nothing velixar stood over the ashes and even he looked shaken such glory he said his voice soft such honor your mark is gone darius and your fate now your own show faith to karak and you will achieve all you have seen fail doubt and you will break before jerico two destinies both yours to decide either jerico falls or you fall before him i have faith in you to make the right choice to wield the power meant to be yours karaks strength embodies you stand darius lift your blade darius did and though he felt unsteady on his feet he could not deny how much lighter his armor felt when he lifted his sword it was with a single hand instead of two at his touch fire consumed it dark and deep the metal of the blade was visible but only just my choice darius said it always has been darius looked to velixar then i will live and bring order to a world that sorely needs it velixars smile was ear to ear as it should be he said karak be praised you have truly returned to the fold darius sheathed his sword closed his eyes and gave his first ever prayer to ashhur he asked him to keep his champion from partaking in the battle otherwise his mind was decided his fate was chosen should they meet jerico would die youre grumpier than normal jerico said as bellok shouted orders at every nearby person whether they deserved it or not the whole damn night the wizard said rubbing his eyes ever tried swinging your mace for eight hours straight i did that with my head grumpy doesnt begin to describe how i feel the next person who yells next to my ear gets turned into a jumping toad they walked amid the bustle of the camp preparing to move out arthur had sent them a rider alerting them to greganes location come the late afternoon the battle would begin are we ready jerico asked tightening his armor i still dont know our plan better you dont its not going to work this the grumpiness talking common sense now wheres that blasted little brat kaide jerico pointed toward the top of a hill giving his best speech to the men bellok rubbed his temples with his fingers i dont have time for speeches let me just show you then the paladin followed him to the wizards tent inside was a chest its lid closed before jerico even took a step inside bellok whirled on him jamming a finger against his breastplate whatever you do he said not even if ashhur himself commanded it not even if you thought your very life depended on it do not bump that chest understood jerico stammered his jaw working up and down as if it might somehow figure out a correct response um understood bellok eyed him clearly not believing but then turned to the chest and carefully opened the lid jerico leaned forward curious to see what the fuss was about rocks he said i must confess bellok i expected something a little more impressive the look the wizard gave him made him feel like a child and he started to blush rocks bellok said his voice flat i spent all night casting spells turning these into our one slim hope of victory and you come in and call them unimpressive rocks do you think me a loon that guards a few plain stones like they were karaks balls but i did you not think for even a moment they might be hidden or of a magical nature a wizards stash of artifacts after all might just be magical but and did it not once ever occur to you bellok said now nearly roaring while jamming his finger an inch away from jericos nose that just maybe maybe there is an inherent deception involved in the creation of certain artifacts or that the plain might be infused with the magical just like your miniscule little brain somehow manages to swing a giant mace to smash other miniscule little brains jerico stared at him torn between laughing and running in terror he started to speak stopped watched bellok narrow his eyes as if anticipating another stupid comment and then spoke i just forget it would you like to see what they do jerico sighed yes bellok knelt by the chest and delicately picked up one of the stones they were about the size of his palm and smooth on all sides he gestured for jerico to follow and then left the tent with the chest lid still open jerico glanced within saw about twenty more of the stones and then hurried after wands and staves are beyond anything kaides men might use bellok said as he led them away from the camp but i think even these are within their skills they stopped at the stump of a tree cut down the night before for firewood take off your gauntlet bellok said why because i dont want you to die from too rough of a touch gods how ashhur puts up with you is beyond me biting his tongue jerico removed his gauntlets and set them aside accepting the stone with his bare hand he was immediately struck by how warm it was to the touch bellok pointed to the stump throw it jerico wound up and hurled the stone and only as it left his hand did he realize bellok had retreated a significant distance the stone struck the stump and instead of bouncing off like it should have it broke into pieces with a bright flash the pieces burst into flame the fire spread rapidly as if the surrounding area were bathed in oil jerico let out a shout at the sudden heat and he jumped backward nearly stumbling he caught himself then glared at belloks far too pleased expression rocks the wizard said with a smug grin still unimpressed far from it jerico said looking back the stump was already black the fire spreading to the dead grass nearby the paladin feared a wildfire but then the wizard raised his hands and whispered words of power the fire lessened and then died these will certainly kill a man jerico said grabbing his gauntlets the surprise will be huge bellok scoffed i would not have them used for something so brutish and simple i show you a brilliant weapon and all you can think of is to throw it at the enemy like a child think paladin remember the terrain we are to fight on and where arthur plans to hold his defense jerico paused and then it clicked into place the forest he said bellok grinned well surround them with fire leave sebastians men with nowhere to run with these stones theyll find themselves in the midst of an inferno before they even smell a whiff of smoke burning them alive may not be honorable but sebastian cast aside honor long ago jerico bit his lower lip in thought it could work though he doubted it would be as simple as the wizard hoped of course there was one other major flaw promise me one thing he said whats that adam and griff dont get to carry one bellok finally laughed perhaps there is some shred of intelligence hidden under that skull of yours thanks jerico muttered following him back to camp once there the paladin found kaide grabbing a drink of wine for his parched throat howd it go jerico asked were you not there to listen afraid not was getting lectured by the wizard kaide shrugged i did my best well have surprise on our side wont be able to ride our horses though saddles arent right for it and neither riders nor horses are trained well fight on foot with knives clubs and a few stolen swords to think this is what i wanted should sebastian turn on us with any real amount of numbers our line will break like water not all of it jerico said lifting his shield so its light shone across kaides face i will be at your side your line will not break so long as we stand kaide smiled and it lit his handsome face it was the first true smile jerico had seen from him as you say well make it be thank you jerico my pleasure just dont run on me id hate for you to miss your own victory sir gregane stared across the open field to the distant forest on the other side of the halfmile gap a fair place for a battle nicholls said looking at the smooth terrain arthur chose well they were here before us gregane said as he glanced at his vanguard we must act carefully there may be hidden ditches to break our horses legs or tripwire laced between the trees all that seems a bit low for one such as arthur gregane frowned arthur consorts with brigands and murderers we cannot assume he has gone unchanged he stared at the field confident no ambushes lurked there the grass was too short to conceal a man and there were no hills tall enough to hide behind he saw faint whiffs of smoke from the forest and even at their distance he could tell the entire army waited within fighting amid trees he muttered well need to draw them out a minor advantage nicholls argued not if they flee but first lets see if arthur is willing to submit before any blood is shed greganes vanguard twenty knights and their mounts all fully armored rode with multiple banners waving the sigil of the yellow rose from the forest arthur rode out to meet them with only five at his side they too wore armor and it shone in the afternoon light when they were within a hundred yards gregane motioned for his vanguard to halt and then he rode forward alone as did arthur greetings sir gregane arthur said lifting the visor of his helmet have you come to aid my rightful return as lord of the yellow rose you forfeited that claim gregane said please arthur i ask you to throw down your sword and go home you can see our numbers there is no hope for you here only death are those your terms arthur asked disarm myself and run like a frightened child to cower and hide for the next assassin to come i will not live my life frightened of my drink and distrusting every shadow of my room sebastian tried to take my life he failed i will come for his and i will succeed gregane shook his head very well i have one last offer this from sebastian himself dismiss your army and announce to the people of the north that sebastian is still lord of the yellow rose in return milord will bear no grudge against you ensure no assassins ever dare strike at you and allow you the freedom to leave your castle of caves without fear what say you arthur grinned and the wolfish gleam in his eye told gregane the answer before the lord ever spoke his promises are nothing one last chance gregane the men will listen to you join my side i am the eldest son and i have come for my birthright sir gregane saluted even as he felt sadness pang in his heart ready your men he said it comes to bloodshed then arthur saluted in return i pray we do not meet in battle he said for no matter the victor i will always offer my hand to you in friendship should you ever choose to accept it they rode back to their escorts well nicholls asked prepare the archers gregane said i want the whole damn woods buried with arrows nicholls shouted the order and then the army began marching as expected arthur vanished into the forest behind the many trunks and naked branches no troops came out to meet them as they marched it looked like they wished to fight amid the trees but gregane had no intention of doing so once within two hundred yards gregane called a halt archers rushed to the front forming three lines of a hundred each sir gregane lifted his arm and he looked through the trees at the line of soldiers somewhere in there an honorable lord would die such a shame let loose he said volley after volley sailed into the air and in the silence following the twang of bowstrings gregane sighed the arrows hit the forest like rain even from their distance gregane could hear the sounds of pierced trunks snapped shafts and the screams of the wounded of all it was the third that was the least frowning he ordered another volley again the arrows fell and gregane struggled to see the trees were too much cover from what he could tell and the men on the front lines bore heavy shields what now nicholls asked arrows are replaced easier than men gregane said empty every quiver the twang of the bowstrings became a discordant chorus the archers letting loose as fast as they were capable gregane did not even watch instead turning to his troops and planning strategy his knights would lose most advantages navigating their horses through the trees if only he could draw arthurs men out somehow and then send his knights crashing through their sides advance slowly gregane said tight formations no charge let us see how disciplined our enemy is and watch for traps the archers fell to the back and then the squads of footmen began their approach only a third were equipped with shields and they would be the ones on the frontlines the rest carried heavy swords and axes the killing men that would break through once the initial clash was done gregane stayed back with his knights watching for the perfect moment to send them crashing in the yards between them shrank and gregane found himself holding his breath waiting for the collision of bodies the communal yell of a charge it did not come for behind him he heard the sound of an inferno unleashed what in karaks name is that nicholls shouted gregane spun his horse and he felt his heart hammer in his chest at the sight the woods behind them were ablaze not just burning not just smoking but full ablaze every tree consumed every inch of the sky blotted out above it as trees collapsed and branches fell the grassland caught the wind gregane said fighting off panic it is with us nicholls said but he didnt sound convinced the fire will not catch us itll burn west instead at such a sight it was hard to believe swearing he looked back to the fight most were unaware of the inferno no doubt focused on the battle his squads had reached the forest which remained at a standstill shields locked against shields those with the longer swords stabbed over and gregane knew he was killing just as many if not more than arthur but that fire he glanced back and this time saw a disturbing sight running low to the ground were several hundred men racing ahead of the fire amid the smoke they were difficult to spot but luck had been with him a heavy gust pushing the smoke away so he might see cursing he took stock of the new threat it must be the bandits he said nicholls turned for a moment confused following greganes point he saw the group and frowned i see no heavy armor he said i think youre right what do we do the fight was not yet theirs but they could not afford to be pressed from two directions no matter how weak that second force might be it seemed overkill to use his knights but the bandits were on open ground take half he told nicholls wipe them out quickly then return right said the knight drawing his sword calling out orders he trotted ahead two hundred and fifty men riding behind gregane turned his attention back to the forest trusting his fellow knight to deal with the distraction at first he smiled for arthurs line had clearly broken but then he saw his men remained in tight formations just within the tree line they certainly didnt look like an army giving chase find out whats going on he told one of his riders the man shot off rode a halfcircle behind the lines and then returned they built themselves a ditch said the rider fell back and now are killing any trying to climb across sir gregane swore then spurred his horse onward to me he cried and several nearby took up his cry to ensure he was heard over the chaos of the battle to me fall back his men did as they were told and gregane clenched his teeth as arthurs men launched an assault greganes footmen torn between standing their ground and retreating as ordered suffered terrible casualties before reforming their lines outside the trees those that chased turned back vanishing into the forest gregane rode past his lines estimating numbers hundreds dead already if not a thousand still he outnumbered arthur but such brutal losses get the archers he told his vanguard i want them shoving every last body into the ditch well charge across the dead both theirs and ours rob ash ride to either side and find out just how far that ditch goes i want them flanked come our next charge the two knights saluted and obeyed as the archers rushed forward and his men reset their lines he glanced back to see how long until nicholls returned instead his mouth fell agape at the sight the fire had spread ignoring the wind as if it were possessed already a quarter mile of grassland burned gregane swore at whatever sorcery had to be involved a second fire appeared to have erupted at the feet of his charging knights every which way he saw horses sprinting some with riders some without the leather of their saddles and sometimes their very bodies burned those that had survived appeared locked in combat though he was too far to know how that went amidst all this strangeness was a strong blue light no matter where his knights rode no matter who struck at it the light never faded never broke sir said rob returning from his side it goes on for at a tenth mile though most of it appears unguarded theyll shift over should they see us moving gregane said but he eyed the stretch of forest with a thought we have numbers though they cant cover it all ash returned the young knight telling of a similar setup it seemed in what time they had arthur had done nothing but build the enormous ditch hoping to use it as a killing ground with the trees to hide them from the arrows that could break them the strategy was simple but sound pull back two squads gregane said send one to each side march until you see no one guarding the ditch then wait for my signal yes sir said the two knights before riding off to do as they were told gregane watched the forest a while longer until it was clear little combat occurred steadily the archers grabbed bodies and guarded by his shielded footmen hurled them into the ditch outnumbered and with their own ditch between them arthurs men couldnt dare charge body by body their only defense vanished and from three sides gregane would strike assuming the fire didnt come to consume them all another glance back showed it getting closer though itd still take an hour to reach them he shuddered to think how quick it might have spread if the wind had been toward them instead as for his knights he found himself stunned at how few their numbers had become more stunning was how they turned and bolted in retreat anger grew in his chest and when nicholls came leading gregane let out his fury armorless bandits he roared my besttrained defeated by mere peasants with clubs they hurled fire like sorcerers nicholls said refusing to lower his head or show weakness at the outburst and armorless or not they wielded heavy weaponry and struck at our horses the fire alone spooked them and they had a wizard whose very words sent our mounts running at random we could not control them the blue light gregane said trying to calm down what of that shield of a paladin nicholls said a skilled man he stands like a mountain and nothing moves him i saw oren ram his horse straight into that shield and it was the horse that fell gregane was stunned he looked about counting and couldnt believe it a hundred dead thirty to the fire nicholls said the rest to the brigands we killed as many as we lost but know i mean it when i say that paladin cannot link up with the rest of arthurs men or we will all suffer gregane looked to the forest suddenly fearful of a strange sorcerer and a holy warrior of ashhur both guarding the line if they could ward off mounted knights in open field what could they do in such close combat you say the wizard could disturb the horses he asked he did they turned and startled every which way no rider can fight like that then dont ride all of you dismount if my own vanguard cannot defeat them we are not worthy to call ourselves knights now go come back with that paladins head or not at all nicholls saluted but gregane could see the hesitation in his eyes damn fool they would outnumber them near two to one how could they lose only the fire posed a threat a fire that continued toward them like a crawling monster struggling to keep his patience he once more turned his attention to the forest alone he marched toward his troops drawing his sword enough of giving commands soon the ditch would be full and both ash and rob would have their hundred men in position it wouldnt matter how many casualties he suffered in the long run once arthur fell the north would remain sebastians now and forever gregane could only hope that such an honor of killing lord arthur would belong to him and him alone valessa waited with mallak in the lower portion of deer valley ever since waking that morning and seeing nothing but distant campfires miles away shed had a nagging fear theyd been betrayed the only question was by whom velixar would never lie mallak said when she voiced her fears not to us not to anyone if someone lied then it was to him let us be patient and see what becomes of this valessa spent the time sharpening her daggers and imagining them plunging into arthur hemmans eyes for what hed done to claire mallak cooked their morning meal and she ate tasting nothing of the nuts and salted pork slivers the sun rose and still they heard no sound of marching feet saw no sign of approaching armies time crawled along until at last velixar and darius appeared in the distance walking into the valley by themselves no one is here velixar said the moment they were within earshot as it seems said mallak but this is where the armies were to meet didnt sir gregane say valessa watched velixars everchanging face harden into a visage of smoldering anger he plays a dangerous game if he thinks to interfere with karaks doings might they be delayed somehow valessa asked already she knew the answer but it amused her to see the prophet flustered so in the daylight he was far from the intimidating specter he was at night his skin seemed paler his bones visible through his stretched skin even the fire in his eyes was but a dull red glow be silent he said closing his eyes and lifting his hands i will find them they waited as the prophet cast his spell valessa used the time to steal a glance at darius she noticed the mark on his hand was gone and felt her stomach tighten at that such a sure sign of karaks forgiveness was hard to dispute crushing her hopes for a chance to take his life it was because of him claire had died a direct result of his lapse in faith karak might welcome the return of the faithful but valessa was not her deity she wanted blood darius himself looked tired still drained and lifeless as he had been when she first saw him at velixars side champion of karak she thought such a joke the fool velixar said suddenly opening his eyes they are in the gulch many miles away well not make it in time valessa said well have to trust sebastians men to achieve victory velixar looked at her as if she were a child the shadows are my doorways he said we will arrive though not as fast as if at night come with me all of you velixar hurried them toward the closest copse of trees near the edge of the valley on their way they saw smoke rise to the west first thin then shockingly heavy have they set the entire gulch aflame valessa wondered but none had an answer for her at the trees velixar circled about stepping into their shade weak he said but enough casting a spell he tore a swirling portal into existence then beckoned for them to enter darius went first followed by mallak valessa smiled at velixar then blew him a kiss before stepping through her stomach immediately twisted and she nearly vomited upon stepping out she felt herself having crossed a great distance but it was something she could not fully understand and her whole body revolted against the sensation they were amid a heavy cluster of trees packed so dense they provided shade from the sun despite their lack of leaves how many times valessa asked all her mocking humor gone because of the unsettling method of travel many velixar said his voice cold the sun will make this travel difficult but i will do what i can arthur must lose and jerico must be slain by darius if i am denied this he closed his eyes and began casting again taking in a breath valessa noticed how focused the prophet seemed how weak he appeared in the daylight she felt her dagger in her hand and looked to darius whose lifeless eyes stared into a world far from their own lead on she said smiling at the two of them as another portal tore into existence j erico marched beside kaide and bellok as they kept ahead of the wildfire behind them burned the bodies of both friend and foe for they could not spare the energy to carry them nor the time to bury them so in fire they went to their gods they come without horses jerico said nodding toward the approach of sir greganes vanguard then i am of no more use bellok said you have proven yourself to have a thousand uses kaide said smacking his friend on the shoulder dont discount yourself yet startling horses is a simple cantrip kaide we have no more firestones and i have gone too long without rest i doubt i could slay a rabbit if it sat still long enough for me to cast all around them marched the rest of the bandits few of whom jerico knew theyd lost a third when the horses came crashing in and would have lost far more if it hadnt been for bellok letting out whistle after strange whistle confusing the mounts and sending them crashing into each other jericos mace was caked with blood and he knew the killing was far from over what do we do he asked kaide as they marched we cannot hold lines against them the two of us may kill twenty thirty before going down but the rest i know kaide said keeping his voice low id hoped the fire would spread much faster but it seems the very weather turns against us but what choice do we have jerico eyed the forest knowing potential safety hid within we run he said your men lack armor and our chasers are burdened if we reach arthurs men we stand a chance sounds like the pally wants to be a coward said adam who had lurked behind them without saying anything to alert them to his presence who says we should be running asked griff beside him he grinned despite the wicked cut across his face which had slashed off a portion of his nose we run to a better location jerico said though his whole body ached he smiled and then we fight there kaide said pointing to a far portion of the forest well make it so long as gregane doesnt throw any soldiers our way to cut us off he does well crash right on through jerico said and with my shield leading the way give the order kaide the bandit leader looked to his men and he mustered one last bit of energy and bravado we run he shouted ignore those bastards and leave their clanking asses in our dust we go to meet with arthur with us at his side we can hold off soldiers from dawn to dusk and spill their blood a thousand times more than our own they cheered jerico led the way conditioned to run in his armor for long periods of time at first the vanguard tensed thinking them charging but then they saw the angle was wrong he heard them cry out and then the chase was on run jerico shouted when he could spare the breath hed put his shield onto his back but he pulled it off and stopped lifting it high so that the stragglers might see its light run my friends for the life of all you love run as its light shone over them they surged ahead with lifted spirits and refreshed legs jerico returned the shield to his back sparing a glance backward and wishing he hadnt the soldiers were less than a hundred yards behind and gaining ground kaides men had fought to their last breath to survive the initial charge of the knights unburdened or not they were tired and struggled to keep pace up ahead the forest seemed so very far away come jerico said grabbing one man by the arm and tugging him along one foot after another now move the man staggered more pulled than running jerico caught up to two more and he saw blood on them he admired their courage and was torn on what to do he grabbed the arm of a second knowing that the other he did not choose was doomed to death may ashhur take you he said the man had no anger in his eyes only fear and that look haunted jerico as he rushed along he saw one man stumble and he let go of the first and reached down to help the second up ahead kaide shouted for them to run but so many were tired and wounded jerico could do no more begging ashhur for his understanding he at last grabbed the arm of another injured man who collapsed flung him onto his back and ran when those around him fell behind or stumbled he left them to their fate to live or die by their own strength every time he saw it though he felt another stab in his gut they were almost to the forest when a squad of men finally noticed their approach they turned and formed a line what few shields they had taking up the front kaide shifted them further away and greganes troops hurried to match behind them the vanguard slowed both to fight the stragglers as well as catch their breath for as jerico had hoped they were more used to riding into battle and their heavy armor had finally taken its toll not that he felt that much better himself but despite that he shoved to the front where kaide ran with his dirks drawn crash through kaide said not even slowing that or death jerico said pulling his shield off his back he held it above his head letting friend and foe know his approach for ashhur he cried and it echoed across the gulch louder than even the fire the light of his shield flared and he slammed into the line blades clanked off his armor no one able to score a solid hit because of the light jerico twisted and swung smashing through while knocking over everyone near behind him the rest of the bandits surged forcing through the gap jerico remained like a wedge holding up a heavy stone even kaide hurried through but only after slashing open the throats of nearby soldiers to satisfy his bloodlust when at last sebastians troops recovered from the brutal assault jerico again turned to run he felt blows striking him and something sharp slashed against his face but he endured crying out the name of his god he slammed a man aside with his shield parried a chop and then reached open ground he ran until he found the ditch and just barely managed to slow himself so he didnt break his legs in the sudden drop he more rolled than climbed down then accepted adams waiting arms pulling him up how many jerico asked looking back half kaide said looking through the trees at where his friends fought and died jerico whispered them a prayer then fell to his knees to recover his breath theyll charge soon bellok said he leaned against a tree and he sounded winded from the run i say we get our asses out of here we dont run kaide said glaring at the remaining hundred men at his command not now not when victory still remains victory jerico muttered looking toward where arthurs men stood in defense far down the ditch he could only barely see them but they still looked terribly outnumbered you held off legions of wolfmen with mere villagers kaide said turning on him dont you lose hope on me now lift that damn shield of yours let my men see you still stand though his side ached and his legs felt on fire he stood and held his shield high none pass he shouted as loud as his tired lungs could manage not here not while my light still shines the men took up the call and they lifted their own weapons daring the soldiers to cross the ditch then greganes men let out a cry and the entire army did just that at their position kaides men were horribly outnumbered but unlike the rest of the battlefield the ditch before them remained empty that quickly changed jerico kept his shield low and swung smashing his mace through helmets and chestplates the ditch was deep enough that it came up to the assaulters waists and they had to abandon all pretense of attacking to climb the rest of the bandits kicked and shoved and they beat at hands and arms with their weapons body by body they filled the ditch too many jerico cried as he looked to the sides greganes men were spreading out going beyond where they could defend no shit kaide yelled back whirling beside him his two blades were coated with blood between dodging the chaotic swings hed dip low and knife a mans throat or plunge a dirk through an eye before continuing along jerico was far less fancy but just as efficient no man gained ground before him he shoved with his shield trusted his armor to protect his lower body and kept his mace moving side to side the screams of the dying grew jerico looked once to his left and saw enemy soldiers climbing up in less than a minute theyd be surrounded we cant hold he shouted to kaide as he slammed his shield to the ground the light momentarily blinding his attackers give the retreat kaide gritted his teeth and his attacks took on a new frenzy theyd been forced to fall back unable to hold the ditch any longer men climbed free and they stayed back defending the rest of their forces kaide slashed into them his blades finding every crease every gap in the armor jerico reminded himself to ask who trained him should they all survive but despite the fury there was no way he could turn the tide not by himself already he heard cries to their left of arthurs troops sounding the retreat the battle was lost go jerico shouted plunging into the gathered forces blows rained down upon him denting his armor and slashing cuts across his face he swung his shield in a high arc slamming away soldiers and then grabbed kaide by the shirt with all his might he flung the man away i said run he screamed as all around him the bandits died they needed no further orders not from kaide casting aside their weapons the remaining few fled kaide looked to jerico and he mouthed a promise the paladin could not hear amid the din then he turned and ran jerico brought his attention back to the soldiers who were cheering their victory most rushed to assault with many giving jerico a wide berth they wanted the fleeing men the ones lacking armor and weaponry twenty remained behind though surrounding jerico in a wide circle they were the furious the ones who had lost friends to his mace jerico braced himself his shield tucked against his body as he met their stares victory is yours he said no one else must die sebastian will want him prisoner one of the soldiers said though the rest murmured in disapproval none seemed ready to attack for everyone clearly knew the first to attack would die jerico kept shifting letting none see his back for long to the abyss with what sebastian wants said their leader who cast off his helmet so jerico could see his glare too many died at his feet drop your mace paladin and i will make it merciful jerico grinned ill die with my weapon in hand he said and only if you can best me the rest tensed the attack was soon to come and would begin with the first blow jerico prayed that ashhur would be kind and take him into his arms he braced for the cries of battle the cries came not of victory but pain fire burned a ring around him keeping him safe another blast of flame came in from outside the forest consuming many of the soldiers they turned to face their attacker as did jerico whose blood ran cold at what he saw approaching the forest was a man in the black robes of karak his deathly skin pale in the sunlight dim red eyes shone from beneath his hood which hid all but his bemused smile a woman was with them dressed in gray two dark paladins walked at his side one a stranger and one painfully familiar darius jerico whispered he is mine the man in black said pointing to the remaining soldiers go seek the spoils of your war elsewhere despite their fury at his magic the remaining men knew they could not challenge one who wielded fire with his bare hands they hurried on chasing after kaide jerico lifted his shield his eyes unable to leave darius the man had a starved look about him all traces of his good humor long vanished pain was evident in his eyes as he gave jerico a cold glare around jerico the fire spread setting trees aflame at his feet though the grass blackened and died but did not burn the heat was heavy but the smoke rose on the wind and the fire only burned outward paladin of ashhur shouted the pale man who seemed a priest karak has declared your life forfeit meet your executioner and then darius drew his sword at sight of the dark fire wreathed about its blade jerico felt his last vestige of hope die darius felt the eyes of everyone upon him as he stepped into the burning forest even karak seemed to watch him and he prayed he would not disappoint his faith was strong he would endure no matter that jerico looked to him with such betrayal and sadness that it rent a hole in his heart no matter that he felt fury at the entire circumstances thrusting them into such a battle only karaks will mattered and karaks desire was plain simple i will not ask for forgiveness darius said as he lifted his sword with both hands and adopted an offensive stance not for this you are to die jerico my god demands it for a brief moment the old jerico surfaced a halfsmile stretching at his face then tell him no darius grinned though he felt no humor not this time i have rejected him once and was rejected in turn not again you are a plague upon this world a false light that must be extinguished dezrel was not made in your image ashhurs hope is a hope of fools and peasants karak is truth the wretched the broken the selfish the weak they will burn in fire my fire he swung and it seemed his entire world slowed to a crawl his sword struck jericos shield two lights intertwining the dark and light bursting together in violent sparks that showered the ground darius felt a spike of pain from the contact but jerico felt it as well both staggered back breathing heavily i wont break jerico said repositioning his shield you know that i know youre a fool he swung again trying to shatter jerico as if he were a stone sword and shield connected and the shockwave of it echoed throughout the forest i know my faith is stronger i will break you i have no choice at his third swing jerico parried it aside with his mace and then lunged his shield leading darius screamed at the painful light never before had it made his eyes ache so he turned away and rolled avoiding a swing from the mace spinning on his knees he kicked to his feet stabbing jerico shifted to the side narrowly avoiding an impaling no choice jerico cried stepping back as darius swung wildly is that what you tell yourself you are no slave darius no puppet i was your friend damn it remember that friend darius asked as their weapons connected when jerico tried to shove forward with his shield darius was ready he pulled back and struck it with his blade the dark fire flaring they both felt the pain but darius knew his blows were raining down ever harder karaks strength flooding his veins the other paladin staggered deeper into the forest the red light of the fire shone upon them and in the glow darius felt himself returned to the abyss fulfilling his visions friend jerico gasped stumbling onto one knee before quickly standing i gave my life for you darius said i sacrificed everything even my faith for you and what do i find you leading a rebellion sowing chaos throughout the north at the side of bandits rebels i have suffered every day since cast off abandoned tortured and i see it was for nothing you worship a lie too long i accepted it treated you as an equal but youre not youre nothing and at last i see it friend jerico shook his head at last showing despair you cant believe that he said quietly by my actions my proof darius swung only to have jerico block the metal of his mace groaned but held jerico shoved it aside then shifted so his shield shone its light directly into his eyes darius fell back swinging wildly to keep the other paladin at bay where were you when i suffered in prison he cried where was ashhur when velixar took the lives of his faithful where were either of you as i butchered that family he has abandoned this world abandoned us all look at you last of his kind what lies can you offer what hope can you possibly believe in tell me why tell me why i wasnt stopped jerico remained back seemingly with no desire to go on the offensive the sadness on his face only grew with every word darius spoke and for whatever reason that infuriated him further darius stepped in and swung crying out the name of his god the fire on his blade consumed it fully and a word came to his lips its meaning unknown to him felholad he screamed the very metal of his blade vanished nothing but the burning will of his god it struck jericos shield with the sound of thunder bright light flared but dariuss fire sucked it in and defeated it jerico flew back several feet before hitting a tree his head smacking against it hard enough to leave a smear of blood he slumped to his knees remaining upright only by leaning his weight on his fists blood trickled down his neck and dripped to the scorched grass darius held his blade high clutching it with both hands as he towered over his defeated opponent karaks judgment he whispered stand with me jerico said and he looked up without any anger any malice only disappointment remember darius stand with me the words jerico had said during the fight against the wolfmen side by side theyd fought bled and been ready to die and so they had making their stand against the chaos of the world it didnt matter darius had failed to protect his charges that his lack of strength had doomed many jerico had understood and called him to fight without ever casting blame or judgment side by side the fire of his blade fueled by his hatred his anguish his certainty could no longer be sustained it dwindled away still bright but no longer the felholad it had become in that brief moment darius felt terrified to be once more alone abandoned a failure to the vision hed seen in that brief moment jerico lunged to his feet his mace swinging darius was too slow to block only partially deflecting the strike the mace struck the side of his head the flanged edges tearing into his skin blood spilled and he collapsed from the blow as his sight blurred his hands felt strange to him and the sword slipped to the ground tears in his eyes he saw the fire fade completely more than anything he felt alone on his knees he looked up at jerico who stood with the mace at ready do it he said kill me gods help me you dont know what ive done i can be this no longer jerico hesitated and for some reason that hesitation filled darius with fury i said do it he screamed coward ill not be judged instead jerico flung his mace to the ground shifted his shield onto his back and offered his hand darius stared at it unbelieving take it and stand said jerico why darius asked because i need to believe you arent lost to me otherwise i might as well throw down my shield and join you in death now stand darius felt velixars words searing through his mind he thought of the massacred villagers of the horrors at durham he felt guilt crushing him denied for so long by a certainty of faith he no longer held through it all one thing echoed over everything velixars own words now turned against him darius looked to jericos offered hand and a face containing no anger no blame only forgiveness what this world needs he whispered he took it and stood jerico embraced him and he laughed ashhur be praised he said grinning i thought you were going to take my head off i almost did together they looked through the fire to where velixar waited they could see the barest hint of the group so deep into the forest they had gone during their fight we have to run jerico said nodding the other way sebastians army will come back to find us soon no darius said glancing at his sword no running those out there know your name theyll hunt you forever and me as well let us end this now jerico touched the back of his head and he winced at the pain darius felt guilty for it but he laughed anyway and smacked jerico across the shoulder for whatever reason even at the prospect of facing down velixar he felt almost giddy he had always expected one of two fates to befall him either torturing in the abyss or being tortured somehow he had found a third fate and it was at jericos side if you say we must then we must jerico said readying his shield and mace lets go wait darius said unable to control his grin i have an idea v alessa felt disappointed to see darius emerge from the forest into daylight shed hoped the other paladin might kill him and as a failure hed go to karak to beg for mercy mercy he would not receive instead he walked with blood on his armor and his sword sheathed across his back karak be praised velixar said he is dead darius said nothing only walked silently toward the prophet something about the look in his eyes worried valessa so much that she found herself itching to draw her daggers he looked healthier relieved of course she thought hed defeated the burden placed upon him with jerico dead his reparations with karak were complete such a damn shame is he dead velixar asked again a note of worry in his voice as if he too noticed the change darius kept calm his face betraying nothing he moved between the three past velixar but the prophet reached out and grabbed him by the shoulder mallak tensed also sensing the strange feeling in the air darius velixar said draw your sword darius obeyed a hint of a smile finally showing on his lips he drew and valessa froze at the shock of what she saw blue light shone across the edges of the blade so stunned was she she could only watch as darius continued the smooth drawing motion into a swing right for velixars neck the sword cut cloth and struck the prophets pale skin for a moment it seemed it would do nothing but the blue light flared stronger and then the blade passed right on through velixars body burst into dust his eyes melted into fire he let out a single cry before he died a denial against failing a refusal to accept the death befalling him then he was silent betrayer mallak cried drawing his sword in time to block dariuss followup swing their blades connected showering sparks the dark fire wreathing mallaks sword was far greater and with ease he pushed darius back you will burn for eternity for such cowardice valessa could not believe her luck the damned prophet was gone and here was darius deserving every bit of pain she could deliver karak must have smiled upon her she watched as the two paladins exchanged swings with darius clearly the inferior in strength and passably equal in skill when she saw an opening his back completely to her she tensed her legs to lunge searing pain flooded her back before she could and then she found herself flying through the air tucking her shoulder she rolled then spun so she might dig her heels into the dirt to halt her momentum chasing after her was jerico with that damned shield of his worse he was apologizing sorry he said carefully approaching dont like attacking opponents unaware consider me aware she said twirling her daggers in her hands one opening just one opening he lifted his mace to strike and she went for it one blade jamming inward to lock his shield out of place the other thrusting for the gap in his armor at the armpit numbing pain jolted into her hand as her dagger hit the shield but she forced herself on her other dagger sliced into flesh and then she whirled avoiding the downward chop of his mace the paladin let out a cry and it was music to her ears continuing her spin she stayed close and her daggers stabbed for a crease just above his shoulder i have no problem stabbing a man in the back she said through clenched teeth as jericos body reacted on instinct arching his upper half toward her she twisted the dagger locking his right arm from striking at her with his mace how could you kill claire she asked still pressed tight against him you a slow dimwitted fool she was worlds beyond you because i have friends jerico ducked and dariuss elbow caught her full in the face her training kicked in and valessa rolled with it to minimize the damage leaving one of her two daggers still embedded in jericos shoulder when she returned to her feet the next few seconds were a jumbled blur her eyes watered from the hit and the throbbing in her head seemed to make everything a haze jerico fell to one side still bleeding instead of pressing the attack on her darius spun flinging his weapon up to block mallaks attack who was far from beaten mallak it seemed had tried to kill jerico while he lay helpless as valessa lunged to help jerico rolled to his knees and lifted his shield its light shone upon her and already weakened she struggled to push onward it felt as if her every movement was through ice water jerico met her ineffective attack with that damn shield of his her whole body pressed against it but she could only cry out in agony never before had she felt such pain valessa hit the ground her only conscious thought that of the ringing in her ears as if from someone elses body she watched the battle end jerico turned his shield back to mallak joining the traitor dariuss side mallak seemingly realizing he had to end the fight quickly now that he was outnumbered assaulted the wounded jerico with all his might the fire of his blade flared and he struck with awesome fury jericos shield weathered the blows though he cried out in pain all the while but darius was there and he took the opening before him valessa silently shrieked as the traitor thrust his blade through a crease in mallaks armor and then twisted the handle blood gushed from mallaks side and when he coughed more spilled across his lips and neck he fell help me valessa whispered struggling to stand it was as if her limbs had suddenly stopped taking orders please karak help me jerico fell to one knee and he screamed when darius yanked out the dagger she had lodged into his shoulder whatever satisfaction she might have felt meant nothing knowing he would survive so many dead and all their fault all their fault karak she breathed i am your darkness i am your shadow do not abandon me not now the two paladins turned their attention to her and there was no misunderstanding the look in dariuss eyes as he approached dont she heard jerico say and she felt fury at any false sympathy he might show darius refused to listen im sending her to her god said the traitor i know what she is what she is capable of the world is better this way i will hunt you valessa said to him even as tears welled in her eyes even to the abyss the traitor knelt beside her and he touched her face with a hand even as the other lifted his sword so the point rested against her throat i will never feel the abysss flames he said dont you see sister im karaks champion no longer darius cried jerico he hesitated and that was enough for her with the last of her strength she flung herself onto his blade the metal pierced flesh her whole body retched and then she felt fire burning j erico and darius stood over the bodies and they watched as valessas corpse was consumed by a dark fire ive never seen such a thing darius said watching until she was all but ash i think weve seen more than few firsts today jerico said and he grinned despite the pain and blood that trickled down the inside of his armor with his good arm he gestured to where greganes army had pushed into the forest in chase of lord arthurs men i think we should get out of here he said chuckling despite the pain it caused at some point theyre going to come back and i doubt theyll be happy with us where do we go darius asked as he came over to inspect his wounds later jerico said pushing him back ive survived worse and where should we go youre an outlaw now as much as i darius looked to the forest i spoke with sebastian he said ive seen how his mind works if arthur is alive we need to help him it only seems right given the mess i helped cause here in the north plenty my fault too jerico said and he leaned on darius to remain standing lets put greganes army far behind us i know a place we can hide epilogue you are certain sir robert godley asked as he leaned back in his wooden chair which creaked from his weight sure as i am of anything in this world said jeremy hangfield who stood with his hands clasped behind his back the chosen spokesmen for the people of durham and you have witnesses who will swear to this over a hundred jeremy said this was something well never forget well say it until our graves or the king brings us justice go robert said dismissing him i promise you an answer by tomorrow the man bowed and left robert to be alone with his most trusted friend daniel coldmine in his room in the blood tower this is bad daniel said i gathered as much no you dont understand daniel leaned on the desk with both hands and he looked out the window to the distant wildlands of the wedge a paladin of karak we cant make enemies with the stronghold you know damn well how favored his priests are in the capital but that many witnesses theyll mean nothing and you know it all their lives are a pile of shit in the eyes of anyone outside the north robert crossed his arms and forced himself to bite his tongue he knew there were good people in the capital but daniel was right given the current balance of power they would be making enemies of those who controlled the mind and heart of the king what is it you think i should do he asked bring him in for questioning daniel said turning to him play it safe either that or give him over to the stronghold and let them handle the matter robert scratched at his chin then shook his head no im tired of these games daniel the whole north is in chaos because of those two hemman brothers and the king already loathes my name hell leave me to settle this on my own and settle it i will i want proclamations given to every single village along the gihon and for them to send riders west until they reach the sea announcing the same the dark paladin known as darius shall be executed on sight without trial or capture offer the largest reward we can afford a hundred people watched him burn their village to the ground a village i helped save if hell destroy what all our good men died for then well destroy him and to the abyss with what the stronghold might think are those your orders daniel asked they are said robert and i expect them carried out daniel saluted youre thrusting fire at a hornets nest he said but ill trust you he left the room and once alone robert swore up a storm damn you darius he said slamming a fist against the top of his desk how could you do such a thing how he would receive no answers for he wanted none the entire north would descend upon him and if the world were just darius would receive the punishment he deserved and if karak had a problem with that im afraid of no gods robert said not ashhur not karak none of you he thought of the corpses strewn across durhams streets of what the strongholds reaction might be and then poured himself a drink to help make some truth of that statement valessa thought she went to her god to join her deity in the abyss but something was wrong the image of darius refused to fade fire burned across her flesh but she saw no darkness just the face of a man who had turned against everything she stood for her body felt strange full of pain but without any definitive source at last dariuss face broke like shards of glass and she saw darkness within that darkness a lion roared not yet she heard a voice say the words flooding her existence with cold terror and then she was plummeting downward feeling wind blasting against her hard enough to steal away her breath if she was still breathing when she hit she screamed and all at once her senses returned to her the world was dark and high above glittered a field of stars she felt no sensations of heat or cold all she felt was pain a constant ache from every part of her pale naked body looking about she realized she was beyond the gulch instead at the distant shrine where she had met karaks prophet when she took a step she fell forcing herself back to her feet she took another this time watching her naked body to see what betrayed her when she moved her body lost all color texture and became a swirl of shadow you have your most heartfelt desire that cold voice spoke once more find him kill him i will not wait for my prophets return to bring punishment to my most unfaithful servant as you wish valessa whispered to the stars near where she awoke she saw her daggers lying there as if calling out to her when she brought them into her hands they swirled with darkness and power thank you she prayed and she would have cried if her body remained capable of tears thank you so much her hearts greatest desire at her hands darius would die
