lois mcmaster bujold cetaganda chapter one now is it diplomacy is the art of war pursued by other men asked ivan or was it the other way around war is diplo all diplomacy is a continuation of war by other means miles intoned chou en lai twentieth century earth what are you a walking reference library no but commodore tung is he collects wise old chinese sayings and makes me memorize em so was old chou a diplomat or a warrior lieutenant miles vorkosigan thought it over i think he must have been a diplomat miless seat straps pressed against him as the attitude jets fired banking the personnel pod in which he and ivan sat across from each other in lonely splendor their two benches lined a short fuselage miles craned his neck for a glimpse past the pod pilots shoulder at the planet turning below them eta ceta iv the heart and homeworld of the sprawling cetagandan empire miles supposed eight developed planets and an equal fringe of allied and puppet dependencies qualified as a sprawl in any sane persons lexicon not that the cetagandan ghemlords wouldnt like to sprawl a little farther at their neighbors expense if they could well it didnt matter how huge they were they could only put military force through a wormhole jump one ship at a time just like everybody else it was just that some people had some damned big ships the colored fringe of night slid around the rim of the planet as the personnel pod continued to match orbits from the barrayaran imperial courier vessel they had just left to the cetagandan transfer station they were approaching the nightside glittered appallingly the continents were awash in a fairy dust of lights miles swore he might read by the glow of the civilization as if from a full moon his homeworld of barrayar seemed suddenly a dull vast swatch of rural darkness with only a few sparks of cities here and there eta cetas hightech embroidery was downright gaudy yes overdressed like a woman weighted down with too much jewelry tasteless he tried to convince himself i am not some backcountry hick i can handle this i am lord vorkosigan an officer and a nobleman of course so was lieutenant lord ivan vorpatril but the fact did not fill miles with confidence miles regarded his big cousin who was also craning his neck eyes avid and lips parted drinking in their destination below at least ivan looked the part of a diplomatic officer tall darkhaired neat an easy smile permanently plastered on his handsome face his fit form filled his officers undress greens to perfection miless mind slid with the greased ease of old bad habit to invidious comparison miless own uniforms had to be handtailored to fit and insofar as possible disguise the massive congenital defects that years of medical treatments had done so much to correct he was supposed to be grateful that the medicos had done so much with so little after a lifetime of it he stood fourfootnine hunchbacked and brittleboned but it beat being carried around in a bucket sure but he could stand and walk and run if need be leg braces and all and barrayaran imperial security didnt pay him to be pretty thank god they paid him to be smart still the morbid thought did creep in that he had been sent along on this upcoming circus to stand next to ivan and make him look good impsec certainly hadnt given him any more interesting missions unless you could call security chief illyans last curt and stay out of trouble a secret assignment on the other hand maybe ivan had been sent along to stand next to miles and make him sound good miles brightened slightly at the thought and there was the orbital transfer station coming up right on schedule not even diplomatic personnel dropped directly into eta cetas atmosphere it was considered bad etiquette likely to draw an admonition administered by plasma fire most civilized worlds had similar regulations miles conceded if only for purposes of preventing biological contaminations i wonder if the dowager empresss death was really natural miles asked idly ivan after all could hardly be expected to supply the answer it was sudden enough ivan shrugged she was a generation older than great uncle piotr and he was old since forever he used to unnerve the hell out of me when i was a kid its a nice paranoid theory but i dont think so illyan agrees with you im afraid or he wouldnt have let us come this could have been a lot less dull if it had been the cetagandan emperor whod dropped instead of some tottering little old hautlady but then we would not be here ivan pointed out logically wed both be on duty hunkering down in some defensive outpost right now while the princecandidates factions fought it out this is better travel wine women song its a state funeral ivan i can hope cant i anyway were just supposed to observe and report what or why i dont know illyan emphasized he expects the reports in writing ivan groaned how i spent my holiday by little ivan vorpatril age twentytwo its like being back in school miless own twentythird birthday would be following ivans soon if this tedious duty ran to schedule he should actually be back home in time for a celebration for a change a pleasant thought miless eyes glinted still it could be fun embroidering events for illyans entertainment why should official reports always have to be in that dead dry style because theyre generated by dead dry brains my cousin the frustrated dramatist dont get too carried away illyan has no sense of humor it would disqualify him for his job im not so sure miles watched as the pod wove through its assigned flight path the transfer station flowed past vast as a mountain complex as a circuit diagram it would have been interesting to meet the old lady when she was still alive she witnessed a lot of history in a century and a half if from an odd angle inside the hautlords seraglio lowlife outer barbarians like us would never have been let near her mm i suppose not the pod paused and a major cetagandan ship with the markings of one of the outplanet governments ghosted past on and on maneuvering its monstrous bulk to dock with exquisite care all the hautlord satrap governorsand their retinuesare supposed to be converging for this ill bet cetagandan imperial security is having fun right now if any two governors come i suppose the rest have to show up just to keep an eye on each other ivans brows rose should be quite a show ceremony as art hell the cetagandans make blowing your nose an art just so they can sneer at you if you get the moves wrong oneupmanship to the nth power its the one thing that convinces me that the cetagandan hautlords are still human after all that genetic tinkering ivan grimaced mutants on purpose are mutants still he glanced down at his cousins suddenly stiff form cleared his throat and tried to find something interesting to look at out the canopy youre so diplomatic ivan said miles through a tight smile try not to start a war single mouthed eh civil or otherwise ivan shrugged off his brief embarrassment the pod pilot a barrayaran techsergeant in black fatigues slid his little ship neatly into its assigned docking pocket the view outside shrank to blank dimness control lights blinked cheery greetings and servos whined as the flextube portals matched and locked miles snapped off his seat straps just a shade more slowly than ivan pretending disinterest or savoir faire or something no cetagandan was going to catch him with his nose pressed to the glass like some eager puppy he was a vorkosigan his heart beat faster anyway the barrayaran ambassador would be waiting to take his two highranking guests in hand and show them miles hoped how to go on miles mentally reviewed the correct greetings and salutations and the carefully memorized personal message from his father the pod lock cycled and the hatch on the side of the fuselage to the right of ivans seat dilated a man hurtled through swung himself to a sudden halt on the hatchs handlebar and stared at them with wide eyes breathing heavily his lips moved but whether in curses prayers or rehearsals miles wasnt sure he was elderly but not frail broadshouldered and at least as tall as ivan he wore what miles guessed was the uniform of a station employee cool gray and mauve fine white hair wisped over his scalp but he had no facial hair at all on his shiny skin neither beard nor eyebrows nor even down his hand flew to his left vest over his heart weapon miles yelled in warning the startled pod pilot was still snaking his way clear of his seat straps and miles was physically illequipped to jump anyone but ivans reflexes had been honed by plenty of training if not actual combat he was already moving rotating around his own handhold pointofcontact and into the intruders path handtohand combat in free fall was always incredibly awkward due in part to the necessity of having to hang on tightly to anybody one wanted to seriously hit the two men quickly ended up wrestling the intruder clutched wildly not at his vest but at his right trouser pocket but ivan managed to knock the glittering nerve disrupter from his hand the nerve disruptor tumbled away and whanged off the other side of the cabin now a random threat to everyone aboard miles had always been terrified of nerve disrupters but never before as a projectile weapon it took two more crosscabin ricochets for him to snatch it out of the air without accidentally shooting himself or ivan the weapon was undersized but charged and deadly ivan had meanwhile worked around behind the old man attempting to pinion his arms miles seized the moment to try to nail down the second weapon dragging open the mauve vest and going for that lump in the inner pocket his hand came away clutching a short rod that he first took for a shockstick the man screamed and wrenched violently greatly startled and not at all sure what hed just done miles launched himself away from the struggling pair and ducked prudently behind the pod pilot judging from that mortal yell miles was afraid hed just ripped out the power pack to the mans artificial heart or something but he continued to fight on so it couldnt have been as fatal as it sounded the intruder shook off ivans grip and recoiled to the hatchway there came one of those odd pauses that sometimes occur in close combat everyone gulping for breath in the rush of adrenaline the old man stared at miles with the rod in his fist his expression altered from fright towas that grimace a flash of triumph surely not demented inspiration outnumbered now as the pilot joined the fray the intruder retreated tumbling back out the flex tube and thumping to whatever docking bay deck lay beyond miles scrambled after ivans hot pursuit just in time to see the intruder now firmly on his feet in the stations artificial gravity field land ivan a blow to his chest with a booted foot that knocked the younger man backward into the portal again by the time miles and ivan had disentangled themselves and ivans gasping became less alarmingly disrupted the old man had vanished at a run his footsteps echoed confusingly in the bay which exit the pod pilot after a quick look to ensure that his passengers were temporarily safe hurried back inside to answer his comm alarm ivan regained his feet dusted himself off and stared around miles did too they were in a small dingy dimly lit freight bay yknow said ivan if that was the customs inspector were in trouble i thought he was about to draw on us said miles it looked like it you didnt see a weapon before you yelled it wasnt the weapon it was his eyes he looked like someone about to try something that scared him to death and he did draw after we jumped him who knows what he was about to do miles turned slowly on his heel taking in their surroundings in more detail there wasnt a human being in sight cetagandan barrayaran or other theres something very wrong here either he wasnt in the right place or we werent this musty dump cant be our docking port can it i mean wheres the barrayaran ambassador the honor guard the red carpet the dancing girls ivan sighed you know if hed been trying to assassinate you or hijack the pod he should have come charging in with that nerve disrupter already in his hand that was no customs inspector look at the monitors miles pointed two vidpickups mounted strategically on nearby walls were ripped from their moorings dangling sadly down he disabled them before he tried to board i dont understand station security should be swarming in here right now dyou think he wanted the pod and not us you boy no one would be after me he seemed more scared of us than we were of him miles concealed a deep breath hoping his heart rate would slow speak for yourself said ivan he sure scared me are you all right asked miles belatedly i mean no broken ribs or anything oh yeah ill survive you im all right ivan glanced down at the nerve disrupter in miless right hand and the rod in his left and wrinkled his nose howd you end up with all the weapons i dont quite know miles slipped the little nerve disrupter into his own trouser pocket and held the mysterious rod up to the light i thought at first this was some land of shockstick but its not its something electronic but i sure dont recognize the design a grenade ivan suggested a timebomb they can make them look like anything yknow i dont think so my lords the pod pilot stuck his head through the hatch station flight control is ordering us not to dock here theyre telling us to stand off and wait clearance immediately i thought we must be in the wrong place said ivan its the coordinates they gave me my lord said the pod pilot a little stiffly not your error sergeant im sure miles soothed flight control sounds very forceful the sergeants face was tense please my lords obediently miles and ivan shuffled back aboard the pod miles refastened his seat straps automatically his mind running on overdrive trying to construct an explanation for their bizarre welcome to cetaganda this section of the station must have been deliberately cleared of personnel he decided aloud ill bet you betan dollars cetagandan security is in process of conducting a sweepsearch for that fellow a fugitive by god thief murderer spy the possibilities enticed he was disguised anyway said ivan how do you know ivan picked a few fine white strands from his green sleeve this isnt real hair really said miles charmed he examined the clump of threads ivan extended across the aisle to him one end was sticky with adhesive huh the pod pilot finished taking up his new assigned coordinates the pod now floated in space a few hundred meters from the row of docking pockets there were no other pods locked onto the station for a dozen pockets in either direction ill report this incident to the station authorities shall i my lords the sergeant reached for his comm controls wait said miles my lord the pod pilot regarded him dubiously over his shoulder i think we should wait till they ask us after all were not in the business of cleaning up cetagandan securitys lapses after them are we its their problem a small grin immediately suppressed told miles the pilot was amenable to this argument yes sir he said making it an orderreceived and therefore miles s lordly officers responsibility and not that of a lowly techsergeant whatever you say sir miles muttered ivan what do you think youre doing observing said miles primly im going to observe and see how good cetagandan station security is at their job i think illyan would want to know dont you oh theyll be around to question us and take these goodies back but this way i can get more information in return relax ivan ivan settled back his disturbed air gradually dissipating as the minutes ticked on with no further interruptions to the boredom in the little pod miles examined his prizes the nerve disrupter was of some exceptionally fine cetagandan civilian make not military issue in itself odd the cetagandans did not encourage the dispersal of deadly antipersonnel weapons among their general populace but it did not bear the fancy decorations that would mark it as some ghemlords toy it was plain and functional of a size meant to be carried concealed the short rod was odder still embedded in its transparent casing was a violent glitter looking decorative miles was sure microscopic examination would reveal fine dense circuitry one end of the device was plain the other covered with a seal which was itself locked in place this looks like its meant to be inserted in something he said to ivan turning the rod in the light maybe its a dildo ivan smirked miles snorted with the ghemlords who can say but no i dont think so the indented seal on the endcap was in the shape of some clawed and dangerouslooking bird deep within the incised figure gleamed metallic lines the circuitconnections somewhere somebody owned the mate a raised screaming birdpattern full of complex encodes which would release the cover revealing what another pattern of encodes a key for a key it was all extraordinarily elegant miles smiled in sheer fascination ivan regarded him uneasily you are going to give it back arent you of course if they ask for it and if they dont keep it for a souvenir i suppose its too pretty to throw away maybe ill take it home as a present to illyan let his cipherlaboratory elves play with it as an exercise for about a year its not an amateurs bauble even i can tell that before ivan could come up with more objections miles undid his green tunic and slipped the device into his own inner breast pocket out of sight out of mind ahyou want to keep this he handed the nerve disrupter across to his cousin ivan plainly did placated by this division of the spoils ivan a partner in crime now made the little weapon disappear into his own tunic the weapons secret and sinister presence would do nicely miles calculated to keep ivan distracted and polite all through the upcoming disembarkation at last the station traffic control directed them to dock again they locked onto a pod pocket two up from the one they had been assigned before this time the door opened without incident after a slight hesitation ivan exited through the flex tube miles followed him six men awaited them in a gray chamber almost identical to the first one if cleaner and better lit miles recognized the barrayaran ambassador immediately lord vorobyev was a stout solid man of about sixtystandard sharpeyed smiling and contained he wore a vorobyev house uniform rather formal for the occasion miles thought winered with black trim he was flanked by four guards in barrayaran undress greens two cetagandan station officials in mauve and gray garb of similar style but more complex cut than the intruders stood slightly apart from the barrayarans only two stationers where were the civil police cetagandan military intelligence or at least some ghemfactions private agents where were the questions and the questioners miles had been anticipating dissecting instead he found himself greeting ambassador vorobyev as if nothing had happened just as hed first rehearsed vorobyev was a man of miles s fathers generation and in fact had been his appointee back when count vorkosigan had still been regent vorobyev had been holding down this critical post for six years having retired from his military career to take up imperial service on the civil side miles resisted an urge to salute and gave the ambassador a formal nod instead good afternoon lord vorobyev my father sends you his personal regards and these messages miles handed across the sealed diplomatic disk an act duly noted by a cetagandan official on his report panel six items of luggage the cetagandan inquiredwith a nod as the pod pilot finished stacking them on the waiting float pallet saluted miles and returned to his ship yes thats all said ivan to miless eye ivan looked stuffed and shifty intensely conscious of the contraband in his pocket but apparently the cetagandan official could not read his cousins expression as well as miles could the cetagandan waved a hand and the ambassador nodded to his guards two of them split off to accompany the luggage on its trip through cetagandan inspection the cetagandan resealed the docking port and bore off the floatpallet ivan anxiously watched it go will we get it all back eventually after some delays if things run true to form said vorobyev easily did you gentlemen have a good trip entirely uneventful said miles before ivan could speak until we got here is this a usual docking port for barrayaran visitors or were we redirected for some other reason he kept one eye on the remaining cetagandan official watching for a reaction vorobyev smiled sourly sending us through the service entrance is just a little game the cetagandans play with us to reaffirm our status you are correct it is a studied insult designed to distract our minds i stopped allowing it to distract me some years ago and i recommend you do the same the cetagandan displayed no reaction at all vorobyev was treating him with no more regard than a piece of furniture a compliment he apparently returned by acting like one it seemed to be a ritual thank you sir ill take your advice uh were you delayed too we were they cleared us to dock once and then sent us back out to cool the runaround today seems particularly ornate consider yourselves honored my lords come this way please ivan gave miles a pleading look as vorobyev turned away miles shook his head fractionally wait led by the expressionless cetagandan station official and flanked by the embassy guards the two young men accompanied vorobyev up several station levels the barrayaran embassys own planetary shuttle was docked to a genuine passenger lock it had a proper vip lounge with its own grav system in the flex tube so nobody had to float there they shed their cetagandan escort once on board the ambassador seemed to relax a little he settled miles and ivan in luxuriously padded seats arranged around a bolteddown comconsole table at vorobyevs nod a guard offered them drinks of choice while they waited for their luggage and departure clearances following vorobyevs lead they accepted a barrayaran wine of a particularly mellow vintage miles barely sipped hoping to keep his head clear while ivan and the ambassador made small talk about their trip and mutual vorish friends back home vorobyev seemed to be personally acquainted with ivans mother miles ignored ivans occasional raisedbrow silent invitation to join the chat and maybe tell lord vorobyev all about their little adventure with the intruder yes why hadnt the cetagandan authorities been all over them just now asking questions miles ran scenarios through his heated brain it was a setup and ive just taken the bait and theyre letting the line play out considering what he knew of cetagandans miles placed this possibility at the head of his list or maybe its just a time lag and theyll be here momentarily or eventually the fugitive must first be captured and then made to disgorge his version of the encounter this could take time particularly if the man had been say stunned unconscious during arrest if he was a fugitive if the station authorities had indeed been sweeping the docking area for him if miles studied his crystal cup and swallowed a mouthful of the smoky ruby liquid and smiled affably at ivan their luggage and its guards arrived just as they finished their drinks experienced timing on vorobyevs part miles judged when the ambassador rose to oversee its stowage and their departure ivan leaned across the table to whisper urgently to miles arent you going to tell him about it not yet why not are you in such a hurry to lose that nerve disrupter the embassyd take it away from you as fast as the cetagandans i bet screw that what are you up to im not sure yet this was not the scenario hed expected to unfold hed anticipated bandying sharp exchanges with assorted cetagandan authorities while they made him disgorge his prizes and trading for information consciously or unconsciously revealed it wasnt his fault the cetagandans werent doing their job weve got to at least report this to the embassys military attache report it yes but not to the attache illyan told me that if i had any problemsmeaning of the sort our department concerns itself withi was to go to lord vorreedi hes listed as a protocol officer but hes really an impsec colonel and chief of impsec here the cetagandans dont know of course they know just like we know whos really who at the cetagandan embassy in vorbarr sultana its a polite legal fiction dont worry ill see to it miles sighed inwardly he supposed the first thing the colonel would do was cut him out of the informationflow and he dared not explain why vorreedi shouldnt ivan sat back temporarily silenced only temporarily miles was sure vorobyev joined them again settling down and hunting his seat straps and thats that my lords nothing taken from your possessions nothing added welcome to eta ceta four there are no official ceremonies requiring your presence today but if youre not too tired from your journey the marilacan embassy is hosting an informal reception tonight for the legation community and all its august visitors i recommend it to your attention recommend said miles when someone with a career as long and distinguished as vorobyevs recommended miles felt one attended youll be seeing a lot of these people over the next two weeks vorobyev said it should provide a useful orientation what should we wear asked ivan four of the six cases theyd brought were his undress greens please said vorobyev clothing is a cultural language everywhere to be sure but here its practically a secret code it is difficult enough to move among the ghemlords without committing some defined error and among the hautlords its nearly impossible uniforms are always correct or if not exactly correct clearly not the wearers fault since he has no choice ill have my protocol office give you a list of which uniforms you are to wear at each event miles felt relieved ivan looked faintly disappointed with the usual muted clinks and clanks and hisses the flex tubes withdrew and the shuttle unlocked and undocked from the side of the station no arresting authorities had poured through the hatch no urgent communications had sent the ambassador hurrying forward miles considered his third scenario our intruder got clean away the station authorities know nothing of our little encounter in fact no one knows except of course the intruder miles kept his hand down and did not touch the concealed lump in his tunic whatever the device was that fellow knew miles had it and he could surely find out who miles was i have a string on you now if i let it play out something must surely climb back up it to my hand right this could shape up into a nice little exercise in intelligencecounterintelligence better than maneuvers because it was real no proctor with a list of answers lurked on the fringes recording all his mistakes for later analysis in excruciating detail a practicepiece at some stage of development an officer had to stop following orders and start generating them and miles wanted that promotion to impsec captain oh yes might he somehow persuade vorreedi to let him play with the puzzle despite his diplomatic duties miless eyes narrowed with new anticipation as they began their descent into the murky atmosphere of eta ceta chapter two halfdressed miles wandered across the spacious bedchambersitting room the barrayaran embassy had assigned to him turning the glittering rod in his hand so if im meant to have this am i meant to stash it here or am i meant to carry it on my person ivan neat and complete in the highcollared tunic sidepiped trousers and halfboots of fresh undress greens rolled his eyes ceilingward will you quit fooling with that thing and get dressed before you make us late maybe its a fancy curtainweight and its meant to drive you crazy trying to assign it some deep and sinister significance or drive me crazy listening to you some ghemlords practical joke a particularly subtle practical joke if so doesnt rule it out ivan shrugged no miles frowned and limped to the comconsole desk he opened the top drawer and found a stylus and a pad of plastic flimsies embossed with the embassy seal he tore off a flimsy and pressed it against the birdfigure on the rods caplock then traced the indentations with the stylus a quick accurate and toscale sketch after a moments hesitation he left the rod in the drawer with the pad of flimsies and closed it again not much of a hiding place ivan commented if its a bomb maybe you ought to hang it out the window for the rest of our sakes if not your own its not a bomb dammit and ive thought of a hundred hiding places but none of them are scannerproof so theres no point this should be in a leadlined blackbox which i dont happen to have i bet they have one downstairs ivan said werent you going to confess yes but unfortunately lord vorreedi is out of the city dont look at me like that i had nothing to do with it vorobyev told me the hautlord in charge of one of the eta cetan jumppoint stations has impounded a barrayaranregistered merchant ship and its captain for importation infractions smuggling said ivan growing interested no some complicated cockeyed cetagandan regulations with fees and taxes and fines and a level of acrimony thats going asymptotic since normalizing trade relations is a current goal of our government and since vorreedi is apparently good at sorting out hautlords and ghemlords vorobyev detailed him to take care of it while hes stuck here with the ceremonial duties vorreedi will be back tomorrow or the next day meanwhile it wont hurt to see how far i can get on my own if nothing interesting turns up ill bounce it over to the impsec office here anyway ivans eyes narrowed as he processed this yeah so what if something interesting does turn up well then too of course so did you tell vorobyev not exactly no look illyan said vorreedi so vorreedi it is ill take care of it as soon as the man gets back in any case its time ivan reiterated yeah yeah miles shuffled over to his bed sat and frowned at his leg braces laid out waiting i have to take the time to get my leg bones replaced ive given up on the organics its time to go with plastic maybe i could persuade them to add a few centimeters of length while theyre at it if only id known i had all this dead time coming up i could have scheduled surgery and been recovering while we traveled and stood around being decorative inconsiderate of the dowager empress not to send you a note and warn you she was dropping dead ivan agreed wear the damn things or aunt cordelia will hold me responsible if you trip over the embassy cat and break your legs again miles growled not very loudly ivan could read him entirely too well too he closed the cool steel protection around his lumpy discolored toomanytimes smashed legs at least the uniform trousers concealed his weakness he fastened his tunic sealed the polished shortboots checked his hair in the mirror over his dresser and followed the impatient ivan already at the door in passing he slipped the folded flimsy into his trouser pocket and paused in the corridor to rekey the door lock to his own palm a somewhat futile gesture as a trained impsec agent lieutenant vorkosigan knew exactly how insecure palm locks could be despite or perhaps because of ivans prodding they arrived in the foyer at almost the same moment as ambassador vorobyev vorobyev was wearing his red and black house uniform again not a man who liked making a lot of decisions about clothing miles sensed he shepherded the two younger men into the embassys waiting groundcar where they sank into soft upholstery vorobyev politely took the rearfacing seat across from his official guests a driver and a guard occupied the front compartment the car ran on the city nets computer control but the alert driver sat ready to hit the manual override in case of some nonnatural emergency the silvered canopies closed and they oozed out into the street you may regard the marilacan embassy as neutral but nonsecured territory tonight gentlemen vorobyev advised them enjoy yourselves but not too much will there be many cetagandans present miles asked or is this party strictly for us offworlders no hautlords of course said vorobyev theyre all at one of the late empresss more private obsequies tonight along with some of the highestranking ghemclan heads the lowerranking ghemlords are at loose ends and may be out in force as the month of official mourning has reduced their usual social opportunities the marilacans have been accepting a great deal of cetagandan aid in the past few years a greediness i predict they will come to regret they think cetaganda wont attack an ally the groundcar climbed a ramp and swung around a corner offering a brief vista down a glittering canyon of high buildings strung together with tubeways and transparent walks glowing in the dusk the city seemed to go on forever and this wasnt even the main center the marilacans arent paying sufficient attention to their own wormhole nexus maps vorobyev went on they imagine they are at a natural border but if marilac were directly held by cetaganda the next jump would bring them to zoave twilight with all its crossroutes and a whole new region for cetagandan expansion marilac is in exactly the same relationship to the zoave twilight crossings as vervain is to the hegen hub and we all know what happened there vorobyevs lips twisted in irony but marilac has no interested neighbor to mount a rescue as your father did for vervain lord vorkosigan and provocative incidents can be manufactured so easily the alert rush in miless chest faded there was no personal secret meaning in vorobyevs remarks everyone knew of admiral count aral vorkosigans political and military role in creating the swift alliance and counterattack that had driven off the attempted cetagandan capture of its neighbor vervain s wormhole jumps to the hegen hub no one knew of the role impsec agent miles vorkosigan had played in bringing the admiral to the hegen hub in so timely a fashion and what no one knew no one got credit for hi im a hero but i cant tell you why its classified from vorobyevs and practically everybody elses point of view lieutenant miles vorkosigan was a lowranking impsec courier officer a nepotistic sinecure that shuffled him off into routine duties that took him out of the way mutant i thought the hegen alliance gave the ghemlords a bloody enough nose at vervain to keep them subdued for a while said miles all the expansionist party ghemofficers in deep eclipse ghemgeneral estanis committing suicideit was suicide wasnt it in an involuntary sort of way said vorobyev these cetagandan political suicides can get awfully messy when the principal wont cooperate thirtytwo stab wounds in the back worst case of suicide they ever saw murmured ivan clearly fascinated by the gossip exactly my lord vorobyevs eyes narrowed in dry amusement but the ghemcommanders loose and shifting relationship to the assorted secret hautlord factions lends an unusual degree of deniability to their operations the vervain invasion is now officially described as an unauthorized misadventure the erring officers have been corrected thank you what do they call the cetagandan invasion of barrayar in my grandfathers time miles asked a reconnaissance in force when they mention it at all yes all twenty years of it asked ivan halflaughing they tend not to go into the embarrassing details have you shared your views on cetagandan ambitions toward marilac with illyan miles asked yes we keep your chief fully informed but there are no material movements at present to support my theory im just reasoning on principle so far impsec is watching some key indicators for us im not in that loop said miles needtoknow and all that but i trust you grasp the larger strategic picture oh yes andupperclass gossip is not always as guarded as it should be you two will be in a position to encounter some plan to report it all to my chief of protocol colonel vorreedi he will be giving you daily briefings as soon as he returns let him sort out which tidbits are important check miles nodded to ivan who shrugged acquiescence and ah try not to give away more than you gain well im safe said ivan i dont know anything he smiled cheerily miles tried not to wince nor mutter we know ivan under his breath loud enough to be heard since the offplanet legations were concentrated in one section of eta cetas capital city the drive was short the groundcar descended a streetlevel and slowed it entered the marilacan embassy buildings garage and pulled into a brightly lit entry foyer made less subterranean by marble surfaces and decorative plants trailing from tiers of tubs the cars canopy rose marilacan embassy guards bowed the barrayaran party into the lift tubes doubtless they also discreetly scanned their guestsit seemed ivan had mustered the good sense to leave that nerve disruptor in his desk drawer too they exited the lift tube into a wide lobby opening in turn onto several levels of connected public areas already well populated with guests the volume of their babble invitingly high the center of the lobby was occupied by a large multimedia sculpture real not a projection trickling water cascaded down a fountain reminiscent of a little mountain complete with impressionistic mountainpaths one could actually walk upon colored flakes swirled in the air around the minimaze making delicate tunnels from their green color miles guessed they were meant to represent earth tree leaves even before he drew close enough to make out the realistic details of their shapes the colors slowly began to change from twenty different greens to brilliant yellows golds reds and blackreds as they swirled they almost seemed to form fleeting patterns like human faces and bodies to a background of tinkling like wind chimes so was it meant to be faces and music or was it just tricking his brain into projecting meaningful patterns onto randomness the subtle uncertainty attracted him thats new commented vorobyev his eye also caught pretty ah good evening ambassador bernaux good evening lord vorobyev their silverhaired marilacan host exchanged a familiar nod with his barrayaran counterpart yes we think its rather fine its a gift from a local ghemlord quite an honor its titled autumn leaves my cipher staff puzzled over the name for half a day and finally decided it meant autumn leaves the two men laughed ivan smiled uncertainly not quite following the injoke vorobyev formally introduced them to ambassador bernaux who responded to their rank with elaborate courtesy and to their age by telling them where to find the food and pointedly turning them loose it was the ivaneffect miles decided glumly they mounted stairs toward a buffet cut off from getting to hear whatever private comments the two older men went on to exchange probably just social pleasantries but still miles and ivan sampled the hors doeuvres which were dainty but abundant and selected drinks ivan chose a famous marilacan wine miles conscious of the flimsy in his pocket chose black coffee they abandoned each other with a silent wave each to circulate after his own fashion miles leaned on the railing overlooking the lifttube lobby he sipped from the fragile cup and wondered where its staywarm circuit was concealedah there on the bottom woven into the metallic glitter of the marilacan embassy seal autumn leaves was chilling down to the end of its cycle the water in the trickling fountains froze or appeared to stilled to silent black ice the swirling colors faded to the sere yellow and silvergray of a winter sunset the figures if figures they were now suggesting skeletal despair the chimemusic faded to discordant broken whispers it was not a winter of snow and celebration it was a winter of death miles shivered involuntarily damned effective so how to begin asking questions without revealing anything in return he pictured himself buttonholing some ghemlord say did one of your minions lose a codekey with a seal like this no by far the best approach was to let his adversaries find him but they were being tediously slow about it miless eye swept the throng for men without eyebrows without success but ivan had found a beautiful woman already miles blinked as he registered just how beautiful she was tall and slim the skin of her face and hands as delicately smooth as porcelain jeweled bands bound her blondwhite hair loosely at the nape of her neck and again at her waist the hair did not trail to its silky end until halfway to her knees her dress concealed rather than revealed with layers of underslips split sleeves and vests sweeping to her ankles the dark hues of the overgarments set off the pallor of her complexion and a flash of cerulean silk underneath echoed her blue eyes she was a cetagandan ghemlady without questionshe had that attenuatedelf look that suggested more than a tinge of hautlord genes in her family tree true the look could be mimicked with surgeries and other therapies but the arrogant arch to her brow had to be genuine miles sensed the pheromones in her perfume while still spiraling in from three meters away it seemed redundant ivan was already on overdrive his dark eyes sparkling as he decanted some story featuring himself as hero or at least protagonist something about training exercises ah of course emphasizing his barrayaran martial style venus and mars right but she was actually smiling at something ivan had said it wasnt that miles enviously sought to deny ivan his luck with women it would simply be nice if some of the overflow would trickle down his way though ivan claimed you had to make your own luck ivans resilient ego could absorb a dozen rejections tonight for some smiling thirteenth payoff miles thought he would be dead of mortification by attempt three maybe he was naturally monogamous hell you had to at least achieve monogamy before you could go on to larger ambitions so far he had failed to attach even one woman to his sawedoff person of course nearly three years in covert ops and the period before that in the allmale environs of the military academy had limited his opportunities nice theory so why hadnt similar conditions stopped ivan elena was he still holding out for the impossible on some level miles swore he wasnt nearly as choosy as ivanhe could hardly afford to beyet even this lovely ghemblonde lacked what the intelligence the reserve the pilgrim soul but elena had chosen another and probably wisely time and past time for miles to move on too and carve out some luck of his own he just wished the prospect didnt feel so bleak spiraling in from the other side a moment or two after miles came a cetagandan ghemlord tall and lean the face rising up out of his dark and flowing robes was young the fellow was not much older than ivan and himself miles guessed he was squareskulled with prominent round cheekbones one cheekbone was decorated with a circular patch a decal miles realized a stylized swirl of color identifying the mans rank and clan it was a shrunken version of the full face paint a few other cetagandans present wore an avantgarde youth fashion currently being disapproved of by the older generation was he come to rescue his lady from ivans attentions lady gelle he bowed slightly and lord yenaro she responded with a precisely graded inclination of her head by which miles gathered that she had a higher status in the ghemcommunity than the man and he was not her husband or brotherivan was probably safe i see you have found some of the galactic exotics you were longing for said lord yenaro to her she smiled back at him the effect was downright blinding and miles found himself wishing shed smile at him even though he knew better lord yenaro doubtless inoculated by a lifetime of exposure to ghemladies seemed immune lord yenaro this is lieutenant lord ivan vorpatril of barrayar and ah her lashes swept down over her eyes indicating ivan should introduce miles a gesture as sharp and evocative as if shed tapped ivans wrist with a fan my cousin lieutenant lord miles vorkosigan ivan supplied smoothly on cue ah the barrayaran envoys lord yenaro bowed more deeply what luck to meet you miles and ivan both returned decent nods miles made sure the inclination of his head was slightly shallower than his cousins a fine gradation alas probably spoiled by the angle of view we have an historical connection lord vorkosigan yenaro went on famous ancestors miless adrenaline level shot up oh damn this is some relative of the late ghemgeneral estanis and hes out to get the son of aral vorkosigan you are the grandson of general count piotr vorkosigan are you not ah ancient history not recent miles relaxed slightly indeed i am in a sense your opposite number then my grandfather was ghemgeneral yenaro oh the unfortunate commander of the uh what do you folks call it the barrayaran expedition the barrayaran reconnaissance ivan put in the ghemgeneral who lost the barrayaran war yenaro said bluntly really yenaro must you bring him up said lady gelle did she actually want to hear the end of ivans story miles could have told her a much funnier one about the time on training maneuvers when ivan had led his patrol into gluey waistdeep mud and theyd all had to be winched out by hovercar i am not a proponent of the herotheory of disaster miles said diplomatically general yenaro had the misfortune to be the last of five successive ghemgenerals who lost the barrayaran war and thus the sole inheritor of a as it were tontine of blame oh well put murmured ivan yenaro too smiled do i understand that thing in the lobby is yours yenaro the girl inquired clearly hoping to steer the conversation away from a fast downslide into military history a trifle banal for your crowd isnt it my mother liked it it is but a practice piece a slightly ironic bow acknowledged this mixed review the marilacans were delighted with it true courtesy considers the tastes of the recipient it has some levels of subtlety only apparent when you walk through it i thought you were specializing in the incense contests im branching out into other media though i still maintain scent is a subtler sense than sight you must let me mix for you sometime that civetjasmine blend youre wearing tonight absolutely clashes with the thirdlevel formal style of your dress you know her smile went thin does it miless imagination supplied background music a scrape of rapiers and a take that varlet he tamped down a grin beautiful dress ivan put in earnestly you smell great mm yes speaking of your craving for the exotic lord yenaro said to lady gelle did you know that lord vorpatril here is a biological birth the girls featherfaint brows drew in making a tiny crease in her flawless forehead all births are biological yenaro ah but no the original sort of biology from his mothers body eeeuu her nose wrinkled in horror really yenaro you are so obnoxious tonight mother is right you and your retroavant crowd are going to go too far one of these days you are in danger of becoming someone not to know instead of someone famous her distaste was directed at yenaro but she shifted farther from ivan miles noticed when fame eludes notoriety may serve said yenaro shrugging i was a replicator birth miles thought of putting in brightly but didnt just goes to show you can never tell except for the brain damage ivan had better luck than i good evening lord yenaro she tossed her head and moved off ivan looked dismayed pretty girl but her mind is so unformed murmured yenaro as if to explain why they were better off without her company but he looked uncomfortable so uh you chose an artistic career over a military one did you lord yenaro miles tried to fill the breach career lord yenaros mouth quirked no i am an amateur of course commercial considerations are the death of true taste but i hope to achieve some small stature in my own way miles trusted that last wasnt a double entendre of some sort they followed lord yenaros gaze over the rail and down into the lobby at his fountainthing gurgling there you absolutely should come see it from the inside you know the view is entirely altered yenaro was really a rather awkward man miles decided his prickly exterior barely shielding a quiveringly vulnerable artistes ego sure he found himself saying yenaro needed no further encouragement and smiling anxiously led them toward the stairs beginning to explain some thematic theory the sculpture was supposed to be displaying miles sighted ambassador vorobyev beckoning to him from the far side of the balcony excuse me lord yenaro ivan you go on ill catch up with you oh yenaro looked momentarily crushed ivan watched miles escape with a light of ire in his eye that promised later retribution vorobyev was standing with a woman her hand familiarly upon his arm she was about fortystandard miles guessed with naturally attractive features free of artificial sculptural enhancement her long dress and robes were styled after the cetagandan fashion though much simpler in detail than lady gelles she was no cetagandan but the dark red and cream colors and green accents of her garments worked as cleverly with her olive skin and dark curls there you are lord vorkosigan said vorobyev ive promised to introduce you this is mia maz who works for our good friends at the vervani embassy and who has helped us out from time to time i recommend her to you miles snapped to attention at the key phrase smiled and bowed to the vervani woman pleased to meet you and what do you do at the vervani embassy maam im assistant chief of protocol i specialize in womens etiquette thats a separate specialty it is here or should be ive been telling ambassador vorobyev for years that he ought to add a woman to his staff for that purpose but we havent any with the necessary experience sighed vorobyev and you wont let me hire you away though i have tried so start one without experience and let her gain it miles suggested would milady maz consider taking on an apprentice now theres an idea vorobyev looked much struck mazs brows rose approvingly maz we should discuss this but i must speak to wilstar whom i see just hitting the buffet over there if im lucky i can catch him with his mouth full excuse me his mission of introduction accomplished vorobyev fadedhow elsediplomatically away maz turned her whole attention gratefully upon miles anyway lord vorkosigan i wanted to let you know that if theres anything we at the vervani embassy can do for the son or the nephew of admiral aral vorkosigan during your visit to eta ceta well all that we have is at your disposal miles smiled dont make that offer to ivan he might take you up on it personally the woman followed his glance down over the railing to where his tall cousin was now being guided through the sculpture by lord yenaro she grinned impishly making a dimple wink in her cheek not a problem so are uh ghemladies really so different from ghemlords as to make a fulltime study i admit most barrayarans views of the ghemlords have been through rangefinders two years ago i would have scorned that militaristic view since the cetagandan invasion attempt weve come to appreciate it actually the ghemlords are so much like the vor id think youd find them more comprehensible than we vervani do the hautlords are something else and the hautladies are even more something else ive begun to realize the hautlords women are so thoroughly sequestered do they ever do anything i mean nobody ever sees them do they they have no power they have their own sort of power their own areas of control parallel not competing with their men it all makes sense they just never bother explaining it to outsiders to inferiors that too her dimple flashed again so are you well up on ghem and hautlord seals crests marks that sort of thing i can recognize about fifty clanmarks by sight and all the military insignia and corps crests of course but i know that just scratches the surface im fairly well up they have layers within layers i cant claim to know them all by any means miles frowned thoughtfully then decided to seize the moment there was nothing else going on here tonight that was certain he drew the flimsy from his pocket and flattened it out against the railing do you know this icon i ran across it well in an odd place but it smelled ghemish or hautish if you know what i mean she gazed with interest at the screamingbird outline i dont recognize it right off but youre correct its definitely in the cetagandan style its old though how can you tell well its clearly a personal seal not a clanmark but it doesnt have an outline around it for the last three generations people have been putting their personal marks in cartouches with more and more elaborate borders you can practically tell the decade by the border design huh if you like i can try to look it up in my resource materials would you id like that very much he folded the flimsy back up and handed it to her uh id appreciate it if you wouldnt show it to anyone else though oh she let the syllable hang there oh excuse me professional paranoia i uh he was getting in deeper and deeper its a habit he was rescued from tripping further over his tongue by the return of ivan ivans practiced eye summed up the attractions of the vervani woman instantly and he smiled attentively at her as sincerely delighted as he had been with the last girl and would be with the next and the next the ghemlord artiste was still glued to his elbow miles perforce introduced them both maz seemed not to have met lord yenaro before in front of the cetagandan maz did not repeat to ivan her message of boundless vervani gratitude to the vorkosigan clan but she was definitely friendly you really ought to let lord yenaro take you on the tour of his sculpture miles ivan said ruthlessly its quite a thing an opportunity not to be missed and all that i found her first dammit yes its very fine would you be interested lord vorkosigan yenaro looked earnest and hopeful ivan bent to miless ear to whisper it was lord yenaros gift to the marilacan embassy dont be a lout miles you know how sensitive the cetagandans are about their artsy uh things miles sighed and mustered an interested smile for yenaro certainly now miles excused himself with unfeigned regrets to maz the vervani the ghemlordling led him down the stairs to the lobby and had him pause at the entrance of the walkthrough sculpture to wait for the showcycle to begin anew im not really qualified to judge aesthetics miles mentioned hoping to head off any conversation in that direction so very few are smiled yenaro but that doesnt stop them it does seem to me to be a very considerable technical achievement do you drive the motion with antigrav then no theres no antigrav in it at all the generators would be bulky and wasteful of power the same force drives the leaves motion as drives their color changesor so my technicians explained it to me technicians i somehow pictured you putting all this together with your own hands yenaro spread his handspale longfingered and thinand stared at them as if surprised to find them on the ends of his wrists of course not hands are to be hired design is the test of the intellect i must disagree in my experience hands are integral with brains almost another lobe for intelligence what one does not know through ones hands one does not truly know you are a man capable of true conversation i perceive you must meet my friends if your schedule here permits im hosting a reception at my home in two evenings timedo you suppose um maybe that evening was a blank as far as the funeral formalities went it could be quite interesting a chance to observe how the ghemlordlings of his own generation operated without the inhibitions of their elders a glimpse into the future of cetaganda yes why not ill send you directions oh yenaro nodded toward the fountain which was starting up with its highcanopied summer greens again now we can go in miles did not find the view from inside the fountainmaze all that much different from the outside in fact it seemed less interesting as at close range the illusion of forms in the flitting leaves was reduced the music was clearer though it rose to a crescendo as the colors began to change now youll see something said yenaro with evident satisfaction it was all sufficiently distracting that it took another moment for miles to realize that he was feeling somethingtingling and heat coming from his leg braces lying against his skin he schooled himself not to react till the heat began to rise yenaro was babbling on with artistic enthusiasm pointing out effects now watch this brilliant colors swirled before miless eyes a distinct sensation of scalding flesh crept up his legs miles muffled his scream to a lessedged yell and managed not to jump for the water god knew he might be electrocuted the few seconds it took him to pelt out of the maze brought the steel of his braces to a temperature sufficient to boil water he gave up dignity dove for the floor and yanked up his trouser legs his first snatch at the clamps burned his hands too he swore eyes watering and tried again he tore off his boots snapped loose the braces and flung them aside with a clatter and curled up momentarily in overwhelming pain the braces had left a pattern of rising white welts surrounded by an angry red border of flesh on shin knees and ankles yenaro was flapping about in distress calling loudly for help miles looked up to find himself the center of an audience of about fifty or so shocked and bewildered people witnessing his display he stopped writhing and swearing and sat panting his breath hissing through clenched teeth ivan and vorobyev shouldered through the mob from different directions lord vorkosigan what has happened asked vorobyev urgently im all right said miles he was not all right but this was not the time or place to go into details he pulled his trouser legs quickly back down concealing the burns yenaro was yammering on in dismay what happened i had no ideaare you all right lord vorkosigan oh dear ivan bent and prodded at a cooling brace yes what the hell miles considered the sequence of sensations and their possible causes not antigrav not noticeable to anyone else and it had slid right past marilacan embassy security hidden in plain sight right i think it was some sort of electrohysteresis effect the colorchanges in the display are apparently driven by a reversing magnetic field at low level no problem for most people for me well it wasnt quite as bad as shoving my leg braces into a microwave butyou get the idea grinning he got to his feet ivan looking very worried had already collected his flung boots and the offending braces miles let him keep them he didnt want to touch them just now he blundered rather blindly closer to ivan and muttered under his breath get me out of here he was shivering and shocky as ivans hand on his shoulder could sense ivan gave him a short understanding nod and swiftly withdrew through the crowd of finely dressed men and women some of whom were already turning away ambassador bernaux hurried up and added his worried apologies to yenaros oneman chorus do you wish to stop in to the embassy infirmary lord vorkosigan bernaux offered no thank you ill wait till we get home thanks soon please bernaux bit his lip and regarded the stillapologizing lord yenaro lord yenaro im afraid yes yes turn it off at once said yenaro i will send my servants to remove it immediately i had no ideaeveryone else seemed to be enjoyingit must be redesigned or destroyed yes destroyed at once i am so sorrythis is so embarrassing yes isnt it thought miles a show of his physical weakness displayed to a maximum audience at the earliest possible moment no no dont destroy it said ambassador bernaux horrified but we certainly must have it examined by a safety engineer and modified or perhaps a warning posted ivan reappeared at the edge of the dispersing crowd and gave miles a thumbsup signal after a few more minutes of excruciating social niceties vorobyev and ivan managed to get him escorted back down the lift tube to the waiting barrayaran embassy groundcar miles flung himself into the upholstery and sat grinning in pain breath shallow ivan eyed his shivering form skinned out of his tunic and tucked it around miless shoulders miles let him all right lets see the damages demanded ivan he propped one of miless heels on his knee and rolled back the trouser leg damn thats got to hurt quite agreed miles thinly it could hardly have been an assassination attempt though said vorobyev his lips compressed with calculation no agreed miles bernaux told me he had his own security people examine the sculpture before they installed it looking for bombs and bugs of course but they cleared it im sure they did this could not have hurt anyone but me vorobyev followed his reasoning without effort a trap awfully elaborate if so noted ivan im not sure said milesim meant to be notsure thats the beauty of it it had to have taken days maybe weeks of preparation we didnt even know we were coming here till two weeks ago when did it arrive at the marilacan embassy last night according to bernaux vorobyev said before we even arrived before our little encounter with the man with no eyebrows it cant possibly be connectedcan it how long have we been scheduled for that party the embassies arranged the invitations about three days ago said vorobyev the timing is awfully tight for a conspiracy ivan observed vorobyev thought it over i think i must agree with you lord vorpatril shall we put it down as an unfortunate accident then provisionally said miles that was no accident i was set up me personally you know theres a war on when the opening salvo arrives except that usually one knew why a war had been declared it was all very well to swear not to be blindsided again but who was the enemy here lord yenaro i bet you throw a fascinating party i wouldnt miss it for worlds chapter three the proper name for the cetagandan imperial residence is the celestial garden said vorobyev but all the galactics just call it xanadu youll see why in a moment duvi take the scenic approach yes my lord returned the young sergeant who was driving he altered the control program the barrayaran embassy aircar banked and shot through a shining stalagmite array of city towers gently if you please duvi my stomach at this hour of the morning yes my lord regretfully the driver slowed them to a saner pace they dipped wove around a building that miles estimated must have been a kilometer high and rose again the horizon dropped away whoa said ivan thats the biggest force dome ive ever seen i didnt know they could expand them to that size it absorbs the output of an entire generating plant said vorobyev for the dome alone another for the interior a flattened opalescent bubble six kilometers across reflected the late morning sun of eta ceta it lay in the midst of the city like a vast egg in a bowl a pearl beyond price it was ringed first by a kilometerwide park with trees then by a street reflecting silver then by another park then by an ordinary street thick with traffic from this eight wide boulevards fanned out like the spokes of a wheel centering the city centering the universe miles gained the impression the effect was doubtless intended the ceremony today is in some measure a dress rehearsal for the final one in a week and a half vorobyev went on since absolutely everyone will be there ghemlords hautlords galactics and all there will likely be organizational delays as long as theyre not on our part i spent a week of hard negotiating to get you your official rankings and place in this which is said miles you two will be placed equivalently to secondorder ghemlords vorobyev shrugged it was the best i could do in the mob though toward the front of it the better to watch without being much noticed himself miles supposed today that seemed like a good idea all three of them vorobyev ivan and himself were wearing their respective house mourning uniforms logos and decorations of rank stitched in black silk on black cloth maximum formal since they were to be in the imperial presence itself miles ordinarily liked his vorkosigan house uniform whether the original brown and silver or this somber and elegant version because the tall boots not only allowed but required him to dispense with the leg braces but getting the boots on over his swollen burns this morning had been painful he was going to be limping more noticeably than usual even tanked as he was on painkillers ill remember this yenaro they spiraled down to a landing by the southernmost dome entrance fronted by a landing lot already crowded with other vehicles vorobyev dismissed the driver and aircar we keep no escort my lord miles said doubtfully watching it go and awkwardly shifting the long polished maplewood box he carried vorobyev shook his head not for security purposes no one but the cetagandan emperor himself could arrange an assassination inside the celestial garden and if he wished to have you eliminated here a regiment of bodyguards would do you no good some very tall men in the dress uniforms of the cetagandan imperial guard vetted them through the dome locks the guardsmen shunted them toward a collection of floatpallets set up as open cars with white silky upholstered seats the color of cetagandan imperial mourning each ambassadorial party was bowed on board by what looked to be senior servants in white and gray the roboticallyrouted floatcars set off at a sedate pace a handspan above the whitejadepaved walkways winding through a vast arboretum and botanical garden here and there miles saw the rooftops of scattered and hidden pavilions peeking through the trees all the buildings were low and private except for some elaborate towers poking up in the center of the magic circle almost three kilometers away though the sun shone outside in an eta ceta spring day the weather inside the dome was set to a gray cloudy and appropriately mournful dampness promising but doubtless not delivering rain at length they wafted to a sprawling pavilion just to the west of the central towers where another servant bowed them out of the car and directed them inside along with a dozen other delegations miles stared around trying to identify them all the marilacans yes there was the silverhaired bernaux some greenclad people who might be jacksonians a delegation from aslund which included their chief of stateeven they had only two guards disarmedthe betan ambassadoress in a blackonpurple brocade jacket and matching sarong all streaming in to honor this one dead woman who would never have met them facetoface when alive surreal seemed an understatement miles felt like hed crossed the border into faerie and when they emerged this afternoon a hundred years would have passed outside the galactics had to pause at the doorway to make way for the party of a hautlord satrap governor he had an escort of a dozen ghemguards miles noted in full formal face paint orange green and white swirls the decor inside was surprisingly simpletasteful miles supposedtending heavily to the organic arrangements of live flowers and plants and little fountains as if bringing the garden indoors the connecting halls were hushed not echoing yet ones voice carried clearly theyd done something extraordinary with acoustics more palace servants circulated offering food and drinks to the guests a pair of pearlcolored spheres drifted at a walking pace across the far end of one hall and miles blinked at his first glimpse of hautladies sort of outside their very private quarters hautwomen all hid themselves behind personal forceshields usually generated miles had been told from a floatchair the shields could be made any color according to the mood or whim of the wearer but today would all be white for the occasion the hautlady could see out with perfect clarity but no one could see in or reach in or penetrate the barrier with stunner plasma or nerve disrupter fire or small projectile weapons or minor explosions true the forcescreen also eliminated the opportunity to fire out but that seemed not to be a hautlady concern the shield could be cut in half with a gravitic imploder lance miles supposed but the imploders bulky power packs massing several hundred kilos made them strictly field ordnance not hand weapons inside their bubbles the hautwomen could be wearing anything did they ever cheat slop around in old clothes and comfy slippers when they were supposed to be dressed up go nude to garden parties who could tell a tall elderly man in the pure white robes reserved for the haut and ghemlords approached the barrayaran party his features were austere his skin finely wrinkled and almost transparent he was the cetagandan equivalent of an imperial majordomo apparently though with a much more flowery title for after collecting their credentials from vorobyev he provided them with exact instructions as to their place and timing in the upcoming procession his attitude conveyed that outlanders might be hopelessly gauche but if one repeated the directions in a firm tone and made them simple enough there was a chance of getting through this ceremony without disgrace he looked down his hawkbeak nose at the polished box and this is your gift lord vorkosigan miles managed to unlatch the box and open it for display without dropping it within nestled on a black velvet bed lay an old nicked sword this is the gift selected from his collection by my emperor gregor vorbarra in honor of your late empress it is the sword his imperial ancestor dorca vorbarra the just carried in the first cetagandan war one of several but no need to go into that a priceless and irreplaceable historical artifact here is its documentation of provenance oh the majordomos feathery white brows lifted almost despite themselves he took the packet sealed with gregor s personal mark with more respect please convey my imperial masters thanks to yours he halfbowed and withdrew that worked well said vorobyev with satisfaction i should bloody think so growled miles breaks my heart he handed off the box to ivan to juggle for a while nothing seemed to be happening just yetorganizational delays miles supposed he drifted away from ivan and vorobyev in search of a hot drink he was on the point of capturing something steaming and he hoped nonsedating from a passing tray when a quiet voice at his elbow intoned lord vorkosigan he turned and stifled an indrawn breath a short and rather androgynous elderly womanstood by his side dressed in the gray and white of xanadus service staff her head was bald as an egg her face devoid of hair not even eyebrows yes maam ba she said in the tone of one offering a polite correction a lady wishes to speak with you would you accompany me please uh sure she turned and paced soundlessly away and he followed in alert anticipation a lady with luck it might be mia maz of the vervani delegation who ought to be around somewhere in this mob of a thousand people he was developing some urgent questions for her no eyebrows i was expecting a contact sometime but here they exited the hall passing out of sight of vorobyev and ivan stretched miless nerves still further he followed the gliding servant down a couple of corridors and across a little open garden thick with moss and tiny flowers misted with dew the noises from the reception hall still carried faintly through the damp air they entered a small building open to the garden on two sides and floored with dark wood that made his black boots echo unevenly in time with his limping stride in a dim recess of the pavilion a womansized pearlescent sphere floated a few centimeters above the polished floor which reflected an inverted halo from its light leave us a voice from the sphere directed the servant who bowed and withdrew eyes downcast the transmission through the force screen gave the voice a low flat timbre the silence lengthened maybe shed never seen a physically imperfect man before miles bowed and waited trying to look cool and suave and not stunned and wildly curious so lord vorkosigan came the voice again at last here i am er quite miles hesitated and just who are you milady besides a very pretty soapbubble there was a longer pause then i am the haut rian degtiar servant of the celestial lady and handmaiden of the star creche another flowery hauttitle that gave no clue to its function he could name every ghemlord on the cetagandan general staff all the satrap governors and their ghemofficers but this female hautbabble was new to him but the celestial lady was the polite name for the late empress haut lisbet degtiar and that name at least he knew you are a relative of the late dowager empress milady i am of her genomic constellation yes three generations removed i have served her half my life a ladyinwaiting all right one of the old empresss personal retinue then the most inward of insiders very high rank probably very aged as well uh youre not related to a ghemlord named yenaro by chance are you who even through the forcescreen the voice conveyed utter bafflement never mind clearly not important his legs were beginning to throb getting the damn boots back off when he returned to the embassy was going to be an even better trick than getting them on had been i could not help noticing your serving woman are there many folk around here with no hair it is not a woman it is ba ba the neuter ones the emperors highslaves in his celestial fathers time it was the fashion to make them smooth like that ah genetically engineered genderless servants hed heard rumors about them mostly connected illogically enough with sexual scenarios that had more to do with the tellers hopeful fantasies than with any likely reality but they were reputed to be a race utterly loyal to the lord who had after all literally created them so not all ba are hairless but all the hairless ones are ba he worked it out yes more silence then why have you come to the celestial garden lord vorkosigan his brow wrinkled to hold up barrayars honor in this circuum solemn procession and to present your late empresss biergift im an envoy by appointment of emperor gregor vorbarra whom serve in my own small way another longer pause you mock me in my misery what what do you want lord vorkosigan what do i want you called me here lady isnt it the other way around he rubbed his neck tried again er can i help you by chance you her astonished tone stung him yeah me im not as incompetent as i look ive been known to accomplish a thing or two in my time but if you wont give me a clue as to what this is all about i cant i will if i do know but i cant if i dont dont you see now he had confused himself tonguetangled look can we start this conversation over he bowed low good day i am lord miles vorkosigan of barrayar how may i assist you milady thief the light dawned at last oh oh no i am a vorkosigan and no thief milady though as possibly a recipient of stolen property i may be a fence he allowed judiciously more baffled silence perhaps she was not familiar with criminal jargon miles went on a little desperately have you uh by chance lost an object rodshaped electronic device with a birdcrest seal on the cap you have it her voice was a wail of dismay well not on me her voice went low throaty desperate you still have it you must return it to me gladly if you can prove it belongs to you i certainly dont pretend it belongs to me he added pointedly you would do this for nothing for the honor of my name and er i am impsec id do almost anything for information satisfy my curiosity and the deed is done her voice came back in a shocked whisper you mean you dont even know what it is the silence stretched for so long after that he was beginning to be afraid the old lady had fainted dead away in there processional music wafted faintly through the air from the great pavilion oh shier oh that damn parade is starting and im supposed to be near the front milady how can i reach you you cant her voice was suddenly breathless i have to go too ill send for you the white bubble rose and began to float away where when the music was building toward the startcue say nothing of this he managed a sketchy bow at her retreating maybeback and began hobbling hastily across the garden he had a horrible feeling he was about to be very publicly late when hed wended his way back into the reception area he found the scene was every bit as bad as hed feared a line of people was advancing to the main exit toward the tower buildings and vorobyev in the barrayaran delegations place was dragging his feet creating an obvious gap and staring around urgently he spotted miles and mouthed silently hurry up dammit miles hobbled faster feeling as if every eye in the room was on him ivan with an exasperated look on his face handed over the box to him as he arrived where the hell were you all this time in the lav i looked there sh tell you later ive just had the most bizarre miles struggled with the heavy maplewood box and straightened it around into an appropriate presentational position he marched forward across a courtyard paved with more carved jade catching up at last with the delegation in front of them just as they reached the door to one of the hightowered buildings they all filed into an echoing rotunda miles spied a few white bubbles in the line ahead but there was no telling if one was his old hautlady the game plan called for everyone to slowly circle the bier genuflect and lay their gifts in a spiral pattern in order of senioritystatusclout and file out the opposite doors to the northern pavilion for the hautlords and ghemlords or the eastern pavilion for the galactic ambassadors where a funereal luncheon would be served but the steady procession stopped and began to pile up in the wide arched doorways from the rotunda ahead instead of quiet music and hushed shuffling footsteps a startled babble poured voices were raised in sharp astonishment then other voices in even sharper command whats gone wrong ivan wondered craning his neck did somebody faint or something since miless eyelevel view was of the shoulders of the man ahead of him he could scarcely answer this with a lurch the line began to proceed again it reached the rotunda but then was shunted out a door immediately to the left a ghemcommander stood at the intersection directing traffic with lowvoiced instructions repeated over and over please retain your gifts and proceed directly around the outside walkway to the eastern pavilion please retain your gifts and proceed directly to the eastern pavilion all will be reordered presently please retain at the center of the rotunda above everyones heads on a great catafalque lay the dowager empress in state even in death outlander eyes were not invited to look upon her her bier was surrounded by a forcebubble made translucent only a shadow of her form was visible through it as if through gauze a whiteclad slight sleeping ghost a line of mixed ghemguards apparently just drafted from the passing satrap governors stood in a row from catafalque to wall on either side of the bier shielding something else from the passing eyes miles couldnt stand it after all they cant massacre me here in front of everybody can they he jammed the maplewood box at ivan and ducked under the elbow of the ghemofficer trying to shoo everyone out the other door smiling pleasantly his hands held open and empty he slipped between two startled ghemguards who were clearly not expecting such a rude and impudent move on the other side of the catafalque in the position reserved for the first gift of the hautlord of highest status lay a dead body its throat was cut and quantities of fresh red blood pooled on the shimmering green malachite floor all around soaking into its gray and white palace servitors uniform a thin jeweled knife was clutched rigorously in its outflung right hand it was exactly the term for the corpse too a bald eyebrowless manshaped creature elderly but not frail miles recognized their intruder from the personnel pod even without the false hair his own heart seemed to stop in astonishment somebodys just raised the stakes in this little game the highestranking ghemofficer in the room swooped down upon him even through the swirl of face paint his smile was fixed the look of a man constrained to be polite to someone he would more naturally have preferred to bludgeon to the pavement lord vorkosigan would you rejoin your delegation please of course who was that poor fellow the ghemcommander made little herding motions at himthe cetagandan was not fool enough to actually touch him of courseand miles allowed himself to be moved off grateful irate and flustered the man was actually surprised into an unguarded reply it is ba lura the celestial ladys most senior servitor the ba has served her for sixty years and moreit seems to have wished to follow on and serve her in death as well a most tasteless gesture to do it here the ghemcommander buffeted miles near enough to the againstopped line of delegates for ivans long arm to reach out grab him and pull him in and march him doorward with a firm fist in the middle of his back what the hell is going on ivan bent his head to hiss in miless ear from behind and where were you when the murder took place lord vorkosigan except that it didnt look like a murder it really did look like a suicide done in a most archaic manner less than thirty minutes ago while he had been off talking with the mysterious white bubble who might or might not have been haut rian degtiar how the hell was he to tell the corridor seemed to be spinning but miles supposed it was only his brain you should not have gotten out of line my lord said vorobyev severely ah what was it you saw miless lip curled but he tamped it back down one of the late dowager empresss oldest ba servants has just cut its throat at the foot of her bier i didnt know the cetagandans made a fashion of human sacrifice not officially anyway vorobyevs lips pursed in a soundless whistle then flashed a brief instantly stifled grin how awkward for them he purred they are going to have an interesting scramble trying to retrieve this ceremony yes so if the creature was so loyal why did it arrange what it must have known would be a major embarrassment for its masters posthumous revenge admittedly with cetagandans thats the safest kind by the time they completed an interminable hike around the outside of the central towers to the pavilion on the eastern side miless legs were killing him in a huge hall the several hundred galactic delegates were being seated at tables by an army of servitors all moving just a little faster than strict dignity would have preferred since some of the biergifts the other delegates carried were even bulkier than the barrayarans maplewood box the seating was going slowly and more awkwardly than planned with a lot of people jumping up and down and rearranging themselves to the servitors evident dismay somewhere deep in the bowels of the building miles pictured a squadron of harried cetagandan cooks swearing many colorful and obscene cetagandan oaths miles spotted the vervani delegation being seated about a third of the way across the room he took advantage of the confusion to slip out of his assigned chair weave around several tables and try to seize a word with mia maz he stood by her elbow and smiled tensely good afternoon mlady maz i have to talk lord vorkosigan i tried to talk with you they cut across each others greetings you first he ducked his head at her i tried to call you at your embassy earlier but youd already left what in the world happened in the rotunda do you have any idea for the cetagandans to alter a ceremony of this magnitude in the middleits unheard of they didnt exactly have a choice well i suppose they could have ignored the body and just carried on around iti think that would have been much more impressive personallybut evidently they decided to clean it up first again miles repeated what he was beginning to think of as the official version of ba luras suicide he had the total attention of everyone within earshot to hell with it the rumors would be flying soon enough no matter what he said or didnt say did you have any luck with that little research question i posed to you last night miles continued i uh dont think this is the time or place to discuss it but yes and yes maz said and not over any holovid transmission channel on this planet either miles thought supposedly secured or not can you stop by the barrayaran embassy directly after this well take tea or something i think that would be very appropriate maz said she watched him with newly intensified curiosity in her dark eyes i need a lesson in etiquette miles added for the benefit of their interested nearby listeners mazs eyes twinkled in something that might have been suppressed amusement so i have heard it said my lord she murmured by whom he choked off vorobyev i fear bye he finished instead rapped the table cheerily and retreated back to his proper place vorobyev watched miles seat himself with a slightly dangerous look in his eyes that suggested he was thinking of putting a leash on the peripatetic young envoy soon but he made no comment aloud by the time they had eaten their way through about twenty courses of tiny delicacies which more than made up in numbers what they lacked in volume the cetagandans had reorganized themselves the hautlord majordomo was apparently one of those commanders who was never more masterly than when in retreat for he managed to get everyone marshaled in the correct order of seniority again even though the line was now being cycled through the rotunda in reverse one sensed the majordomo would be cutting his throat later in the proper place and with the proper ceremony and not in this dreadful harumscarum fashion miles laid down the maplewood box on the malachite floor in the second turning of the growing spiral of gifts about a meter from where ba lura had poured out its life the unmarked perfectly polished floor wasnt even damp and had the cetagandan security people had time to do a forensics scan before the cleanup or had someone been counting on the hasty destruction of the subtler evidence damn i wish i could have been in charge of this just now the white floatcars were waiting on the other side of the eastern pavilion to carry the emissaries back to the gates of the celestial garden the entire ceremony had run only about an hour late but miless sense of time was inverted from his first whimsical vision of xanadu as faerie he felt as if a hundred years had gone by inside the dome while only morning had passed in the outside world he winced painfully in the bright afternoon light as vorobyevs sergeantdriver brought the embassy aircar to their pickup point miles fell gratefully into his seat i think theyre going to have to cut these bloody boots off when we get back home chapter four pull miles said and set his teeth ivan grasped his boot by the ankle and heel braced his knee against the end of the couch upon which miles lay and yanked dutifully yeow ivan stopped does that hurt yes keep going dammit ivan glanced around miless personal suite maybe you ought to go downstairs to the embassy infirmary again later i am not going to let that butcher of a physician dissect my best boots pull ivan put his back into it and the boot at last came free he studied it in his hand a moment and smiled slowly you know youre not going to be able to get the other one off without me he observed so so give give what knowing your usual humor id have thought youd be as amused by the idea of an extra corpse in the funeral chamber as vorobyev was but you came back looking like youd just seen your grandfathers ghost the ba had cut its throat it was a messy scene i think youve seen messier corpses oh yes miles eyed his remaining booted leg which was throbbing and pictured himself limping through the corridors of the embassy seeking a less demanding valet no he sighed messier but no stranger youd have twitched too we met the ba yesterday you and i you wrestled with it in the personnel pod ivan glanced toward the comconsole desk drawer where the mysterious rod remained concealed and swore that does it weve got to report this to vorobyev if it was the same ba miles put in hastily for all i know the cetagandans clone their servants in batches and the one we saw yesterday was this ones twin or something ivan hesitated you think so i dont know but i know where i can find out just let me have one more pass at this before we send up the flag please ive asked mia maz from the vervani embassy to stop in and see me if you wait ill let you sit in ivan contemplated this bribe boot miles demanded while he was thinking somewhat absently ivan helped pull it off all right he said at last but after we talk to her we report to impsec ivan i am impsec snapped miles three years of training and field experience remember do me the honor of grasping that i may just possibly know what im doing i wish to hell i knew what i was doing intuition was nothing but the subconscious processing of subliminal clues he was fairly sure but i feel it in my bones made too uncomfortably thin a public defense for his actions how can you know something before you know it give me a chance ivan departed for his own room to change clothes without making any promises freed of the boots miles staggered to his washroom to gulp down some more painkillers and skin out of his formal house mourning and into loose black fatigues judging by the embassys protocol list miless private chamber was going to be the only place he could wear the fatigues ivan returned all too soon breezily trim in undress greens but before he could continue asking questions miles couldnt answer or demanding justifications miles couldnt offer the comconsole chimed it was the staffer from the embassys lobby downstairs mia maz is here to see you lord vorkosigan the man reported she says she has an appointment thats correct uh can you bring her up here please was his suite monitored by embassy security he wasnt about to draw attention by inquiring but no if impsec were eavesdropping hed certainly have had to deal with some stiff interrogation from their offices belowstairs by now either via vorobyev or directly they were extending him the courtesy of privacy as yet in his personal spacethough probably not on his comconsole every public forum in the building was guaranteed to be bugged though the staffer ushered maz to miless door in a few moments and miles and ivan hastened to get her comfortably seated she too had stopped to change clothes and was now wearing a formfitting jump suit and kneelength vest suitable for street wear even at fortyodd her form supported the style very nicely miles got rid of the staffer by sending him off with an order for tea and at ivans request wine miles settled down on the other end of the couch and smiled hopefully at the vervani woman ivan was forced offsides to a nearby chair milady maz thank you for coming just maz please she smiled in return we vervani dont use such titles im afraid we have trouble taking them seriously you must be good at keeping a straight face or you could not function so well here her dimple winked at him yes my lord ah yes vervain was one of those socalled democracies not quite as insanely egalitarian as the betans but they had a definite cultural drift in that direction my mother would agree with you miles conceded she would have seen no inherent difference between the two corpses in the rotunda except their method of arriving there of course i take it this suicide was an unusual and unexpected event unprecedented said maz and if you know cetagandans you know just how strong a term that is so cetagandan servants do not routinely accompany their masters in death like a pagan sacrifice i suppose the ba lura was unusually close to the empress it had served her for so long said the vervani woman since before any of us were born ivan was wondering if the hautlords cloned their servants ivan cast miles a slightly dirty look for being made the stalking horse but did not voice an objection the ghemlords sometimes do said maz but not the hautlords and most certainly never the imperial household they consider each servitor as much a work of art as any of the other objects with which they surround themselves everything in the celestial garden must be unique if possible handmade and perfect that applies to their biological constructs as well they leave mass production to the masses im not sure if its a virtue or a vice the way the haut do it but in a world flooded with virtual realities and infinite duplication its strangely refreshing if only they werent such awful snobs about it speaking of things artistic said miles you said you had some luck identifying that icon yes her gaze flicked up to fix on his face where did you say you saw it lord vorkosigan i didnt hm she halfsmiled but apparently decided not to fence with him over the point just now it is the seal of the star creche and not something id expect an outlander to run across every day in fact its not something id expect an outlander to run across any day its most private check and hautish supremely and um just what is the star creche you dont know maz seemed a little surprised well i suppose you fellows have spent all your time studying cetagandan military matters a great deal of time yes ivan sighed the star creche is the private name of the hautraces gene bank oh that i was dimly aware ofdo they keep backup copies of themselves then miles asked the star creche is far more than that among the haut they dont deal directly with each other to have egg and sperm united and the resulting embryo deposited in a uterine replicator the way normal people do every genetic cross is negotiated and a contract drawn between the heads of the two genetic linesthe cetagandans call them constellations though i suppose you barrayarans would call them clans that contract in turn must be approved by the emperor or rather by the senior female in the emperors line and marked by the seal of the star creche for the last halfcentury since the present regime began that senior female has been haut lisbet degtiar the emperors mother its not just a formality either any genetic alterationsand the haut do a lot of themhave to be examined and cleared by the empresss board of geneticists before they are allowed into the haut genome you asked me if the hautwomen had any power the dowager empress had final approval or veto over every haut birth can the emperor override her maz pursed her lips i truly dont know the haut are incredibly reserved about all this if there are any behindthescenes power struggles the news certainly doesnt leak out past the celestial gardens gates i do know ive never heard of such a conflict so who is the new senior female who inherits the seal ah now youve touched on something interesting maz was warming to her subject nobody knows or at least the emperor hasnt made the public announcement the seal is supposed to be held by the emperors mother if she lives or by the mother of the heirapparent if the dowager is deceased but the cetagandan emperor has not yet selected his heir the seal of the star creche and all the rest of the empresss regalia is supposed to be handed over to the new senior female as the last act of the funeral rites so he has ten more days to make up his mind i imagine that decision is the focus of a great deal of attention right now among the hautwomen no new genomic contracts can be approved until the transfer is completed miles puzzled this through he has three young sons right so he must select one of their mothers not necessarily said maz he could hand things over to an imperial aunt one of his mothers kin as an interim move a diffident rap at miless door indicated the arrival of the tea the barrayaran embassys kitchen had sent along a perfectly redundant threetiered tray of little petit fours as well someone had been doing their homework for maz murmured ooh my favorite one feminine hand dove for some dainty chocolate confections despite the imperial luncheon theyd recently consumed the embassy steward poured tea opened the wine and withdrew as discreetly as he had entered ivan took a gulp from his crystal cup and asked in puzzlement do the hautlords marry then one of these genetic contracts must be the equivalent of a marriage right well no maz swallowed her third chocolate morsel and chased it with tea there are several kinds of contracts the simplest is for a sort of onetime usage of ones genome a single child is created who becomes the i hesitate to use the term property who is registered with the constellation of the male parent and is raised in his constellations creche you understand these decisions are not made by the principalsin fact the two parents may never even meet each other these contracts are chosen at the most senior level of the constellation by the oldest and presumably wisest heads with an eye to either capturing a favored genetic line or setting up for a desirable cross in the ensuing generation at the other extreme is a lifetime monopolyor longer in the case of imperial crosses when a hautwoman is chosen to be the mother of a potential heir the contract is absolutely exclusiveshe must never have contracted her genome previously and can never do so again unless the emperor chooses to have more than one child by her she goes to live in the celestial garden in her own pavilion for the rest of her life miles grimaced is that a reward or a punishment its the best shot at power a hautwoman can ever geta chance of becoming a dowager empress if her sonand its always and only a sonis ultimately chosen to succeed his father even being the mother of one of the losers a princecandidate or satrap governor is no bad deal its also why in an apparently patriarchal culture the output of the hautconstellations is skewed to girls a constellation headclan chief in barrayaran terminologycan never become an emperor or the father of an emperor no matter how brightly his sons may shine but through his daughters he has a chance to become the grandfather of one advantages as you may imagine then accrue to the dowager empresss constellation the degtiar were not particularly important until fifty years ago so the emperor has sons miles worked this out but everyone else is mad for daughters but only once or twice a century when a new emperor succeeds can anyone win the game thats about right so where does sex fit into all this asked ivan plaintively nowhere said maz nowhere maz laughed at his horrified expression yes the haut have sexual relations but its purely a social game they even have longlasting sexual friendships that could almost qualify as marriages sometimes i was about to say theres nothing formalized except that the etiquette of all the shifting associations is so incredibly complex i guess the word i want is legalized rather than formalized because the rituals are intense and weird really weird sometimes from what little ive been able to gather of it all fortunately the haut are such racists they almost never go slumming outside their genome so you are not likely to encounter those pitfalls personally oh said ivan he sounded a little disappointed but if the haut dont marry and set up their own households when and how do they leave home they never do ow you mean they live with like their mothers forever well not with their mothers of course their grandparents or greatgrandparents but the youththat is anyone under fifty or sodo live as pensioners of their constellation i wonder if that is at the root of why so many older haut become reclusive they live apart because they finally can butwhat about all those famous and successful ghemgenerals and ghemlords whove won hautlady wives asked miles maz shrugged they cant all aspire to become imperial mothers can they actually i would point out this aspect particularly to you lord vorkosigan have you ever wondered how the haut who are not noted for their military prowess control the ghem who are oh yes ive been expecting this crazy cetagandan doubledecked aristocracy to fall apart ever since i learned about it how can you control guns with with art contests how can a bunch of perfumed poetasters like the hautlords buffalo whole ghemarmies maz smiled the cetagandan ghemlords would call it the loyalty justly due to superior culture and civilization the fact is that anyone whos competent enough or powerful enough to pose a threat gets genetically coopted there is no higher reward in the cetagandan system than to be imperially assigned a hautlady wife the ghemlords are all panting for it its the ultimate social and political coup youre suggesting the haut control the ghem through these wives said miles i mean im sure the hautwomen are lovely and all but the ghemgenerals can be such hardbitten castiron bastardsi cant imagine anyone who gets to the top in the cetagandan empire being that susceptible if i knew how the hautwomen do it maz sighed id bottle it and sell it no betteri think id keep it for myself but it seems to have worked for the last several hundred years it is not of course the only method of imperial control to be sure only the most overlooked one i find that in itself significant the haut are nothing if not subtle does the uh hautbride come with a dowry miles asked maz smiled again and polished off another chocolate confection you have hit upon an important point lord vorkosigan she does not id think keeping a hautwife in the style to which she is accustomed could get rather expensive very so if the cetagandan emperor wished to depress an excessively successful subject he could award him a few hautwives and bankrupt him i dont think its done quite so obviously as all that but the element is there you are very acute my lord ivan asked but how does the hautlady who gets handed out like a goodconduct medal feel about it all i mean if the highest hautlady ambition is to become an imperial monopoly this has got to be the ultimate opposite to be permanently dumped out of the hautgenometheir descendants never marry back into the haut do they no confirmed maz i believe the psychology of it all is a bit peculiar for one thing the hautbride immediately outranks any other wives the ghemlord may have acquired and her children automatically become his heirs this can set up some interesting tensions in his household particularly if it comes as it usually does in midlife when his other marital associations may be of long standing it must be a ghemladys nightmare to have one of these hautwomen dropped on her husband ivan mused dont they ever object make their husbands turn down the honor apparently its not an honor one can refuse mm with difficulty miles pulled his imagination away from these sidefascinations and back to his most immediate worry that seal of the star creche thingi dont suppose you have a picture of it i brought a number of vids with me yes my lord said maz with your permission we can run them on your comconsole ooh i adore competent women do you have a younger sister milady maz yes please said miles they all trooped over to the chambers comconsole desk and maz began a quick illustrated lecture on haut crests and the several dozen assorted imperial seals here it is my lordthe seal of the star creche it was a clear cubical block measuring maybe fifteen centimeters on a side with the birdpattern incised in red lines upon its top not the mysterious rod miles exhaled with relief the terror that had been riding him ever since maz had mentioned the seal that he and ivan might have accidentally stolen a piece of the imperial regalia faded the rod was some kind of imperial gizmo obviously and would have to be returnedanonymously by preferencebut at least it wasnt maz called up the next unit of data and this object is the great key of the star creche which is handed over along with the seal she went on ivan choked on his wine miles faint leaned on the desk and smiled fixedly at the image of the rod the original lay some few centimeters under his hand in the drawer and ahjust what is the great key of the star creche mlamaz miles managed to murmur what does it do im not quite sure at one time in the past i believe it had something to do with data retrieval from the haut gene banks but the actual device may only be ceremonial by now i mean its a couple of hundred years old it has to be obsolete we hope thank god he hadnt dropped it yet i see miles muttered ivan later miles hissed to him out of the corner of his mouth i understand your concern ivan mouthed something obscene at him over the seated mazs head miles leaned against the comconsole desk and screwed up his features in a realistic wince something wrong my lord maz glanced up concerned im afraid my legs are bothering me a bit i had probably better pay another visit to the embassy physician after this would you prefer to continue this later maz asked instantly well to tell you the truth i think ive had about all the etiquette lessons i can absorb for one afternoon oh theres lots more but apparently he was looking realistically pale too for she rose adding far too much for one session to be sure are your injuries much troubling you i didnt realize they were that severe miles shrugged as if in embarrassment after a suitable exchange of parting amenities and a promise to call on his vervani tutor again very soon ivan took over the hostly duties and escorted maz back downstairs he returned immediately to seal the door behind him and pounce on miles do you have any idea how much trouble were in he cried miles sat before the comconsole rereading the official and entirely inadequate description of the great key while its image floated hauntingly before his nose above the vid plate yes i also know how were going to get out of it do you know as much this gave ivan pause what else do you know that i dont if you will just leave it to me i believe i can get this thing back to its rightful owner with no one the wiser its rightful owner is the cetagandan emperor according to what maz said well ultimately yes i should say back to its rightful keeper who if i read the signs right is as chagrined about losing it as we are in finding it if i can get it back to her quietly i dont think shes going to go around proclaiming how she lost it although i do wonder how she did lose it something was not adding up just below his level of conscious perception we mugged an imperial servitor thats how yes but what was ba lura doing with the thing on an orbital transfer station in the first place why had it disabled the security monitors in the docking bay lura was taking the great key somewhere obviously to the great lock for all i know ivan paced around the comconsole so the poor sod cuts its throat the next morning cause it lost its charge its trust courtesy of ushell miles i feel like we just killed that old geezer and it never did us any harm it just blundered into the wrong place and had the bad luck to startle us is that what happened miles murmured really is that why i am so desperately determined for the story to be something anything else the scenario hung together the old ba charged with transporting the precious object loses the great key to some outlander barbarians confesses its disgrace to its mistress and kills itself in expiation wrap miles felt ill so if the key was that important why wasnt the ba traveling with a squadron of imperial ghemguards god miles i wish it had been a firm knock sounded on miless door miles hastily shut down the comconsole and unsealed the door lock come in ambassador vorobyev entered and favored him with a semicordial nod he held a sheaf of delicately colored scented papers in his hand hello my lords did you find your tutorial with maz useful yes sir said miles good i thought you would shes excellent vorobyev held up the colored papers while you were in session this invitation arrived for you both from lord yenaro along with assorted profound apologies for last nights incident embassy security has opened scanned and chemically analyzed it they report the organic esters harmless with this safety pronouncement he handed the papers across to miles it is up to you whether or not to accept if you concur that the unfortunate sideeffect of the sculptures power field was an accident your attendance might be a good thing it would complete the apology repairing face all around oh well go sure the apology and invitation were handcalligraphed in the best cetagandan style but ill keep my eyes open ah wasnt colonel vorreedi due back today vorobyev grimaced hes run into some tedious complications but in view of that odd incident at the marilacan embassy ive sent a subordinate to replace him he should be back tomorrow perhaps do you wish a bodyguard not openly of course that would be another insult mm well have a driver right let him be one of your trained men have backup on call give us both comm links and have him wait for us nearby very well lord vorkosigan ill make arrangements vorobyev nodded and regarding the incident in the rotunda earlier today miless heart pounded yes please dont break ranks like that again did you receive a complaint and from whom one learns to interpret certain pained looks the cetagandans would consider it impolite to protestbut should unpleasant incidents pile high enough not too impolite for them to take some sort of indirect and arcane retaliation you two will be gone in ten days but i will still be here please dont make my job any more difficult than it already is eh understood sir said miles brightly ivan was looking intensely worriedwas he going to bolt pour out confessions to vorobyev not yet evidently for the ambassador waved himself back out without ivan throwing himself at his feet nearby doesnt cut it for a bodyguard ivan pointed out as soon as the door sealed again oh youre beginning to see it my way now are you but if we go to yenaros at all i cant avoid risk i have to eat drink and breatheall routes for attack an armed guard cant do much about anyway my greatest defense is that it would be a grievous insult to the cetagandan emperor for anyone to seriously harm a galactic delegate to his august mothers funeral i predict should another accident occur it will be equally subtle and nonfatal and equally infuriating oh yeah when theres been one fatality already ivan stood silent for a long time do you think all these incidents could possibly be related ivan nodded toward the perfumed papers still in miless hand and toward the comconsole desk drawer i admit i dont see how do you think they could possibly all be unrelated coincidences hm ivan frowned digesting this so tell me he pointed again to the desk drawer how are you planning to get rid of the empresss dildo miless mouth twitched stifling a grin at the ivandiplomatic turn of phrase i cant tell you mostly because i dont know yet myself but the haut rian degtiar had to be scrambling right now he fingered as if absently the silver eyeofhorus impsec insignia pinned to his black collar theres a ladys reputation involved ivans eyes narrowed in scorn of this obvious appeal to ivans own brand of personal affairs horseshit are you running some kind of secret rig for simon illyan if i were i couldnt tell you now could i damned if i know ivan stared at him in frustration for another moment then shrugged well its your funeral chapter five stop here miles instructed the groundcars driver the car swung smoothly to the side of the street and with a sigh of its fans settled to the pavement miles peered at the layout of lord yenaros suburban mansion in the gathering dusk mentally pairing the visual reality with the map he had studied back at the barrayaran embassy the barriers around the estate serpentine garden walls and concealing landscaping were visual and symbolic rather than effective the place had never been designed as a fortress of anything but privilege a few higher sections of the rambling house glimmered through the trees but even they seemed to focus inward rather than outward comm link check my lords the driver requested miles and ivan both pulled the devices from their pockets and ran through the codes with him very good my lords whats our backup miles asked him i have three units arranged within call i trust weve included a medic in the lightflyer fully equipped i can put him down inside lord yenaros courtyard in fortyfive seconds that should be sufficient i dont expect a frontal assault but i wouldnt be surprised if i encountered another little accident of some sort well walk from here i think i want to get the feel of the place yes my lord the driver popped the canopy for them and miles and ivan exited is this what you call genteel poverty ivan inquired looking around as they strolled through open unguarded gates and up yenaros curving drive ah yes the style might be different but the scent of aristocratic decay was universal little signs of neglect were all around unrepaired damage to the gates and walls overgrown shrubbery what appeared to be threequarters of the mansion dark and closedoff vorobyev had the embassys impsec office make a background check of lord yenaro miles said yenaros grandfather the failed ghemgeneral left him the house but not the means to keep it up having consumed his capital in his extended and presumably embittered old age yenaros been in sole possession for about four years he runs with an artsy crowd of young and unemployed ghemlordlings so his story holds up to that extent but that thing in the marilacan embassys lobby was the first sculpture yenaros ever been known to produce curiously advanced for a first try dont you think if youre so convinced it was a trap why are you sticking your hand in to try and trip another one no risk no reward ivan just what reward are you envisioning truth beauty who knows embassy security is also running a check on the workmen who actually built the sculpture i expect it to be revealing at least he could make that much use of the machinery of impsec miles felt intensely conscious of the rod now riding concealed in his inner tunic pocket hed been carrying the great key in secret all day through a tour of the city and an interminable afternoon performance of a cetagandan classical dance company this last treat had been arranged by imperial decree especially for the offplanet envoys to the funeral but the haut rian degtiar had not made her promised move to contact him yet if he did not hear from his hautlady by tomorrow on one level miles was growing extremely sorry he had not taken the local impsec subordinates into his confidence on the very first day but if he had he would no longer be in charge of this little problem the decisions would all have been hiked to higher levels out of his control the ice is thin i dont want anyone heavier than me walking on it just yet a servant met them at the mansions door as they approached and escorted them into a softly lit entry foyer where they were greeted by their host yenaro was in dark robes similar to the ones hed worn at the marilacan embassys reception ivan was clearly correct in his undress greens miles had chosen his ultraformal house blacks he wasnt sure how yenaro would interpret the message as honor or reminderim the official envoy or warningdont mess with me but he was fairly certain it was not a nuance yenaro would miss yenaro glanced down at miles s black boots and are your legs better now lord vorkosigan he inquired anxiously much better thank you miles smiled tightly in return i shall certainly live im so glad the tall ghemlord led them around a few corners and down a short flight of steps to a large semicircular room wrapped around a peninsula of the garden as if the house were undergoing some botanical invasion the room was somewhat randomly furnished apparently with items yenaro had previously owned rather than to design but the effect was pleasantly comfortablebachelor the lighting here too was soft camouflaging shabbiness a dozen ghemtypes were already present talking and drinking the men outnumbered the women two bore full face paint most sported the cheekdecal of the younger set and a few radical souls wore nothing above the neck but a little eye makeup yenaro introduced his barrayaran exotics all around none of the ghem were anyone miles had heard of or studied though one young man claimed a greatuncle on staff at cetagandan headquarters an incense burner smoked on a cylindrical stand by the garden doors one ghemguest paused to inhale deeply good one yenaro he called to his host your blend thank you yes said yenaro more perfumes inquired ivan and a bit extra that mixture also contains a mild relaxant suitable to the occasion you would perhaps not care for it lord vorkosigan miles smiled stiffly just how much of an organic chemist was this man miles was reminded that the root word of intoxication was toxic probably not but id love to see your laboratory would you ill take you up then most of my friends have no interest in the technical aspects only in the results a young woman listening nearby drifted up at this and tapped yenaro on the arm with one long fingernail glittering with patterned enamel yes dear yenni results you promised me some remember she was not the prettiest ghemwoman miles had seen but attractive enough in swirling jadegreen robes with thick pale hair clipped back and curling down to her shoulders in a pinkfrosted froth and i keep my promises lord yenaro asserted lord vorkosigan perhaps you would care to accompany us upstairs now certainly ill stay and make new acquaintances i think ivan bowed himself out of the party the two tallest and most striking ghemwomen present a leggy blonde and a truly incredible redhead were standing together across the room ivan somehow managed to make eye contact with both and they favored him with inviting smiles miles sent up a short silent prayer to the guardian god of fools lovers and madmen and turned to follow yenaro and his female petitioner yenaros organic chemistry laboratory was sited in another building lights came up as they approached across the garden it proved to be a quite respectable installation a long double room on the second floorsome of the money that wasnt going into home repairs was obviously ending up here miles walked around the benches eyeing the molecular analyzers and computers while yenaro rummaged among an array of little bottles for the promised perfume all the raw materials were beautifully organized in correct chemical groupings betraying a deep understanding and detailed love of the subject on the owners part who assists you here miles inquired no one said yenaro i cant bear to have anyone else mucking about they mess up my orderings which i sometimes use to inspire my blends its not all science you know indeed with a few questions miles led yenaro on to talk about how hed made the perfume for the woman she listened for a while and then wandered off to sniff at experimental bottles till yenaro with a pained smile rescued them from her yenaros expertise was less than professorial but fully professional any commercial cosmetics company would have hired him on the spot for their product development laboratory so and so how did this square with the man whod claimed hands are to be hired not at all miles decided with concealed satisfaction yenaro was unquestionably an artist but an artist of esters not a sculptor someone else had supplied the undoubted technical expertise that had produced the fountain and had that same somebody also supplied the technical information on miless personal weaknesses lets call him lord x fact one about lord x he had access to cetagandan securitys most detailed reports on barrayarans of military or political significance and their sons fact two he had a subtle mind fact three there was no fact three yet they returned to the party to find ivan ensconced on a couch between the two women entertaining themor at least they were laughing encouragingly the ghemwomen fully matched lady gelle in beauty the blonde might have been her sister the redhead was even more arresting with a cascade of amber curls falling past her shoulders a perfect nose lips that one might miles cut off the thought no ghemlady was going to invite him to dive into her dreams yenaro departed briefly to oversee his servanthe seemed to have only oneand expedite the smooth arrival of fresh food and drinks he returned with a small transparent pitcher of a pale ruby liquid lord vorpatril he nodded at ivan i believe you appreciate your beverages do try this one miles went to alertstatus his heart thumping yenaro might not be a sculptorassassin but he would undoubtedly make a great poisoner yenaro poured from the pitcher into three little cups on a lacquered tray and extended the tray to ivan thanks ivan selected one at random oh zlati ale murmured one of the junior ghemlords yenaro passed the tray to him and took the last cup himself ivan sipped and raised his brows in surprised approval miles watched closely to be sure yenaro actually swallowed he did five different methods for presenting deadly drinks with just that maneuver and still being sure the victim received the right one including the trick of the host consuming the antidote first flashed through miless mind but if he was going to be that paranoid they ought not have come here in the first place yet hed eaten and drunk nothing himself so far so what are you going to do wait and see if ivan falls over first and then try it yenaro did not this time pause to confide to the two women bracketing ivan the repulsive biological history of his birth hell maybe the incident with the fountain really had been an accident and the man was sorry and trying his very best to make it up to the barrayarans nevertheless miles circled in trying to get a closer look at ivans cup over his shoulder ivan was in the process of the classic im just resting my arm along the back of this couch test of the redhead on his right to see if she was going to flinch from or invite further physical contact ivan swiveled his head to repel his cousin with a toothy smile go have a good time miles he murmured relax stop breathing up my neck miles grimaced back in nonappreciation of the heighthumor and drifted off again some people just didnt want to be saved he decided instead to try to talk with some of yenaros male friends several of whom were clustered at the opposite end of the room it wasnt hard to get them to talk about themselves it seemed that was all they had to talk about forty minutes of valiant effort in the art of conversation convinced miles that most of yenaros friends had the minds of fleas the only expertise they displayed was in witty commentary upon the personal lives of their equally idle compatriots their clothes various love affairs and the mismanagement thereof sportsall spectator none participatory and mainly of interest due to wagers on the outcomeand the assorted latest commercial feelie dreams and other offerings including erotic ones this retreat from reality seemed to absorb by far the bulk of the ghemlordlings time and attention not one of them offered a word about anything of political or military interest hell ivan had more mental clout it was all a bit depressing yenaros friends were excluded men wasted wastrels no one was excited about a career or servicethey had none even the arts received only a ripple of interest they were strictly feelie dream consumers not producers all in all it was probably a good thing these youths had no political interests they were just the sort of people who started revolutions but could not finish them their idealism betrayed by their incompetence miles had met similar young men among the vor third or fourth sons who for whatever reason had not gained entry to a traditional military career living as pensioners upon their families but even they could look forward to some change in their status by midlife given the average ghem life span any chance of ascent up the social ladder by inheritance was still some eighty or ninety years off for most of yenaros set they werent inherently stupidtheir genetics did not permit itbut their minds were damped down to some artificial horizon beneath the air of hectic sophistication their lives were frozen in place miles almost shivered miles decided to try out the women if ivan had left any for him he excused himself from the group to pursue a drinkhe might have left without explanation just as easily for all anyone seemed to care about lord yenaros most unusual and shortest guest miles helped himself at a bowl from which everyone else seemed to be ladling their drinks and touched the cup to his lips but did not swallow he looked up to find himself under the gaze of a slightly older woman who had come late to the party with a couple of friends and who had been lingering quietly on the fringes of the gathering she smiled at him miles smiled back and slid around the table to her side composing a suitable opening line she took the initiative from him lord vorkosigan would you care to take a walk in the garden with me why certainly is lord yenaros garden a sight to see in the dark i think it will interest you the smile dropped from her face as if wiped away with a cloth the moment she turned her back to the room to be replaced with a look of grim determination miles fingered the comm link in his trouser pocket and followed in the perfumed wake of her robes once out of sight of the rooms glass doors among the neglected shrubbery her step quickened she said nothing more miles limped after her he was unsurprised when they came to a redenameled squarelinteled gate and found a person waiting a slight androgynous shape with a dark hooded robe protecting its bald head from the nights gathering dew the ba will escort you the rest of the way said the woman the rest of the way where a short walk the ba spoke in a soft alto very well miles held up a restraining hand and drew his comm link from his pocket and said into it base im leaving yenaros premises for a while track me but dont interrupt me unless i call for you the drivers voice came back in a dubious tone yes my lord where are you going im taking a walk with a lady wish me luck oh the drivers tone grew more amused less dubious good luck my lord thank you miles closed the channel all right the woman seated herself on a rickety bench and drew her robes around herself with the air of one preparing for a lengthy wait miles followed the ba out the gate and past another residence across a roadway and into a shallow wooded ravine the ba produced a handlight to prevent stumbles on rocks and roots politely playing it before miless polished boots which were going to be a lot less polished if this went on very far they climbed up out of the ravine into what was obviously the back portion of another suburban estate in an even more neglected condition than yenaros a dark bulk looming through the trees was an apparently deserted house but they turned right on an overgrown path the ba pausing to sweep damp branches out of miless way and then back down toward the stream they emerged in a wide clearing where a wooden pavilion stoodsome ghemlords former favorite picnic spot for al fresco brunches no doubt duckweed choked a pond crowding out a few sad wateririses they crossed the pond on an arched footbridge which creaked so alarmingly miles was momentarily glad he was no bigger a faint familiar pearlescent glow emanated from the pavilions vineveiled openings miles touched the great key hidden in his tunic for reassurance right this is it the ba servitor pulled aside some greenery gestured miles inside and went to stand guard by the footbridge cautiously miles stepped within the small oneroomed building the haut rian degtiar or a close facsimile sat or stood or something the usual few centimeters above the floor a blank pale sphere she had to be riding in a floatchair her light seemed dimmed stopped down to a furtive feeble glow wait let her make the first move the moment stretched miles began to be afraid this conversation was going to be as disjointed as their first one but then she spoke in the same breathless transmissionflattened voice he had heard before lord vorkosigan i have contacted you as i said i would to make arrangements for the safe return of my thing the great key said miles you know what it is now ive been doing a little research since our first chat she moaned what do you want of me money i have none military secrets i know none dont go coy on me and dont panic i want very little miles unfastened his tunic and drew out the great key oh you have it here oh give it to me the pearl bobbed forward miles stepped back not so fast ive kept it safe and ill give it back but i feel i should get something in return i merely want to know exactly how it came to be delivered or misdelivered into my hands and why its no business of yours barrayaran perhaps not but every instinct i own is crying out that this is some kind of setup of me or of barrayar through me and as a barrayaran impsec officer that makes it very explicitly my business im willing to tell you everything i saw and heard but you must return the favor to start with i want to know what ba lura was doing with a piece of the late empresss major regalia on a space station her voice went low and tart stealing it now give it back a key a key is not of great worth without a lock i grant its a pretty elegant historical artifact but if ba lura was planning on a privately funded retirement surely there are more valuable things to steal from the celestial garden and ones less certain to be missed was lura planning to blackmail you is that why you murdered it a completely absurd chargethe hautlady and miles were each others alibisbut he was curious to see what it would stir up in the way of response the reaction was instantaneous you vile little i did not drive lura to its death if anything you are responsible god i hope not this may be so and if it is i must know ladythere is no cetagandan security within ten kilometers of us right now or you could have them strip this bauble off me and dump my carcass in the nearest alleyway right now why not why did ba lura steal the great keyfor its pleasure the ba makes a hobby of collecting cetagandan imperial regalia does it you are horrible then to whom was ba lura taking the thing to sell not sell ha then you know who not exactly she hesitated some secrets are not mine to give they belong to the celestial lady whom you serve yes even in death yes a note of pride edged her voice and whom the ba betrayed even in death no not betrayed we had a disagreement an honest disagreement yes between a thief and a murderess no quite so but the accusation definitely had her going some guilt there yeah tell me about guilt look ill make it easy for you ill begin ivan and i were coming over from the barrayaran courier jumpship in a personnel pod we docked into this dump of a freight bay the ba lura wearing a station employee uniform and some badly applied false hair lumbered into our pod as soon as the lock cycled open and reached we thought for a weapon we jumped it and took away a nerve disrupter and this miles held up the great key the ba shook us off and escaped and i stuck this in my pocket till i could find out more the next time i saw the ba it was dead in a pool of its own blood on the floor of the funeral rotunda i found this unnerving to say the least now its your turn you say ba lura stole the key from your charge when did you discover the great key was missing i found it missing from its place that day how long could it have been gone when had you last checked it it is not being used every day now because of the period of mourning for the celestial lady i had last seen it when i arranged her regalia two days before that so potentially it could have been missing for three days before you discovered its absence when did the ba go missing im not sure i saw ba lura the evening before that cuts it down a little so the ba could have been gone with the key as early as the previous night do the ba servitors pass pretty freely in and out of the celestial garden or is it hard freely they run all our errands so ba lura came back when the night of your arrival but the ba would not see me it claimed to be sick i could have had it dragged into my presence but i did not want to inflict such an indignity they were in it together right i went to see the ba in the morning the whole sorry story came out then the ba was trying to take the great key to someone and entered into the wrong docking bay then someone was supposed to supply a personnel pod then someone was waiting on a ship in orbit i didnt say that keep pressing her its working though it did make him feel faintly guilty to be badgering the distraught old lady so even if possibly for her own good dont let up so the ba blundered onto our pod andwhat was the rest of its story tell me exactly ba lura was attacked by barrayaran soldiers who stole the great key how many soldiers six miles s eyes widened in delight and then what ba lura begged for its life and head and honor but they laughed and ejected the ba and flew away lies lies at last and yet the ba was only human anyone who had screwed up so hugely might retell the story so as to make themselves look less at fault what exactly did it say we said her voice grated with anger you insulted the celestial lady then what the ba came home in shame so why didnt the ba call on cetagandan security to shake us down and get the great key back on the spot there was a longer silence then she said the ba could not do that but it confessed to me and i came to you to humble myself and beg for the return of my charge and my honor why didnt the ba confess to you the night before i dont know so while you set about your retrieval task ba lura cut its throat in great grief and shame she said lowly yeah why not at least wait to see if you could coax the key back from me so why not cut its throat privately in its own quarters why advertise its shame to the entire galactic community isnt that a bit unusual was the ba supposed to attend the biergifting ceremony yes and you were too yes and you believed the bas story yes lady i think you are lost in the woods let me tell you what happened in the personnel pod as i saw it there were no six soldiers just me my cousin and the pod pilot there was no conversation no begging or pleading no slurs on the celestial lady ba lura just yelped and ran off it didnt even fight very hard in fact it scarcely fought us at all strange dont you think in a handtohand struggle for something so important that the ba slit its own throat over its loss the next day we were left scratching our heads holding the damned thing and wondering what the hell now you know that one of us me or the ba is lying i know which one give the great key to me was all she could say its not yours but i think i was framed by someone who apparently wants to drag barrayar into a cetagandan internal disagreement why what am i being set up for her silence might indicate that these were the first new thoughts to penetrate her panic in two days or it might not in any case she only whispered not yours miles sighed i couldnt agree with you more milady and i am glad to return your charge but in light of the whole situation i would like to be able to testifyunder fastpenta if need bejust who i gave the great key back to you could be anyone in that bubble my aunt alys for all i know or cetagandan security or who knows i will return it to you facetoface he held out his hand halfopen the key resting invitingly across his palm is that the last of your price if yes ill ask no more ff it was a small triumph he was going to see a hautwoman and ivan wasnt it would doubtless embarrass the old dragon to reveal herself to outlander eyes but dammit given the runaround miles had suffered she owed him something and he was deathly serious about being able to identify where the great key went the haut rian degtiar handmaiden of the star creche was certainly not the only player in this game very well she whispered the white bubble faded to transparency and was gone from between them oh said miles in a very small voice she sat in a floatchair clothed from slender neck to ankle in flowing robes of shining white a dozen shimmering textures lying one atop another her hair glinted ebony masses of it that poured down across her shoulders past her lap to coil around her feet when she stood it would trail on the floor like a banner her enormous eyes were an ice blue of such arctic purity as to make lady gelles eyes look like mudpuddles skin miles felt he had never seen skin before just blotched bags people wore around themselves to keep from leaking this perfect ivory surface his hands ached with the desire to touch it just once and die her lips were warm as if roses pulsed with blood how old was she twenty forty this was a hautwoman who could tell who could care men of the old religion had worshipped on their knees icons far less glorious in beaten silver and hammered gold miles was on his knees now and could not remember how hed come to be there he knew now why they called it falling in love there was the same nauseating vertigo of free fall the same vast exhilaration the same sick certainty of broken bones upon impact with a rapidly rising reality he inched forward and laid the great key in front of her perfectly shaped whiteslippered feet and sank back and waited i am fortunes fool chapter six she bent forward one graceful hand darting down to retrieve her solemn charge she laid the great key in her lap and pulled a long necklace from beneath her layered white garments the chain held a ring decorated with a thick raised birdpattern the gold lines of electronic contacts gleaming like filigree upon its surface she inserted the ring into the seal atop the rod nothing happened her breath drew in she glared down at miles what have you done to it milady i i nothing i swear by my word as vorkosigan i didnt even drop it whats supposed to happen it should open um um he would break into a desperate sweat but he was too damned cold he was dizzy with the scent of her and the celestial music of her unfiltered voice there are only three possibilities if theres something wrong with it someone broke itnot me i swear could that have been the secret of ba luras peculiar intrusion maybe the ba had broken it and had been seeking a scapegoat upon whom to shuffle the blame or someones reprogrammed it or least likely theres been some kind of substitution pulled a duplicate or or her eyes widened and her lips parted moving in some subvocalization not least likely miles hazarded it would surely be the most difficult but it crosses my mind that maybe someone didnt think you would be getting it back from me if its a counterfeit maybe it was meant to be on its way to barrayar in a diplomatic pouch right now or or something no that didnt quite make sense but she sat utterly still her face tense with panic her hands clutching the rod milady talk to me if its a duplicate its obviously a very good duplicate you now have it to turn over at the ceremony so what if it doesnt work whos going to check the function of some obsolete piece of electronics the great key is not obsolete we used it every day its some kind of data link right you have a timewindow here nine days if you think its been compromised wipe it and reprogram it from your backup files if that thing in your hand is some kind of a nonworking dummy youve maybe got time to make a real duplicate and reprogram it but dont just sit there with death in your lovely eyes talk to me i must do as ba lura did she whispered the ba was right this is the end no why its just a a thing who cares not me she held up the rod her arcticblue eyes fixing on his face at last her gaze made him want to scuttle into the shadows like a crab to hide his merely human ugliness but he held fast before her there is no backup she said this is the sole key miles felt faint and it wasnt just from her perfume no backup he choked are you people crazy it is a matter of control what does the damn thing really do anyway she hesitated then said it is the datakey to the haut gene bank all the frozen genetic samples are stored in a randomized order for security without the key no one knows what is where to recreate the files someone would have to physically examine and reclassify each and every sample there are hundreds of thousands of samplesone for every haut who has ever lived it would take an army of geneticists working for a generation to recreate the great key this is a real disaster then huh he said brightly blinking his teeth gritted now i know i was framed he climbed to his feet and threw back his head defying the onslaught of her beauty lady what is really going on here ill ask you one more time with feeling what in gods green ninety hells was the ba lura ever doing with the great key on a space station no outlander may somebody made it my business sucked me right into it i dont think i could escape now if i tried and i think you need an ally it took you a day and a half just to arrange this second meeting with me nine days left you dont have time to go it alone you need a trained security man and for some strange reason you dont seem to want to get one from your own side she rocked just slightly in frozen misery in a faint rustle of fabrics if you dont think im worthy of being let in on your secrets miles went on wildly then explain to me how you think i could possibly make things any worse than they are right now her blue eyes searched him for he knew not what but he thought if she asked him to open his veins for her right here and now the only thing hed say would be how wide it was my celestial ladys desire she began fearfully and stopped miles clutched at his shredded selfcontrol everything shed spilled so far was either obviously deducible or common knowledge at least in her milieu now she was getting to the good stuff and knew it he could tell by the way shed stalled out milady he chose his words with extreme care if the ba did not commit suicide it was certainly murdered and we both have good reason to prefer the second scenario ba lura was your servitor your colleague dare i guess friend i saw its body in the rotunda a very dangerous and daring person arranged that hideous tableau there was a deep mischief and mockery in it was that pain in those cool eyes so hard to tell i have old and very personal reasons to particularly dislike being made the unwitting target of persons of cruel humor i dont know if you can understand this perhaps she said slowly yes look past the surface see me not this joke of a body and i am the one person on eta ceta you know didnt do it its the only certainty we share so far i claim a right to know whos doing this to us and the only chance in hell i have to figure out who is to know exactly why still she sat silent i already know enough to destroy you miles added earnestly tell me enough to save you her sculpted chin rose in bleak decision when she blessed him with her outward attention at last it was total and terrifying it was a longstanding disagreement he strained to hear to keep his head clear to concentrate on the words and not just on the enchanting melody of her voice between the celestial lady and the emperor my lady had long thought that the haut gene bank was too centralized in the heart of the celestial garden she favored the dispersal of copies for safety my lord favored keeping it all under his personal protectionfor safety they both sought the good of the haut each in their own way i see miles murmured encouraging her with as much delicacy as he could muster all good guys here right the emperor forbade her plan but as she neared the end of her life she came to feel that her loyalty to the haut must outweigh her loyalty to her son twenty years ago she began to have copies made in secret a large project miles said huge and slow but she brought it to fruition how many copies eight one for each of the planetary satraps exact copies yes i have reason to know i have been the celestial ladys supervisor of geneticists for five years now ah so you are something of a trained scientist you know about extreme care and scrupulous honesty how else should i serve my lady she shrugged but you dont know much ill bet about covert ops chicanery hm if there are eight exact copies there must be eight exact great keys right no not yet my lady was saving the duplication of the key to the last moment a matter of control miles finished smoothly how did i guess a faint flash of resentment at his humor sparked in her eyes and miles bit his tongue it was no laughing matter to haut rian degtiar the celestial lady knew her time was drawing near she made me and the ba lura the executors of her will in this matter we were to deliver the copies of the gene bank to each of the eight satrap governors upon the occasion of her funeral which they would be certain to all attend together but she died more suddenly than she had expected she had not yet made arrangements for the duplication of the great key it was a problem of considerable technical and cipher skill as all of the empires resources went into its original creation ba lura and i had all her instructions for the banks but nothing for how the key was to be duplicated and delivered or even when she had planned this to happen the ba and i were not sure what to do ah miles said faintly he dared not offer any comment at all for fear of impeding the free flow at last of information he hung on her words barely breathing ba lura thought if we took the great key to one of the satrap governors he might use his resources to duplicate it for us i thought this was a very dangerous idea because of the temptation to take it exclusively for himself ah excuse me let me see if i follow this i know you consider the haut gene bank a most private matter but what are the political sideeffects of setting up new haut reproductive centers on each of cetagandas eight satrap planets the celestial lady thought the empire had ceased to grow at the time of the defeat of the barrayar expedition that we had become static stagnant enervated she thought if the empire could only undergo mitosis like a cell the haut might start to grow again become reenergized with the splitting of the gene bank there would be eight new centers of authority for expansion eight new potential imperial capitals miles whispered yes i suppose eight new centers civil war was only the beginning of the possibilities eight new cetagandan empires each expanding like killer coral at their neighbors expense a nightmare of cosmic proportions i think i can see said miles carefully why perhaps the emperor was less than enthused by his mothers admittedly sound biological reasoning something to be said on both sides dont you think i serve the celestial lady said the haut rian degtiar simply and the haut genome the empires shortterm political adjustments are not my business so all this ah genetic shuffling would the cetagandan emperor by chance regard this as treason on your part how said the haut rian degtiar it was my duty to obey the celestial lady oh the eight satrap governors have all committed treason in it though she added matteroffactly have committed they all took delivery of their gene banks last week at the welcoming banquet ba lura and i succeeded in that part of the celestial ladys plan at least treasure chests for which none of them have keys i dont know each of them you see the celestial lady felt it would be better if each of the satrap governors thought that he alone was the recipient of the new copy of the haut gene bank each would strive better to keep it secret that way do you knowi have to ask this im just not sure i want to hear the answer do you know to which of the eight satrap governors ba lura was trying to take the great key for duplication when it ran into us no she said ah miles exhaled in pure satisfaction now now i know why i was set up and why the ba died fine lines appeared on her ivory brow as she stared at him dont you see it too the ba didnt hit us barrayarans on the way out it hit us on the way back your ba was suborned ba lura did take the key to one of the satrap governors and received in return not a true copy because there was no time for the extensive decoding required but a decoy which the ba then was sent to deliberately lose to us which it did although not i suspect in quite the manner it had originally planned almost certainly not as planned he found himself pacing keyed up and hectic he ought not to limp before her it brought attention to his deformities but he could not keep still and while everybody is off chasing barrayarans the satrap governor quietly goes home with the only real copy of the great key getting a large jumpstart on the hautcompetition after first arranging the bas reward for its doubletreason and incidentally eliminating the only witness to the truth oh yes it works or it would have worked if only the satrap governor had remembered that no battleplan survives first contact with the enemy not when the enemy is me he stared into her eyes willing her to believe in him striving not to melt how soon can you analyze this great key and support or explode these theories i will examine it immediately tonight but whatever has been done to it my examination will not tell me who did it barrayaran her voice grew glacial with this thought i doubt you could have created a true duplicate but a nonworking forgery is certainly within your capabilities if this one is falsewhere is the real one it seems that is just what i must discover milady to to clear my name to redeem my honor in your eyes the intrinsic fascination of an intellectual puzzle had brought him to this interview hed thought curiosity was his strongest driving force till suddenly his whole personality had become engaged it was like being underno like becoming an avalanche if i can discover this will you what look favorably upon his suit despise him for an outlander barbarian all the same let me see you again i dont know reminded her hand drifted to the control on her floatchair for the concealing forcescreen no no dont go we must have some way of communicating he said hastily before she could disappear again behind that faintly humming barrier her head tilted considering this she drew a small comm link from her robes it was undecorated utilitarian but like the nerve disruptor hed taken from ba lura perfectly designed in what miles was beginning to recognize as the haut style she whispered a command into it in a moment the androgynous ba appeared from its guard post beside the pond did its eyes widen just slightly to see its mistress without her shell give me your comm link and wait outside haut rian degtiar ordered the little ba nodded and turned the device over to her without question and withdrew silently she held the comm link out to miles i use this to communicate with my senior servitors when they run errands outside the celestial garden for me here he wanted to touch her but scarcely dared he instead extended his cupped hands toward her like a shy man offering flowers to a goddess she dropped the comm link into them gingerly as into the hands of a leper or an enemy is it secured he dared to ask temporarily in other words it was the ladys private line only as long as no one in higherlevel cetagandan security troubled to break in right he sighed it wont work you cant send signals into my embassy without causing my superiors to ask a whole lot of questions id rather not answer just now and i cant give you my comm link either im supposed to turn it in and i dont think i can get away with telling them i lost it reluctantly he handed the link back to her but we have to meet again somehow yes oh yes if im going to be risking my reputation and maybe my life on the validity of my reasoning id like to prop it up with a few facts one fact was almost certain someone with enough wit and nerve to murder one of the most senior imperial servitors under the nose of cetagandas own emperor would hardly balk at threatening a decidedly unsenior female degtiar the thought was obscene hideous a barrayaran scions diplomatic immunity would be an even more useless shield no doubt but that was merely the price of the game i think you could be in grave danger it might be better to play along for a bitdont reveal to anyone you have obtained this key from me i have a funny feeling im not following his script ysee he paced nervously back and forth before her if you can find out anything at all about ba luras real activities in the few days before it dieddont run afoul of your own security though they have to be following up on the bas death i will contact you when and how i can barrayaran slowly one pale hand caressed the control pad on the arm of the floatchair and a dim gray mist coalesced around her like a fairy spell of seeming the ba servitor returned to the pavilion to escort not miles but its mistress away miles was left to stumble back through the dark to yenaros estate alone it was raining miles was not surprised to find that the ghemwoman was no longer waiting on the bench by the redenameled gate he let himself in quietly and paused just outside the lighted garden doors to brush as many of the water droplets as possible off his formal blacks and to wipe his face he then sacrificed the handkerchief to the redemption of his boots and quietly dropped the sodden object behind a bush he slipped back inside no one noticed his entry the party was continuing a little louder with a few new faces replacing some of the previous ones the cetagandans did not use alcohol for inebriation but some of the guests had a lateparty dissociated air about them similar to overindulgers miles had witnessed at home if intelligent conversation had been difficult before it was clearly hopeless now he felt himself no better off than the ghemlings drunk on information dizzy with intrigue everyone to their own secret addictions i suppose he wanted to collect ivan and escape as swiftly as possible before his head exploded ah there you are lord vorkosigan lord yenaro appeared at miless elbow looking faintly anxious i could not find you i took a long walk with a lady miles said ivan was nowhere to be seen where is my cousin lord vorpatril is taking a tour of the house with lady arvan and lady benello said yenaro he glanced through a wide archway at the rooms opposite side which framed a spiral staircase in a hall beyond theyve been gone an astonishingly long time yenaros smile attempted to be knowing but came out oddly puzzled since before you i dont quite ah well would you care for a drink yes please said miles distractedly he took it from yenaros hand and gulped without hesitation his eyes almost crossed considering the possibilities of ivan plus two beautiful ghemwomen though to his hautdazzled senses all the ghemwomen in the room looked as coarse and dull as backcountry slatterns just now the effect would wear off with time he hoped he dreaded the thought of his own next encounter with a mirror what had the haut rian degtiar seen looking at him a simian blackclad gnome twitching and babbling he pulled up a chair and sat rather abruptly the spiral staircase bracketed in his sights ivan hurry up yenaro lingered by his side and began a disjointed conversation about proportional theories of architecture through history art and the senses and the natural esters trade on barrayar but miles swore the man was as focused on the staircase as he was miles finished his first drink and most of a second before ivan appeared in the shadows at the top of the stairs ivan hesitated in the dimness his hand checking the fit of his green uniform which appeared fully assembled or reassembled he was alone he descended with one hand clutching the curving rail which floated without apparent support in echo of the stairs arc he jerked a stiff frown into a stiff smile before entering the main room and the light his head swiveled till he spotted miles toward whom he made a straight line lord vorpatril yenaro greeted him you had a long tour did you see everything ivan bared his teeth everything even the light yenaros smile did not slip but his eyes seemed to fill with questions im so glad a guest called to him from across the room and yenaro was momentarily distracted ivan bent down to whisper behind his hand into miless ear get us the hell out of here i think ive been poisoned miles looked up startled dyou want to call down the lightflyer no just back to the embassy in the groundcar but no dammit ivan hissed just quietly before that smirking bastard goes upstairs he nodded toward yenaro who was now standing at the foot of the staircase gazing upward i take it you dont think it is acute oh it was cute all right ivan snarled you didnt murder anybody up there did you no but i thought theyd never tell you in the car youd better miles clambered to his feet they perforce had to pass yenaro who attached himself to them like a good host and saw them to his front door with suitably polite farewells ivans goodbyes might have been etched in acid as soon as the canopy sealed over their heads miles commanded give ivan ivan settled back still seething i was set up this comes as a surprise to you coz by lady arvan and lady benello they were the setup yenaro was behind it im sure of it youre right about that damned fountain being a trap miles i see it now beauty as bait all over again what happened to you you know all those rumors about cetagandan aphrodisiacs yes well sometime this evening that sonofabitch yenaro slipped me an antiaphrodisiac urn are you sure i mean there are natural causes for these moments im told it was a setup i didnt seduce them they seduced me wafted me upstairs to this amazing roomit had to have been all arranged in advance god it was it was his voice broke in a sigh it was glorious for a little while and then i realized i couldnt like perform what did you do it was too late to get out gracefully so i winged it it was all i could do to keep em from noticing what i made up a lot of instant barbarian folklorei told em a vor prides himself on selfcontrol that its not considered polite on barrayar for a man to you know before his lady has three times it was considered insulting to her i stroked i rubbed i scratched i recited poetry i nuzzled and nibbled andcripes my fingers are cramped his speech was a bit slurred too miles noticed i thought theyd never fall asleep ivan paused a slow smirk displaced the snarl on his face but they were smiling when they finally did the smirk faded into a look of bleak dismay what do you want to bet those two are the biggest female ghemgossips on eta ceta no takers here said miles fascinated let the punishment fit the crime or in this case the trap fit the prey someone had studied his weaknesses and someone just as clearly had studied ivans we could have the impsec office do a data sweep for the tale over the next few days if you breathe a word of this ill wring your scrawny neck if i can find it youve got to confess to the embassy physician blood tests oh yes i want a chemical scan the instant i hit the door what if the effects permanent ba vorpatril miles intoned eyes alight dammit i didnt laugh at you no thats true you didnt miles sighed i expect the physician will find whatever it was metabolizes rapidly or yenaro wouldnt have drunk the stuff himself you think remember the zlati ale id bet my impsec silver eyes that was the vector ivan relaxed slightly obviously relieved at this professional analysis after a minute he added yenaros done you now and hes done me third times a charm whats next do you suppose and can we do him first miles was silent for a long time that depends he said at last on whether yenaros merely amusing himself or whether he too is being set up and on whether theres any connection between yenaros backer and the death of ba lura connection what possible connection we are the connection ivan a couple of barrayaran backcountry boys come to the big city and ripe for the plucking somebody is using us and i think somebody has just made a major mistake in his choice of tools or fools ivan stared at his venomous tone have you got rid of that little toy youre packing yet he demanded suspiciously yes and no oh shit i knew better than to trustwhat the hell do you mean by yes and no either you have or you havent right the object has been returned yes thats that then no not quite miles you had better start talking to me yes i think i better had miles sighed they were approaching the legation district after youre done in the infirmary i have a few confessions to make but ifwhenyou talk to the impsec nightduty officer about yenaro dont mention the other yet oh drawled ivan in a tone of deep suspicion things have gotten complex you think they were simple before i mean complex beyond the scope of mere security concerns into genuine diplomatic ones of extreme delicacy maybe too delicate to submit to the sort of booted paranoids who sometimes end up running local impsec offices thats a judgment call that ill have to make myself when im sure im ready but this isnt a game anymore and its no longer feasible for me to run without backup i need help god help me we knew that yesterday oh yes but its even deeper than i first thought over our heads miles hesitated and smiled sourly i dont know ivan how good are you at treading water alone in his suites bathroom miles slowly peeled off his black house uniform now in desperate need of attention from the embassys laundry he glanced at himself sideways in the mirror then resolutely looked away he considered the problem as he stood in the shower to the haut all normal humans doubtless looked like some lower lifeform from the haut rian degtiars foreshortened perspective perhaps there was little to choose between him and say ivan and ghemlords did win haut wives from time to time for great deeds and the vor and the ghemlords were very much alike even maz had said so how great a deed very great well hed always wanted to save the empire the cetagandan just wasnt the empire hed pictured was all life was like that always throwing you curveballs youve gone mad you know to hope to even think it if he defeated the late dowager empresss plot might the cetagandan emperor be grateful enough to give him rians hand if he advanced the late dowager empresss plot might the haut rian degtiar be grateful enough to give him her love to do both simultaneously would be a tactical feat of supernatural scope barrayars interests lay unusually squarely with the interests of the cetagandan emperor obviously it was his clear impsec duty to foil the girl and save the villain right my head hurts reason was returning to him slowly the astonishing effect of the haut rian degtiar wearing off wasnt it she hadnt exactly tried to suborn him after all even if rian was as ugly as the witch baba yaga hed still have to be following up on this to a point he needed to prove barrayar had not filched the great key and the only certain way of doingthat was to find its real thief he wondered if one could get a hangover from excess passion if so his was apparently starting while he was still drunk which did not seem quite fair eight cetagandan satrap governors had been led into treason by the late empress optimistic to think that only one could be a murderer but only one possessed the real great key lord x seven chances of guessing wrong against one of guessing right not favorable odds ill figure something out chapter seven ivan was taking a long time downstairs in the infirmary miles shucked on his black fatigues and barefoot fired up his comconsole for a quick review of the eight hautlord satrap governors the satrap governors were all chosen from a pool of men who were close imperial relations halfbrothers and uncles and greatuncles in both paternal and maternal lines two current officeholders were of the degtiar constellation each ruled his satrapy for a set term of only five years then he was required to shiftsometimes to permanent retirement back at the capital on eta ceta sometimes to another satrapy a couple of the older and more experienced men had cycled this way through the entire empire the purpose of the term limitation of course was to prevent the buildup of a personal local power base to anyone who might harbor secret imperial pretensions so far so sensible so which among them had been tempted into hubris by the dowager empress and ba lura for that matter how had she contacted them all if shed been working on her plan for twenty years shed had lots of time still that long ago how could she have predicted which men would be satrap governors on the unknown date of her death the governors must have all been brought into the plot quite recently miles stared narroweyed at the list of his eight suspects i have to cut this down somehow several somehows if he assumed lord x had personally murdered the ba lura he could eliminate the weakest and most fragile elderly men a premature assumption any of the hautlords might possess a ghemguard both loyal and capable enough to be delegated the task while the satrap governor lingered front and center in the biergifting ceremonies his alibi established before dozens of witnesses no disloyalty to barrayar intended but miles found himself wishing he were a cetagandan security man right nowspecifically the one in charge of whatever investigation was progressing on ba luras supposed suicide but there was no way he could insert himself inconspicuously into that data flow and he wasnt sure rian had the mindset for it not to mention the urgent necessity of keeping cetagandan securitys attention as far from her as possible miles sighed in frustration it wasnt his task to solve the bas murder anyway it was his task to locate the real great key well he knew in general where it wasin orbit aboard one of the satrap governors flagships how else to finger the right one a chime at his door interrupted his furious meditations he hastily shut down the comconsole and called enter ivan trod within looking extremely dyspeptic how did it go miles asked waving him to a chair ivan dragged a heavy and comfortable armchair up to the comconsole and flung himself across it sideways scowling he was still wearing his undress greens you were right it was taken by mouth and it metabolizes rapidly not so rapidly that our medics couldnt get a sample though ivan rubbed his arm they said it would have been untraceable by morning no permanent harm done then except to my reputation your colonel vorreedi just blew in i thought you might like to know at least he took me seriously we had a long talk just now about lord yenaro vorreedi didnt strike me as a booted paranoid by the way ivan let the implication so hadnt you better go see him hang in the air miles left it there good i think you didnt mention ah not yet but if you dont cough up some explanations im going back to him for another pass fair enough miles sighed and steeled himself as briefly as the complications permitted he summed up his conversation with the haut rian degtiar for ivan leaving out only a description of her incredible beauty and his own stunned response to it that was not ivans business that especially was not ivans business so it seems to me miles ran down at last that the only way we can certainly prove that barrayar had nothing to do with it is to find which satrap governor has the real great key he pointed orbitward ivans eyes were round his mouth screwed up in an expression of total dismay wewe miles weve only been here for two and a half days how did we get put in charge of the cetagandan empire isnt this cetagandan securitys job would you trust them to clear us of blame miles shrugged and forged on into ivans hesitation we only have nine days left ive thought of three strings that could maybe lead us back to the right man yenaro is one of them a few more words in our protocol officers ear could put the machinery of impsec here into tracing yenaros connections without bringing up the matter of the great key yet the next string is ba luras murder and i havent figured out how i can pull that one yet the other string lies in astropolitical analysis and that i can do look on the comconsole miles called up a schematic threedimensional map of the cetagandan empire its wormhole routes and its immediate neighbors the ba lura could have foisted that decoy key onto any number of outlander delegations instead it picked barrayarans or rather its satrapgovernor master did why maybe we were the only ones there at the right time ivan suggested mm im trying to reduce the random factors please if yenaros backer is the same as our man we were picked in advance to be framed now he waved at the map picture a scenario where the cetagandan empire breaks apart and the pieces begin an attempt to expand which if any benefit from trouble with barrayar ivans brows went up and he leaned forward staring at the glowing array of spheres and lines above the vid plate well rho ceta is positioned to expand toward komarr or would be if we werent sitting on two thirds of the wormhole jumps between mu ceta just got a bloody nose administered by us when it attempted to expand past vervain into the hegen hub those are the two most obvious these other three ivan pointed and eta ceta itself are all interior i dont see any benefit to them then theres the other side of the nexus miles waved at the display sigma ceta bordering the vega station groups and xi ceta giving onto marilac if they were seeking to break out it might be expedient for them to have the empires military resources tied up far away against barrayar four out of eight its a start ivan conceded ivans analysis matched his own then well theyd both had the same strategic training it stood to reason still miles was obscurely comforted it wasnt all the hallucination of his own overdriven imagination if ivan could see it too its a triangulation said miles if i can get any of the other lines of investigation to eliminate even part of the list the final overlap ought to well it would be nice if it all came down to one and then what ivan demanded doggedly his brows drawn down in suspicion what do you have in mind forus to do then im not sure but i do think youd agree that a quiet conclusion to this mess would be preferable to a splashy one eh oh yeah ivan chewed on his lower lip eyeing the wormhole nexus map so when do we report not yet but i think wed better start documenting it all personal logs so that anybody who came after themmiles trusted not posthumously but that was the unspoken thoughtwould at least have a chance of unraveling the events ive been doing that since the first day ivan informed him grimly its locked in my valise oh good miles hesitated when you talked to colonel vorreedi did you plant the idea that yenaro had a highplaced backer not exactly id like you to talk to him again then try to direct his attention toward the satrap governors somehow why dont you talk to him im not ready not yet not tonight im still assimilating it all and technically he is my impsec superior here or would be if i were on active duty id like to limit my um outright lies to him ivan completed sweetly miles grimaced but did not deny it look i have an access in this matter that no other impsec officer could due to my social position i dont want to see the opportunity wasted but it also limits mei cant get at the routine legwork the downanddirty details i need im too conspicuous i have to play to my own strengths and get others to play to my weaknesses ivan sighed all right ill talk to him just this once with a tired grunt he heaved himself out of his chair and wandered toward the door he looked back over his shoulder the trouble coz with your playing the spider in the center of this web pulling all the strings is that sooner or later all the interested parties are going to converge back along those strings to you you do realize that dont you and what are you going to do then o mastermind he bowed himself out with alltooeffective irony miles hunched down in his station chair and groaned and keyed up his list again the next morning ambassador vorobyev was called away from what was becoming his customary breakfast with barrayars young envoys in his private dining room by the time he returned miles and ivan had finished eating the ambassador did not sit down again but instead favored miles with a bemused look lord vorkosigan you have an unusual visitor miless heart leapt rian here impossible his mind did a quick involuntary review of his undress greens yes his insignia were on straight his fly was fastenedwho sir ghemcolonel dag benin of cetagandan imperial security he is an officer of middle rank assigned to internal affairs at the celestial garden and he wants to speak privately with you miles tried not to hyperventilate whats gone wrong maybe nothing yet calm down did he say what about it seems he was ordered to investigate the suicide of that poor baslave the other day and your ah erratic movements brought you to his negative attention i thought youd come to regret getting out of line and am i to talk to him then we have decided to extend that courtesy yes weve shown him to one of the small parlors on the ground floor it is of course monitored youll have an embassy bodyguard present i dont suspect benin of harboring any murderous intentions it will merely be a reminder of your status we have decided so colonel vorreedi whom miles still had not met and probably vorobyev too would be listening to every word oh shit very good sir miles stood and followed the ambassador ivan watched him go with the suffused expression of a man anticipating the imminent arrival of some unpleasant form of cosmic justice the small parlor was exactly that a comfortably furnished room intended for private teteatetes between two or three persons with the embassy security staff as an invisible fourth ghemcolonel benin apparently had no objection to anything he had to say being recorded a barrayaran guard standing outside the door swung in behind miles and the ambassador as they entered and took up his post stolidly and silently he was tall and husky even for a barrayaran with a remarkably blank face he wore a senior sergeants tabs and insignia of commando corps by which miles deduced that the lowwattage expression was a puton ghemcolonel benin waiting for them rose politely as they entered he was of no more than middle stature so probably not overstocked with hautgenes in his recent ancestrythe haut favored height he had likely acquired his present post by merit rather than social rank then not necessarily a plus from miless point of view benin was very trim in the dark red cetagandan dress uniform that was everyday garb for security staff in the celestial garden he wore of course full formal face paint in the imperial pattern rather than that of his clan marking his primary allegiance a white base with intricate black curves and red accents that miles thought of as the bleedingzebra look but by association it was a pattern that would command instant and profound respect and total abject cooperation on eight planets barrayar of course was not one of them miles tried to judge the face beneath the paint neither youthful and inexperienced nor aged and sly benin appeared to be a bit over fortystandard young for his rank but not unusually so the default expression of the face seemed to be one of attentive seriousness though he managed a brief polite smile when vorobyev introduced him to miles and a brief relieved smile when vorobyev left them alone together good morning lord vorkosigan benin began clearly well trained in the social arena he managed to keep his glance at miles s physique limited to one quick covert summation did your ambassador explain to you why i am here yes colonel benin i understand you were assigned to investigate the death of that poor fellowif fellow is the right termwe saw so shockingly laid out on the floor of the rotunda the other day the best defense is a good offense did you finally decide it was a suicide benins eyes narrowed obviously but an odd timbre in his voice undercut the statement well yes it was obvious from the exsanguination that the ba died on the spot rather than having its throat cut elsewhere and the body transported but it has occurred to me that if the autopsy showed the ba was stunned unconscious when it died it would rather rule out suicide its a subtle testthe shock of death tends to cover the shock of stunningbut you can find the traces if youre looking was such a test done do you know no miles was not sure if he meant it wasnt done orno benin had to know why not if i were you its the first test id ask for can you get it done now though two days late is not ideal the autopsy is over the ba has been cremated benin stated flatly what already before the case was closed who ordered that not you surely notlord vorkosigan this is not your concern this is not what i came to talk with you about benin said stiffly then paused why this morbid interest in the celestial ladys late servant i thought it was the most interesting thing id seen since i came to eta ceta its in my line you see ive done civil security cases at home murder investigations well one anyway successfully i might add yes what was this cetagandan officers experience in such things the celestial garden was such a wellordered place does this sort of thing happen here often no benin stared at miles with intensified interest so the man might be well read but lacked handson experience at least since hed been promoted to this post he was damned quick at catching nuances though it seems awfully premature to me to cremate the victim before the case is closed there are always lateoccurring questions i assure you lord vorkosigan ba lura was not carried unconscious into the funeral rotunda dead or alive even the ceremonial guards would have noticed that did the slight spin on his tone hint that perhaps the ceremonial guards were chosen for beauty rather than brains well actually i had a theory miles burbled on enthusiastically youre just the man to confirm or disprove it for me too has anyone testified noticing the ba enter the rotunda not exactly ah yes and the spot where it lay deadi dont know what kind of vid coverage you have of the building but that area had to have been occluded or it could not have been what fifteen twenty minutes before the body was discovered right another thoughtful stare you are correct lord vorkosigan normally the entire rotunda is within visual scan but because of the height and width of the catafalque twowell there is some blockage ah ha so how did the ba know exactlyno let me rephrase that who all could have known about the blind spot at the late empresss feet your own security and who else just how high up did your orders come down from colonel benin are you by chance under pressure from above to deliver a quick confirmation of suicide and close your case benin twitched a quick conclusion to this vile interruption of a most solemn occasion is certainly desirable i desire it as ardently as anyone else which brings me to my questions for you lord vorkosigan if i may be permitted oh certainly miles paused then added just as benin opened his mouth are you doing this on your own time then i admire your dedication no benin took a breath and composed himself again lord vorkosigan our records indicate you left the reception hall to speak privately with a hautlady yes she sent a ba servant with an invitation i could hardly refuse besides i was curious i can believe that muttered benin what was the substance of your conversation with the haut rian degtiar whysurely you monitored it surely they had not or this interview would have taken place two days ago before miles had ever left the celestial gardenand been a lot less politely conducted too but benin doubtless had a vid of miless exit from and entrance to the reception area and testimony from the little ba escort as well nevertheless said benin neutrally welli have to admit i found the conversation extremely confusing shes a geneticist you know yes i believe her interest in meexcuse me i find this personally embarrassing i believe her interest in me was genetic i am widely rumored to be a mutant but my physical disabilities are entirely teratogenic damage done by a poison i encountered prenatally not genetic its very important to me that be clearly understood miles thought briefly of his own impsec eavesdroppers the hautwomen apparently collect unusual natural genetic variations for their research the haut rian degtiar seemed quite disappointed to learn i held nothing of interest genetically speaking or so i gathered she talked all around the subjectim not sure but what she perceived her own interest as being rather um questionable im afraid i dont find haut motivations entirely comprehensible miles smiled cheerfully there that was the vaguest convincingsounding uncheckable bullshit he could come up with on the spur of the moment and left a good deal of turningroom for whatever the colonel had got out of rian if anything what did interest me though was the hautladys forcebubble miles added it never touched the ground she had to be riding in a floatchair in there i figured they often do said benin thats why i asked you about who saw the ba lura enter the chamber can anyone use a hautbubble or are they keyed in some way to the wearer and are they as anonymous as they look or do you have some way of telling them apart they are keyed to the wearer and each has its own unique electronic signature any security measure made by man can be unmade by man if he has access to the resources i am aware of this fact lord vorkosigan hm you see the scenario im driving at of course suppose the ba was stunned elsewherea theory that hurried cremation has rendered uncheckable alascarried unconscious inside a hautbubble to the blind spot and had its throat cut silently and without a struggle the bubble glides on it wouldnt have taken more than fifteen seconds it wouldnt have required great physical strength on the part of the murderer but i dont know enough about the specs of the bubbles to judge the technical likelihood and i dont know if any bubbles went in and outhow much traffic was there in the funeral rotunda during the timewindow were talking about there cant have been that much did any hautlady bubbles enter and exit benin sat back pursing his lips regarding miles with keen interest you have an alert way of looking at the world lord vorkosigan five ba servants four guards and six hautwomen crossed the chamber during the time in question the ba have duties there tending to the botanical arrangements and keeping the chamber perfectly clean the hautwomen frequently come to meditate and pay respects to the celestial lady i have interviewed them all none report noticing the ba lura then the last one must be lying benin tented his fingers and stared at them it is not quite that simple miles paused i despise doing internal investigations myself he said at last i trust you are documenting every breath youre taking at this point benin almost smiled thats entirely my problem isnt it miles was actually beginning to like the man you are considering the venue of rather low rank for an investigation of this sensitivity arent you that too is my problem sacrificable benin grimaced oh yes nothing miles had said yet was anything benin hadnt thought of tooif hed dared to speak it aloud miles decided to continue sprinkling the favors youve won yourself quite a pretty problem in this murder id say ghemcolonel miles remarked neither of them were keeping up the pretense about the suicide anymore still if the method was as i guess you can deduce quite a lot about the murderer his rank must be high his access to internal security great andexcuse mehe has a peculiar sense of humor for a cetagandan the insult to the empress nearly borders on disloyalty so says an examination of the method said benin in a tone of complaint its motive that troubles me that harmless old ba has served in the celestial garden for decades revenge seems most unlikely mm perhaps so if ba lura is old news maybe its the murderer whos newly arrived and considerdecades of standing around sopping up secretsthe ba was well placed to know things about persons of extraordinarily high rank suppose the ba had been tempted say into a spot of blackmail i would think that a close tracing of ba luras movements these last few days might be revealing for instance did the ba leave the celestial garden at any time that investigation is in progress if i were you id jump on that aspect the ba might have communicated with its murderer aboard his ship in orbit yes the timing is peculiar you see to my eye this murder shows every sign of having been rushed if the murderer had had months to plan he could have done a much better and quieter job i think he had to make a lot of decisions in a hurry maybe in that very hour and some of them were frankly bad not bad enough sighed benin but you interest me lord vorkosigan miles trusted that wasnt too much of a double entendre this sort of thing is meat and drink to me its the first chance ive had to talk shop with anyone since i came to eta ceta he favored benin with a happy smile if you have any more questions for me please feel free to stop by again i dont suppose you would be willing to answer them under fastpenta benin said without much hope ah miles thought fast with ambassador vorobyevs permission perhaps which would not of course be forthcoming benins slight smile fully comprehended the delicacy of a refusalwithoutrefusing in any case i should be pleased to continue our acquaintance lord vorkosigan any time ill be here nine more days benin gave miles a penetrating unreadable look thank you lord vorkosigan miles had about a million more questions for his new victim but that was all he dared cram into the opening session he wanted to project an air of professional interest not frantic obsession it was tempting but dangerous to think of benin as an ally but he was certainly a window into the celestial garden yeah a window with eyes that looked back at you but there had to be some reasonably subtle way to induce benin to slap himself on the forehead and cry say id better take a closer look at those satrap governors he was definitely looking in the correct direction up and over his shoulder a most uncomfortable position in which to work how much influence could the satrap governors all near imperial relations put on the celestial gardens security not too muchthey were surely regarded as potential threats but one might have been building up convenient contacts for a long time now one might indeed have been perfectly loyal till this new temptation it was a dangerous accusation benin had to be right the first time he wouldnt get a second chance did anyone care about the murder of a ba slave how much interest did benin have in abstract justice if a cetagandan couldnt be oneup in any other way holierthanthou might do an almost aesthetic drivethe art of detection how much risk was benin willing to run how much did he have to lose did he have a family or was he some sort of pure warriormonk totally dedicated to his career to the ghemcolonels credit by the end of the interview benin had been keeping his eyes on miless face because he was interested in what miles was saying not because he was notlooking at miless body miles rose along with benin and paused ghemcolonel may i make a personal suggestion benin tilted his head in curious permission you have good reason to suspect you have a little problem somewhere overhead but you dont know where yet if i were you id go straight to the top make personal contact with your emperor its the only way you can be sure youve capped the murderer did benin turn pale beneath his face paint no way to tell that high overlord vorkosigan i can hardly claim casual acquaintance with my celestial master this isnt friendship its business and its his business if you truly mean to be useful to him its time you began emperors are only human well emperor gregor was the cetagandan emperor was hauthuman miles hoped that still counted ba lura must have been more to him than a piece of the furniture it served him for over fifty years make no accusations merely request that he protect your investigation from being quashed strike first today before someone begins to fear your competence if youre going to cover your ass benin by god do it right i will consider your advice good hunting miles nodded cheerfully as if it wasnt his problem big game is the best think of the honor benin bowed himself out with a small wry smile to be escorted from the building by the embassy guard see you around miles called you may be sure of it benins parting wave was almost but not quite a salute miless desire to dissolve into an exhausted puddle on the corridor floor was delayed by the arrival of vorobyev doubtless from his listening post belowstairs and another man ivan hovered behind them with an expression of morose anxiety the other man was middleaged middlesized and wearing the loose bodysuit and wellcut robes of a cetagandan ghemlord in middle colors they hung comfortably upon him but his face was free of colored paint and the haircut he sported was that of a barrayaran officer his eyes were interested a very well conducted interview lord vorkosigan said vorobyev relieving miless mind slightly an even wager who had interviewed whom just now ghemcolonel benin obviously has a lot on his mind said miles ah he glanced at vorobyevs companion allow me to introduce lord vorreedi said the ambassador lord vorkosigan of course lord vorreedi is our particular expert in understanding the activities of the ghemcomrades in all their multitude of arenas which was diplomatictalk for head spy miles nodded careful greetings pleased to meet you at last sir and you vorreedi returned i regret not arriving sooner the late empresss obsequies were expected to be rather more sedate than this i didnt know of your keen interest in civil security lord vorkosigan would you like us to arrange you a tour of the local police organizations im afraid time will not permit but yes if i hadnt been able to get into a military career i think police work might have been my next choice a uniformed corporal from the embassys impsec office approached and motioned away his civilianclothed superior they conferred in low tones and the corporal handed over a sheaf of colored papers to the protocol officer who in turn handed them to the ambassador with a few words vorobyev his brows climbing turned to ivan lord vorpatril some invitations have arrived for you this morning ivan took the sheets their colors and perfumes clashing and leafed through them in puzzlement invitations lady benello invites you to a private dinner lady arvin invites you to a firepatternviewing partyboth tonightand lady senden invites you to observe a courtdance practice this afternoon who lady senden the protocol officer supplied is lady benellos married sister according to last nights background checks he gave ivan an odd look just what did you do to merit this sudden popularity lord vorpatril ivan held the papers gingerly smiling thinly by which miles deduced he hadnt told the protocol officer quite everything about last nights adventure im not sure sir ivan caught miless suffused gaze and reddened slightly miles craned his neck do any of these women have interesting connections at the celestial garden do you suppose or friends who do your name isnt on these coz ivan pointed out ruthlessly waving the invitations all handcalligraphed in assorted colored inks a faintly cheerful look was starting in his eyes displacing his earlier glum dread perhaps some more background checks would be in order my lord murmured the protocol officer to the ambassador if you please colonel the protocol officer left with his corporal miles with a grateful parting wave to vorobyev tagged along after ivan who clutched the colored papers firmly and eyed him with suspicion mine ivan asserted as soon as they were out of earshot you have ghemcolonel benin who is more to your taste anyway there are a lot of ghemwomen here in the capital who serve as ladiesinwaiting to the hautwomen in the celestial garden is all miles said id like to meet that ghemlady i went walking with last night for instance but she didnt give me her name i doubt many of yenaros crowd have celestial connections i think this one was an exception though the people i really want to meet are the satrap governors facetoface youd have a better chance at that at one of the official functions oh yes im planning on it chapter eight the celestial garden was not quite so intimidating on the second visit miles assured himself this time they were not lost in a great stream of galactic envoys but were only a little party of three miles ambassador vorobyev and mia maz were admitted through a side gate almost privately and escorted by a single servitor to their destination the trio made a good picture miles and the ambassador wore their ultraformal house blacks again maz wore black linings and pure white overrobes combining the two mourning colors acknowledging the cetagandan hue without overstepping the boundaries of hautprivilege no accident that it also displayed her own dark hair and lively complexion to advantage and set off her two companions as well her dimple flashed with her smile of anticipation and pleasure directed over miless head to ambassador vorobyev miles between them felt like an unruly lad being escorted firmly by his two parents vorobyev was taking no chances of unauthorized violations of etiquette today the offering of the elegiac poetry to the dead empress was not a ceremony normally attended by galactic delegates with the exception of a very few highranking cetagandan allies miles did not qualify on either count and vorobyev had been forced to pull every string he owned to get them this invitation ivan had ducked out pleading weariness from the courtdance practice and the fireviewing parties of yesterday and the excuse of four more invitations for this afternoon and evening it was a suspiciously smug weariness miles had let him escape his sadistic urge to make ivan sit along with him through what promised to be an interminable afternoon and evening blunted by the reflection that his cousin could do little to contribute to what was essentially an informationgathering expedition and ivan mightjust mightpick up some useful new contacts among the ghem vorobyev had substituted the vervani woman to her obvious delight and miless benefit to miless relief the ceremony was not carried out in the rotunda with all its alarming associations where the empresss body still lay neither did the haut use anything so crass as an auditorium with people packed in efficient rows instead the servitor took them to adell miles supposed he might call it a bowl in the garden lined with flowers plants and hundreds of little boxseat arrangements overlooking a complex array of daises and platforms at the bottom as befitted their rank or lack of it the servitor placed the barrayaran party in the last and highest row three quarters of the way around from the best frontal view this suited mileshe could watch nearly the whole audience without being overlooked himself the low benches were flawless wood handsmoothed to a high polish mia maz bowed gallantly to her seat by vorobyev patted her skirts and stared around brighteyed miles stared too much less brighteyedhed spent a great deal of time the last day peering into his comconsole display swotting up background in hopes of finding an end to this tangle the haut were filtering in to their places men in flowing snowy robes escorting white bubbles the dell was beginning to resemble a great bank of white climbing roses in a frenzy of bloom miles finally saw the purpose of the box seatsit gave room for the bubbles was rian among them will the women speak first or how do they organize this miles asked maz the women wont speak at all today said maz they had their own ceremony yesterday theyll start with the men of lowest rank and work up through the constellations ending with the satrap governors all of them miles settled himself with the patience of a panther in a tree the men he had come to see were filing into the bottom of the bowl even now if miles had owned a tail it would have twitched as it was he stilled a tapping boot the eight satrap governors assisted by their highestranking ghemofficers sank into seats around a raised reserved dais miles squinted wishing for rangefinder binocularsnot that he could have carried them past the tight security with a twinge of sympathy he wondered what ghemcolonel benin was doing right now and if cetagandan security went as frantic behind the scenes as barrayaran security did at any ceremony involving emperor gregor he could just picture them but he had what hed come forall eight of his suspects artistically arranged on display he studied his top four with particular care the governor of mu ceta was one of the degtiar constellation the present emperors halfuncle being halfbrother to the late empress maz too watched closely as he settled his aged body creakily into his seat and brushed away his attendants with jerky irritated motions the governor of mu ceta had been at his present post only two years replacing the governor who had been recalled and subsequently quietly exiled into retirement after the vervain invasion debacle the man was very old and very experienced and had been chosen explicitly to calm vervani fears of a rematch not miles thought the treasonous type yet by haut rians testimony every man in the circle had taken at least one step over the line secretly receiving the unauthorized gene banks the governor of rho ceta barrayars nearest neighbor worried miles a great deal more the haut este rond was middleaged and vigorous hauttall though unusually heavy his ghemofficer stood well back from his governors sweeping movements ronds general effect was bullish and he was bullishly tenacious in his efforts diplomatic and otherwise to improve cetagandas trade access through the barrayarancontrolled komarr wormhole jumps the rond was one of the more junior hautconstellations seeking growth este rond was a hot prospect for sure the governor of xi ceta maniacs neighbor wafted in proudnosed the haut slyke giaja was what miles thought of as a typical hautlord tall and lean and faintly effeminate arrogant as befit a younger halfbrother of the emperor and dangerous young enough to be a possibility though older than este rond the youngest suspect the haut ilsum kety governor of sigma ceta was a mere stripling of fortyfive or so in body type he was much like slyke giaja who was in fact a cousin of his through their mothers who were halfsisters though of different constellations haut family trees were even more confusing than the vors it would take a fulltime geneticist to keep track of all the semisiblings eight white bubbles floated into the basin and took up an arc to the left of the circle of satrap governors the ghemofficers took up a similar arc to the right they miles realized were going to get to stand through the entire afternoons ceremony being a ghemgeneral wasnt all blood and beer but could any of those bubbles be who are those ladies miles asked maz nodding toward the octet they are the satrap governors consorts i thought the haut did not marry theres no personal relationship implied in the title they are appointed centrally just like the governors themselves not by the governors whats their function social secretaries not at all they are chosen by the empress to be her representatives in all dealings having to do with the star creches business all the haut living on a satrap planet send their genetic contracts through the consorts to the central gene bank here at the celestial garden where the fertilizations and any genetic alterations take place the consorts also oversee the return of the uterine replicators with the growing fetuses to their parents on the outlying planets that has to be the strangest cargo run in the cetagandan empireonce a year for each planet do the consorts travel back to eta ceta once a year in that case to personally accompany their charges yes ah miles settled back smiling fixedly now he saw how the empress lisbet had set up her scheme the living channels she had used to communicate with each satrap governor if every one of those consorts wasnt in on this plot to her eyebrows hed eat his boots sixteen i have sixteen suspects not eight oh god and hed come here to cut down his list but it followed logically that ba luras murderer might not have had to borrow or steal a hautladys bubble she might have owned one already do the consortladies work closely with their satrap governors maz shrugged i really dont know not necessarily i suppose their areas of responsibility are highly segregated a majordomo took center stage and made a silent motion every voice in the dell went still every hautlord dropped to his knees on padded rests thoughtfully provided in front of the benches all the white bubbles bobbledmiles still wondered how many of the hautwomen cheated and cut corners at these ceremonies after an anticipatory hush the emperor himself arrived escorted by guards in white and bloodred uniforms zebrafaced of terrible aspect if you took them seriously miles did not for the face paint but in certain knowledge of just how nervous and twitchy in the triggerfinger such an awesome responsibility could make a man it was the first time in his life miles had seen the cetagandan emperor in the flesh and he studied the man as avidly as he had studied the satrap governors emperor the haut fletchir giaja was tall lean hawkfaced like his demicousins his hair still untouched by gray despite his seventyodd years a survivorhe had succeeded to his rank at a fantastically young age for a cetagandan less than thirty and held on through a wobbly youth to an apparently ironsecure midlife he seated himself with great assurance and grace of movement serene and confident ringed by bowing traitors miless nostrils flared and he took a breath dizzy with the irony at another signal from the majordomo everyone regained their seats still in that remarkable silence the presentation of the elegiac poems in honor of the late haut lisbet degtiar began with the heads of the lowestranking constellations present each poem had to fit into one of half a dozen correct formal types all mercifully short miles was extremely impressed with the elegance beauty and apparent deep feeling of about the first ten offerings the recitation had to be one of those great formal ordeals like taking an oath or getting married in which the preparations wildly outmassed the moment of actualization great care was taken with movement voice and imperceptible variations of what to miless eye were identical white dress robes but gradually miles began to be aware of stock phrases repeated ideas by the thirtieth man his eyes were starting to glaze over more than ever miles wished ivan by his side suffering along with him maz whispered an occasional interpretation or gloss which helped fend off creeping drowsinessmiles had not slept well last night the satrap governors were all doing good imitations of men stuffed and mounted except for the ancient governor of mu ceta who slumped in open boredom and watched through sardonic slitted eyes as his juniors ie everyone else there performed with various degrees of flopsweat the older and more experienced men as they came on at least had better deliveries if not necessarily better poems miles meditated on the character of lord x trying to match it with one of the eight faces ranged before him the murderertraitor was something of a tactical genius he had been presented with an unanticipated opportunity to gain power had committed rapidly to an allout effort evolved a plan and struck how fast the first satrap governor had arrived in person only ten days before miles and ivan had the last only four days before yenaro the embassys impsec office had finally reported had put his sculpture together in just two days from designs delivered from an unknown source working his minions around the clock ba lura could only have been suborned since its mistresss death not quite three weeks ago the aged haut thought nothing of taking on plans that took decades to mature with cantlose security witness the old empress herself they experienced time differently than miles did he was fairly sure this whole chain of events smelled young or young at heart miless opponent must be in an interesting frame of mind just now he was a man of action and decision but now he had to lie quiet and do nothing to draw attention to himself even as it began to look more and more like ba luras death was not going to pass as planned as a suicide he had to sit tight on his bank and the great key till the funeral was over and glide softly back to his planetary basebecause he couldnt start the revolt from here hed prepared nothing in advance before hed left home so would he send the great key on or keep it with him if hed sent it back to his satrapy already miles was in deep trouble well deeper trouble would the governor take the risk of losing the powerful tokens in transit surely not the droning amateur poets were getting to miles he found his subconscious mind not working along with the rest of it as it should but going off on its own tangent a poem of his own in honor of the late empress formed unbidden in his brain a degtiar empress named lisbet trapped a satrap lord neatly in his net enticed into treason for all the wrong reasons hell soon have a crash with his kismet he choked down a genuinely horrible impulse to bounce down to the center of the dell and declaim his poetic offering to the assembled haut multitude just to see what would happen mia maz glanced aside in concern at his muffled snort are you all right yes sorry he whispered im just having an attack of limericks her eyes widened and she bit her lip only her deepening dimple betrayed her shhh she said with feeling the ceremony went on uninterrupted alas there was all too much time to evolve more verse of equal artistic merit he gazed out at the banks of white bubbles a beautiful lady named rian hypnotized a vor scion the little defective thinks hes a detective but instead will be fed to the lion how did the haut live through these things had they bioengineered their bladders to some inhuman capacity along with all the other rumored changes fortunately before miles could think of two rhymes for vorobyev the first satrap governor arose to take his place on the speakers dais miles came abruptly awake the satrap governors poems were all excellent all in the most difficult formsand maz informed miles in a whisper mostly ghostwritten by the best hautwomen poets in the celestial garden rank hath its privileges but try as he might miles could not read any useful sinister double meanings into themhis suspect was not using this moment to publicly confess his crimes put the wind up his enemies or any of the other really interesting possibilities miles was almost surprised the placement of ba luras body suggested lord x had a weakness for the baroque in his plotting when the simple would have done better making an art of it the emperor sat through it with unruffled solemn calm the satrap governors all received polite nods of thanks from the chief mourner for their elegant praises miles wondered if benin had taken his advice and spoken with his master yet he hoped so and then abruptly the literary ordeal was over miles suppressed an impulse to applaud that was apparently not done the majordomo came out and made another cryptic gesture at which everyone went to their knees again the emperor and his guards decamped followed by the consort bubbles the satrap governors and their ghemofficers then everyone else was freedto find a bathroom miles trusted the haut race might have divested itself of the traditional meanings and functions of sexuality but they were still human enough to make the sharing of food part of lifes basic ceremonies in their own way trays of meat were sculpted into flowers vegetables masqueraded as crustaceans and fruit as tiny animals miles stared thoughtfully at the plate of simple boiled rice on the buffet table every grain had been individually handarranged in an elaborate spiral pattern he almost tripped over his own boots boggling at it he controlled his bemusement and tried to refocus on the business at hand the informalby celestial garden standardsrefreshments were served in a long pavilion open as usual to the garden presently lit in a warm afternoon glow that invited relaxation the hautladies in their bubbles had evidently gone elsewheresomeplace where they could drop their bubbles to eat presumably this was the most exclusive of several postpoetry buffet sites scattered around the celestial garden the emperor himself was somewhere at the other end of the graceful building miles wasnt quite sure how vorobyev had got them in but the man deserved a commendation for extraordinary service maz eyes alight hand on vorobyevs arm was clearly in some sort of sociologists heaven here we go murmured vorobyev and miles went headsup the haut este ronds party was entering the crowded pavilion the other haut not knowing what to do about these outofplace outlanders had been trying to pretend the barrayarans were invisible ever since theyd arrived este rond did not have that option the beefy whiterobed satrap governor his painted and uniformed ghemgeneral by his side paused to greet his barrayaran neighbors a whiterobed woman unusual in this heavily male gathering trailed the ronds ghemgeneral her silverblond hair was gathered in a looping queue down her back to her ankles and she stood with downcast eyes not speaking she was much older than rian but certainly a hautwomangod they aged well she must be the ronds ghemgenerals hautwifeany officer destined to such high planetary rank would have been expected to win one long ago maz was giving miles some inexplicable but urgent signala tiny head shake and a no no formed silently on her lips what was she trying to say the hautwife apparently did not speak unless spoken tomiles had never seen anyones bodylanguage express such extraordinary reserve and containment not even the haut rians governor rond and vorobyev exchanged elaborate courtesies by which miles gathered that the rond had been their ticket in vorobyev culminated his diplomatic coup by introducing miles the lieutenant takes a very gratifying interest in the finer points of cetagandan culture vorobyev recommended him to the governors attention the haut rond nodded cordially when vorobyev recommended someone it seemed even cetagandan hautlords attended i was sent to learn as well as serve sir it is my duty and my pleasure miles favored the hautgovernor with a precisely calculated bow and i must say i have certainly been having learning experiences miles tried by his edged smile to put as much doublespin on his words as possible the rond smiled back cooleyed but then if este rond was lord x he ought to be cool they exchanged a few empty pleasantries about the diplomatic life then miles ventured boldly would you be so kind haut rond as to introduce me to governor haut ilsum kety a razorthin smile twitched the ronds lips and he glanced across the room at his fellowgovernor and genetic superior why certainly lord vorkosigan if the rond was going to be stuck with these outlanders miles gathered hed be happy to share the embarrassment the rond shepherded miles over vorobyev was left talking with the rho cetan ghemgeneral who was taking a sincere professional interest in his potential enemies vorobyev shot miles a warning notquiteglower just a slight creasing of his eyebrows miles opened his hand down at his side in an illbegood promise as soon as they were out of the ambassadors earshot miles murmured to the rond we know about yenaro you know i beg your pardon said the rond in realisticsounding bafflement and then they arrived at the haut ilsum ketys little group closeup kety seemed even taller and leaner than he had at a distance at the poetryreadings he had cool chiseled features very much in the haut moldhawknoses had been the style ever since fletchir giaja had ascended the throne a bit of silvergray at the temples set off his dark hair since the man was only in his midforties and haut to boot by god yes the touch of frost was quite perfect but it had to have been artificially produced miles realized with wellconcealed inner amusement in a world where the old men had it all there was no social benefit to a youthful appearance when one actually was young kety too was attended by his ghemgeneral who also kept a hautwife on standby miles tried not to let his eyes bug out too obviously she was extraordinary even by hautstandards her hair was a rich dark chocolate color parted in the middle and gathered in a thick braid that trailed down her back to actually coil upon the floor her skin was vanilla cream her eyes widening slightly as she glanced down at miles approaching by the ronds side were an astonishing light cinnamon color large and liquid a complete confection indeed wholly edible and scarcely older than rian miles was quietly grateful for his previous exposure to rian which helped a great deal toward keeping him on his feet and not crawling on his knees toward her right now ilsum kety clearly had no time for or interest in outlanders but for whatever reason did not care or dare to offend the rond miles managed a brief exchange of formal greetings with him the rond took the opportunity to skim miles off his hands and escape to the buffet the irritated kety was failing to perform his social duties miles took matters into his own hands and directed a halfbow at ketys ghemgeneral the general at least was of the customary cetagandan age for his position ie antique general chilian sir i have studied you in my history texts it is an honor to meet you and your fine lady i dont believe i know her name he smiled hopefully at her chilians brows going up drew back down in a slight frown lord vorkosigan he acknowledged shortly but he didnt take up the hint after a tiny glint of distaste in miless direction the hautwoman stood as if she werent there or at least wishing so the two men seemed to treat her as if she were invisible so if kety were lord x what must be going through his mind right now as he found himself cornered by his intended victim hed planted the false rod on the barrayaran party set up the ba lura to tell rian and convince her to make accusations of theft killed the ba and waited for the results which had beena resounding silence rian had apparently done nothing not said a word to anyone did kety wonder if hed killed lura too soon after all before it had made a chance to confess its loss it must be very puzzling for the man but nothing not a twitch showed on his haut face which would of course also be the case if the governor were totally innocent miles smiled affably at the haut ilsum kety i understand we have a mutual hobby governor he purred oh said kety unencouragingly an interest in the cetagandan imperial regalia such a fascinating set of artifacts and so evocative of the history and culture of the haut race dont you think and its future kety stared at him blankly i would not regard that as a pastime nor a suitable interest for an outlander its a military officers duty to know his enemies i would not know those tasks belong to the ghem such as your friend lord yenaro a slender reed for you to lean on governor im afraid you are about to find ketys pale brow wrinkled who miles sighed inwardly wishing he could flood the entire pavilion with fastpenta the haut were all so damned controlled they looked like they were lying even when they werent i wonder haut kety if you would introduce me to governor haut slyke giaja as an imperial relation of sorts myself i cant help feeling he is something of my opposite number the haut kety blinked surprised into honesty i doubt slyke would think so by the look on his face he was balancing the annoyance to prince slyke giaja of inflicting the outlander on him versus the relief of being rid of miles himself selfinterest won up to a point the haut kety motioned ghemgeneral chilian nearer and dispatched him to gain permission for the transfer with a polite farewell and thankyou to kety miles trailed after the ghemgeneral hoping to take advantage of any indecision to press his suit imperial princes were not likely to make themselves so readily accessible as ordinary hautgovernors general if the haut slyke cannot speak with me would you deliver a short message to him miles tried to keep his voice even despite his limping stride chilian was not shortening his steps in favor to the barrayaran guest just three words chilian shrugged i suppose i can tell him yenaro is ours just that the generals brows rose at this cryptic utterance very well the message of course would be repeated later to cetagandan imperial security miles didnt mind the idea of cetagandan imperial security taking a closer look at lord yenaro the haut slyke giaja was sitting with a small group of men both ghem and haut on the far side of the pavilion unusually the party also included a white bubble hovering near the prince attendant upon it was a ghemlady miles recognized despite the voluminous formal white robes she wore todaythe woman whod been sent to fetch him at yenaros party the ghemwoman glanced across at him approaching stared briefly then looked resolutely away so who was in the bubble rian slyke s consort someone else entirely ketys ghemgeneral bent to murmur in his ear slyke giaja glanced across at miles frowned and shook his head chilian shrugged and bent to murmur again miles watching his lips move saw his message or something very like it being deliveredthe word yenaro was quite distinctive slyke s face betrayed no expression at all he waved the ghemgeneral away general chilian returned to miless side the haut slyke is too busy to see you at this time he reported blandly thank you anyway miles intoned equally blandly the general nodded acknowledgment and went back to his master miles stared around wondering how to leverage access to his next prospect the mu cetan governor was not presenthed probably departed directly from the garden amphitheater to take a nap mia maz drifted up to miles smiling curiosity in her eyes finding any good conversations lord vorkosigan she asked not so far he admitted ruefully yourself i would not presume ive mostly been listening one learns more that way yes listening is the invisible conversational coup i feel quite smug what have you learned the haut topic at this party is each others poetry which they are slicing up along strict lines of dominance by some coincidence everyone is agreeing that the men of higher rank had the better offerings i couldnt tell the difference myself oh but we are not haut why were you wagging your eyebrows at me a while ago miles asked i was trying to warn you about a rare point of cetagandan etiquette how you are supposed to behave when you encounter a hautwoman outside of her bubble it was the first time id ever seen one he lied strategically did i do all right hm barely you see the hautwomen lose the privilege of the forceshields when they marry out of the genome into the ghemrank they become as ghemwomensort of but the loss of the shield is considered a great loss of face so the polite thing to do is to behave as if the bubble were still there you must never directly address a hautwife even if shes standing right in front of you put all inquiries through her ghemhusband and wait for him to transmit the replies i didnt say anything to them oh good and you must never stare directly at them either im afraid i thought the men were being rude to close the women out of the conversation absolutely not they were being most polite cetagandan style oh but the way they carry themselves the women might as well still be in the bubbles virtual bubbles thats the idea yes do the same rules go for hautwomen who still have the privilege of their bubbles i have no idea i cannot imagine a hautwoman talking facetoface with an outlander miles became aware of a ghostly gray presence at his elbow and tried not to jump it was the haut rian degtiars little ba servant the ba had passed into the room without a ripple ignored by its inhabitants miless heart began to race a response he muffled in a polite nod at the servitor lord vorkosigan my lady wishes to speak with you said the ba mazs eyes widened thank you i would be pleased miles responded ah he glanced around for ambassador vorobyev who was still being buttonholed by the rho cetan ghemgeneral good permissions not requested could not be denied maz would you be so kind as to tell the ambassador ive gone to speak with a lady mm i may be some time at it go on without me ill catch up with you back at the embassy if necessary i dont think began maz doubtfully but miles was already turning away he shot her a smile over his shoulder and a cheerful little wave as he followed the ba out of the pavilion chapter nine the little ba its expression devoid as ever of any comment on its mistresss affairs led miles on a lengthy walk through the garden s winding paths around ponds and along tiny exquisite artificial streams miles almost stopped to gape at an emeraldgreen lawn populated by a flock of rubyred peacocks the size of songbirds slowly stalking about a sunny spot on a ledge a little further on was occupied by something resembling a spherical cat or perhaps a bouquet of catfur soft white yes there was an animal in there a pair of turquoiseblue eyes blinked once at him from the fuzz and closed again in perfect indolence miles did not attempt conversation or questions he might not have been personally monitored by cetagandan imperial security on his last trip to the celestial garden when hed been mixed in with a thousand other galactic delegates this was certainly not the case today he prayed rian would realize this lisbet would have he could only hope rian had inherited lisbets safe zones and procedures along with the great key and her genetic mission a white bubble waited in a cloistered walkway the ba bowed to it and departed miles cleared his throat good evening milady you asked to see me how may i serve you he kept his greeting as general as possible for all he knew it was ghemcolonel benin and a voicefilter inside that damned blank sphere rians voice or a good imitation murmured lord vorkosigan you expressed an interest in genetic matters i thought you would care for a short tour good they were monitored and she knew it he suppressed the tiny part of himself that had been hoping against all reason for a loveaffair cover and answered indeed milady all medical procedures interest me i feel the corrections to my own damage were extremely incomplete im always looking for new hopes and chances whenever i have an opportunity to visit more advanced galactic societies he paced along beside her floating sphere trying and failing to keep track of the twists and turns of their route through archways and other buildings he managed a suitably admiring comment or two on the passing scenery so their silence would not be too obvious hed walked about a kilometer from the emperors buffet he gauged though certainly not in a straight line when they came to a long low white building despite the usual charming landscaping it had biocontrol written all over it in the details of its window seals and doorlocks the air lock required complicated encodations from rian though once it had identified her it admitted him under her aegis without a murmur of protest she led him through surprisingly unlabyrinthine corridors to a spacious office it was the most utilitarian least artistic chamber hed yet seen in the celestial garden one entire wall was glass overlooking a long room that had a lot more in common with galacticstandard biolabs than with the garden outside form follows function and this place was bristling with function purpose not the languid ease of the pavilions it was presently deserted shut down but for a lone ba servitor moving among the benches doing some sort of meticulous janitorial task but of course no haut genetic contracts were approved or presumably carried out during the period of mourning for the celestial lady putative mistress of this domain a screamingbird pattern decorated the surface of a comconsole and hovered above several cabinetlocks he was standing in the center of the star creche the bubble settled by one wall and vanished without a pop the haut rian degtiar rose from her floatchair her ebony hair today was bound up in thick loops tumbling no farther than her waist her pure white robes were only calflength two simple layers comfortably draped over a white bodysuit that covered her from neck to whiteslippered toe more woman less icon and yet miles had hoped repeated exposure to her beauty might build up an immunity in him to the mindnumbing effect of her obviously he would need more exposure than this lots more lots and lots andstop it dont be more of a idiot than you have to be we can talk here she said gliding to a station chair beside the comconsole desk and settling herself in it her simplest movements were like dance she nodded to another station chair across from hers and miles lurched into it with a strained smile intensely conscious that his boots barely touched the floor rian seemed as direct as the ghemgenerals wives were closed was the star creche itself a sort of psychological forcebubble for her or did she merely consider him so subhuman as to be completely nonthreatening as incapable as a pet animal of judging her i trust you are correct miles said but wont there be repercussions from your security for bringing me in here she shrugged if they wish they can request the emperor to reprimand me they cannot er reprimand you directly they no the statement was flat factual miles hoped she was not being overly optimistic and yet by the lift of her chin the set of her shoulders it was clear that the haut rian degtiar handmaiden of the star creche firmly believed that within these walls she was empress for the next eight days anyway i trust this is important and brief or im going to emerge to find ghemcolonel benin waiting for an exitinterview its important her blue eyes seemed to blaze i know which satrap governor is the traitor now excellent that was fast uh how the key was as you said a decoy false and empty as you knew suspicion still glinted in her eye lighting upon him by reason alone milady do you have evidence of a sort she leaned forward intently yesterday prince slyke giaja had his consort bring him to the star creche for a tour he pretended he insisted i produce the empresss regalia for his inspection his face said nothing but he gazed upon the collection for a long time before turning away as if satisfied he congratulated me upon my loyal work and left immediately thereafter slyke giaja was certainly on miless short list two data points did not quite make a triangulation but it was certainly better than nothing he didnt ask to see the key demonstrated to prove it worked key no he knew then maybe maybe i bet we gave him food for thought seeing his decoy sitting there all demure i wonder which way hes going to jump next does he realize you know its a decoy or does he think youve been fooled i could not tell it wasnt just him miles thought with glum relief even the haut couldnt read other haut he must realize he has only to wait eight days and the truth will come out the first time your successor tries to use the great key or if not the truth certainly the accusation against barrayar but is that his plan i dont know what his plan is he wants to involve barrayar somehow that im sure of perhaps even provoke armed conflict between our states this rian turned one hand curled as if around the stolen great key would be an outrage but surely not cause enough for war mm this may only be part one this pisangers you at us logically part two ought to be something that angers us at you an uncomfortable new realization clearly lord xslyke giajawas not done yet even if id handed the key back in that first hourwhich i dont think was in his scriptwe still could not have proved we didnt switch it i wish we hadnt jumped the ba lura id give anything to know what story it was supposed to have primed us with i wish you hadnt either said rian rather tartly settling back in her station chair and twitching her vest the first unpurposive move miles had ever seen her make miless lips twisted in brief embarrassment butthis is importantthe consorts the satrap governors consorts you never told me about them theyre in on this arent they why not on both sides she nodded reluctant acknowledgment but i do not suspect any of them of being involved in this treason that would be unthinkable but surely your celestial lady used themwhy unthinkable i mean here a womans got a chance to make herself an instant empress right along with her governor or maybe even independently of her governor the haut rian degtiar shook her head no the consorts do not belong to them they belong to us miles blinked slightly dizzy them the men us the women right the hautwomen are the keepers she broke off evidently hopeless of explaining it to an outlander barbarian it cannot be slyke giajas consort im sorry i dont understand its a matter of the hautgenome slyke giaja is attempting to take something to which he has no right it is not that he attempts to usurp the emperor that is his proper part its that he attempts to usurp the empress a vileness beyond the hautgenome is ours and ours alone in this he betrays not the empire which is nothing but the haut which is everything but the consorts are in favor presumably of decentralizing the hautgenome of course they are all my celestial ladys appointees do they hm do they rotate every five years along with their governors or independently of them they are appointed for life and removed only by the celestial ladys direct order the consorts seemed powerful allies in the heart of the enemy camp if only rian could activate them on her behalf but she dared not do so alas if one of them was herself a traitor miles thought bad words to himself the empire he pointed out is the support of the haut hardly nothing even from a genetic point of view the er prey to predator ratio is quite high she did not smile at his weak zoological joke he probably ought not to treat her to a recitation of his limericks then either he tried again surely the empress lisbet did not mean to instantly fragment the support of the haut no not this fast maybe not even in this generation admitted rian ah that made more sense a timing much more in an old hautladys style but now her plot has been hijacked to anothers purpose someone with shortterm personal goals someone she did not foresee he moistened his lips and forged on i believe your celestial ladys plans have fractured at their weak spot the emperor protects the hautwomens control of the hautgenome in turn you lend him legitimacy a mutual support in both your interests the satrap governors have no such motive you cant give power away and keep it simultaneously her exquisite lips thinned unhappily but she did not deny the point miles took a deep breath its not in barrayars interests for slyke giaja to succeed in his powergrab so far i can serve you in this milady but its not in barrayars interests for the cetagandan empire to be destabilized in the way your empress planned either i think i see how to foil slyke but in turn you must give up your attempt to carry out your mistresss posthumous vision at her astonished look he added weakly at least for now how would you foil prince slyke she asked slowly penetrate his ship retrieve the real great key replace it again with the decoy if possible if were lucky he might not even realize the substitution till he got home and then what could he do about it you hand over the real great key to your successor and it all passes away as smoothly as if it had never happened neither party can accuse the other without incriminating himself or herself i think it is in all the best outcome that can be humanly achieved any other scenario leads to disaster of one sort or another if we do nothing the plot comes out in eight days regardless and barrayar gets framed if i try and fail at least i cant make it any worse are you sure of that how could you get aboard slykes ship i have an idea or two the governors consortsand their ghemladies and their servitorscan they go up and down from orbit freely one porcelain hand touched her throat more or less yes so you get a lady with legitimate access preferably someone relatively inconspicuous to take me up not as myself of course id have to be disguised somehow once im aboard i can take it from there this gives us a problem of trust who could you trust i dont suppose you yourself could i havent left the capital for several years you would not qualify as inconspicuous then besides slyke giaja has to be keeping a close eye on you what about that ghemlady you sent to meet me at yenaros party rian was looking decidedly unhappy someone in the consorts train would be a better choice she said reluctantly the alternative he pointed out coolly would be to let cetagandan security do the job nailing slyke would automatically clear barrayar and my problem would be solved well not quite slyke giaja if lord x was the man whod somehow jiggered the orbital stations traffic control and whod known what security blind spot would hold ba luras body slyke giaja had more security access than he bloody ought to was it so certain that cetagandan security would be able to pull off a surprise raid on the imperial princes ship how would you disguise yourself she asked he tried to convince himself her tone was merely taken aback not scornful as a ba servitor probably some of them are as short as i am and you haut treat those people like theyre invisible blind and deaf too no man would disguise himself as a ba so much the better then he grinned ironically at her reaction her comconsole chimed she stared at it in brief astonished annoyance then touched its code pad the face of a fitlooking middleaged man formed over the vidplate he wore a cetagandan security officers ordinary uniform but he was no one miles recognized gray eyes glinted like granite chips from freshly applied zebrastriped face paint miles quailed and glanced around quicklyhe was out of range of the vidpickup at least haut rian the man nodded deferentially ghemcolonel millisor rian acknowledged i ordered my comconsole blocked to incoming calls this is not a convenient time to speak she kept her eyes from darting to miles i used the emergency override ive been trying to reach you for some time my apologies haut for intruding upon your mourning for the celestial lady but she would have been the first to wish it we have succeeded in tracking the lost lxterranc to jacksons whole i need the authorization of the star creche to pursue out of the empire with all due force i had understood that the recovery of the lxterranc was one of our late ladys highest priorities after the field tests she was considering it as an addition to the hautgenome itself this was true ghemcolonel but well yes it still should be recovered just a moment rian rose went to one of the cabinets and unlocked it with the encodering fished from its chain around her neck she rummaged within and removed a clear block about fifteen centimeters on a side with the scarlet bird pattern incised upon the top returned to her desk and placed it over the comconsoles readpad she tapped out some codes and a light flashed briefly within the block very well ghemcolonel i leave it entirely to your judgment you knew our late ladys mind on this you are fully authorized and may draw your resources as needed from the star creches special fund i thank you haut i will report our progress the ghemcolonel nodded and keyed off what was that all about miles asked brightly trying not to look too predatory rian frowned at him some old internal business of the hautgenome it has nothing to do with you or barrayar or the present crisis i assure you life does go on you know so it does miles smiled affably as if fully satisfied mentally he filed the conversation away verbatim it might make a nice tidbit to distract simon illyan with later he had a bad feeling he was going to need some major distractions for illyan when he got home rian put the great seal of the star creche carefully away again in its locked cabinet and returned to her stationchair so can you do it miles pursued have a lady you trust meet me with a ba servitors uniform and real ids the false rod and some way to check the real one and send her up to prince slykes ship on some valid pretext with me in her train and when im not sure when we have to set the meeting in advance this time if im going to go wandering away from my embassys supervision for several hours you cant just call me away at random i have to cover my own aconcocted a cover story for my own security too do you have a copy of my official schedule you must or we could not have connected before i think we should rendezvous outside the celestial garden this time for starters im going to be going to something called the bioesthetics exhibit tomorrow afternoon i think i could make up an excuse to get away from there maybe with ivans help so soon not soon enough in my view theres not much time left and we have to allow for the possibility that the first attempt may have to be aborted for some reason you do realize your evidence against prince slyke is suggestive only not conclusive but its all i have so far i understand but we need all the margin we can get in case we have to go back for a second pass yes youre right she took a breath frowning anxiously very well lord vorkosigan i shall help you make this attempt do you have any guesses where on his ship prince slyke might be inclined to store the great key its a small object and a big ship after all my first guess would be his personal quarters once aboard is there any way of detecting the great keys location i dont suppose were so fortunate as to have a screamer circuit on it not as such its internal power system is an old and very rare design though at short range it might be possible to pick it up with an appropriate sensor i will see that my lady brings you one and anything else i can think of every little bit helps there they were in motion at last he suppressed a wild impulse to beg her to throw it all over and flee away with him to barrayar could he even smuggle her out of the cetagandan empire surely it was no more miraculous a task than the one now before him yes and what would be the effect on his career not to mention his fathers of installing a refugee cetagandan hautwoman and close relative of emperor fletchir giajas in vorkosigan house and how much trouble would trail him he thought fleetingly of the story of the trojan war still it would have been flattering if she had indeed been trying to suborn him if shed at least tried a little harder she had not lifted a finger to attract him not an eyebrow arched in false invitation she seemed straightforward to the point of naivete to his own impsectrained naturally convoluted mind when someone fell deeply and hopelessly in love with somebody that somebody ought at least to have the courtesy to notice the key word boy is hopelessly keep it in mind they shared no love he and rian nor the chance of any and no goals but they did share an enemy it would have to do rian rose in dismissal miles scrambled up too saying has ghemcolonel benin caught up with you yet he was assigned to investigate the death of ba lura you know so i understood he has twice requested an audience with me i have not yet granted his request he seems persistent thank god weve still got a chance to get our stories straight miles quickly summed up his own interview with benin with special emphasis on his fictional first conversation with rian we need to make up a consistent account of this visit too i think hell be back i rather encouraged him im afraid i didnt guess prince slyke would give himself away to you so quickly rian nodded walked to the windowwall and pointing to various sites within the laboratory gave miles a brief description of the tour shed given prince slyke yesterday will that do nicely thanks you can tell him i asked a lot of medical questions about correcting various physical disabilities and that you couldnt help me much that id come to the wrong store he could not help adding theres nothing wrong with my dna you know all my damage was teratogenic outside your purview and all that her face always masklike in its beauty seemed to grow a shade more expressionless rattled he added you cetagandans spend an inordinate amount of time on appearances surely youve encountered false appearances before stop it shut up now she opened a hand acknowledging without agreeing or disagreeing and returned to her bubble worn out and not trusting his tongue any further miles paced silently beside it back to the main entrance they exited into a cool and luminous artificial dusk a few pale stars shone in the apparently boundless dark blue hemisphere above sitting in a row on a bench across the entry walk from the star creche were mia maz ambassador vorobyev and ghemcolonel benin apparently chatting amiably they all looked up at miless appearance and vorobyevs and benins smiles at least seemed to grow a shade less amiable miles almost turned around to flee back inside rian evidently felt some similar emotion for the voice from her bubble murmured ah your people are awaiting you lord vorkosigan i hope you found this educational even if not to your needs good evening then and slipped promptly back into the sanctuary of the star creche oh this whole thing is a learning experience milady miles fixed a friendly smile on his face and trod forward across the walkway to the bench where his waiting watchers rose to greet him mia maz had her usual cheerful dimple was it his imagination or had vorobyevs diplomatic affability acquired a strained edge benins expression was less easy to read through the swirls of face paint hello said miles brightly you uh waited sir thanks though i dont think you needed to vorobyevs brows rose in faint ironic disagreement you have been granted an unusual honor lord vorkosigan said benin nodding toward the star creche yes the haut rian is a very polite lady i hope i didnt wear her out with all my questions and were all your questions answered asked benin you are privileged one could not mistake the bitter edge to that comment though one could of course ignore it oh yes and no its a fascinating place but im afraid its technologies hold no help for my medical needs i think im going to have to consider more surgeries after all i dont like surgeries theyre surprisingly painful he blinked mournfully maz looked highly sympathetic vorobyev looked just a little saturnine hes beginning to suspect theres something screwy going on damn in fact both benin and vorobyev looked like only the presence of the other was inhibiting him from pinning miles to the nearest wall and twisting till some truth was emitted if you are finished then i shall escort you to the gate said benin yes the embassy car is waiting lord vorkosigan vorobyev added pointedly they all herded obediently after benin down the path he indicated the real privilege today was getting to hear all that poetry though miles burbled on and how are you doing ghemcolonel are you making any progress on your case benins lips twitched it does not simplify itself he murmured ill bet not alas or perhaps fortunately this was not the time or place for a couple of security men to let their hair down and talk shop frankly oh my said maz and they all paused to take in the show a curve in the path presented a woodsy vista framed a small artificial ravine scattered in the dusk among the trees and along the streamlet were hundreds of tiny luminous tree frogs variously candycolored all singing they sang in chords pitchperfect one chord rising and dying away to be replaced by another the creatures luminosity rose and fell as they sang so the progress of each pure note could be followed by the eye as well as the ear the ravines acoustics bounced the notquite music around in a highly synergistic fashion miless brain seemed to stop dead for a full three minutes at the sheer absurd beauty of it all till some throatclearing from vorobyev broke the spell and the party moved on again outside the dome the capital citys night was warm humid and apricotbright rumbling with the vast subliminal noise of its life night and the city stretching to the horizon and beyond i am impressed by the luxury of the haut but then i realize the size of the economic base that supports it miles remarked to benin indeed said benin with a small smirk i believe cetagandas per capita tax rate is only half that of barrayars the emperor cultivates his subjects economic wellbeing as a garden i have heard it said benin was not immune to the cetagandan taste for oneupmanship taxes were always a volatile civil issue at home im afraid so miles returned we have to match you militarily with less than a quarter of your resources he bit his tongue to keep from adding fortunately thats not hard or something equally snide benin was right though miles reflected as the embassys aircar rose over the capital one was awed by the great silver hemisphere till one looked at the city extending for a hundred kilometers in all directions not to mention the rest of the planet and the other seven worlds and did a little math the celestial garden was a flower but its roots lay elsewhere in the haut and ghem control of other aspects of the economy the great key seemed suddenly a tiny lever with which to try to move this world prince slyke i think you are an optimist chapter ten youve got to help me out on this one ivan miles whispered urgently oh murmured ivan in a tone of extreme neutrality i didnt know vorobyev would be sending him along miles jerked his chin toward lord vorreedi who had stepped away for some undervoiced conference of his own with their groundcars driver the uniformed embassy guard and the plainclothes guard the uniformed man wore undress greens like miles and ivan the other two wore the bodysuits and calflength robes of cetagandan street wear the protocol officer with more comfortable practiced ease miles continued when i set up this rendezvous with my contact i thought wed get mia maz as our native guide again what with this exhibition being the ladies division or whatever they call it you wont just need to cover my departure you may need to distract them when i make my break the plainclothes guard nodded and strode off outerperimeter man miles memorized his face and clothing one more thing to keep track of the guard headed toward the entrance to the exhibition hall it was not when todays outing had first been described to miles he had pictured some cavernous quadrangular structure like the one that housed the district agricultural fair at hassadar instead the moon garden hall as it was styled was another dome a miniature suburban imitation of the celestial garden at the center of the city not too miniatureit was over three hundred meters in diameter arcing over steeply sloping ground flocks of welldressed ghemtypes both men and women funneled toward its upper entrance how the hell am i supposed to do that coz vorreedis not the distractible sort tell him i left with a lady for immoral purposes you leave with immoral ladies all the time why not me miles s lips twisted in a suppressed snarl at ivans rolled eyes introduce him to half a dozen of your girlfriends i cant believe we wont run across some here tell them hes the man who taught you all you know about the barrayaran art of love hes not my type said ivan through his teeth so use your initiative i dont have initiative i follow orders thank you its much safer fine i order you to use your initiative ivan breathed a bad word by way of editorial im going to regret this i know i am just hold on a little while longer this will all be over in a few hours one way or another thats what you said day before yesterday you lied it wasnt my fault things were a little more complicated than id anticipated you remember the time down at vorkosigan surleau when we found that old guerrilla weapons cache and you talked me and elena into helping you activate the old hovertank and we ran it into the barn and the barn collapsed and my mother put me under housearrest for two months we were ten years old ivan i remember it like yesterday i remember it like daybeforeyesterday too that old shed was practically falling down anyway saved the price of a demolition crew for gods sake ivan this is serious you cant compare it to miles broke off as the protocol officer dismissed his men and smiling faintly turned back to the two young envoys he shepherded them into the moon garden hall miles was surprised to see something so crass as a sign even if made entirely of flowers decorating an entry arch to a labyrinth of descending walkways spilling down the natural slope the th annual bioesthetics exhibition class a dedicated to the memory of the celestial lady which dedication had made it a mandatory stop on all polite funeral envoys social calendars do the hautwomen compete here miles asked the protocol officer id think this would be in their style so much so that no one else could win if they did said lord vorreedi they have their own annual bash very privately inside the celestial garden but its on hold till this period of official mourning is completed so these ghemwomen exhibitors are um imitating their haut halfsisters trying to anyway thats the name of the game here the ghemladies exhibits were arranged not in rows but each set individually in its own curve or corner miles wondered briefly what kind of jockeying went on behind the scenes for favorable sites and spaces and what kind of statuspoints one could win for obtaining the best ones and if the competition went as far as assassinations characterassassinations anyway he judged from a few snatches of conversation from groups of ghemladies strolling about admiring and critiquing a large tank of fish caught his eye they were filmyfinned their iridescent scales colored in the exact pattern of one of the ghemclans face paintings bright blue yellow black and white the fish swirled in a watery gavotte it was not too remarkable geneticengineeringwise except that the proud and hopeful exhibitor hovering nearby appeared to be a girl of about twelve she seemed to be a mascot for her clans ladies more serious exhibits give me six years and watch out her small smile seemed to say blue roses and black orchids were so routine they were used merely as framing borders for the real entries a young girl passed by in tow of her ghemparents with a unicorn about half a meter high scampering after her on a golden leash it wasnt even an exhibit maybe a commercial product for all miles knew unlike hassadars district agricultural fair utility did not seem to be a consideration it might even count as a defect the competition was for art life was merely the medium a biopalette supplying effects they paused to lean on a balcony railing that gave a partial overview down the hanging gardens slopes a green flicker by his feet caught miles s eye an array of glossy leaves and tendrils was spiraling up ivans leg red blossoms slowly opened and closed breathing a deep and delicate perfume albeit the total effect was unfortunately mouthlike he stared in fascination for a full minute before murmuring uh ivan dont move but look at your left boot as miles watched another tendril slowly wrapped itself around ivans knee and began hoisting ivan glanced down lurched and swore what the hell is it get it off me i doubt its poisonous said the protocol officer uncertainly but perhaps you had better hold still i think its a climbing rose lively little thing isnt it miles grinned and bent nearer cautiously checking for thorns before extending his hands they might be retractable or something colonel vorreedi made a hesitant restraining motion but before he mustered the nerve to risk skin and flesh a plump ghemlady carrying a large basket hurried up the path oh there you are you bad thing she cried excuse me sir she addressed ivan without looking up kneeling by his boot and commencing to unwind her quarry too much nitrogen this morning im afraid the rose let go its last tendril from around ivans boot with a regretful recoil and was unceremoniously plunged into the basket with some other writhing escapees pink and white and yellow the woman her eyes darting here and there at corners and under benches hurried on i think it liked you said miles to ivan pheromones get stuffed murmured ivan back or ill dip you in nitrogen and stake you out under the good god what is this theyd rounded a corner to an open area displaying a graceful tree with large fuzzy heartshaped leaves filling two or three dozen branches that arced and drooped again swaying slightly with the burden of the podded fruit tipping each branch the fruit was mewing miles and ivan stepped closer now now that is just plain wrong said ivan indignantly bundled upside down in each fruit pod was a small kitten long and silky white fur fluffing out around each feline face framing ears and whiskers and bright blue eyes ivan cradled one in his hand and lifted it to his face for closer examination with one blunt finger he carefully tried to pet the creature it batted playfully at his hand with soft white front paws kittens like this should be out chasing string not glued into damned trees to score points for some ghembitch ivan opined hotly he glanced around the area they were temporarily alone and unobserved urn im not so sure theyre glued in said miles wait i dont think youd better trying to stop ivan from rescuing a kitten from a tree was approximately as futile as trying to stop ivan from making a pass at a pretty woman it was some kind of spinal reflex by the glint in his eye he was bent on releasing all the tiny victims to chase after the climbing roses perhaps ivan snapped the pod from the end of its branch the kitten emitted a squall convulsed and went still kitty kitty ivan whispered doubtfully into his cupped hand an alarming trickle of red fluid coursed from the broken stem across his wrist miles pulled back the podleaves around the kittens corpse he feared there was no back half to the beast pink naked legs fused together and disappeared into the stem part of the pod i dont think it was ripe ivan thats horrible ivans breath rasped in his throat with his outrage but the volume was pitched way down by unspoken mutual consent they sidled quickly away from the kittentree and around the nearest unpeopled corner ivan glanced around frantically for a place to dispose of the tiny corpse and so distance himself from his sin and vandalism grotesque miles said thoughtfully oh i dont know its not any more grotesque than the original method when you think about it i mean have you ever watched a mother cat give birth to kittens ivan covered his full hand with the other and glared at his cousin the protocol officer studied ivans dismay with a mixture of exasperation and sympathy miles thought that if he had known ivan longer the proportion of the first emotion to the second would be much higher but vorreedi only said my lord would you like me to dispose of that for you discreetly uh yes please said ivan looking very relieved if you dont mind he hastily palmed off the inert pod of fluff onto the protocol officer who hid it in a pocket handkerchief stay here ill be back shortly he said and went off to get rid of the evidence good one ivan growled miles want to keep your hands in your pockets after this ivan scrubbed at the sticky substance on his hand with his own handkerchief spat into his palm and scrubbed again out out damned spot dont you start making noises like my mother it wasnt my fault things were a little more complicated than id anticipated ivan stuffed his handkerchief back in his pocket and stared around frowning this isnt fun anymore i want to go back to the embassy you have to hang on till i meet my contact at least and when will that be soon i suspect they strolled to the end of the aisle where another little balcony gave an enticing view of the next lower section damn said ivan what do you see asked miles tracking his gaze he stretched to stand on tiptoe but it wasnt enough to spot what had caught ivans negative attention our good buddy lord yenaro is here two levels down talking to some women it could be a coincidence this place is lousy with ghemlords with the award ceremony this afternoon the winning women gain honor for their clan naturally they want to cash in and this is just the sort of artsy stuff that tickles his fancy i think ivan cocked an eyebrow at him you want to bet on that nope ivan sighed i dont suppose theres any way we can get him before he gets us dont know keep your eyes open anyway no lie they stared around some more a ghemlady of middleage and dignified bearing approached them and gave miles an acknowledging if not exactly friendly nod her palm turned outward briefly displaying to him a heavy ring with a raised screamingbird pattern filigreed with complex encodes now miles said quietly no her cultured voice was a lowpitched alto meet me by the west entrance in thirty minutes i may not be able to achieve precision ill wait she passed on crap said ivan after a moments silence youre really going to try to bring this off you will be the hell careful wont you oh yes the protocol officer was taking a long time to find the nearest wastedisposal unit miles thought but just as his nerves were stretching to the point of going to look for the man he reappeared walking quickly toward them his smile of greeting seemed a little strained my lords he nodded something has come up im going to have to leave you for a while stay together and dont leave the building please perfect maybe what sort of something asked miles we spotted yenaro our practical joker yes we know hes here my analysts judge him a nonlethal annoyance i must leave you to defend yourselves from him temporarily but my outerperimeter man who is one of my sharpest fellows has spotted another individual known to us a professional the term professional in this context meant a professional killer or something along those lines miles nodded alertly we dont know why hes here vorreedi went on i have some heavier backup on the way in the meanwhile we propose to drop in on him for a short chat fastpenta is illegal here for anyone but the police and the imperials isnt it i doubt this one would go to the authorities to complain murmured vorreedi with a slightly sinister smile have fun watch yourselves the protocol officer nodded and drifted away asifcasually miles and ivan walked on pausing to examine a couple more rooted floral displays that seemed less unnervingly uncertain of their kingdom and phylum miles counted minutes in his head he could break away shortly and reach his rendezvous right on time well hello sweet thing a musical voice trilled from behind them ivan turned around a beat faster than miles lady arvin and lady benello stood with arms linked they unlinked arms and oozed miles decided was the term up on either side of ivan capturing one side each sweet thing miles murmured in delight ivan spared him a brief glower before turning to his greeters we heard you were here lord ivan the blonde lady arvin continued tall lady benello concurred her cascade of amber curls bouncing with her nod what are you doing afterwards ah no particular plans said ivan his head swiveling in an attempt to divide his attention precisely in half ooh said lady arvin perhaps you would care to have dinner with me at my penthouse lady benello interrupted or if youre not in an urban mood i know this place not far from here on a lake each patron is rowed out to their own little tiny island and a picnic is served alfresco its very private each woman smiled repellingly at the other ivan looked faintly hunted what a tough decision he temporized come along and see lady benellos sisters pretties while you think about it then lord ivan said lady arvin equably her eye fell on miles you too lord vorkosigan weve been neglecting our most senior guest quite shamefully i think upon discussion we think this might be a regrettable oversight her hand tightened on ivans arm and she peeked around his torso to give her redhaired companion a bright meaningful smile this could be the solution to lord ivans dilemma in the dark all cats are gray miles murmured or at any rate all barrayarans ivan winced at the mention of felines lady arvin looked blank but miles had a bad feeling the redhead had caught the joke in any case she detached herself from ivanwas that a flash of triumph crossing lady arvins faceand turned to miles indeed lord vorkosigan do you have any particular plans im afraid so said miles with a regret that was not entirely feigned in fact i have to be going now right now oh do come see my sisters exhibit at least lady benello stopped short of linking arms with him but seemed willing to walk by his side even if it left her rival in temporary possession of ivan time it wouldnt hurt to give the protocol officer a few more minutes to become fully engaged with his quarry miles smiled thinly and allowed himself to be dragged along in the wake of the party lady arvin in the lead towing ivan that tall redhead lacked the porcelain delicacy of the haut rian on the other hand she was not nearly so impossible the difficult we do at once the impossible takes stop it these women are users you know that oh god let me be used focus boy goddammit they walked down the switchback pathway arriving at the next lower level lady arvin turned in at a small circular open space screened by trees in tubs their leaves were glossy and jewellike but they were merely a frame for the display in the center the display was a little baffling artistically it seemed to consist of three lengths of thick brocade in subtle hues spiraling loosely around each other from the top of a manhigh pole to trail on the carpet below the dense circular carpet echoed the greens of the bordering trees in a complex abstract pattern heads up murmured ivan i see him breathed miles lord yenaro darkrobed and smiling was sitting on one of the little curving benches that also helped frame the space wheres veda asked lady benello she just stepped out said yenaro rising and nodding greetings to all lord yenaro has been giving my sister veda a little help with her entry lady benello confided to miles and ivan oh said miles staring around and wondering where the trap was this time he didnt see it yet and uh just what is her entry i know it doesnt look very impressive said lady benello defensively but thats not the point the subtlety is in the smell its the cloth it emits a perfume that changes with the mood of the wearer i still wonder if we ought to have had it made up into a dress this last comment seemed aimed at yenaro we could have had one of the servitors stand here and model it all day it would have seemed too commercial yenaro said to her this will score better and um its alive asked ivan doubtfully the scent glands in the cloth are as alive as the sweat glands in your body yenaro assured him nevertheless you are right the display is a bit static step closer and well handdemonstrate the effects miles sniffed his paranoiaheightened awareness trying to individually check every volatile molecule that entered his nostrils the dome was clouded with scents of every kind drifting down from the displays upslope not to mention the perfumes of the ghemladies and yenaro in their robes but the brocade did seem to be emitting a pleasant mixture of odors ivan didnt respond to the invitation to come closer either miles noticed in addition to the perfumes though there was something else a faint oily acridity yenaro picked up a pitcher from the bench and walked toward the pole more zlati ale ivan murmured dryly recognition and memory zinged through miles followed by a wave of adrenaline that nearly stopped his heart before it began racing grab that pitcher ivan dont let him spill it ivan did yenaro gave up his hold with a surprised snort really lord ivan miles dropped prone to the thick carpet sniffing frantically yes what are you doing asked lady benello halflaughing the rug isnt part of it oh yes it is ivan said miles urgently scrambling back to his feet hand me thatcarefully and tell me what you smell down there miles took the pitcher much more tenderly than he would have a basket of raw eggs ivan with a look of some bewilderment did as he was told he sniffed then ran his hand through the carpet and touched his fingers to his lips and turned white miles knew ivan had reached the same conclusion he had even before he turned his head and hissed asterzine miles tiptoed back well away from the carpet lifted the pitchers lid and sniffed again a faint odor resembling vanilla and oranges gone slightly wrong wafted up which was exactly right and yenaro had been going to dump it all miles was sure at his own feet with lady benello and lady arvin looking on miles thought of the fate of lord xs prince slykes last tool the ba lura no yenaro doesnt know he may hate barrayarans but hes not that frigging crazy he was set up right along with us this time third times a charm all right when ivan rose his jaw set and his eyes burning miles motioned him over and handed him the pitcher again ivan took it gingerly stepping back another pace miles knelt and tore off a few threads from the carpets edge the threads parted with a gumlike stretching confirming his diagnosis lord vorkosigan lady arvin objected her brows drawn down in amused puzzlement at the barrayarans bizarre barbarian behavior miles traded the threads to ivan for the pitcher again and jerked his head toward yenaro bring him excuse us please ladies um mantalk rather to his surprise this appeal actually worked lady arvin only arched her brows though lady benello pouted slightly ivan wrapped one hand around yenaros upper arm and guided him out of the display area ivans grip tightened in silent threat when yenaro tried to shrug him off yenaro looked angry and tightlipped and just a little embarrassed they found an empty nook a few spaces down ivan stood himself and his captive with their backs to the path shielding miles from view miles gently set the pitcher down stood jerked up his chin and addressed yenaro in a lowpitched growl i will demonstrate what you almost did in just a moment what i want to know now is just what the hell you thought you were doing i dont know what youre talking about snapped yenaro let go you lout ivan kept his hold frowning fiercely demonstrate first coz right the pavingstones were some cool artificial marble and did not look flammable miles shook the threads off his finger and motioned ivan and yenaro closer he waited till there were no passersby in sight and said yenaro take two drops on your fingers of that harmless liquid you were waving around and sprinkle them on this ivan forced yenaro to kneel alongside miles yenaro with a cold glance at his captors dipped his hand and sprinkled as ordered if you think he was interrupted by a bright flash and a wave of heat that scorched miless eyebrows the soft report fortunately was mostly muffled by their shielding bodies yenaro froze arrested and that was only about a gram of material miles went on relentlessly that whole carpetbomb massed what about five kilos you should know im certain you carried it in here personally when the catalyst hit it would have gone up taking out this whole section of the dome you me the ladies it would have been quite the high point of the show this is some sort of trick grated yenaro oh its a trick all right but this time the joke was on you youve never had any military training at all have you or with your nose youd have recognized it too sensitized asterzine lovely stuff formable dyeable you can make it look like practically anything and totally inert and harmless till the catalyst hits it then miles nodded toward the small scorched patch on the white pavement let me put the question to you another way yenaro what effect did your good friend the hautgovernor tell you this was going to have he yenaros breath caught his hand swept down across the dark and oily residue then rose to his nose he inhaled frowning then sat back rather weakly on his heels his wide eyes lifted to meet miless gaze oh confession said ivan meaningfully is good for the soul and body miles took a breath once more from the top yenaro what did you think you were doing yenaro swallowed it was supposed to release an ester that would simulate alcohol poisoning you barrayarans are famous for that perversion nothing that you dont already do to yourselves allowing ivan and me to publicly stagger through the rest of the afternoon blind drunk or a close approximation something like that and yourself did you just ingest the antidote before we showed up no it was harmless supposed to be i had made arrangements to go and rest till it passed off i thought it might be an interesting sensation pervert murmured ivan yenaro glared at him miles said slowly when i was burned that first night all that handwringing on your part wasnt totally feigned was it you werent expecting it yenaro paled i expected i thought perhaps the marilacans had done something to the power adjustment it was only supposed to shock not injure or so you were told yes yenaro whispered the zlati ale was your idea though wasnt it growled ivan you knew im not an idiot some passing ghem glanced in puzzlement at the three men kneeling in a circle on the floor though fortunately they passed on without comment miles nodded to the nearest bench in the curve of the nook i have something to tell you lord yenaro and i think you had better be sitting down ivan guided yenaro to it and firmly pushed him down after a thoughtful moment ivan then poured the rest of the pitcher of liquid into the nearest treetub before settling between yenaro and the exit this isnt just a series of gratifying tricks played on the doltish envoys of a despised enemy for you to chuckle at miles went on lowly you are being used as a pawn in a treason plot against the cetagandan emperor used discarded and silenced its beginning to be a pattern your last fellowpawn was the ba lura i trust youve heard what happened to it yenaros pale lips parted but he breathed no word after a moment he licked his lips and tried again this cant be its too crude it would have started a blood feud between his clan and those of all the innocent bystanders no it would have started a blood feud between their clans and yours you were set up to take the fall for this one not only as an assassin but as one so incompetent that he blew himself up with his own bomb following in your grandfathers footsteps so to speak and who would be left alive to deny it the confusion would multiply within the capital as well as between your empire and barrayar while his satrapy made its break for independence no not crude downright elegant the ba lura committed suicide it was said no murdered cetagandan imperial security is on to that one too they will unravel it in time no they will unravel it eventually i dont trust that it will be in time it is impossible for a ba servitor to commit treason unless the ba servitor thinks that it is acting loyally in a deliberately ambiguous situation i dont think even the ba are so unhuman that they cannot be mistaken no yenaro looked up at both the barrayarans you must believe i would have no regrets whatsoever if you two fell off a cliff but i would not push you myself i so i judged said miles but for my curiositywhat were you to get out of the deal besides a weeks amusement in embarrassing a couple of loutish barbarians or was this art for arts sake on your part he promised me a post yenaro stared at the floor again you dont understand what it is to be without a post in the capital you have no position you have no status you are no one i was tired of being no one what post imperial perfumer yenaros dark eyes flashed i know it doesnt sound very mighty but it would have gained me entrance to the celestial garden maybe the imperial presence itself where i would have worked among the best in the empire the top people and i would have been good miles had no trouble understanding ambition no matter how arcane its form i imagine so yenaros lips twitched in half a grateful smile miles glanced at his chrono god im late ivancan you handle this from here i think so miles rose good day lord yenaro and a better one than you were destined to have i think i may have used up a years supply this afternoon already but wish me luck i have a little date with prince slyke now good luck yenaro said doubtfully miles paused it was prince slyke was it not no i was talking about governor the haut ilsum kety miles pursed his lips and blew out his breath in a slow trickle i have just been either screwed or saved i wonder which kety set you up with all this yes could kety have sent his fellow governor and cousin prince slyke to scout out the imperial regalia for him a stalking horse certainly or not for that matter could slyke have set up kety to operate yenaro for him not impossible back to square one damn damn damn while miles hovered in new doubt the protocol officer rounded the corner his hurried stride slowed as he spotted miles and ivan and a look of relief crossed his face by the time he strolled into the nook he was projecting the air of a tourist again but he raked yenaro with a knifekeen glance hello my lords his nod took all three in equally hello sir said miles did you have an interesting conversation extraordinarily ah i dont believe youve formally met lord yenaro sir lord yenaro this is my embassys protocol officer lord vorreedi the two men exchanged more studied nods yenaros hand going to his chest in a sketch of a sitting bow what a coincidence lord yenaro vorreedi went on we were just talking about you oh said yenaro warily ah vorreedi sucked his lip thoughtfully then seemed to come to some internal decision are you aware that you seem to be in the middle of some sort of vendetta at present lord yenaro ino what makes you think so hm normally ghemlords personal affairs are not my business only the official ones but the ah chance of a good deed has come up so squarely in my path i shall not avoid it this time i just had a short talk with a ah gentleman who informed me he was here today with the mission of seeing that you in his precise phrasing did not leave the moon garden hall alive he was a little vague about what method he proposed to use to accomplish this what made him peculiar in this venue was that he was no ghem a purely commercial artist he did not know who had hired him that information being concealed behind several layers of screening do you have any guesses yenaro listened to this recital shocked tightlipped and thoughtful miles wondered if yenaro was going through the same set of deductions he was he rather thought so the hautgovernor it appeared whichever one it was had sent yenaros ploy some backup just to make sure nothing went wrong such as yenaro surviving his own bombing to accuse his betrayer i have a guess yes would you care to share it yenaro regarded him doubtfully not at this time suit yourself vorreedi shrugged we left him sitting in a quiet corner the fastpenta should wear off in about ten minutes you have that much leadtime to dowhatever you decide thank you lord vorreedi said yenaro quietly he gathered his dark robes about himself and rose he was pale but admirably controlled not shaking i think i will leave you now probably a good choice said vorreedi keep in touch huh said miles yenaro gave him a brief formal nod yes we must talk again he strode away glancing left and right ivan chewed on his fingers it was better than his blurting out everything to vorreedi right here and now miless greatest fear was that all true sir miles asked colonel vorreedi yes vorreedi rubbed his nose except that im not so certain that it isnt any of our business lord yenaro seems to be taking a great deal of interest in you one cant help wondering if there might be some hidden connection sifting through that hired thugs hierarchy would be tedious and timeconsuming for my department and what would we find at the end vorreedis eye fell coolly on miles just how angry were you at getting your legs burned the other night lord vorkosigan not that angry miles denied hastily give me credit for a sense of proportion at least sir no it wasnt me who hired the goon though he had just as surely set up yenaro for this by attempting to play all those cute little headgames with his possible patrons kety prince slyke and the rond you wanted a reaction you got one but its just a feeling you understand but i think pursuing this lead might be time and resources well spent fj a feeling eh you surely have trusted your intuition before in your work sir used yes trusted never an impsec officer should be clear about the difference i understand sir they all rose to continue the tour of the exhibition miles carefully not glancing at the scorched spot on the pavement as they passed on as they approached the west side of the dome miles searched the robed crowd for his contactlady there she was sitting near a fountain frowning but he would never succeed in ditching vorreedi now the man was stuck like glue he tried anyway excuse me sir i have to speak to a lady ill come with you said vorreedi pleasantly right miles sighed hastily composing his message the dignified ghemlady looked up as he approached with his unwelcome companions miles realized he didnt know the womans name pardon me milady i just wanted to let you know that i will not be able to accept your invitation to visit uh this afternoon please convey my deepest regrets to your mistress would she and the haut rian interpret this as intended as abort abort abort miles could only pray so but if she can arrange instead a visit to the mans cousin i think that would be most educational the womans frown deepened but she only said i will convey your words lord vorkosigan miles nodded farewell mentally blessing her for avoiding the pitfall of any more complicated reply when he looked back she had already swept to her feet and was hurrying away chapter eleven miles had not entered the sacred confines of the barrayaran embassys impsec offices before having stayed discreetly upstairs in the diplomatic corps plusher territory as hed posited it was on the second lowest basement level a uniformed corporal ushered him past security scanners and into colonel vorreedis office it was not as austere as miles expected being decorated all about with small examples of cetagandan art objects though the powered sculptures were all turned off this morning some might be mementos but the rest suggested the socalled protocol officer was a collector of excellent taste if limited means the man himself was seated at a desk cleared in utilitarian bareness vorreedi was dressed as usual in the underlayers and robes of a middleranking ghemlord of painfully sober preferences subdued blues and grays except for the lack of face paint in a crowd of ghem vorreedi would practically disappear though behind a barrayaran impsec comconsole desk the effect of the ensemble was a little startling miles moistened his lips good morning sir ambassador vorobyev told me you wanted to see me yes thank you lord vorkosigan vorreedis nod dismissed the corporal who withdrew silently the doors slid shut behind him with a heavy sealing sound do sit down miles slipped into the station chair across the desk from vorreedi and smiled in what he hoped seemed innocent good cheer vorreedi looked across at miles with keen undivided attention not good vorreedi was second in authority here only to ambassador vorobyev and like vorobyev had been chosen as a top man for one of the most critical posts in the barrayaran diplomatic corps one might count on vorreedi to be a very busy man but never a stupid one miles wondered if vorreedis meditations this past night had been one half so busy as his own miles braced himself for an illyanesque opening shot such as what the hell are you up to vorkosigan trying to start a damned war singlehanded instead colonel vorreedi favored him with a long thoughtful stare before observing mildly lieutenant lord vorkosigan you are an impsec courier officer by assignment yes sir when i am on duty an interesting breed of men utterly reliable and loyal they go here go there deliver whatever is asked of them without question or comment or failure short of intervention by death itself its not usually that dramatic we spend a lot of time riding around in jumpships one catches up on ones reading mm and to a man these glorified mailmen report to commodore boothe head of impsec communications komarr with one exception vorreedis gaze intensified you are listed as reporting directly to simon illyan himself who reports to emperor gregor the only other person i know of offhand in a chain of command that short is the chief of staff of the imperial service its an interesting anomaly how do you explain it how do i explain it miles echoed temporizing he thought briefly of replying i never explain anything except that was both already evident and clearly not the answer vorreedi was looking for why every once in a while emperor gregor needs a personal errand run for himself or his household which is too trivial or too inappropriate to assign to working military personnel perhaps he wants say an ornamental breadfruit bush brought from the planet pol to be planted in the garden of the imperial residence they send me thats a good explanation vorreedi agreed blandly there was a short silence and do you have an equally good story for how you acquired this pleasant job nepotism obviously since i am clearly miless smile thinned physically unfit for normal duties this post was manufactured for me by my family connections hm vorreedi sat back and rubbed his chin now he said distantly if you were a covert ops agent here on a mission from god meaning simon illyansame thing from the impsec point of view you should have arrived with some sort of render all due assistance order then a poor impsec local man might know where he stood with you if i dont get this man under control he can and will nail my boots to the floor of the embassy and lord x will have no impediment at all to his baroque bid for chaos and empire yes sir miles took a breath and so would anyone else who saw it vorreedi glanced up startled does impsec command suspect a leak in my communications not as far as i know but as a lowly courier i cant ask questions can i by the slight widening of his eyes vorreedi caught the joke a subtle man indeed from the moment you set foot on eta ceta lord vorkosigan i have not noticed you stop asking questions a personal failing and do you have any supporting evidence for your explanation of yourself certainly miles stared thoughtfully into the air as if about to pull his words from the thinnest part consider sir all other impsec courier officers have an implanted allergy to fastpenta it renders them interrogationproof to illicit questioners at fatal cost due to my rank and relations that was judged too dangerous a procedure to do to me therefore i am qualified for only the lowestsecurity sort of missions its all nepotism very convincing it wouldnt be much good if it werent sir true another long pause is there anything else youd like to tell melieutenant when i return to barrayar i will be giving a complete report of my mexcursion to simon illyan im afraid youll have to apply to him it is definitely not within my authority to try and guess what he will wish to tell you there whew hed told no lies at all technically even by implication yeah be sure and point that out when they play a transcript of this conversation at your future courtmartial but if vorreedi chose to construe that miles was a covert ops agent working on the highest levels and in utmost secrecy it was no less than perfectly true the fact that his mission here was spontaneously selfappointed and not assigned from above was another order of problem altogether i could add a philosophical observation please do my lord you dont hire a genius to solve the most intractable imaginable problem and then hedge him around with a lot of rules nor try to micromanage him from two weeks distance you turn him loose if all you need is somebody to follow orders you can hire an idiot in fact an idiot would be better suited vorreedis fingers drummed lightly on his comconsole desk miles felt the man might have tackled an intractable problem or two himself in his past vorreedis brows rose and do you consider yourself a genius lord vorkosigan he asked softly vorreedis tone of voice made miless skin crawl it reminded him so much of his fathers when count vorkosigan was about to spring some major verbal trap my intelligence evaluations are in my personnel file sir ive read it thats why were having this conversation vorreedi blinked slowly like a lizard no rules at all well one rule maybe deliver success or pay with your ass you have held your current post for almost three years i see lieutenant vorkosigan your ass is still intact is it last time i checked sir for the next five days maybe this suggests astonishing authority and autonomy no authority at all just responsibility oh dear vorreedi pursed his lips very thoughtfully indeed you have my sympathy lord vorkosigan thank you sir i need it into the alltoomeditative silence that followed miles added do we know if lord yenaro survived the night he disappeared so we think he has he was last seen leaving the moon garden hall with a roll of carpet over his shoulder vorreedi cocked an inquiring eye at miles i have no explanation for the carpet miles ignored the broad hint responding instead with are you so sure that disappearance equates with his survival what about his stalker hm vorreedi smiled shortly after we left him he was picked up by the cetagandan civil police who still have him in close custody they did this on their own lets say they received an anonymous tip it seemed the socially responsible thing to do but i must say the civils responded to it with admirable efficiency he appears to be of interest to them for some previous work did he have time to report in to his employers before he was canned no so lord x was in an information vacuum this morning he wouldnt like that one bit the misfire of yesterdays plot must make him frantically frustrated he wouldnt know what had gone wrong or if yenaro had realized his intended fate though yenaros disappearance and subsequent noncommunication would surely be a fat clue yenaro was now as loose a cannon as miles and ivan which of them would be first on lord xs hit list after this would yenaro go seeking protection to some authority or would the rumor of treason frighten him off and what method could lord x come up with for disposing of the barrayaran envoys onehalf so baroque and perfect as yenaro had been yenaro was a masterpiece as far as the art of assassination went beautifully choreographed in three movements and a crescendo now all that elaborate effort was wasted lord x would be as livid at the spoiling of his lovely pattern as at the failure of his plot miles swore and he was an anxious impatient artist who couldnt leave well enough alone who had to add those clever little touches the kind of person who as a child given his first garden would dig up the seeds to see if theyd sprouted yet miles felt a tiny twinge of sympathy for lord x yes indeed lord x playing for great stakes and losing both time and his inhibitions was now well and classically primed to make a major mistake why am i not so sure thats such a great idea more to add lord vorkosigan said vorreedi hm no just uh thinking besides it would only upset you i would request as the embassy officer ultimately responsible for your personal safety as an official envoy that you and lord vorpatril end your social contacts with a man who is apparently involved in a lethal cetagandan vendetta yenaro is of no further interest to me i wish him no harm my real priority is in identifying the man who supplied him with that fountain vorreedis brows rose in mild reproach you might have said so earlier hindsight said miles is always better thats for damned sure sighed vorreedi in a voice of experience he scratched his nose and sat back there is another reason i called you here this morning lord vorkosigan ghemcolonel benin has requested a second interview with you has he same as before miles kept his voice from squeaking not quite he specifically requested to speak with both you and lord vorpatril in fact hes on his way now but you can refuse the interview if you wish no thats thats fine in fact id like to talk to benin again i ah shall i go fetch ivan then sir miles rose to his feet bad bad idea to let the two suspects consult before the interrogation but then this wasnt vorreedis case how fully had miles convinced the man of his secret clout go ahead said vorreedi affably though i must say miles paused i do not see how lord vorpatril fits into this hes no courier officer and his records are as transparent as glass a lot of people are baffled by ivan sir but sometimes even a genius needs someone who can follow orders miles tried not to scamper hustling down the corridor to ivans quarters the luxury of privacy their status had bought them was about to come to a screeching halt he suspected if vorreedi didnt turn on the bugs in both their rooms after this the man either had supernatural selfcontrol or was brain dead and the protocol officer was the voraciously curious type it went with his job ivan unlocked his door with a drawl of enter at miless impatient knock miles found his cousin sitting up in bed halfdressed in green trousers and cream shirt leafing through a pile of handcalligraphed colored papers with an abstracted and not particularly happy air ivan get up get dressed were about to have an interview with colonel vorreedi and ghemcolonel benin confession at last thank god ivan tossed the papers up in the air and fell backward on his bed with a woof of relief no not exactly but i need you to let me do most of the talking and confirm whatever i assert oh damn ivan frowned up at the ceiling what now benin has to have been investigating ba luras movements the day before its death im guessing hes traced the ba to our little encounter at the pod dock i dont want to screw up his investigation in fact i want it to succeed at least as far as identifying the bas murderer so he needs as many real facts as possible real facts as opposed to what other kind of facts we absolutely cant bring up any mention of the great key or the haut rian i figure we can tell events exactly as they happened just leave out that one tiny detail you figure do you you must be using a different kind of math than the rest of the universe does do you realize how pissed vorreedi and the ambassador are going to be about our concealing that little incident ive got vorreedi under control temporarily he thinks im on a mission from simon illyan that means you arent i knew it ivan groaned and pulled a pillow over his face and squashed it tight miles pulled it out of his grasp i am now or i would be if illyan knew what i know bring that nerve disrupter but dont pull it out unless i tell you to i am not shooting your commanding officer for you youre not shooting anybody and anyway vorreedis not my commander that could be an important legal point later i may want it for evidence but not unless the subject comes up we volunteer nothing never volunteer yes thats the ticket youre catching on at last coz shut up get up miles threw ivans undress uniform jacket across his prostrate form this is important but you have to stay absolutely cool i may be completely offbase and panicking prematurely i dont think so i think youre panicking postmaturely in fact if you were panicking any later it would be practically posthumously ive been panicking for days miles tossed ivan his halfboots with ruthless finality ivan shook his head sat up and began pulling them on do you remember ivan sighed that time in the back garden at vorkosigan house when youd been reading all those military histories about the cetagandan prison camps during the invasion and you decided we had to dig an escape tunnel except it was you who did all the designing and me and elena who did all the digging we were about eight said miles defensively the medics were still working on my bones i was still pretty friable then and the tunnel collapsed on me ivan went on dreamily and i was under there for hours it wasnt hours it was minutes sergeant bothari had you out of there in practically no time it seemed like hours to me i can still taste the dirt it got stuffed up my nose too ivan rubbed his nose in memory mother would still be having the fit if aunt cordelia hadnt sat on her we were stupid little kids what has this got to do with anything nothing i suppose i just woke up thinking about it this morning ivan stood up fastened his tunic and pulled it straight i never believed id miss sergeant bothari but i think i do now whos going to dig me out this time miles wanted to snap out a sharp rejoinder but shivered instead i miss bothari too he had almost forgotten how much till ivans words hit the scar of his regret that secret little pocket of anguish that never seemed to drain major mistakes dammit a man walking a tightwire didnt need someone shouting from the sidelines how far down the drop was or what lousy balance he had it wasnt like he didnt know but what he most needed was to forget even a momentary loss of concentrationof selfconfidenceof forward momentum could be fatal do me a favor ivan dont try to think youll hurt yourself just follow orders huh ivan bared his teeth in a nonsmile and followed miles out the door they met with ghemcolonel benin in the same little conference room as before but this time vorreedi rode shotgun personally dispensing with the guard the two colonels were just finishing the amenities and sitting down as miles and ivan entered by which sign miles hoped theyd had less time to compare notes than he and ivand had benin was dressed again in his formal red uniform and lurid face paint freshly and perfectly applied by the time theyd all finished going through the polite greetings once more and everyone was reseated miles had his breathing and heartbeat under control ivan concealed his nerves in an expression of blank benevolence that made him look in miless opinion remarkably sappy lord vorkosigan ghemcolonel benin began i understand you work as a courier officer when im on duty miles decided to repeat the party line for benins benefit its an honorable task thats not too physically demanding for me and do you like your duties miles shrugged i like the travel and ah it gets me out of the way an advantage that cuts two ways you know about barrayars backward attitude to mutations miles thought of yenaro s longing for a post and it gives me an official position makes me somebody i can understand that conceded benin yeah i thought you would but youre not on courier duty now not this trip we were to give our diplomatic duties our undivided attention and it was hoped maybe acquire a little polish and lord vorpatril here is assigned to operations is that right desk work ivan sighed i keep hoping for ship duty not really true miles reflected ivan adored being assigned to hq at the capital where he kept up his own apartment and a social life that was the envy of his brotherofficers ivan just wished his mother lady vorpatril might be assigned ship duty someplace far away hm benins hands twitched as if in memory of sorting stacks of plastic flimsies he drew breath and looked miles straight in the eyes so lord vorkosiganthe funeral rotunda was not the first time you saw the ba lura was it benin was trying for the rattling unexpected straight shot to unnerve his quarry correct miles answered with a smile expecting denial benin already had his mouth open for the second strike probably the presentation of some telling piece of evidence that would give the barrayaran the lie he had to close it again and start over if if you wished to keep it a secret why did you as much as flat tell me to look where i would be sure to find you and his tone sharpened with baffled annoyance if you didnt want to keep it a secret why didnt you tell me about it in the first place it provided an interesting test of your competence i wanted to know if it would be worth my while to persuade you to share your results believe me my first encounter with the ba lura is as much a mystery to me as im sure it is to you even from beneath the gaudy face paint the look benin gave miles reminded him forcibly of the look he got all too often from superiors he even capitalized it in his mind the look in a weird backhanded way it made him feel quite comfortable with benin his smile became slightly cheerier and how did you encounter the ba said benin what do you know so far miles countered benin would of course keep something back to crosscheck miles s story that was quite all right as miles proposed to tell almost the whole truth next ba lura was at the transfer station the day you arrived he left the station at least twice once apparently from a pod docking bay in which the security monitors were deactivated and unchecked for a period of forty minutes the same bay and the same period in which you arrived lord vorkosigan our first arrival you mean yes vorreedis eyes were widening and his lips were thinning miles ignored him for now though ivans gaze cautiously shifted to check him out deactivated torn out of the wall id call it very well ghemcolonel but tell mewas our encounter in the pod dock the first or second time the ba appeared to leave the station second benin said watching him closely can you prove that yes good it may be very important later that you can prove that ha benin wasnt the only one who could crosscheck the truth of this conversation benin for whatever reason was being straight with him so far turn and turnabout well this is what happened from our point of view in a flat voice and with plenty of corroborative physical details miles described their confusing clash with the ba the only item he changed was to report the ba reaching for its trouser pocket before hed yelled his warning he brought the tale up to the moment of ivans heroic struggle and his own retrieval of the loose nerve disrupter and bounced it over to ivan to finish ivan gave him a dirty look but taking his tone from miles offered a brief factual description of the bas subsequent escape since it lacked face paint miles could watch vorreedis face darken out of the corner of his eye the man was too cool and controlled to actually turn purple or anything but miles bet a blood pressure monitor would be beeping in plaintive alarm right now and why did you not report this at our first meeting lord vorkosigan benin asked again after a long digestive pause i might said vorreedi in a slightly suffused voice ask you the same question lieutenant benin shot vorreedi a raisedbrow look almost putting his face paint in danger of smudging lieutenant not my lord miles took the point the pod pilot reported to his captain who will have reported to his commander to wit illyan in fact the report slogging through normal channels should be reaching illyans desk right about now three days more for an emergency query to arrive on vorreedis desk from home six more days for a reply and returnreply it would all be over before illyan could do a damned thing now however on my authority as senior envoy i suppressed the incident for diplomatic reasons we were sent with specific instructions to maintain a low profile and behave with maximum courtesy my government considered this solemn occasion an important opportunity to send a message that we would be glad to see more normal trade and other relations and an easing of tensions along our mutual borders i did not judge that it would do anything helpful for our mutual tensions to open our visit with charges of an unmotivated armed attack by an imperial slave upon the barrayaran special representatives the implied threat was obvious enough despite benins face paint miles could tell that one had hit home even vorreedi looked like he might be giving the pitch serious consideration can you prove your assertions lord vorkosigan asked benin cautiously we still have the captured nerve disruptor ivan miles nodded to his cousin gently using only his fingertips ivan drew the weapon from his pocket and laid it gingerly on the table and returned his hands demurely to his lap he avoided vorreedis outraged eye vorreedi and benin reached simultaneously for the nerve disruptor and simultaneously stopped frowning at each other excuse me said vorreedi i had not seen this before really said benin how extraordinary his tone implied go ahead his hand dropped politely vorreedi picked up the weapon and examined it closely among other things checking to see that the safety lock was indeed engaged before handing it equally politely to benin id be glad to return the weapon to you ghemcolonel miles went on in exchange for whatever information you are able to deduce from it if it can be traced back to the celestial garden thats not much help but if it was something the ba acquired en route well it might be revealing this is a check that you can make more easily than i can miles paused then added who did the ba visit from the station the first time benin glanced up from his close contemplation of the nerve disruptor a ship moored offstation can you be more specific no excuse me let me rephrase that could you be more specific if you chose to benin set the disruptor down and leaned back his expression of attention to miles if possible intensifying he was silent for a long thoughtful moment before finally replying no unfortunately i could not rats the three hautgovernors ships moored off that transfer station were ilsum ketys slyke giajas and este ronds this could have been the final line of his triangulation but benin didnt have it yet id be particularly interested in how traffic control or what certainly passed for traffic control came to direct us to the wrong or at any rate the first pod dock why do you think the ba entered your pod benin asked in turn given the intense confusion of the encounter i certainly would consider the possibility of it having been an accident if it was arranged i think something must have gone very wrong no shit said ivans silent morose look miles ignored him anyway ghemcolonel i hope this helps to anchor your timetable miles continued in a tone of finality surely benin would be itching to run and check out his new clue the nerve disrupter benin didnt budge so what did you and the haut rian really discuss lord vorkosigan for that im afraid you will have to apply to the haut rian she is cetagandan to the bone and so all your department alas but i think her distress at the death of the ba lura was quite genuine benins eyes flicked up when did you see enough of her to gauge the depth of her distress or so i deduced and if he didnt end this now he was going to put his foot in it so deep theyd need a handtractor to pull it out again he had to play vorreedi with the utmost delicacy this was not quite the case with benin this is fascinating ghemcolonel but im afraid im out of time for this morning but if you ever find out where that nerve disruptor came from and where the ba went to i would be more than glad to continue the conversation he sat back folded his arms and smiled cordially what vorreedi should have done was announce loudly that they had all the time in the world and let benin continue to be his stalkinghorsemiles would have in his placebut vorreedi himself was clearly itching to get miles alone instead the protocol officer rose signaling the official end to the interview benin on embassy grounds as a guest on sufferancenot his normal mode miles was sureacceded without comment rising to take his farewells i will be speaking with you again lord vorkosigan benin promised darkly i certainly hope so sir ahdid you take my other piece of advice too about blocking interference benin paused looking suddenly a little abstracted yes in fact how did it go better than i would have expected good benins parting semisalute was ironic but not miles felt altogether hostile vorreedi escorted his guest to the door but turned him over to the hall guard and was back in the little room before miles and ivan could make good their escape vorreedi pinned miles by eye miles felt a momentary regret that his diplomatic immunity did not extend to the protocol officer as well would it occur to vorreedi to separate the pair of them and break ivan ivan was practicing looking invisible something he did very well vorreedi stated dangerously i am not a mushroom lieutenant vorkosigan to be kept in the dark and fed on horseshit right miles sighed inwardly sir apply to my commander meaning illyanvorreedis commander too in point of factbe cleared and im yours until then my best judgment is to continue exactly as i have been trusting your instincts said vorreedi dryly its not as if i had any clear conclusions to share yet so do your instincts suggest some connection between the late ba lura and lord yenaro vorreedi had instincts too oh yes or he wouldnt be in this post besides the fact that both have interacted with me nothing that i trust im after proof then i will be somewhere where head down in the biggest privy you ever imagined at the current rate i guess ill know when i get there sir we too will speak again lord vorkosigan you can count on it vorreedi gave him a very abbreviated nod and departed abruptlyprobably to apprise ambassador vorobyev of the new complications in his life into the ensuing silence miles said faintly that went well all things considered ivans lip curled in scorn they kept silence on the trudge back to ivans room where ivan found a new stack of colored papers waiting on his desk he sorted through them pointedly ignoring miles i have to reach rian somehow miles said at last i cant afford to wait things are getting too damned tight i dont want anything more to do with any of this said ivan distantly its too late yes i know his hand paused huh heres a new wrinkle this one has both our names on it not from lady benello is it im afraid vorreedi will count her offlimits now no its not a name i recognize miles pounced on the paper and tore it open lady dhar a garden party what does she grow in her garden i wonder could it be a double meaningreferencing the celestial garden hm awfully short notice it could be my next contact god i hate being at haut rians mercy for every setup well accept it anyway just in case its not my first choice of how to spend the evening said ivan did i say anything about a choice its a chance weve got to take it he went on nastily besides if you keep leaving your genetic samples all over town your progeny could end up being featured in next years art show as bushes ivan shuddered you dont think they wouldthats not whyuh could they sure why when youre gone they could recreate the operative body parts that interest them to perform on command to any scalequite the souvenir and you thought that kitten tree was obscene theres more to it than that coz ivan stated with injured dignity his voice faded in doubt you dont think theyd really do something like that do you theres no more ruthless passion than that of a cetagandan artist in search of new media he added firmly were going to a garden party im sure its my contact with rian garden party conceded ivan with a sigh he stared off blankly into space after a minute he commented offhandedly yknow its too bad she cant just get the gene bank back from his ship then hed have the key but no lock thatd fox him up but good i bet miles sat down in ivans desk chair slowly when hed got his breath back he whispered ivanthats brilliant why didnt i think of that before ivan considered this cause its not a scenario that lets you play the lone hero in front of the haut rian they exchanged saturnine looks for once miless gaze shifted first i meant that as a rhetorical question he said tightly but he didnt say it very loudly chapter twelve garden party was a misnomer miles decided he stared past ambassador vorobyev and ivan as the three of them exited from an earpopping ride up the lift tube and into the apparently open air of the rooftop a faint golden sparkle in the air above marked the presence of a lightweight forcescreen blocking unwanted wind rain or dust dusk here in the center of the capital was a silver sheen in the atmosphere for the halfkilometer high building overlooked the green rings of parkway surrounding the celestial garden itself curving banks of flowers and dwarf trees fountains rivulets walkways and arched jade bridges turned the roof into a descending labyrinth in the finest cetagandan style every turn of the walkways revealed and framed a different view of the city stretching to the horizon though the best views were the ones that looked to the emperors shimmering great phoenix egg in the citys heart the lifttube foyer opening onto it all was roofed with arching vines and paved in an elaborate inlay of colored stones lapis lazuli malachite green and white jade rose quartz and other minerals miles couldnt even name looking around it gradually dawned on miles why the protocol officer had them all wearing their house blacks when miles would have guessed undress greens to be adequate it was not possible to be overdressed here ambassador vorobyev was admitted on sufferance as their escort but even vorreedi had to wait in the garage below tonight ivan looking around too clutched their invitation a little tighter their putative hostess lady dhar stood on the edge of the foyer apparently being inside her home counted the same as being inside a bubble for she was welcoming her guests even at her advanced age her hautbeauty stunned the eye she wore robes in a dozen fine layers of blinding white sweeping down and swirling around her feet thick silver hair flowed to the floor her husband ghemadmiral har whose bulky presence would normally have dominated any room seemed to fade into the background beside her ghemadmiral har commanded half the cetagandan fleet and his dutydelayed arrival for the final ceremonies of the empresss funeral was the reason for tonights welcomehome party he wore his imperial bloodred dress uniform which he could have hung with enough medals to sink him should he chance to fall in a river hed chosen instead to oneup the competition with the neckribbon and medallion of the deceptively simplesounding order of merit clearing away the other clutter made this honor impossible for the viewer to miss or match it was given rarely at the sole discretion of the emperor himself there were few higher awards to be had in the cetagandan empire the hautlady by his side was one of them though lord har would have pinned her to his tunic too if he could miles felt for all he had won her some forty years past the har ghemclans face paint featured mainly orange and green the patterns lacked definition crossing with the mans deeply agelined features and clashing horribly with the red of the uniform even ambassador vorobyev was awed by ghemadmiral har miles judged by the extreme formality of his greetings har was polite but clearly puzzled why are these outlanders in my garden but he deferred to lady dhar who relieved ivan of his nervously proffered invitation with a small cool nod and directed them in a voice agesoftened to a honeyed alto to where the food and drinks were displayed they strolled on after he recovered from the shock of lady dhar ivans head swiveled looking for the young ghemwomen he knew without success this place is walltowall old crusts he whispered to miles in dismay when we walked in the average age here dropped from ninety to eightynine eightynine and a half id say miles whispered back ambassador vorobyev put a finger to his lips suppressing the commentary but his eyes glinted in amused agreement quite this was the real thing yenaro and his crowd were shabby little outsiders indeed by comparison excluded by age by rank by wealth by everything scattered through the garden were halfadozen hautlady bubbles glowing like pale lanterns something miles had not yet seen outside the celestial garden itself lady dhar kept social contact with her hautrelatives or former relatives it appeared rian here miles prayed so i wish i could have got maz in vorobyev sighed with regret how did you do this lord ivan not me denied ivan he flipped a thumb at miles vorobyevs brows rose inquiringly miles shrugged they told me to study the powerhierarchy this is it isnt it actually he was not so sure anymore where did power lie in this convoluted society with the ghemlords he would have said once without hesitation who controlled the weapons the ultimate threat of violence or with the hautlords who controlled the ghem through whatever oblique means certainly not with the secluded hautwomen was their knowledge a kind of power then a very fragile sort of power wasnt fragile power an oxymoron the star creche existed because the emperor protected it the emperor existed because the ghemlords served him yet the hautwomen had created the emperor created the haut itself created the ghem for that matter power to create power to destroy he blinked dizzy and munched on a canape in the shape of a tiny swan biting off its head first the feathers were made with rice flour judging from the taste the center a spicy protein paste vatgrown swan meat the barrayaran party collected drinks and began a slow circuit of the rooftop gardens walks comparing views they also collected stares from the elderly ghem and haut scattered about but none came up to introduce themselves or ask questions or attempt to start a conversation vorobyev himself was only scouting so far miles thought but the man would surely pursue the evenings opportunities for contactmaking soon how miles was to divest himself of the ambassador when his own contact turned up he was not sure assuming this was where his contact was to meet him and it wasnt all just his hyperactive imagination or or the next assassination attempt theyd rounded some greenery to see a woman in hautwhite but with no hautbubble standing alone and staring out over the city miles recognized her from the heavy chocolatedark braid falling down her back to her ankles even at this threequartersturned view the haut vio dchilian was ghemgeneral chilian here was kety himself ivans breath drew in right except for their elderly hostess this was the first time ivan had seen a hautwoman outside her bubble and ivan lacked the inoculation of the haut rian miles found he could view the haut vio this time with scarcely a tremor were the hautwomen a disease that you could only catch once like the legendary smallpox and if you survived it you were immune thereafter however scarred who is she whispered ivan enchanted ghemgeneral chilians hautwife vorobyev murmured into his ear the ghemgeneral could order your liver fried for breakfast i would send it to him the free ghemladies can entertain themselves as they please with you but the married haut are strictly offlimits understood yes sir said ivan faintly the haut vio was staring as if hypnotized at the great glowing dome of the celestial garden longing for her lost life miles wondered shed spent years exiled in the hinterlands at sigma ceta with her ghem husband what was she feeling now happy homesick some movement or sound from the barrayarans must have broken her reverie for her head turned toward them for a second just a second her astonishing cinnamon eyes seemed coppermetallic with a rage so boundless miless stomach lurched then her expression snapped into a smooth hauteur as blank as the bubble she lacked and as armored the open emotion was gone so fast miles was not sure the other two men had even seen it but the look was not for them it had been on her face even as shed turned before she could have identified the barrayarans blackly dressed in the shadows ivan opened his mouth please no miles thought but ivan had to try good evening milady wonderful view eh she hesitated a long momentmiles pictured her fleeingbut then answered in a lowpitched perfectly modulated voice there is nothing like it in the universe ivan encouraged brightened and moved forward let me introduce myself im lord ivan vorpatril of barrayar and uh this is ambassador vorobyev and this is my cousin lord miles vorkosigan son of youknowwho eh miles winced watching ivan babble in sexual panic would normally be entertaining if it wasnt so excruciatingly embarrassing it reminded miles painfully ofhimself did i look like that much of a fool the first time i saw rian he feared the answer was yes yes said the haut vio i know miles had seen people talk to their potted plants with more warmth and expression than the haut vio turned on ivan give it up ivan miles urged silently this woman is married to the first officer of a guy who maybe tried to kill us yesterday remember unless lord x was prince slyke after allor the haut rond or miles ground his teeth but before ivan could dig himself any deeper a man in cetagandan military uniform rounded the corner his face paint crinkling with his frown ghemgeneral chilian miles froze his hand wrapping ivans forearm and biting deep in warning chilians gaze swept the barrayarans his nostrils flaring in suspicion haut vio he addressed his wife come with me please yes my lord she said her lashes sweeping down demurely and she escaped around ivan with a bare nod of farewell chilian brought himself to nod also acknowledging the outlanders existence with an effort miles felt the general glanced once back over his shoulder as he whisked his wife away so what sin had ghemgeneral chilian committed to win her lucky guy sighed ivan in envy im not so sure said miles ambassador vorobyev just smiled grimly they walked on miless brain whirling around this new encounter was it accidental was it the start of a new setup lord x used his human tools like longhandled forks to keep the heat at a distance surely the ghemgeneral and his wife were too close to him too obviously connected unless of course lord x wasnt kety after all a glow ahead brought miless gaze front and center a hautbubble was approaching them along the evergreenbounded walk vorobyev and ivan stood aside to let it pass instead it stopped in front of miles lord vorkosigan the womans voice was melodious even through the filter but it was not rians may i speak privately with you of course said miles before vorobyev could put in an objection where tension shot through him was tonight to be his final assault already upon the new target of governor ilsum ketys ship too premature still too uncertain and for how long not far we will be about an hour not nearly long enough for a trip to orbit this was something else then very well gentlemen will you excuse me vorobyev looked about as unhappy as his habitual control would allow lord vorkosigan his hesitation was actually a good sign vorreedi and he must have had a long and extraordinary talk do you wish a guard no a comm link no you will be careful which was diplomatic for are you sure you know what the hell youre doing boy oh yes sir what do we do if youre not back in an hour said ivan wait he nodded cordially and followed the bubble down the garden path when they turned into a private nook lit by low colored lanterns and screened by flowering bushes the bubble rotated and abruptly blinked out miles found himself facing another haut beauty in white riding in her floatchair like a throne this womans hair was honeyblond intricately woven and tucked up around her shoulders vaguely reminiscent of a gilt chainmail neck guard he would have guessed her age as fortystandard which meant she was probably twice that the haut rian degtiar instructs me to bring you she stated she moved her robes from the left side of the chair uncovering a thickly padded armrest we have not much time her gaze seemed to measure his height or shortness you can um perch here and ride how fascinating if only she were rian but this would test certain theories he had about the mechanical capacities of hautbubbles oh yes uh identification milady he added almost apologetically the last person he suspected of experiencing such a ride had ended up with its throat cut after all she nodded as if expecting this and turned her hand outward displaying the ring of the star creche that was probably about as good as they could do under the circumstances cautiously he approached and eased himself aboard grasping the back of the chair above her head for balance each was careful not to actually touch the other her longfingered hand moved over the control panel embedded in the right armrest and the forcefield snapped on again the pale white light reflected off the flowered bushes bringing out their color and cast a glow before them as they began to move down the path their view was quite clear scarcely impeded by an eggshellthin ghostly sphere of mist that marked the boundary of the forcefield as seen from this side sound too was transmitted with high clarity much better than the deliberately muffled reverse effect he could hear voices and the clink of glassware from a balcony above they passed ambassador vorobyev and ivan again who stared curiously uncertain of course if this was the same bubble theyd seen before miles squelched an absurd impulse to wave at them going by they came not to the lifttube foyer as miles had expected but to the edge of the rooftop garden their silverhaired hostess was standing waiting she nodded at the bubble and coded open the forcescreen letting the bubble pass through onto a small private landing pad the reflected glow off the pavement darkened as the hautwoman blacked out her bubble miles stared upward at the shimmering night sky looking for the lightflyer or aircar instead the bubble moved smoothly to the edge of the building and dropped straight over the side miles clutched the seatback convulsively trying not to scream fling his arms around his hostesspilots neck or throw up all over her white dress they were freefalling and he hated heights was this his intended death his assassin sacrificing herself along with him oh god i thought these things only went a meter in the air he choked out his voice despite his best efforts going high and squeaky if you have enough initial altitude you can maintain a controlled glide she said calmly despite miless horrified first impression they were not actually dropping like a rock they were arcing outward across the boulevards far below and the lightsparked green rings of parks toward the dome of the celestial garden miles thought wildly of the witch baba yaga from the barrayaran folk tales who flew in a magic mortar this witch didnt qualify as old and ugly but he was not at this moment totally convinced she didnt eat bad children in a few minutes the bubble decelerated again to a smooth walking pace a few centimeters above the pavement outside one of the celestial gardens minor entrances a movement of her finger brought back the white glow ah she said in a refreshed tone i havent done that in years she almost cracked a smile for a moment nearly human miles was shocked when they passed through the celestial domes security procedures almost as if they werent there except for a swift exchange of electronic codes no one stopped or searched the bubble the sort of uniformed men whod shaken down the galactic envoys with beadyeyed thoroughness stood back respectfully with downcast gaze why dont they stop us miles whispered unable to overcome the psychological conviction that if he could see and hear them they could see and hear him stop me repeated the hautwoman in puzzlement i am the haut pel navarr consort of eta ceta i live here their further progress was happily groundhugging if faster than the usual walkingpace through the increasingly familiar precincts of the celestial garden to the low white building with the biofilters on every window the haut pels passage through its automated security procedures was almost as swift and perfunctory as through the dome entrance itself they passed silently down a set of corridors but turned in a different direction from the labs and offices at the buildings heart and went up one level double doors parted to admit them to a large circular room done in subdued and subduing tones of silvery gray unlike any other place hed seen in the celestial garden it was devoid of living decorations neither plant nor animal nor any of those disturbing creations inbetween hushed concentrated undistracting it was a chamber in the star creche he supposed he could dub it the star chamber eight women in white awaited them sitting silently in a circle his stomach should not still be turning over dammit the free fall was done the haut pel brought her floatchair to a halt in a waiting empty gap in the circle grounded it and switched off the forcebubble eight extraordinary pairs of eyes focused on miles no one he thought should be exposed to this many hautwomen at once it was some kind of dangerous overdose their beauty was varied three were as silverhaired as the ghemadmirals wife one was coppertressed one was darkskinned and hawknosed with masses of blueblack ringlets tumbling down around her like a cloak two were blonde his guide with her golden weave and another with hair as pale as oat straw in the sun and as straight to the floor one darkeyed woman had chocolatebrown hair like the haut vio but in soft curling clouds instead of bound and then there was rian their massed effect went beyond beauty where to he was not sure but terror came close he slipped off the arm of the float chair and stood away from it grateful for the propping effect of his stiff high boots here is the barrayaran to testify said the haut rian testify he was here as a witness then not as the accused a key witness so to speak he stifled a slightly manic giggle somehow he did not think rian would appreciate the pun he swallowed and got his voice unlocked you have the advantage of me ladies though he could make a good guess who they all were at this point his gaze swept the circle and he blinked hard against the vertigo i have only met your handmaiden he nodded toward rian on a low table before her the empresss entire formal regalia was laid out including the seal and the false great key rian tilted her head in acknowledgment of the reasonableness of his request and proceeded to go around the circle with a bewildering slug of haut names and titlesyes here indeed sat the consorts of the eight satrap planets with rian the ninth sitting in for the late empress the creative controllers of the hautgenome of the wouldbe master race were all met here in some extraordinary council the chamber was clearly set up for just this purpose such meetings must also occur when the consorts journeyed home to escort the childships miles particularly focused on the consorts of prince slyke ilsum kety and the rond ketys woman the consort of sigma ceta was one of the silverhaired ones closer to being contemporary with the late empress than anyone else in the room rian introduced her as the haut nadina the oatstraw blonde served prince slyke of xi ceta and the browncurled woman was the consort of rho ceta miles wondered anew at the significance of their titles which named them all consorts of their planets not of the men lord vorkosigan said the haut rian i would like you to repeat for the consorts how you say you came into possession of the false great key and all the subsequent events miles did not blame her in the least for switching strategies from playing all cards close to her chest to calling in reinforcements it was not before time in his opinion but he disliked being taken by surprise it would have been nice if shed at least consulted him first yeah how i take it you understood my message to abort the infiltration of prince slykes ship he countered yes i expect you will explain why in due order excuse me milady i do not mean to insult anyone here but if one of the consorts is a traitoress in collusion with her satrap governor this will pipeline everything we know straight to him how do you know you are entirely among friends there was enough tension in the room to go with any number of treasons certainly rian raised a hand as if to stem it he is an outlander he cannot understand she gave him a slow nod there is treason we believe yes but not on this level further down oh we have concluded that even with the bank and key in his hands the satrap governor could not run the hautgenome by himself the haut of his satrap would not cooperate with such a sudden usurpation the overturning of all custom he must plan to appoint a new consort one under his own control we think she has already been selected ah do you know who not yet rian sighed not yet she is someone i fear who does not wholly understand the goal of haut it is all of a piece if we knew which governor we could guess which hautwoman he has suborned if we knew which woman well dammit this triangulation had to break soon miles chewed on his lower lip then said slowly milady tell meif you cansomething about how your forcebubbles are keyed to their individual operators and why everyone is so damned convinced theyre deadsecure the keypad on those control panels looks like a palmlock but it cant just be a palmlock you can get around palmlocks i cannot give you the technical details lord vorkosigan said rian i dont expect you to just the general logic of it well they are keyed genetically of course one brushes ones hand across the pad leaving a few skin cells these are sucked in and scanned does it scan your entire genome surely that would take a lot of time no of course not it runs through a tree of a dozen or so critical markers that individually identify a hautwoman starting with the presence of an x chromosome pair and going down a branching list until confirmation is achieved how much chance is there of duplicating the markers in two or more individuals we do not clone ourselves lord vorkosigan i mean just of the dozen factors just enough to fool the machine vanishingly small even among closely related members of ones own constellation she hesitated exchanging a glance with lady pel who raised her brows thoughtfully theres a reason i ask miles went on when ghemcolonel benin interviewed me he let slip that six hautbubbles had entered the funeral rotunda during the time period the ba luras body must have been placed at the foot of the bier and that it presented him with a major puzzle he didnt tell me which six but i bet you could get him to disgorge the list its a bruteforce triage of a major data dump butsuppose you ran the markers of those six through your records and checked for accidental duplicates among living hautwomen if the woman is serving the satrap governor she might have served him in that murder too you might finger your traitoress without ever having to leave the star creche rian momentarily alert sat back with a weary sigh your reasoning is correct lord vorkosigan we could do thatif we had the great key oh said miles yeah that he reverted from an eager paraderest to a deflated atease for what its worth my strategic analysis and what little physical evidence ive wrung from ghemcolonel benin so far suggests either prince slyke or the haut ilsum kety with the haut rond a distant third but as rho ceta and mu ceta would bear the brunt of it if open conflict with barrayar was actually engineered my own choice has settled pretty firmly between slyke and kety recent events point to kety he glanced again around the circle is there anything any of the consorts have seen or heard or overheard that would help pin him more certainly a murmur of negatives unfortunately no said rian we have discussed that problem already this evening please begin on your head be it milady miles took a deep breath and launched into the full true account minus most of his opinions of his experiences on eta ceta from the moment the ba lura lurched into their personnel pod he paused occasionally to give rian a chance to hint him away from anything she wanted to conceal she appeared to want to conceal nothing instead drawing him on with skillful questions and prompts to disgorge every detail rian had seen he slowly realized that the secrecy problem cut two ways lord x could assassinate miles maybe rian as well but even the most megalomanic cetagandan politician must find it excessively challenging to try to get away with disposing of all eight satrap consorts his voice strengthened he felt his underlying assumptions slowly wringing insideout rian seemed less and less like a damsel in distress all the time in fact he was beginning to wonder if he was trying to rescue the dragon well dragons need to be rescued too sometimes nobody even blinked at his description of his nearassassination the day before if anything there was a subliminal murmur of appreciation for its elegance of form and style and of faintly sympathetic disappointment at its foiling the judges had no appreciation for the governors originality in attempting to muscle in on their own territory though the sigma and xi cetan consorts looked increasingly stony exchanging a raisedbrow glance or a nod of understanding now and then there was a long silence when hed finished time to present plan b i have a suggestion miles said boldly recall all the duplicate gene banks from the satrap governors ships if they are all returned you will have stripped him of his ability to carry out his larger plans if he resists releasing it you will have smoked him out bring them back said the haut pel in dismay do you have any idea how much trouble we had getting them up there but he might take both bank and key and flee objected the browncurled consort of rho ceta no said miles thats the one thing he cant do there are too many imperially guarded wormhole jumps between him and home speaking militarily open flight is impossible hed never make it he cannot reveal a thing about any of this till hes safely in orbit around something ceta in a weird way we have him cornered till the funeral is over which will be all too soon now that still leaves the problem of retrieving the real key said rian once you have the bank back you may be able to negotiate the keys return in exchange for say amnesty or you can claim he stole itperfectly trueand set your own security to get it back for you once the other governors are freed of the incriminating evidence theyre holding you may be able to cut him out of the herd so to speak with their goodwill in any case it will open up a lot of tactical options he may threaten to destroy it worried the consort of sigma ceta you must know ilsum kety better than anyone else here haut nadina said miles would he he is an erratic young man she said reluctantly i am not yet convinced that he is guilty but i know nothing about him that makes your accusations impossible and your governor maam miles nodded to the consort of xi ceta prince slyke is a determined and brilliant man the plot you describe is not beyond his capacities im not sure well you can recreate the great key eventually cant you push or shove the empresss great plan would be canned for a generation a very desirable outcome from barrayars point of view miles smiled agreeably a faint groan went around the room recovering the great key undamaged is the highest priority rian said firmly he still wants to frame barrayar said miles it may have started as coldblooded astropolitical calculation but im pretty sure its a personal motivation by now if i recall the banks said rian slowly we will entirely lose this opportunity to distribute them the consort of sigma ceta the silverhaired nadina sighed i had hoped to live to see the celestial ladys vision of new growth carried out she was right you know i have seen the stagnation increasing in my lifetime other opportunities will come said another silverhaired lady it must be done more carefully next time said the browncurled consort of rho ceta our lady trusted the governors too much im not so sure she did said rian i was only attempting to go as far as distributing inactive copies for backup the ba lura felt our mistresss desires keenly but did not understand her subtlety it wasnt my idea to attempt to distribute the key now and im not convinced it was hers either i dont know if the ba had a separate understanding with her or just a separate misunderstanding and now i never will she bowed her head i apologize to the council for my failure her tone of voice made miles think of inwardturning knives you did your best dear said the haut nadina kindly but she added more sternly however you should not have attempted to handle it all alone it was my charge a little less emphasis on the my and a little more emphasis on the charge next time miles tried not to squirm at the general applicability of this gentle correction a glum silence reigned for a time we may need to consider altering the genome to make the hautlords more controllable said the rho cetan consort for renewed expansion we need the opposite objected the dark consort more aggression the ghemexperiment filtering favorable genetic combinations upward from the general population surely suffices for that said the haut pel our lady in her wisdom aimed at less uniformity not more conceded rian i believe we have long made a mistake in leaving the hautmales so entirely to their own devices said the rho cetan consort stubbornly said the dark one but how else should we select among them if there is no free competition to sort them out rian held up a restraining hand the time for this larger debate must be soon but not now i myself have been convinced by these events that further refinement must come before further expansion but that she sighed is a new empresss task now we must decide what state of affairs she will inherit how many favor the recall of the gene banks the ayes had it several were slow in coming but in some occult way a unanimous vote was achieved through nothing more than an exchange of unreadable glances miles breathed relief rians shoulders slumped wearily then i so order you all return them to the star creche as what asked the haut pel in a practical tone rian stared into the air a moment and replied as collections of human genomic materials from your various satrapies requested by the lady before her death and received by us in trust for the star creches experimental files that will do nicely on this end nodded the haut pel and on the other end tell your governors we discovered a serious error in the copy which must be corrected before the genome can be released to them very good the meeting broke up the women activating their floatchairs though not yet their private bubbles and leaving in twos and threes in a murmur of intense discussion rian and the haut pel waited until the room emptied and miles perforce waited with them do you still want me to try and retrieve the key for you miles asked rian barrayar remains vulnerable until we nail the satrap governor with solid proof data a clever man cant diddle and i especially dont like the toehold he seems to have in your own security i dont know said rian the return of the gene banks cannot take less than a day ill send someone for you as we did tonight well be down to two days left then not much margin id rather go sooner than later it cannot be helped she touched her hair a nervous gesture despite its grace watching her he searched his heart the impact of his first mad crush was surely fading in this drought of response to be replaced by what if she had slaked his thirst with the least little drop of affection he would be hers body and soul right now in a way he was glad she wasnt faking anything depressing as it was to be treated like a ba servitor his loyalty and obedience assumed maybe his proposed disguise as a ba had been suggested by his subconscious for more than practical reasons was his backbrain trying to tell him something the haut pel will return you to your point of origin rian said he bowed in my experience milady we can never get back to exactly where we started no matter how hard we try she returned nothing to this but an odd look as he rode out again on the haut pels floatchair pel carried him through the celestial garden as before in reverse he wondered if she was as uncomfortable with their compressed proximity as he was he made a stab at light conversation did the hautladies make all this plant and animal life in the garden competing like the ghem bioesthetics fair i was particularly impressed by the singing frogs i must say oh no said the haut pel the lower lifeforms are all ghem work thats their highest reward to have their art incorporated into the imperial garden the haut only work in human material he didnt recall seeing any monsters around where we mostly fieldtest ideas in the ba servitors it prevents the accidental release of any genomic materials through sexual routes oh our highest honor is for a favorable gene complex we have developed to be taken up into the hautgenome itself it was like some golden rule in reversenever do unto yourself what you have not first tried on another miles smiled rather nervously and did not pursue the subject further a groundcar driven by a ba servitor waited for the haut pels bubble at the side entrance to the celestial garden and they were returned to lady dhars penthouse by more normal routes pel let him out of her bubble in another private nook in an unobserved moment and drifted away again he pictured her reporting back to rianyes milady i released the barrayaran back into the wild as you ordered i hope he will be able to find food and a mate out there he sat on a bench overlooking the celestial garden and meditated upon that view until ivan and ambassador vorobyev found him they looked respectively scared and angry youre late said ivan where the hell did you go i almost called out colonel vorreedi and the guards added ambassador vorobyev sternly that would have been futile sighed miles we can go now thank god muttered ivan vorobyev said nothing miles rose wondering how soon the ambassador and vorreedi were going to stop taking not yet for an answer not yet please not yet chapter thirteen there was nothing he would have liked more than a day off miles reflected but not today the worst was the knowledge that hed done this to himself until the consorts completed their retrieval of the gene banks all he could do was wait and unless rian sent a car to the embassy to pick him up a move so overt as to be vigorously resisted by both sets of imperial security it was impossible for miles to make contact with her again until the gatesong ceremonies tomorrow morning at the celestial garden he grumbled under his breath and called up more data on his suites comconsole then stared at it unseeing he wasnt sure it was wise to give lord x an extra day either for all that this afternoon would contain a nasty shock for him when his consort came to take away his gene bank that would eliminate his last chance of sitting tight and gliding away with bank and key perhaps dumping his old centrally appointed and controlled consort out an airlock en route the man must realize now that rian would turn him in even if it meant incriminating herself before letting him get away assassinating the handmaiden of the star creche hadnt been part of the original plan miles was fairly sure rian had been intended to be a blind puppet accusing miles and barrayar of stealing her key lord x had a weakness for blind puppets but rian was loyal to the haut beyond her own selfinterest no rightminded plotter could assume she would stay paralyzed for long lord x was a tyrant not a revolutionary he wanted to take over the system not change it the late empress was the real revolutionary with her attempt to divide the haut into eight competing sibling branches and may the best superman win the ba lura might have been closer to its mistresss mind than rian allowed you cant give power away and keep it simultaneously except posthumously so what would lord x do now what could he do now but fight to the last trying anything he could think of to avoid being brought down for this it was that or slit his wrists and miles didnt think he was the wristslitting type he would still be searching for some way to pin it all on barrayar preferably in the form of a dead miles who couldnt give him the lie there was even still a faint chance he could bring that off given the cetagandan lack of enthusiasm for outlanders in general and barrayarans in particular yes this was a good day to stay indoors so would the results have been any better if miles had publicly turned over the decoy key and the truth on the very first day no then the embassy and its envoys would be mired right now in false accusations and public scandal and no way to prove their innocence if lord x had picked any other delegation but barrayars upon which to plant his false keysay the marilacans the aslunders or the vervanihis plan might yet be running along like clockwork miles hoped sourly that lord x was very very sorry that hed targeted barrayar and im going to make you even sorrier you sod miless lips thinned as he turned his attention back to his comconsole the satrap governors ships were all to the same general plan and a general plan alas was all the barrayaran embassy data bank had available without tapping in to the secret files miles shuffled the holovid display though the various levels and sections of the ship if i were a satrap governor planning revolt where would i hide the great key under ray pillow probably not the governor had the key but not the keys key so to speak rian still possessed that ring if lord x could open the great key he could do a data dump possess himself of a duplicate of the informationcontents and maybe in a pinch return the original divesting himself of material evidence of his treasonous plans or even destroy it hah but if the key were easy to get open he should have done this already when his plans first began to go seriously wrong so if he was still trying to access the key it ought to be located in some sort of cipher lab so where on this vast ship was a suitable cipher lab the chime of his door interrupted miless harried perusal colonel vorreedis voice inquired lord vorkosigan may i come in miles sighed enter hed been afraid all this comconsole activity would attract vorreedis attention the protocol officer had to be monitoring from downstairs vorreedi trod in and studied the holovid display over miless shoulder interesting what is it just brushing up on cetagandan warship specs continuing education officerstyle and all that the hope for promotion to ship duty never dies hm vorreedi straightened i thought you might like to hear the latest on your lord yenaro i dont think i own him butnothing fatal i hope said miles sincerely yenaro might be an important witness later upon mature reflection miles was beginning to regret not offering him asylum at the embassy not yet but an order has been issued for his arrest by cetagandan security for treason no by the civil police for theft its a false charge id lay odds somebodys trying to use the system to smoke him out of hiding can you find out who laid the charge a ghemlord by the name of nevic does that mean anything to you no hes got to be a puppet the man who put nevic up to it is the man we want the same man who supplied yenaro with the plans and money for his funfountain but now you have two strings to pull you imagine it to be the same man imagination said miles has nothing to do with it but i need proof standupincourt type proof vorreedis gaze was uncomfortably level why did you guess the charge against yenaro would be treason oh well i wasnt thinking theft is much better less flashy if what his enemy wants is for the civil police to drag yenaro out into the open where he can get a clear shot at him vorreedis brows crimped lord vorkosigan but he appeared to think better of whatever hed been about to say he just shook his head and departed ivan wandered in later flung himself onto miless sofa put up his booted feet on the armrest and sighed you still here miles shut down his comconsole which was by now making him crosseyed i thought youd be out making hay or rolling in it or whatever our last two days here and all or did you run out of invitations miles jerked his thumb ceilingward we may be bugged ivans lip curled screw it vorreedi has laid on more bodyguards it kind of takes the spontaneity out of things he stared into the air besides i worry about where i put my feet now wasnt it some queen of egypt who was delivered in a rolledup carpet could happen again could indeed miles had to agree almost certainly will in fact great remind me not to stand next to you miles grimaced after a minute or two ivan added im bored miles chased him from his room the ceremony of singing open the great gates did not entail the opening of any gates though it did involve singing a massed chorus of several hundred ghem both male and female robed in whiteonwhite arranged themselves near the eastern entrance inside the celestial garden they planned to pass in procession around the four cardinal directions and eventually later in the afternoon finish at the north gate the chorus stood to sing along an undulating area of ground with surprising acoustic properties and the galactic envoys and ghem and haut mourners stood to listen miles flexed his legs inside his boots and prepared to endure the open venue left lots of space for hautlady bubbles and they were out in forcesome hundreds scattered about the glade how many hautwomen did live here miles glanced around his little delegationhimself ivan vorobyev and vorreedi all in house blacks mia maz dressed as before striking in black and white vorreedi looked more barrayaran more officerlike and miles had to admit a lot more sinister out of his deliberately dull cetagandan civvies maz rested one hand on vorobyevs arm and stood on tiptoe as the music started breathtaking miles realized could be a quite literal termhis lips parted and the hairs on the backs of his arms stood on end as the incredible sounds washed over him harmonies and dissonances followed one another up and down the scale with such precision the listener could make out every word when the voices were not simply wordless vibrations that seemed to crawl right up the spine and ring in the backbrain in a succession of pure emotions even ivan stood transfixed miles wanted to comment to express his astonishment but breaking into the absolute concentration the music demanded seemed some sort of sacrilege after about a thirtyminute performance the music came to a temporary close and the chorus prepared to move gracefully off to its next station followed more clumsily by the delegates the two groups took different routes ba servitors under the direction of a dignified ghemlord majordomo shepherded the delegates to a buffet to both refresh and delay them while the chorus set up for its next performance at the southern gate miles stared anxiously after the hautlady bubbles which naturally did not accompany the outlander envoys but floated off in their own mob in yet a third direction he was getting less distracted by the diversions of the celestial garden could one finally grow to take it entirely for granted the haut certainly seemed to i think im getting used to this place he confided to ivan as he walked along between him and vorobyev in the ragged parade of outlander guests or i could mm said ambassador vorobyev but when these pretty folks turned their pet ghemlords loose to pick up some cheap new real estate out past komarr five million of us died i hope that hasnt slipped your mind my lord no said miles tightly not ever but even you are not old enough to remember the war personally sir im really starting to wonder if well ever see an effort like that from the cetagandan empire again optimist murmured ivan let me qualify that my mother always says behavior that is rewarded is repeated and the reverse i think that if the ghemlords fail to score any new territorial successes in our generation its going to be a long time till we see them try again an expansionist period followed by an isolationist one isnt a new historical phenomenon after all didnt know youd taken up political science said ivan can you prove your point asked vorobyev in less than a generation miles shrugged dont know its one of those subliminal gutfeel things if you gave me a year and a department i could probably produce a reasoned analysis with graphs i admit said ivan its hard to imagine say lord yenaro conquering anybody its not that he couldnt its just that by the time he ever got a chance hed be too old to care i dont know after the next isolationist period though all bets are off when the haut are done with ten more generations of tinkering with themselves i dont know what theyll be and neither do they that was an odd realization you mean no one is in charge here universal conquest may seem like a crude dull game from their childhood after that or else he added glumly theyll be unstoppable jolly thought grumbled ivan a delicate breakfast offering was set up in a nearby pavilion on the other side of it the floatcars with the white silk upholstery waited to convey refreshed funeral envoys the couple of kilometers across the celestial garden to the south gate miles nabbed a hot drink refused with concealed loathing the offer of a pastry trayhis stomach was knotting with nervous anticipationand watched the movements of the ba servitors with hawklike attention it has to break today theres no more time come on rian and how the devil was he to take rians next report when he had vorreedi glued to his hip the man was noting his every eyeflicker miles swore the day wore on with a repeat of the cycle of music and food and transportation a number of the delegates were looking glassily overloaded with it all even ivan had stopped eating in selfdefense at about stop three when the contact did come at the buffet after the fourth and last choral performance miles almost missed it he was making idle chitchat with vorreedi reminiscing about keroslav district baking styles and wondering how he was going to distract and ditch the man miles had reached the point of desperation of fantasizing slipping ambassador vorobyev an emetic and siccing so to speak the protocol officer on his superior while miles ducked out when he saw out of the corner of his eye ivan talking with a grave ba servitor he did not recognize this ba it was not rians favorite little creature for it was young and had a brush of blond hair ivans hands turned palmout and he shrugged then he followed the servitor from the pavilion looking puzzled ivan what the hell does she want ivan for excuse me sir miles cut across vorreedis words and around his side by the time vorreedi had turned after him miles had darted past another delegation and was halfway to the exit after ivan vorreedi would follow but miles would just have to deal with that later miles emerged blinking into the artificial afternoon light of the dome just in time to see the dark shadow and bootgleam of ivans uniform disappear around some flowering shrubbery beyond an open space featuring a fountain he trotted after his own boots scuffing unevenly on the colored stone walks threading the greenery lord vorkosigan vorreedi called after him miles didnt turn around but raised his hand in an acknowledging but still rapidly receding wave vorreedi was too polite to curse out loud but miles could fill in the blanks the manhigh shrubbery broken up by artistic groupings of trees wasnt quite a maze but nearly so miless first choice of directions opened onto some sort of unpeopled water meadow with the stream generated from the nearby fountain running like silver embroidery through its center he ran back along his route cursing his legs and his limp and swung around the other end of the bushes in the center of a treeshaded circle lined with benches a hautchair floated with its high back to miles its screen down the blond servitor was gone already ivan leaned in toward the floatchairs occupant his lips parted in fascination his brows drawn down in suspicion a whiterobed arm lifted a faint cloud of iridescent mist puffed into ivans surprised face ivans eyes rolled back and he collapsed forward across the seated occupants knees the forcescreen snapped up white and blank miles yelled and ran toward it the hautladies floatchairs were hardly race cars but they could move faster than miles could run in two turns through the shrubbery it was out of sight when miles cleared the last stand of flowers he found himself facing one of the major carvedwhitejadepaved walkways that curved through the celestial garden floating along it in both directions were half a dozen hautbubbles all now moving at the same dignified walking pace miles had no breath left to swear but black thoughts boiled off his brain he spun on his heel and ran straight into colonel vorreedi vorreedis hand descended on his shoulder and took a good solid grip on the uniform cloth vorkosigan what the hell is going on and where is vorpatril im just about to go check on that right now sir if youll permit me cetagandan security had better know ill light up their lives if theyve i dont think security can help us on this one sir i think i need to talk to a ba servitor immediately vorreedi frowned trying to process this it obviously did not compute miles couldnt blame him until a week ago he too had shared the universal assumption that cetagandan imperial security was in charge here and so they are in some ways but not all ways speak of the devil as miles and vorreedi turned to retrace their steps to the pavilion a reduniformed zebrafaced guard appeared striding rapidly toward them sheepdog miles judged sent to round up straying galactic envoys fast but not fast enough my lords the guard a lowranker nodded very politely the pavilion is this way if you please the floatcars will take you to the south gate vorreedi appeared to come to a quick decision thank you but we seem to have mislaid a member of our party would you please find lord vorpatril for me certainly the guard touched a wrist com and reported the request in neutral tones while still firmly herding miles and vorreedi pavilionward taking ivan for now as merely a lost guest that had to happen fairly often since the garden was designed to entice the viewer on into its delights i give cetagandan security maybe ten minutes to figure out hes really disappeared in the middle of the celestial garden then it all starts coming apart the guard split off as they climbed the steps to the pavilion back inside miles approached the oldest bald servitor he saw excuse me ba he said respectfully the ba glanced up nonplussed at not being invisible i must communicate immediately with the haut rian degtiar its an emergency he opened his hands and stood back the ba appeared to digest this for a moment then gave a half bow and motioned miles to follow vorreedi came too around a corner in the semiprivacy of a service area the ba pulled back its gray and white uniform sleeve and spoke into its wristcomm a quick gabble of words and code phrases its nonexistent eyebrows rose in surprise at the return message it took off its wristcomm handed it to miles with a low bow and retreated out of earshot miles wished vorreedi looming over his shoulder would do the same but he didnt lord vorkosigan came rians voice from the communfiltered she must be speaking from inside her bubble milady did you just send one of your people to pick up my cousin ivan there was a short pause no i witnessed this oh another much longer pause when her voice came back again it had gone low and dangerous i know what is happening im glad somebody does i will send my servitor for you and ivan we will handle that the comm cut abruptly miles almost shook it in frustration but handed it back to the servitor instead who took it bowed again and scooted away just what did you witness lord vorkosigan vorreedi demanded ivan left with a lady what again here now does the boy have no sense of time or place this isnt emperor gregors birthday party dammit i believe i can retrieve him very discreetly sir if you will allow me miles felt a faint twinge of guilt for slandering ivan by implication but the twinge was lost in his general hearthammering fear had that aerosol been a knockout drug or a lethal poison vorreedi took a long long minute to think this one over his eye cold on miles vorreedi miles reminded himself was intelligence not counterintelligence curiosity not paranoia was his driving force miles shoved his hands into his trouser pockets and tried to look calm unworried merely annoyed as the silence lengthened he dared to add if you trust nothing else sir please trust my competence thats all i ask discreet eh said vorreedi youve made some interesting friends here lord vorkosigan id like to hear a lot more about them soon i hope sir mm very well but be prompt ill do my best sir miles lied it had to be today once away from his guardian he wasnt coming back till the job was done or we are all undone he gave a semisalute and slipped away before vorreedi could think better of it he went to the open side of the pavilion and stepped down into the artificial sunlight just as a floatcar arrived that was not funerally decorated a simple twopassenger cart with room for cargo behind a familiar aged little bald ba was at the controls the ba spotted miles and swung closer and brought its vehicle to a halt they were intercepted by a quickmoving redclad guard sir galactic guests may not wander the celestial garden unaccompanied miles opened his palm at the ba servitor my lady requests and requires this mans attendance i must take him said the ba the guard looked unhappy but gave a short reluctant nod my superior will speak to yours im sure the bas lips twitched in what miles swore was a smirk the guard grimaced and stepped away his hand reaching for his comm link go go thought miles as he climbed aboard but they were already moving this time the floatcar took a shortcut rising up over the garden and heading southwest in a straight line they actually moved fast enough for the breeze to ruffle miless hair in a few minutes they descended toward the star creche gleaming pale through the trees a strange procession of white bubbles was bobbing toward what was obviously a delivery entrance at the back of the building five bubbles one on each side and one above were herding a sixth bumping it along toward the high wide door and into whatever loading bay lay beyond the bubbles buzzed like angry wasps whenever their forcefields touched the ba brought its little floatcar calmly down into the tail of this parade and followed the bubbles inside the door slid closed behind them and sealed with that solid clunk and cacophony of chirps that bespoke high security except for being lined with colored polished stone in geometric inlays instead of gray concrete the loading bay was utilitarian and normal in design it was presently empty except for the haut rian degtiar standing in full flowing white robes beside her own floatchair waiting her pale face was tense the five herding bubbles settled to the floor and snapped off revealing five of the consorts miles had met in the council night before last the sixth bubble remained stubbornly up white and solid and impenetrable miles swung out of his cart as it settled to the pavement and limped hurriedly to rians side is ivan in there he demanded pointing at the sixth bubble we think so whats happening sh wait she made a graceful palmdown gesture miles gritted his teeth jittering inside rian stepped forward her chin rising surrender and cooperate said rian clearly to the bubble and mercy is possible defy us and it is not the bubble remained defiantly up and blank standoff the bubble had nowhere to go and could not attack but she has ivan in there very well sighed rian she pulled a penlike object from her sleeve with a screamingbird pattern engraved in red upon its side adjusted some control pointed it at the bubble and pressed the bubble winked out and the floatchair fell to the floor with a reverberant thump all power dead a yelp floated from a cloud of white fabric and brown hair i didnt know anyone could do that whispered miles only the celestial lady has the override said rian she put the control back in her sleeve and stepped forward again and stopped the haut vio dchilian had recovered her balance instantly she now halfknelt one arm under ivans blackuniformed arm supporting his slumping form the other hand holding a thin knife to his throat it looked very sharp as it pressed against his skin ivans eyes were open dilated shifting he was paralyzed not unconscious then and not dead thank god yet the haut vio dchilian unless miles missed his guess would have no inhibitions whatsoever about cutting a helpless mans throat he wished ghemcolonel benin were here to witness this move against me said the haut vio and your barrayaran servitor dies miles supposed the emphasis was intended as a hautish insult he was not quite sure it succeeded miles paced anxiously to rians other side making an arc around the haut vio but venturing no closer the haut vio followed him with venomous eyes now directly behind her the haut pel gave miles a nod her floatchair rose silently into the air and slipped out a doorway to the creche going for help for a weapon pel was the practical one he had to buy time ivan miles said indignantly ivans not the man you want the haut vios brows drew down what but of course lord x always used front men and women for his legwork keeping his own hands clean miles had been galloping around doing the legwork therefore lord x must have reasoned that ivan was really in charge agh miles cried what did you think that because hes taller and and cuter he had to be running this show its the haut way isnt it youyou morons im the brains of this outfit he paced the other way spluttering i had you spotted from day one dont you know but no nobody ever takes me seriously ivans eyes the only part of him that apparently still worked widened at this rant so you went and kidnapped the wrong man you just blew your cover for the sake of grabbing the expendable one the haut pel hadnt gone for help he decided shed gone to the lav to fix her hair and was going to take forever in there well he certainly had the undivided attention of everyone in the loading bay murderess victim hautcops and all what next handsprings its been like this since we were little kids yknow whenever the two of us were together theyd always talk to him first like i was some kind of idiot alien who needed an interpreter the haut pel reappeared silently in the doorway lifted her handmiless voice rose to a shout well im sick of it dyou hear the haut vios head twisted in realization just as the haut pels stunner buzzed vios hand spasmed on the knife as the stunner beam struck her miles pelted forward as a line of red appeared at the blades edge and he grabbed for ivan as she slumped unconscious the stun nimbus had caught ivan too and his eyes rolled back miles let the haut vio hit the floor on her own as hard as gravity took her ivan he lowered gently it was only a surface cut miles breathed again he pulled out his pocket handkerchief and dabbed at the sticky trickle of blood then pressed it against the wound he glanced up at the haut rian and the haut pel who floated over to examine her handiwork she knocked him over with some kind of drugmist stun on top of thatis he in medical danger i think not said pel she dismounted from her floatchair knelt and rummaged through the unconscious haut vios sleeves and came up with an assortment of objects which she laid out in a methodical row on the pavement one was a tiny silvery pointed thing with a bulb on the end the haut pel waved it under her lovely nose sniffing ah this is it no hes in no danger it will wear off harmlessly hell be very sick when he wakes up though maybe you could give him a dose of synergine miles pleaded we have that available good he studied the haut rianonly the celestial lady has the override but rian had used it as one entitled and no one had blinked not even the haut vio have you grasped this yet boy rian is the acting empress of cetaganda until tomorrow and every move shes made has been with full real imperial authority handmaiden ha another one of those impenetrable misleading haut titles that didnt say what it meant you had to be in the know assured of ivans eventual recovery miles scrambled to his feet and demanded whats happening now how did you find ivan did you get all the gene banks back or not what did you the haut rian held up a restraining hand to stem the flood of questions she nodded to the dead bubblechair this is the consort of sigma cetas floatchair but as you see the haut nadina is not with it ilsum kety yes what happened howd he diddle the bubble howd you detect it how long have you known ilsum kety yes we began to know last night when the haut nadina failed to return with her gene bank all the others were back and safe by midnight but kety apparently only knew that his consort would be missed at this mornings ceremonies so he sent the haut vio to impersonate her we suspected at once and watched her why ivan that i do not know yet kety cannot make a consort disappear without great repercussions i suspect he meant to use your cousin to divest himself of guilt somehow another frame yes that would fit his modus operandi you realize the haut vio must have murdered the ba lura at ketys direction yes rians eyes falling on the prostrate form of the brownhaired woman were very cold she too is a traitor to the haut that will make her the business of the star creches own justice miles said uneasily she could be an important witness to clear barrayar and me of blame in the disappearance of the great key dont um do anything premature till we know if thats needed huh oh we have many questions for her first so kety still has his bank and the key and a warning damn whose idiot idea had it been oh yes but you cant blame ivan for this one youthought recalling the gene banks was a great move and rian bought it too idiocy by committee the finest kind and he has his consort whom he knows he cannot let live assuming she still lives now i did not think i would be sending the haut nadina to her death the haut rian stared at the far wall avoiding both miless and pels eyes neither did i miles swallowed sickness he can bury her in the chaos of his revolt once it gets going but he cant start his revolt yet he paused but if in order to arrange her death in some artistic way that incriminates barrayar he needs ivan i dont think shell be dead yet saved held prisoner on his ship yes not dead yet please not dead yet we know one other thing too the haut nadina is successfully concealing information from him or even actively misleading him or he wouldnt have tried what he just tried actually that could also be construed as convincing evidence that the haut nadina was dead miles bit his lip but now ketys made enough overt moves to incriminate himself for charges to stick to him and not to me yes rian hesitated maybe he is clearly very clever miles stared at the inert floatchair sitting slightly canted and looking quite ordinary without its magical electronic nimbus so are we those floatchairs somebody here must securitykey them to their operators in the first place right would i be making too silly a wildass guess if i suggested that person was the celestial lady that is correct lord vorkosigan so you have the override and could encode this to anybody not to anybody only to any hautwoman ilsum kety is expecting the return of this hautbubble after the ceremonies with a hautwoman and a barrayaran prisoner yes he took a deep breath i think we should not disappoint him chapter fourteen i found ivan sir miles smiled into the comconsole the background beyond ambassador vorobyevs head was blurred but the sounds of the buffet winding downsubdued voices the clink of platescarried clearly over the comm hes getting a tour of the star creche well be here a while yetcant insult our hostess and all that but i should be able to extract him and catch up with you before the partys over one of the ba will bring us back vorobyev looked anything but happy at this news well i suppose it will have to do but colonel vorreedi does not care for these spontaneous additions to the planned itinerary regardless of the cultural opportunity and i must say im beginning to agree with him dont ah dont let lord vorpatril do anything inappropriate eh the haut are not the ghem you know yes sir ivans doing just fine never better ivan was still out cold back in the freight bay but the returning color to his face had suggested the synergine was starting to work just how did he obtain this extraordinary privilege anyway asked vorobyev oh well you know ivan couldnt let me score a coup he couldnt match ill explain it all later must go now ill be fascinated to hear it the ambassador murmured dryly miles cut the comm before his smile fractured and fell off his face whew that buys us a little time a very little time we need to move yes agreed his escort the brownhaired rho cetan lady she turned her floatchair and led him out of the sideoffice containing the comconsole he had to trot to keep up they returned to the freight bay just as rian and the haut pel finished recoding the haut nadinas bubblechair miles spared an anxious glance for ivan laid out on the tessellated pavement he seemed to be breathing deeply and normally im ready miles reported to rian my people wont come looking for us for at least an hour if ivan wakes up well you should have no trouble keeping him under control he licked lips gone dry if things go wrong go to ghemcolonel benin or to your emperor himself no imperial security middlemen everything about this especially the ways governor kety has been able to diddle what everyone fondly believed were diddleproof systems is screaming to me that hes suborned a connection high up probably very high up in your own security whos giving him serious aid and comfort being rescued by him could be a fatal experience i suspect i understand said rian gravely and i agree with your analysis the ba lura would not have taken the great key to kety for duplication in the first place if it had not been convinced that he was capable of carrying out the task she straightened from the floatchair arm and nodded to the haut pel the haut pel had filled her sleeves with most of the little items she had taken from the haut vio she nodded back straightened her robes and gracefully settled herself aboard the little items did not alas include energy weapons the power packs of which would set off security scanners not even a stunner miles thought with morbid regret im going into orbital battle wearing dress blacks and riding boots and im totally disarmed wonderful he took his place again at pels left side perched on the cushioned armrest trying not to feel like the ventriloquists dummy that he glumly fancied he resembled the bubbles forcescreen enclosed them and rian stood back and nodded pel her right hand on the control panel spun the bubble and they floated quickly toward the exit which dilated to let them pass two other consorts exited simultaneously and sped off in other directions miles felt a brief pang in his heart that pel and not rian was his companion in arms in his heart but not in his head it was essential not to place rian the most creditable witness of ketys treason in ketys power and he liked pels style she had already demonstrated her ability to think fast and clearly in an emergency he still wasnt sure that drop over the side of the building night before last hadnt been for her amusement rather than for secrecy a hautwoman with a sense of humor almost too bad she was eighty years old and a consort and cetagandan and give it up will you ivan you arent nor ever will be but one way or another governor the haut ilsum ketys treason is not going to last the day they joined ketys party as it was making ready to depart at the south gate of the celestial garden the haut vio would have been sent to collect ivan at the last possible moment to be sure ketys train was large as befit his governors dignity a couple of dozen ghemguards plus ghemladies nonba servitors in his personal livery and rather to miless dismay ghemgeneral chilian was chilian in on his masters treason or was he due to be dumped along with the haut nadina on the way home and replaced with ketys own appointee he had to be one or the other the commander of imperial troops on sigma ceta could hardly be expected to stay neutral in the upcoming coup kety himself gestured the haut vios bubble into his own vehicle for the short ride to the imperial shuttleport the exclusive venue for all such high official arrivals to and departures from the celestial garden ghemgeneral chilian took another car miles and the haut pel found themselves alone with kety in a vanlike space clearly designed for the ladybubbles youre late complications kety inquired cryptically settling back in his seat he looked worried and stern as befit an earnest mourneror a man riding a particularly hungry and unreliable tiger yeah and i should have known he was lord x when i first spotted that fake gray hair miles decided this was one hautlord who didnt want to wait for what life might bring him nothing i couldnt handle reported pel the voicefilter set to maximum blur altered her tones into a fair imitation of the haut vios im sure my love keep your forcescreen up till were aboard yes yep ghemgeneral chilian definitely has an appointment with an unfriendly air lock miles decided poor sucker the haut vio perhaps meant to get back into the hautgenome one way or another so was she ketys mistress or his master or were they a team two brains rather than one behind this plot could account for its speed flexibility and confusion all together the haut pel touched a control and turned to miles when we get aboard we must decide whether to look first for the haut nadina or the great key miles nearly choked er he gestured toward kety sitting less than a meter from his knee he cannot hear us pel reassured him it seemed to be so for kety turned abstracted eyes to the passing view outside the luxurious liftvans polarized canopy the recovery of the key pel went on is of the highest priority mm but the haut nadina if shes still alive is an important witness for barrayars sake and she may have an idea where the key is being kept i think its in a cipher lab but its a damned big ship and theres a lot of places kety may have tucked a cipher lab both it and nadina will be close to his quarters pel said he wont have her in the brig i doubt kety will have wished many of his soldiers or servitors to know that he holds his consort prisoner no she will most likely be secreted in a cabin i wonder where kety figures to stage whatever fatal crime hes planned involving ivan and the haut nadina the consorts move on pretty constricted paths he wont site it on his own ship nor his own residence and he probably doesnt dare repeat the performance inside the celestial garden that would be just too much something downside i fancy and tonight governor kety glanced at their force bubble and inquired is he waking up yet pel touched her lips then her controls not yet i want to question him before i must know how much they know time enough barely pel killed her outgoing sound again the haut nadina first miles voted firmly i think youre right lord vorkosigan sighed pel further dangerous conversation with kety was blocked by the confusion of loading the shuttle to convey the portion of retinue that was going to orbit kety himself was busied on his comm link they did not find themselves alone with the governor again until the whole mob had disgorged into the shuttle hatch corridor aboard ketys state ship and gone about their various duties or pleasures ghemgeneral chilian did not even attempt to speak with his wife pel followed at ketys gesture from the fact that kety had dismissed his guards miles reasoned that they were about to get down to business limiting witnesses limited the murders necessary to silence them later if things went wrong kety led them to a broad tastefully appointed corridor obviously dedicated to upperclass residence suites miles almost tapped the haut pel on the shoulder look down the hall do you see a liveried man stood guard outside one cabin door he braced to attention at the sight of his master but kety turned in to another cabin first the guard relaxed slightly pel craned her neck might it be the haut nadina yes well maybe i dont think hed dare use a regular trooper for the duty not if he doesnt control their command structure yet miles felt a strong pang of regret that he hadnt figured out the schism between kety and his ghemgeneral earlier talk about exploitable opportunities the door slid closed behind them and miless head snapped around to see what they were getting into now the chamber was clean bare of decoration or personal effects an unused cabin then we can put him here said kety nodding to a couch in the sittingroom portion of the chamber can you keep him under control chemically or must we have some guards chemically responded pel but i need a few things synergine fastpenta and wed better check him for induced fastpenta allergies first many important people are given them i understand i dont think you want him to die here clarium pel glanced at miles her eyes widening in question she did not know that one clarium was a fairly standard military interrogation tranquilizermiles nodded that would be a good idea pel hazarded no chance of his waking up before i get back is there asked kety in concern im afraid i dosed him rather strongly hm please be more discreet my love we dont want excessive chemical residues left upon autopsy though with luck there will not be enough left to autopsy im reluctant to count on luck good said kety with a peculiar exasperation youre learning at last ill await you said pel coolly by way of a broad hint as if the haut vio would have done anything else let me help you lay him out kety said it must be crowded in there not for me im using him for a footrest the floatchair is most comfortable let me enjoy the privilege of the haut a little longer my love pel sighed it has been so long ketys lips thinned in amusement soon enough you shall have more privileges than the empress ever had and all the outworlders at your feet you may desire he gave the bubble a short nod and departed striding quickly where would a hautgovernor with an interrogation chemistry shopping list go sickbay security and how long would it take now said miles back up the corridor we have to get rid of the guarddid you bring any of that stuff that the haut vio used on ivan pel pulled the tiny bulb from her sleeve and held it up how many doses are left pel squinted two vio overprepared she sounded faintly disapproving as if vio had lost stylepoints by this redundancy id have taken a hundred just in case all right use it sparinglynot at all if you dont have to pel floated her bubble out of the cabin again and turned up the corridor miles slid around behind the floatchair crouching with his hands gripping the high back and his boots slipping slightly on base which held the power pack hiding behind a womans skirts it was frustrating as hell to have his transportationand everything elseunder the control of a cetagandan even if the rescue mission was his idea but needs must drive pel came to a halt before the liveried guard servitor she addressed him haut he nodded respectfully to the blank white bubble i am on duty and may not assist you this will not take long pel flicked off her forcescreen miles heard a faint hiss and a choking noise the floatchair rocked he popped up to find pel with the guard slumped very awkwardly across her lap damn said miles regretfully we should have done this to kety back in the first cabinoh well let me at that door pad it was a standard palmlock but set to whom very few maybe kety and vio only but the guard must be empowered to handle emergencies move him up a little miles instructed pel and pressed the unconscious mans palm to the readpad ah he breathed in satisfaction as the door slid aside without alarm or protest he relieved the guard of his stunner and tiptoed inside the haut pel floating after oh huffed pel in outrage they had found the haut nadina the old woman was sitting on a couch similar to the one in the previous cabin wearing only her white bodysuit the effects of a century or so of gravity were enough to sag even her haut body taking away her voluminous outer wrappings seemed a deliberate indignity only barely short of stripping her naked her silver hair was clamped half a meter from its end in a device obviously borrowed from engineering and never designed for this purpose but locked in turn to the floor it was not physically cruelthe length of the rest of her hair still left her nearly two meters of turning roombut there was something deeply offensive about it the haut vios idea perhaps miles thought he knew how ivan had felt contemplating the kitten tree it seemed a wrong thing to do to a little old lady even one from a race as obnoxious as the haut who reminded him of his betan grandmotherwell not really pel actually seemed more like his grandmother naismith in personality but pel dumped the unconscious guard unceremoniously on the floor and rushed from her floatchair to her sister consort nadina are you injured pel anyone else would have fallen on her rescuers neck in a hug being haut they confined themselves to a restrained if apparently heartfelt handclasp oh said pel again gazing furiously at the haut nadinas situation her first action was to skin out of her own robes and donate about six underlayers to nadina who shrugged them on gratefully and stood a little straighter miles completed a fast survey of the premises to be sure they were indeed alone and returned to the women who stood contemplating the hairlock pel knelt and tugged at a few strands which held fast ive tried that sighed the haut nadina they wont come out even one hair at a time where is the key to its lock vio had it pel quickly emptied her sleeves of her mysterious arsenal nadina looked it over and shook her head wed better cut it said miles we have to go as quickly as possible both women stared at him in shock hautwomen never cut their hair said nadina um excuse me but this is an emergency if we go at once to the ships escape pods i can pilot you both to safety before kety awakes to his loss maybe even get away clean every seconds delay costs us our very limited margin no said pel we must retrieve the great key first he could not unfortunately send the two women off and promise to search for the key on his own he was the only qualified orbital pilot in the trio they were going to have to stick together blast it one hautlady was bad enough managing two was going to be worse than trying to herd cats haut nadina do you know where kety keeps the great key yes he took me to it last night he thought i might be able to open it for him he was very upset when i couldnt miles glanced up sharply at her tone there were no marks of violence on her face at least but her movements were stiff arthritis of age or shockstick trauma he returned to the guards unconscious body and began searching it for useful items code cards weapons ah a folded vibraknife he palmed it out of sight and returned to the ladies ive heard of animals gnawing their legs off to escape traps he offered cautiously ugh said pel barrayarans you dont understand said nadina earnestly he was afraid he did they would stand here arguing about nadinas trapped hauthair until kety caught up with them look he pointed at the door pel jerked to her feet and nadina cried what miles snapped open the vibraknife grabbed the mass of silver hair and sliced through it as close to the clamp as he could there lets go barbarian cried nadina but she wasnt going to go over the edge into hysterics she shrieked her belated protest quite quietly all things considered a sacrifice for the good of the haut miles promised her a tear stood in her eye pel pel looked as if she were secretly grateful the deed had been done by him and not her they all boarded the floatchair again nadina half across pels lap miles clinging on behind pel exited the chamber and raised her forcescreen again floatchairs were supposed to be soundless but the engine whined protest at this overload it moved forward with a disconcerting lurch down this way turn right here the haut nadina directed halfway down the hall they passed an ordinary servitor who stepped aside with a bow and did not look back at them did kety fastpenta you miles asked nadina how much does he know of what the star creche suspects about him fastpenta does not work on hautwomen pel informed him over her shoulder oh how about on hautmen not very well said pel hm nevertheless down here nadina pointed to a lift tube they descended a deck and continued down another narrower corridor nadina touched the silver hair piled in her lap regarded the raggedly cut end with a deep frown then let the handful fall with an unhappy but rather finalsounding snort this is all highly improper i trust you are enjoying your opportunity for sport pel and that it will be brief pel made a noncommittal noise somehow this was not the heroic covert ops mission that miles had envisioned in his mindblundering around ketys ship in tow of a pair of prim aging hautladieswell pels allegiance to the proprieties was highly suspect but nadina appeared to be trying to make up for it he had to admit the bubble beat the hell out of his trying to disguise his physical peculiarities in the garb of a ba servitor especially given that the ba appeared to be uniformly healthy and straight enough other hautwomen were aboard that the sight of a passing bubble was unremarkable to staff and crew no weve just been lucky so far they came to a blank door this is it said nadina no giveaway guard this time this was the little room that wasnt there how do we get in asked miles knock i suppose so said pel she dropped her forcescreen just long enough to do so then raised it again i meant that as ajoke said miles horrified surely no one was in therehed pictured the great key kept alone in some safe or coded compartment the door opened a pale man with dark rings under his eyes dressed in ketys livery pointed a device at the bubble read off the electronic signature that resulted and said yes haut vio i have brought the haut nadina to try again said pel nadina grimaced in disapproving editorial i dont think were going to need her said the liveried man but you can talk to the general he stood aside to let them pass within miles who had been calculating how to knock the man out with pels aerosol again started his calculations over there were three men in the floating cipher lab yes an array of equipment festooned with temporary cables cluttered every available surface an even more wheyfaced tech wearing the black undress uniform of cetagandan military security sat before a console with the air of a man whod been there for days as evidenced by the caffeinated drink containers littered around him in a ring and a couple of bottles of commercial painkillers sitting atop a nearby counter but it was the third man leaning over his shoulder who riveted miless attention it wasnt ghemgeneral chilian as his mind had first tried to assume this officer was a younger man taller sharpfaced who wore the bloodred dress uniform of the celestial gardens own imperial security he was not wearing his proper zebrastriped face paint though his tunic was rumpled and hanging open not the chief of securitymiless mind ratcheted down the list he had memorized weeks ago in misaimed preparation for this tripghemgeneral naru yes that was the man third in command in that very inner hierarchy ketys deduced seduced contact called in apparently to lend his expertise in cracking the codes that protected the great key all right said the wheyfaced tech start over with branch seven thousand threehundred and six only seven hundred more to go and well have it i swear pel gasped and pointed piled in a disorderly heap on the table beyond the console was not one but eight copies of the great key or one great key and seven copies could kety be attempting to carry out the late empress lisbets vision after all all the rest of the chaos of the past two weeks some confused misunderstanding no no this had to be some other scam maybe he planned to send his fellow governors home with bad copies or give cetagandan imperial security seven more decoys to chase or a multitude of possibilities as long as they advanced ketys own personal agenda and no one elses firing his stunner would set off every alarm in the place making it a weapon of last resort hell his victims if cleverand miles suspected he faced three very clever menmight jump him just to make him fire it what else do you have up your sleeve miles whispered to pel nadina pel gestured to the table which one is the great key im not sure said nadina peering anxiously at the clutter grab them all check later urged miles but they could all be false dithered pel we must know or it could all be for nothing she fished in her bodice and pulled out a familiar ring on a chain with a raised screamingbird pattern miles choked for gods sake you didnt bring that here keep it out of sight after two weeks of trying to do what that ring does in a second i guarantee those men wouldnt hesitate to kill you for it ghemgeneral naru wheeled from his tech to face the pale glowing bubble yes vio what is it now his voice was bored and dripping with open contempt pel looked a little panicked miles could see her throat move as she subvocalized some practice reply then rejected it were not going to be able to keep this up for much longer said miles how about we attack grab and run how asked nadina pel held up her hand for silence from the onboard debating team and essayed a temporizing reply to the general your tone of voice is most improper sir naru grimaced being back in your bubble makes you proud again i see enjoy it while it lasts well have all of those damned bitches pried out of their little fortresses after this their days of being cloaked by the emperors blindness and stupidity are numbered i assure you haut vio well naru wasnt in on this plot for the sake of the late empresss vision of genetic destiny that was certain miles could see how the hautwomens traditional privacies could come to be a deep itching offense to a dedicated properly paranoid security man was that the bribe kety had offered naru for his cooperation the promise that the new regime would open the closed doors of the star creche and shine light into every secret place held by the hautwomen that he would destroy the hautwomens strange and fragile powerbase and put it all into the hands of the ghemgenerals where it obviously to naru belonged so was kety stringing naru along or were they nearequal coplotters equals miles decided this is the most dangerous man in the room maybe even on the ship he set the stunner for low beam in a forlorn hope of not setting off alarms on discharge pel miles said urgently get ghemgeneral naru with your last dose of sleepyjuice ill try to threaten the others get the drop on them without actually firing tie them up grab the keys and get out of here it may not be elegant but its fast and were out of time pel nodded reluctantly twitched her sleeves back and readied the little aerosol bulb nadina gripped the chairback miles prepared to spring away and take up a firing stance pel dropped her bubble and squirted the aerosol toward narus startled face naru held his breath and ducked away barely grazed by the iridescent cloud of drug his breath puffed back out on a yell of warning miles cursed leapt stumbled and fired three times in rapid succession he dropped the two scrambling techs naru nearly succeeded in rolling away again but at least the beam nimbus brought the ghemgeneral to a twitching halt temporarily naru lumbered around on the deck like a warthog mired in a bog his voice reduced to a garbled groan nadina hurried to the table full of keys swept them into her outermost robe and brought them back to pel pel began trying the ringkey on each one not that one not that miles glanced at the door which remained closed would remain closed until an authorized hand pressed its palmlock who would be so authorized kety naru who was already in here any others were about to find out not pel continued oh what if theyre all false no of course they are miles realized the real one must be must be he began tracing cables from the cipher techs comconsole they led to a box stuffed in behind some other equipment and in the box wasanother great key but this one was braced in a comm lightbeam carrying the signals that probed its codes here miles yanked it from its place and sprinted back to pel weve got the key weve got nadina weve got the goods on naru weve got it all lets go the door hissed open miles whirled and fired a stunnerarmed man in ketys livery stumbled backward thumps and shouts echoed from the corridor as what seemed a dozen more men stood quickly out of the line of fire yes cried pel happily as the cap of the real great key came off in her hand demonstrating its provenance not now screeched miles put it back pel put your forcescreen up now miles ducked aboard the floatchair its forcescreen snapped into place a blast of massed stunner fire roiled through the doorway the stunner fire crackled harmlessly around the sparkling sphere only making it glitter a bit more but the haut nadina had been left outside she cried out and stumbled backward painfully grazed by the stunnimbus men charged through the door you have the key pel cried the haut nadina flee an impractical suggestion alas as his men secured the room and the haut nadina governor kety strolled through the door and closed it behind him palmlocking it well he drawled eyes alight with curiosity at the carnage before him well he might at least have had the courtesy to curse and stamp miles thought sourly instead he looked quite thoroughly in control what have we here a ketyliveried trooper knelt by ghemgeneral naru and helped straighten him and hold him up by his shoulders naru struggling to sit rubbed a shaking hand over his doubtless numb and tingling facemiles had experienced the full unpleasantness of being stunned himself more than once in his pastand essayed a mumbling answer on the second try he managed slurred but intelligible speech s the consorts pel and nadina an the barrayarn tol you those damned bubbles were a securty menace he slumped back into the troopers arms s all right though we have em all now when that voyeur is tried for his treasons said the haut pel poisonously i shall ask the emperor to have his eyes put out before he is executed miles wondered anew at the sequence of events here last night how had they extracted nadina from her bubble i think youre getting a little ahead of us milady he sighed kety walked around the haut pels bubble studying it cracking this egg was a pretty puzzle for him or was it hed done it once before escape was impossible the bubbles movements were physically blocked kety might besiege them starve them out if he didnt mind waitingno kety couldnt wait miles grinned blackly and said to pel this floatchair has communication link capacity doesnt it im afraid its time to call for help they had by god almost brought it off almost made the entire affair disappear without a trace but now that theyd identified and targeted naru the threat of secret aid for kety from inside cetagandan imperial security was neutralized the cetagandans should be able to unravel the rest of it for themselves if i can get the word out governor kety motioned the two men holding the haut nadina to drag her forward to what he apparently guessed was in front of the bubble except that he was actually about forty degrees offsides he relieved one guardsman of his vibraknife stepped behind nadina and lifted her thick silver hair she squeaked in terror but relaxed again when he only laid the knife very lightly against her throat drop your forcescreen pel and surrender immediately i dont think i need to go into crude tedious threats do i no whispered pel in agreement that kety would slit the haut nadinas throat now and arrange the body later was unquestionable hed gone beyond the point of no return some time ago dammit grated miles in anguish now hes got it all us the great key the great key chock full it was of coded information information the value of which lay entirely in its secrecy and uniqueness everywhere else people waded through floods of information information to their eyebrows a clogging mass of data signal and noise all information was transmittable and reproducible left to itself it multiplied like bacteria as long as there was money or power to be had in it till it choked on its own reduplication and the boredom of its human receivers the floatchair your comm linkits all star creche equipment can you download the great key from it do what why said pel struggling with astonishment i suppose so but the chairs comm link is not powerful enough to transmit all the way back to the celestial garden dont worry about that patch it through to the commercial navigations emergency communication net therell be a booster right outside this ship on the orbital transfer station i have the standard codes for it in my head theyre made simple on purpose maximum emergency overridesthe boosterll split the signal and dump it into the onboard computers of every ship commercial or military navigating right now through the eta ceta star system and every station supposed to be a cryforhelp system for ships in deep trouble you see so ketyll have the great key so will a couple thousand other people and where is his sly little plot then we may not be able to win but we can take his victory from him the look on pels face as she digested this outrageous suggestion transformed from horror to a fey delight but then to dismay that will takemany minutes kety will never letno i have the solution for that pels eyes lit with understanding and rage what are those codes miles rattled them off pels fingers flashed over her control panel a dicey moment followed while pel arranged the opened great key in the lightbeam reader kety cried from outside the bubble now pel his hand tightened on the knife nadina closed her eyes and stood in dignified stillness pel tapped the comm link start code dropped the bubbles forcescreen and sprang out of her seat dragging miles with her all right she cried stepping away from the bubble were out ketys hand relaxed the bubbles screen snapped back up the force of it almost pushed miles off his feet he stumbled into the unwelcoming arms of the hautgovernors guards that said kety coldly eyeing the bubble with the great key inside is annoying but a temporary inconvenience take them he jerked his head at his guards and stepped away from nadina you he said in surprise finding miles in their grip me miless lips peeled back on a white flash of teeth that had nothing to do with a smile me all along in fact from start to finish and you are finished of course i may be too dead to enjoy the spectacle kety dared not let any of the three interlopers live but it would take a little time yet to arrange their deaths with civilized artistry how much time how many chances to kety caught himself just before his fist delivered a jawcracking blow to miless face no youre the breakable one isnt that right he muttered half to himself he stepped back nodded to a guard a little shockstick on him on them all the guard unshipped his standard military issue shockstick glanced at the whiterobed haut consorts and hesitated he shot a covertly beseeching look at kety miles could almost see kety grind his teeth all right just the barrayaran looking very relieved the guard swung his stick with a will and belted miles three times starting with his face and skittering down his body to belly and groin the first touch made him yell the second took his breath away and the third dropped him to the floor blazing agony radiating outward and drawing his arms and legs in calculation stopped temporarily ghemgeneral naru just being helped to his feet chuckled in a tone of one happy to see justice done general kety nodded to naru then to the bubble how long to get that open let me see naru knelt to the unconscious wheyfaced tech and relieved him of a small device which he pointed at the bubble theyve changed the codes half an hour once you get my men waked up kety grimaced his wrist comm chimed ketys brows rose and he spoke into it yes captain hautgovernor came the formal uneasy voice of some subordinate we are experiencing a peculiar communication over emergency channels an enormous data dump is being speedloaded into our systems some kind of coded gibberish but it has exceeded the memory capacity of the receiver and is spilling over into other systems like a virus its marked with an imperial override the initial signal appears to be originating from our ship is this something you intend ketys brows drew down in puzzlement then his gaze rose to the white bubble glowing in the center of the room he swore one sharp heartfelt sibilant no ghemgeneral naru we have to get this forcescreen down now kety spared a venomous glare for pel and miles that promised infinite retribution later then he and naru fell to frantic consultation heavy doses of synergine from the guards medkit failed to return the techs to immediate consciousness though they stirred and groaned in a promising fashion kety and naru were left to do it themselves judging by the wicked light in pels eyes as she and the haut nadina clung together they were going to be way too late the pain of the shockstick blows were fading to pins and needles but miles remained curled up on the floor the better not to draw further such attentions to himself kety and naru were so absorbed in their task and their irate arguments over the swiftest way to proceed only miles noticed when a spot on the door began to glow despite his pain he smiled a beat later the whole door burst inward in a spray of melted plastic and metal another beat to wait out anyones hairtrigger reflexes ghemcolonel benin impeccably turned out in his bloodred dress uniform and freshly applied face paint stepped firmly across the threshold he was unarmed but the redclad squad behind him carried an arsenal sufficient to destroy any impediment in their path up to the size of a pocket dreadnought kety and naru froze in midlurch ketys liveried retainers suddenly seemed to think better of drawing weapons opening their hands palmoutward and standing very still colonel vorreedi equally impeccable in his house blacks if not quite so cool in expression stepped in behind benin in the corridor beyond miles could just glimpse ivan looming behind the armed men and shifting anxiously from foot to foot good evening haut kety ghemgeneral naru benin bowed with exquisite courtesy by the personal order of emperor fletchir giaja it is my duty to arrest you both upon the serious charge of treason to the empire and contemplating naru especially benins smile went razorsharp complicity in the murder of the imperial servitor the ba lura chapter fifteen from miless eyelevel the deck sprouted a forest of red boots as benins squad clumped in to disarm and arrest ketys retainers and march them out with their hands atop their heads kety and naru were taken along with them sandwiched silently between some hardeyed men who didnt look as though they were interested in listening to explanations at a growl from kety the procession paused in front of the entering barrayarans miles heard ketys voice icycold congratulations lord vorpatril i hope you may be fortunate enough to survive your victory huh said ivan oh let him go it would be too exhausting to try and sort out kety about his confused inversion of miless little chainofcommand maybe benin would have it straight at a sharp word from their sergeant the security squad prodded their prisoners back into motion and clattered on down the corridor four shiny black boots made their way through the mob and halted before miless nose speaking of explanations miles twisted his head and looked up the odd foreshortened perspective at colonel vorreedi and ivan the deck was cool beneath his stinging cheek and he didnt really want to move even supposing he could ivan bent over him giving an upsidedown view up his nostrils and said in a strained tone are you all right shshshockstick nothing bbroken right said ivan and hauled him to his feet by his collar miles hung a moment shivering and twitching like a fish on a hook till he found his unsteady balance by necessity he leaned on ivan who supported him with an uncommenting hand under his elbow colonel vorreedi looked him up and down ill let the ambassador do the protesting about that vorreedis distant expression suggested he thought privately that the fellow with the shockstick had stopped too soon vorobyev is going to need all the ammunition he can get you have created the most extraordinary public incident of his career i suspect oh colonel sighed miles i predict theres going to bbe nothing ppublic bout this incident wait n see ghemcolonel benin across the room was bowing and scraping to the hauts pel and nadina and supplying them with floatchairs albeit lacking forcescreens extra robes and ghemlady attendants arresting them in the style to which they were accustomed miles glanced up at vorreedi has ivan um explained everything sir i trust so said vorreedi in a voice drenched with menace ivan nodded vigorously but then hedged um all i could under the circumstances meaning lack of privacy from cetagandan eavesdroppers miles presumed all ivan is my cover still intact i admit vorreedi went on i am still assimilating it what hhappened after i left the star creche miles asked ivan i woke up and you were gone i think that was the worst moment of my life knowing youd gone haring off on some crazy selfappointed mission with no backup oh but you were my backup ivan miles murmured earning himself a glare and a good one too as you have just demonstrated yes yeah your favorite kindunconscious on the floor where i couldnt inject any kind of sense into the proceedings you took off to get yourself killed or worse and everybody would have blamed me the last thing aunt cordelia said to me before we left was and try to keep him out of trouble ivan miles could hear countess vorkosigans weary exasperated cadences quite precisely in ivans parody anyway as soon as i figured out what the hell was going on i got away from the hautladies how god miles theyre just like my mother only eight times over ugh anyway the haut rian insisted i go through ghemcolonel benin which i was willing to dohe at least seemed like he had his head screwed on straight perhaps attracted by the sound of his name benin strolled over to listen in on this and god be praised he paid attention to me seemed to make more sense out of my gabble than i did at the time benin nodded i was of course following the very unusual activities around the star creche today around not in quite my own investigations had already led me to suspect something was going on involving one or more of the hautgovernors so i had orbital squads on alert squads ha said ivan theres three imperial battle cruisers surrounding this ship right now benin smiled slightly and shrugged ghemgeneral chilian is a dupe i believe miles put in though you will pprobably wish to question him about the activities of his wife the haut vio he has already been detained benin assured him detained not arrested all right benin seemed exactly on track so far but had he realized yet that all the governors had been involved or was kety elected sole sacrifice a cetagandan internal matter miles reminded himself it was not his job to straighten out the entire cetagandan government tempting as it would be to try his duty was confined to extracting barrayar from the morass he smiled at the glowing white bubble still protecting the real great key the hauts nadina and pel were consulting with some of benins men it appeared that rather than attempting to get the forcescreen down here they were making arrangements to transport it and its precious contents whole and inviolate back to the star creche vorreedi gave miles a grim look one thing that lord vorpatril has not yet explained to my satisfaction lieutenant vorkosigan is why you concealed the initial incident involving an object of such obvious importance kety was trying to frame barrayar sir until i could achieve independent corroborative evidence that vorreedi went on inexorably from your own side ah miles briefly considered a relapse of shockstick symptoms rendering him unable to talk no alas his own motives were obscure even to him in retrospect what had he started out wanting before the twisting events had made sheer survival his paramount concern oh yes promotion that was it not this time boyo antique but evocative phrases like damage control and spin doctoring freefloated through his consciousness in fact sir i did not at first recognize the great key for what it was but once the haut rian contacted me events slid very rapidly from apparently trivial to extremely delicate by the time i realized the full depth and complexity of the hautgovernors plot it was too late too late for what asked vorreedi bluntly what with the shockstick residue and all miles did not need to feign a sick smile but it seemed vorreedi had drifted back to the conviction that miles was not working as a covert ops agent for simon illyan after all thats what you want everybody to think remember miles glanced aside at ghemcolonel benin listening in fascination you would have taken the investigation away from me you know you would have sir everyone in the wormhole nexus thinks im a cripple whos been given a cushy nepotistic sinecure as a courier that i might be competent for more is something lieutenant lord vorkosigan would never in the ordinary course of events ever be given a chance to publicly prove to the world at large true but illyan knew all about the pivotal role miles had played in the hegen hub and elsewhere as did miless father prime minister count vorkosigan and emperor gregor and everyone else whose opinion really counted back on barrayar even ivan knew about that extraordinary covert ops coup in fact it seemed the only people who didnt know were the enemy hed beaten the cetagandans so did you do all this only to shine in the haut rians beautiful eyes or did you have a wider audience in view ghemcolonel benin slowly deciphered this outpouring you wanted to be a hero so badly you didnt even care for which side vorreedi added in some dismay i have done the cetagandan empire a good turn its true miles essayed a shaky bow in benins direction but it was barrayar i was thinking of governor kety had some nasty plans for barrayar those at least ive derailed oh yeah said ivan where would they and you be right now if we hadnt shown up oh miles smiled to himself id already won kety just didnt know it yet the only thing still in doubt was my personal survival he conceded why dont you sign up for cetagandan imperial security then coz suggested ivan in exasperation maybe ghemcolonel benin would promote you ivan damn him knew miles all too well unlikely miles said bitterly im too short ghemcolonel benins eyebrow twitched actually miles pointed out if i was freelancing for anyone it was for the star creche not for the empire i have not served the cetagandan empire so much as the haut ask them he nodded toward pel and nadina getting ready to exit the room with their ghemlady escorts fussing over their comfort hm ghemcolonel benin seemed to deflate slightly magic words apparently a hautconsorts skirts made a stronger fortification behind which to hide than miles would have thought possible a few weeks ago the haut nadinas bubble was hoisted into the air by some men with handtractors and maneuvered out of the room benin glanced after it turned again to miles and opened his hand in front of his chest in a sketch of a bow in any case lieutenant lord vorkosigan my celestial master the emperor haut fletchir giaja requests you attend upon him in my company now miles could decipher an imperial command when he heard one he sighed and bowed in return in proper honor of benins august order certainly ah he glanced aside at ivan and the suddenly agitated vorreedi he wasnt exactly sure he wanted witnesses for this audience he wasnt exactly sure he wanted to be alone either your friends may accompany you benin conceded with the understanding that they may not speak unless invited to do so which inviting would be done if at all solely by benins celestial master vorreedi nodded in partial satisfaction ivan began to practice looking blank with all his might they all herded out surrounded and escortedbut not arrested of course that would violate diplomatic protocolby benins imperial guards miles found himself still supported by ivan waiting to exit the doorway beside the haut nadina such a nice young man nadina commented in a wellmodulated undertone to miles nodding at benin whom they could glimpse out in the corridor directing his troopers so neatly turnedout and he understands the proprieties well have to see what we can do for him dont you agree pel oh quite pel said and floated on through after a lengthy walk through the great state ship miles cycled through the air lock into the cetagandan security shuttle in the company of benin himself who had not let him out of his sight benin looked cool and alert as ever but there was an underlying well smugness leaking through his zebrastriped facade it must have given benin a moment of supreme cetagandan satisfaction arresting his commanding officer for treason the oneup high point of his career miles would have bet betan dollars to sand naru was the man whod assigned the dapper and decorous benin to close the case on the ba luras death in the first place setting him up to fail miles ventured by the way if i didnt say it before congratulations on cracking your very tricky murder case general benin benin blinked colonel benin he corrected thats what you think miles floated forward and helped himself to the most comfortable window seat he could find i dont believe ive seen this audience chamber before colonel vorreedi whispered to miles his gaze flicking around to take in their surroundings its not one ever used for public or diplomatic ceremonies unusually they had come not to a pavilion but to a closed lowlying building in the northern quadrant of the celestial garden the three barrayarans had spent an hour in an antechamber cooling their heels while their internal tension rose they were attended by half a dozen polite solicitous ghemguards who saw to their physical comforts while courteously denying every request for outside communication benin had gone off somewhere with the hauts pel and nadina in view of their cetagandan company miles had not so much reported to vorreedi as exchanged a few guarded remarks the new room reminded miles a bit of the star chamber simple undistracting deliberately serene soundbaffled and cool in shades of blue voices had a curious deadened quality that hinted that the entire chamber was enclosed in a coneofsilence patterns on the floor betrayed a large concealed comconsole table and stationchairs that could be raised for conferences but for now the supplicants stood another guest was waiting and miles raised his brows in surprise lord yenaro stood next to a redclad ghemguard yenaro looked pale with dark greenish circles under his eyes as if he had not slept for about two days his dark robes the same clothes miles had last seen him wearing at the bioesthetics exhibition were rumpled and bedraggled yenaros eyes widened in turn at the sight of miles and ivan he turned his head away and tried not to notice the barrayarans miles waved cheerfully dragging a reluctantly polite return nod from yenaro and starting a very pained crease between his eyebrows and here came something to keep miless mind off his own lingering shockstick pains right now or rather someone ghemcolonel benin entered first and dismissed the barrayarans guards he was followed by the hauts pel nadina and rian in their floatchairs shields down who silently arranged themselves on one side of the room nadina had tucked the cut ends of her hair out of sight among her garments the same robes pel had shared and which nadina had not stopped to change they had all obviously been closeted for the past hour in a debriefing at the highest level for last of all a familiar figure strode in shedding more guards in the corridor outside closeup emperor the haut fletchir giaja seemed even taller and leaner than when miles had seen him at a distance at the elegyreading ceremonies and older despite his dark hair he was for the moment casually dressed by imperial standards in a mere half a dozen layers of fine white robes over the usual masculineloose but blindingwhite bodysuit befitting his status as chief mourner emperors per se did not unnerve miles though yenaro swayed on his feet as though he were about to faint and even benin moved with the most rigid formality emperor gregor had been raised along with miles practically as his fosterbrother somewhere in the back of miless mind the term emperor was coupled with such identifiers as somebody to play hideandseek with in this context those hidden assumptions could be a psychosocial land mineeight planets and older than my father miles reminded himself trying to inculcate a proper deference to the illusion of power imperial panoply sought to create one chair at the head of the room rose from the floor to receive what gregor would have sardonically dubbed the imperial ass miles bit his lip it was apparently going to be a most intimate audience for giaja beckoned benin over and spoke to him in a low voice and benin subsequently dismissed even yenaros guard that left the three barrayarans the two planetary consorts and rian benin the emperor and yenaro nine a traditional quorum for judgment still it was better than facing illyan maybe the haut fletchir giaja was not disposed to razoredged sarcasms but anyone related to all those hautwomen had to be dangerously bright miles swallowed against a babbling burst of explanations wait for your straight lines boy rian looked pale and grave no clue there rian always looked pale and grave a last pang of desire banked itself to a tiny furtive ember in miless heart secret and encysted like a tumor but he could still be afraid for her his chest was cold with that dread lord vorkosigan fletchir giajas exquisite baritone broke the waiting silence miles suppressed a quick glance aroundit wasnt like there were any other lords vorkosigan present after allstepped forward and came to a precise parade rest sir i am still unclear just what your place was in these recent events and how you came by it my place was to have been a sacrificial animal and it was chosen for me by governor kety sir but i didnt play the part he tried to assign to me the emperor frowned at this lessthanstraightforward reply explain yourself miles glanced at rian everything she gave an almost imperceptible nod miles closed his eyes in a brief diffuse prayer to whatever sportive gods were listening opened them again and launched once more into the true description of his first encounter with the ba lura in the personnel pod great key and all at least it had the advantage of simultaneously getting in miless overdue confession to vorreedi in a venue where the embassys chief security officer was totally blocked from making any comment or reply amazing man vorreedi he betrayed no emotion beyond one muscle jumping in his jaw as soon as i saw the ba lura in the funeral rotunda with its throat cut miles went on i realized my thenunknown opponent had thrown me into the logically impossible position of having to prove a negative there was no way once i had been tricked into laying hands on the false key to prove that barrayar had not effected a substitution except by the positive testimony of the one eyewitness then lying dead on the floor or by positively locating the real great key which i set out to do and if the ba luras death was not a suicide but rather a murder elaborately set up to pass as a suicide it was clear someone high in the celestial gardens security was cooperating with the bas killers which made approaching cetagandan security for help quite dangerous at that point but then somebody assigned ghemcolonel benin to the case presumably with heavy hints that it would be well for his career to bring in a quick verdict confirming suicide somebody who seriously underestimated benins abilities and ambition as a security officer was it ghemgeneral naru by the way benin nodded a faint gleam in his eye for whatever reason naru decided ghemcolonel benin would make a suitable additional goat it was beginning to be a pattern in their operations as you must realize if youve collected testimony from lord yenaro here miles raised an inquiring eyebrow at benin i see you found lord yenaro before ketys agents did i think im glad in all you should be benin returned blandly we picked him upalong with his very interesting carpetlast night his account was critical in shaping my response to your cousins um sudden onslaught of information and demands i see miles shifted his weight his parade rest growing rather bent he rubbed his face because it didnt seem like the time or place to rub his crotch does your medical condition require you to sit benin inquired solicitously ill manage miles took a breath i tried in our first interview to direct ghemcolonel benins attentions to the subtleties of his situation fortunately ghemcolonel benin is a subtle man and his loyalty to you or to the truth outweighed whatever implied threats to his career naru presented benin and miles exchanged guarded appreciative nods kety tried to deliver me into the hands of the star creche accused by means of ba luras false confession to the handmaiden miles continued carefully but once again his pawns ad libbed against his script i entirely commend the haut rian for her cool and collected response to this emergency the fact that she kept her head and did not panic allowed me to continue to try to clear barrayar of blame she is um a credit to the haut you know miles regarded her anxiously for a cue where are we but she remained as glassily attentive as if that nowabsent forcebubble had become one with her skin the haut rian acted throughout for the good of the haut never once for her own personal aggrandizement or safety though one might argue apparently over where the good of the haut actually lay your late august mother chose her handmaiden well id say that is hardly for you to judge barrayaran drawled the haut fletchir giaja whether in amusement or dangerously miless ear could not quite tell excuse me but i didnt exactly volunteer for this mission i was suckered into it my judgments have brought us all here one way or another giaja looked faintly surprised even a little nonplussed as if hed never before had one of his gentle hints thrown back in his face benin stiffened and vorreedi winced ivan suppressed a grin the merest twitch and continued his invisible man routine the emperor took another tack and how did you come to be involved with lord yenaro um from my point of view you mean presumably benin had already presented him with yenaros own testimony a crosscheck was in order to be sure in carefully neutral phrasing miles described his and ivans three encounters with yenaro s increasingly lethal practical jokes with a lot of emphasis on miless clever once proved theories about lord x vorreedis face drained to an interesting greenish cast upon miless description of the goround with the carpet miles added cautiously in my opinion certainly proved by the incident with the asterzine bomb lord yenaro was as much an intended victim as ivan and myself there is no treason in the man miles cut off a slice of smile he hasnt the nerve for it yenaro twitched but did not gainsay any of it yeah slather on the suggestion of imperial mercy due all round maybe some would slop over on the one who needed it most at benins direction yenaro in a colorless voice confirmed miless account benin called in a guard and had the ghemlord taken out leaving eight in this chamber of imperial inquisition would they work their way down to one giaja sat silent for a time then spoke in formally modulated cadences that suffices for my appraisal of the concerns of the empire we must now turn to the concerns of haut haut rian you may keep your barrayaran creature ghemcolonel benin will you kindly wait in the antechamber with colonel vorreedi and lord vorpatril until i call you sire benin saluted his way out shepherding the reluctant barrayarans obscurely alarmed miles put in but dont you want ivan too celestial lord he witnessed almost everything with me no stated giaja flatly that settled that well until miles and ivan were out of the celestial garden indeed out of the empire and halfway home they wouldnt be any safer anyway miles subsided with a faint sigh then his eyes widened at the abrupt change in the rooms atmosphere feminine gazes formerly suitably downcast rose in direct stares without awaiting permission the three floatchairs arranged themselves in a circle around fletchir giaja who himself sat back with a face suddenly more expressive dryer edgier angrier the glassy reserve of the haut vanished in a new intensity miles swayed on his feet pel glanced aside at the motion give him a chair fletchir she said ketys guard shocksticked him in the best regulation form you know in her place yes as you wish pel the emperor touched a control in his chairarm a station chair near miless feet rose from the floor he fell more than sat in it grateful and dizzy on the edge of their circle i hope you all see now said the haut fletchir giaja more forcefully the wisdom of our ancestors in arranging that the haut and the empire shall have only one interface me only one veto mine issues of the hautgenomemust remain as insulated as possible from the political sphere lest they fall into the hands of politicians who do not understand the goal of haut that includes most of our gentle ghemlords as ghemgeneral naru has perhaps proved to you nadina a flash of subtle savage irony theremiles suddenly doubted his initial perception of gender issues on eta ceta what if fletchir giaja was haut first and male second and the consorts too were haut first female second who was in charge here when fletchir giaja knew himself as a product of his mothers high art indeed said nadina with a grimace rian sighed wearily what can you expect from a halfbreed like naru but it is the haut ilsum kety who has shaken my confidence in the celestial ladys vision she often said that genetic engineering could only sow that winnowing and reaping must still be done in an arena of competition but kety was not ghem but haut the fact that he could try what he tried makes me think we have more work to do before the winnowing and reaping part lisbet always did have an addiction for the most primitive metaphors nadina recalled with faint distaste she was right about the diversity issue though pel said in principle giaja conceded but this generation is not the time the haut population can expand many times over into space presently held by servitor classes without need for further territorial aggrandizement the empire is enjoying a necessary period of assimilation the constellations have been deliberately limiting their numerical expansion of late decades to conserve their favored economic positions observed nadina disapprovingly you know fletchir pel put in an alternate solution might be to require more constellation crosses by imperial edict a kind of genetic selftaxation novel but nadina is right the constellations have grown more miserly and luxurious with each passing decade i thought the whole point of genetic engineering was to avoid the random waste of natural evolution and replace it with the efficiency of reason miles piped up all three hautwomen turned to stare at him in astonishment as if a potted plant had suddenly offered a critique of its fertilization routine or so it seems to me miles trailed off in a much smaller voice fletchir giaja smiled faint shrewd and wintry belatedly miles began to wonder why he was being kept here by giajas suggestioncommand he had a most unpleasant sensation of being in a conversation with an undertow of crosscurrents which were streaming in three different directions at once if giaja wants to send a message i wish hed use a comconsole miless whole body was throbbing in time with the pulsing of his headache several hours past midnight of one of the longer days of his short life i will return to the council of consorts with your veto said rian slowly as i must but fletchir you must address the diversity issue more directly if this generation is not the time it is still certainly not too soon to begin planning and the diversification issue the singlecopy method of security is too horrifyingly risky as recent events also prove hm fletchir giaja halfconceded his eye fell sharply upon miles neverthelesspelwhatever possessed you to spill the contents of the great key across the entire eta ceta system as a joke it does not amuse pel bit her lip her eyes uncharacteristically lowered miles said sturdily no joke sir as far as we knew we were both going to die within a few minutes the haut rian stated that the highest priority was the recovery of the great key the receivers got the key but no lock without the gene banks themselves it was valueless gibberish from their point of view one way or another we assured you would be able to recover it in pieces maybe even after our deaths regardless of what kety did subsequently the barrayaran speaks the truth affirmed pel the best strategies run on rails like that miles pointed out live or die you make your goal he shut up as fletchir giajas stare hinted that perhaps outlander barbarians had better not make comments that could be construed as a slur on his late mothers abilities even when those abilities had been pitted against him you cant get anywhere with these people or whatever they are i want to go home miles thought tiredly what will happen to ghemgeneral naru anyway he will be executed said the emperor to his credit the bald statement clearly brought him no joy security must be secured miles couldnt argue with that and the haut kety will he be executed too he will retire immediately to a supervised estate due to ill health if he objects he will be offered suicide er forcibly if necessary kety is young he will choose life and other days and chances the other governors giaja frowned annoyance at the consorts a little pragmatic blindness in that direction will close matters but they will not find new appointments easy to come by and miles glanced at the ladies the haut vio what about her the others only tried to commit a crime she actually succeeded rian nodded her voice went very flat she too will be offered a choice to replace the servitor she destroyeddesexed depilated and demoted to ba her metabolism altered her body thickened but returned to a life inside the celestial garden as she desired with a passion beyond reason or she may be permitted a painless suicide which will she choose suicide i hope said nadina sincerely a multiple standard seemed at work in all this justice now that the thrill of the chase was over miles felt a nauseated revulsion at the shambles of the kill for this i laid my life on the line what about the haut rian and me fletchir giajas eyes were cool and distant lightyears gone that is a problem upon which i shall now retire and meditate the emperor called benin back in to escort miles away after a short murmured conference but away to where home to the embassy or headfirst down the nearest oubliette did the celestial garden have oubliettes home it appeared for benin returned miles to the company of vorreedi and ivan and took them to the western gate where a car from the barrayaran embassy already waited they paused and the ghemcolonel addressed vorreedi we cannot control what goes into your official reports but my celestial master benin paused to select a suitably delicate term expects that none of what you have seen or heard will appear as social gossip that i think i can promise said vorreedi sincerely benin nodded satisfaction may i have your words upon your names in the matter please hed been doing his homework upon barrayaran customs it seemed the three barrayarans dutifully gave their personal oaths and benin released them into the dank night air it was about two hours till dawn miles guessed the embassy aircar was blessedly shadowed miles settled into a corner wishing he had ivans talent for invisibility but wishing most of all that they could cut tomorrows ceremonies and start home immediately no hed come this far might as well see it through to the bitter end vorreedi had gone beyond emotion to silence he spoke to miles only once in chill tones what did you think you were doing vorkosigan i stopped the cetagandan empire from breaking up into eight aggressively expanding units i derailed plans for a war by some of them with barrayar i survived an assassination attempt and helped catch three highranking traitors admittedly they werent our traitors but still oh and i solved a murder thats enough for one trip i hope vorreedi struggled with himself for a moment then bit out helplessly are you a special agent or not on a needtoknow list vorreedi didnt not really not at this point miles sighed inwardly well if not i succeeded like one didnt i ivan winced vorreedi sat back with no further comment but radiating exasperation miles smiled grimly in the dark chapter sixteen miles woke from a late uneasy doze to find ivan cautiously shaking him by the shoulder he closed his eyes again blocking out the dimness of his suite and his cousin go way he tried to pull the covers back up over his head ivan renewed his efforts more vigorously now i know it was a mission he commented youre having your usual postmission sulks i am not sulking i am tired you look terrific you know great blotch on the side of your face that goon left with his shockstick goes all the way up to your eye itll show from a hundred meters you should get up and look in the mirror i hate people who are cheerful in the morning what time is it why are you up why are you here miles lost his clutch on his bedclothes as ivan dragged them ruthlessly from his grip ghemcolonel benin is on his way here to pick you up in an imperial landcruiser half a block long the cetagandans want you at the cremation ceremony an hour early what why he cant be arresting me from here diplomatic immunity assassination execution isnt it a little late for that ambassador vorobyev also wants to know he sent me to rustle you up as swiftly as possible ivan propelled miles toward his bathroom start depilating ive brought your uniform and boots from the embassy laundry anyway if the cetagandans really wanted to assassinate you theyd hardly do it here theyd slip something subtle under your skin that wouldnt go off for six months and then would drop you mysteriously and untraceably in your tracks reassuring thought miles rubbed the back of his neck surreptitiously feeling for lumps i bet the star creche has some great terminal diseases but i pray i didnt offend them miles suffered ivan to play valet on fastforward with editorials but he forgave his cousin all sins past present and future in exchange for the coffee bulb ivan also shoved into his hand he swallowed and stared at his face in the mirror above his unfastened black tunic the shockstick contusion across his left cheek was indeed turning a spectacular polychrome crowned by a blueblack circle under his eye the other two hits were not as bad as his clothing had offered some protection he still would have preferred to spend the day in bed in his cabin on the outbound impsec jumpship heading home as fast as the laws of physics would allow they arrived at the embassys lobby to find not benin but mia maz waiting in her formal black and white funeral clothing she had been keeping ambassador vorobyev company when theyd dragged in last nightthis morning ratherand could not have had much more sleep than miles but she looked remarkably fresh even chipper she smiled at miles and ivan ivan smiled back miles squinted vorobyev not here hes coming down as soon as hes finished dressing maz assured him you coming with me miles asked hopefully or no i suppose you have to be with your own delegation this being the big finish and all ill be accompanying ambassador vorobyev mazs smile escaped into a chipmunk grin dimples everywhere permanently he asked me to marry him last night i think it was a measure of his general distraction in the spirit of the insanity of the moment i said yes if you cant hire help well that would solve vorobyevs quest for female expertise on the embassys staff not to mention accounting for all that bombardment of chocolates and invitations congratulations miles managed though perhaps it ought to be congratulations to vorobyev and good luck to maz it still feels quite strange maz confided i mean lady vorobyev how did your mother cope lord vorkosigan you mean being an egalitarian betan and all no problem she says egalitarians adjust to aristocracies just fine as long as they get to be the aristocrats i hope to meet her someday youll get along famously miles predicted with confidence vorobyev appeared still fastening his black tunic at almost the same moment as ghemcolonel benin was escorted inside by the embassy guards correction ghemgeneral benin miles smiled under his breath at the glitter of new rank insignia on benins bloodred dress uniform i called that one right did i not may i ask what this is all about ghemgeneral vorobyev didnt miss the new order benin halfbowed my celestial master requests the attendance of lord vorkosigan at this hour ah we will return him to you your word upon it it would be a major embarrassment for the embassy were he to be mislaid again vorobyev managed to be stern at benin while simultaneously capturing mazs hand upon his arm and covertly stroking it my word upon it ambassador benin promised at vorobyevs reluctant nod of permission he led miles out miles glanced back over his shoulder lonely for ivan or maz or somebody on his side the groundcar wasnt half a block long but it was a very fine vehicle indeed and not military issue cetagandan soldiers saluted benin punctiliously and settled him and his guest in the rear compartment when they pulled away from the embassy it felt something like riding in a house may i ask what all this is about ghemgeneral miles inquired in turn benins expression was almost crocodilian i am instructed that explanations must wait until you arrive at the celestial garden it will take only a few minutes of your time nothing more i first thought that you would like it but upon mature reflection i think you will hate it either way you deserve it take care your growing reputation for subtlety doesnt go to your head ghemgeneral miles growled benin merely smiled it was definitely an imperial audience chamber if a small one not a conference chamber like the room last night there was only one seat and fletchir giaja was in it already the white robes he wore this morning were bulky and elaborate to the point of halfimmobilizing him and he had two ba servitors waiting to help him with them when he rose again he had his iconlook plastered back on his face again his expression so reserved it resembled porcelain three white bubbles floated silently beyond his left hand another ba servitor brought a small flat case to benin who stood upon the emperors right you may approach my celestial master lord vorkosigan benin informed him miles stepped forward deciding not to kneel he and the haut fletchir giaja were almost eye to eye as he stood benin handed the case to the emperor who opened it do you know what this is lord vorkosigan giaja asked miles eyed the medallion of the order of merit on its colored ribbon glittering on a bed of velvet yes sir it is a lead weight suitable for sinking small enemies are you going to sew me into a silk sack with it before you throw me overboard giaja glanced up at benin who responded with a didnt i tell you so shrug bend your neck lord vorkosigan giaja instructed him firmly unaccustomed as you may be to doing so was not rian in one of those bubbles miles stared briefly at his mirrorpolished boots as giaja slipped the ribbon over his head he stepped back half a pace tried and failed to keep his hand from touching the cool metal he would not salute i refuse this honor sir no you dont giaja said in an observant tone watching him i am given to understand by my keenest observers that you have a passion for recognition it is a weakness that can be exploited an understandable quality that puts me much in mind of our own ghem well it was better than being compared to the hauts other semisiblings the ba who were not the palace eunuchs they seemed but rather some sort of incredibly valuable inhouse science projectsthe late ba lura might be better than halfsibling to giaja himself for all miles knew sixtyeight percent shared chromosomal material say quite miles decided he would have more respect for not to mention caution of the silent slippered ba after this they were all in on this hautbusiness together the putative servitors and their putative masters no wonder the emperor had taken luras murder so seriously as far as recognition goes sir this is hardly something that i will be able to show around at home more like hide it in the bottom of the deepest drawer i own good said fletchir giaja in a level tone as long as you lay all the matters associated with it alongside ah that was the heart of it a bribe for his silence there is very little about the past two weeks that i shall take pleasure in remembering sir remember what you will as long as you do not recount it not publicly but i have a duty to report your classified military reports do not trouble me i he glanced aside at rians white bubble hovering near agree giajas pale eyelids swept down in an accepting blink miles felt very strange was it a bribe to accept a prize for doing exactly what hed been going to do or not do anyway come to think of it would his own barrayarans think he had struck some sort of bargain the real reason hed been detained for that unwitnessed chitchat with the emperor last night began to glimmer up at last in his sleepdeprived brain surely they cant imagine giaja could suborn me in twenty minutes of conversation could they you will accompany me giaja went on on my left hand its time to go he rose assisted by the ba who gathered up his robes miles eyed the hovering bubbles in silent desperation his last chance may i speak with you one more time haut rian he addressed them generally uncertain which was the one he sought giaja glanced over his shoulder and opened his longfingered hand in a permissive gesture though he himself continued on at the decorous pace enforced by his costume two bubbles waited one followed and benin stood guard just outside the open door not exactly a private moment that was all right there was very little miles wanted to say out loud at this point anyway miles glanced back and forth uncertainly at the pale glowing spheres one blinked out and there rian sat much as he had first seen her stiff white robes cloaked by the inkfall of shining hair she still took his breath away she floated closer and raised one fine hand to touch his left cheek it was the first time they had touched but if she asked does it hurt he swore hed bite her rian was not a fool i have taken much from you she spoke quietly and given nothing its the haut way is it not miles said bitterly it is the only way i know the prisoners dilemma from her sleeve she removed a dark and shining coil rather like a bracelet a tiny hank of silken hair very long wound around and around until it seemed to have no end she thrust it at him here it was all i could think of thats because it is all you have that you truly own milady all else is a gift of your constellation or the star creche or the haut or your emperor you live in the interstices of a communal world rich beyond the dreams of avarice owning nothing not even your own chromosomes miles took the coil from her it was cool and smooth in his hand what does this signify to you i truly do not know she confessed honest to the end does the woman even know how to lie then i shall keep it milady for memory buried very deep yes please how will you remember me he had absolutely nothing on him that he could give away right now he realized except for whatever lint the embassy laundry had left in the bottoms of his pockets or will it please you to forget her blue eyes glinted like sun on a glacier there is no danger of that you will see she moved gently away from him her forcescreen took form around her slowly and she faded like perfume the two bubbles floated after the emperor to seek their places the dell was similar in design to the one where the haut had held the elegiac poetry recitations only larger a wide sloping bowl open to the artificial sky of the dome hautlady bubbles and haut and ghemlords in white filled its sides the thousand or so galactic delegates in all their muted garbs crowded its circumference in the center ringed by a respectfully unpeopled band of grass and flowers sat another round force dome a dozen meters or more in diameter dimly through its misted surface miles could see a jumble of objects piled high around a pallet upon which lay the slight whiteclad figure of the haut lisbet degtiar miles squinted trying to see if he could make out the polished maplewood box of the barrayaran delegations gift but dorcas sword was buried somewhere out of sight it hardly mattered but he was going to have a ringside seat a nearly imperial view of it all the final parade down an alley cleared to the center of the bowl was arranged in inverse order of clout the eight planetary consorts and the handmaiden in their nine white bubbles sevencount em folks sevenghemgovernors then the emperor himself and his honor guard benin blended into ghemgeneral narus former place without a ripple miles limped along in giajas train intensely selfconscious he must present an astonishing sight slight short sinister his face looking like hed lost a spaceport bar fight the night before the cetagandan order of merit made a fine show against his house blacks quite impossible to miss miles supposed giaja was using him to send some kind of signal to his hautgovernors and not a terribly friendly one since giaja clearly had no plans to let out the details of the past two weeks events miles could only conclude it was one of those catch it if you can things intended to unnerve by doubt as much as knowledge a highly delicate species of terrorism yeah let em wonder well not them he passed the barrayaran delegation near the front of the galactic mob vorobyev stared at him stunned maz looked surprised but pleased pointing at miless throat and saying something to her fiance vorreedi looked wildly suspicious ivan looked blank thank you for your vote of confidence coz miles himself stared for a moment when he spotted lord yenaro in the back row of ghemlords yenaro was dressed in the purple and white garb of a celestial garden ghemlordinwaiting of the tenth rank sixth degree the lowest order the lowest of the highest miles corrected himself looks like he got that assistant perfumers job after all and so the haut fletchir giaja brought another loose cannon under control smooth they all took their assigned places at the center of the bowl a procession of young ghemgirls laid a final offering of flowers all around the central forcebubble a chorus sang miles found himself attempting to calculate the price in labor alone of the entire months ceremonies if one set the time of everyone involved at some sort of minimum wage the sum was celestial he became increasingly aware that he hadnt had breakfast or nearly enough coffee i will not pass out i will not scratch my nose or my ass i will not a white bubble drifted up in front of the emperor a short familiar ba paced alongside it carrying a compartmented tray rians voice spoke from the bubble ceremonial words the ba laid the tray before giajas feet miles at giajas left hand stared down into the compartments and smiled sourly the great key the great seal and all the rest of lisbets regalia were returned to their source the ba and the bubble retreated miles waited in mild boredom for giaja to call forth his new empress from somewhere in the mob of hovering hautbubbles the emperor motioned rian and her ba to approach again more formal phrases so convoluted miles took a full belated minute to unravel their meaning the ba bowed and picked up the tray again on its mistresss behalf miless boredom evaporated in a frisson of shock muffled by intense bemusement for once he wished he were shorter or had ivans talent for invisibility or could magically teleport himself somewhere anywhere out of here a stir of interest even astonishment ran through the haut and ghem audience members of the degtiar constellation looked quite pleased members of other constellations looked on politely the haut rian degtiar took possession of the star creche again as a new empress of cetaganda fourth imperial mother to be chosen by fletchir giaja but now first in seniority by virtue of her genomic responsibility her first genetic duty would be to cook up her own imperial prince son god was she happy inside that bubble her new not husband mate the emperormight never touch her or they might become lovers giaja might wish to emphasize his possession of her after all though to be fair rian must have known this was coming before the ceremony and she hadnt looked like she objected miles swallowed feeling ill and horribly tired low blood sugar no doubt good luck to you milady good luck goodbye and giajas control extended itself softly as fog the emperor raised his hand in signal and the waiting imperial engineers solemnly went into motion at their power station inside the great central forcebubble a dark orange glow began turning red then yellow then bluewhite objects inside tilted fell then roiled up again their forms disintegrating into molecular plasma the imperial engineers and imperial security had doubtless had a tense and sweaty night arranging the empress lisbets pyre with the utmost care if that bubble burst now the heateffects would resemble a small fusion bomb it really didnt take very long perhaps ten minutes altogether a circle opened in the grayclouded dome overhead revealing blue sky the effect was extremely weird like a view into another dimension a much smaller hole opened in the top of the forcebubble white fire shot skyward as the bubble vented itself miles assumed the airspace over the center of the capital had been cleared of all traffic though the stream diffused into faint smoke quickly enough then the dome closed again the artificial clouds scurrying away on an artificial breeze the light growing brighter and cheerier the forcebubble faded into nothingness leaving only an empty circle of undamaged grass not even ash a waiting ba servitor brought the emperor a colorful robe giaja traded off his outer layer of whites and donned the new garment the emperor raised a finger and his honor guards again surrounded him and the imperial parade reversed itself out of the bowl when the last major figure cleared the rim the mourners gave a collective sigh and the silence and rigid pattern broke in a murmur of voices and rustle of departing motion a large open floatcar was waiting at the top of the dell to take the emperor away to wherever cetagandan emperors went when the party was over would giaja have a good stiff drink and kick off his shoes probably not the attendant ba arranged the imperial robes and sat to the controls miles found himself left standing beside the car as it rose giaja glanced over at him and favored him with a microscopic nod goodbye lord vorkosigan miles bowed low until we meet again not soon i trust giaja murmured dryly and floated off trailed by a gaggle of forcebubbles now turned all the colors of the rainbow none paused as if to look back ghemgeneral benin at miless elbow almost cracked an expression laughing come lord vorkosigan i will escort you back to your delegation having given your ambassador my personal word to return you i must personallyredeem it as you barrayarans say a curious turn of phrase do you use it in the sense of a soul in a religion or an object in a lottery mm more in a medical sense as in the temporary donation of a vital organ hearts and promises all redeemed here today ah they came upon ambassador vorobyev and his party looking around as galactic delegates boarded floatcars for a ride to one last fantastical meal the cars white silk seats had all been replaced in the last hour by assorted colored silks signifying the end of official mourning at no discernible signal one came promptly to benin no waiting in line for them if we left now miles noted to ivan we could be in orbit in an hour butthe ghemladies might be at the buffet ivan protested women like food yknow miles was starving in that case definitely leave straightaway he said firmly benin perhaps mindful of his celestial master s last broad hint supported this with a bland that sounds like a good choice lord vorkosigan vorobyev pursed his lips ivans shoulders slumped slightly vorreedi nodded at miles s throat a glint of puzzled suspicion in his eyes what was that all about lieutenant miles fingered his silken collar with the cetagandan imperial order of merit attached my reward and my punishment it seems the haut fletchir giaja has a low taste for high irony maz who had obviously not yet been brought up to speed on the subtext of the situation protested his lack of enthusiasm but its an extraordinary honor lord vorkosigan there are cetagandan ghemofficers who would gladly die for it vorobyev explained coolly but rumors of it will hardly make him popular at home love particularly circulating as they must without any real explanation attached even more particularly in light of the fact that lord vorkosigans military assignment is in barrayaran imperial security from the barrayaran point of view it looks well it looks very strange miles sighed his headache was coming on again i know maybe i can get illyan to classify it secret about three thousand people just saw it ivan said miles stirred well thats your fault mine yeah if youd brought me two or three coffee bulbs this morning instead of only one my brain might have been online and i couldve ducked faster and avoided this bloody slow reflexes the implications are still dawning on me for example if he had not bowed his head to giajas silk collar in polite compliance how dramatically would the chances have risen of his and ivans jumpship meeting some unfortunate accident while exiting the cetagandan empire vorreedis brows twitched yes he said what did you and the cetagandans talk about last night after lord vorpatril and i were excluded nothing they never asked me anything more miles grinned blackly thats the beauty of it of course lets see you prove a negative colonel just try i want to watch after a long pause vorreedi slowly nodded i see thank you for that sir breathed miles benin escorted them all to the south gate and saw them out for the last time the planet of eta ceta was fading in the distance though not fast enough to suit miles he switched off the monitor in his bunk aboard the impsec courier vessel and lay back to nibble a bit more from his plain dry ration bar and hope for sleep he wore loose and wrinkled black fatigues and no boots at all he wriggled his toes in their unaccustomed freedom if he played it right he might be able to finesse his way through the entire twoweek trip home barefoot the cetagandan order of merit hung above his head swayed slightly on its colored ribbon gleaming in the soft light he scowled meditatively at it a familiar doubleknock sounded on his cabin door for a moment he longed to feign sleep instead he sighed and pushed himself up on his elbow enter ivan ivan had skinned out of his dress uniform and into fatigues as fast as possible also and frictionslippers hah he had a sheaf of colored papers in his hand just thought id share these with you ivan said vorreedis clerk handed em to me just as we were leaving the embassy everything were going to be missing tonight and for the next week he switched on miless disposal chute in the wall a yellow paper lady benello he popped it in it whooshed into oblivion a green one lady arvin whoosh an enticing turquoise one miles could smell the perfume from his bunk the inestimable veda whoosh i get the point ivan miles growled and the food ivan sighed why are you eating that disgusting rat bar even courier ship stores can do better than that i wanted something plain indigestion eh your stomach acting up again no blood leakage i hope only in my brain look why are you here i just wanted to share my virtuous divesting of my life of decadent cetagandan luxury ivan said primly sort of like shaving my head and becoming a monk for the next two weeks anyway his eye fell on the order of merit turning slowly on its ribbon want me to put that down the disposer too here ill get rid of it for you he made to grab it miles came up out of his bunk in a posture of defense like a wolverine out of its burrow will you get out of here ha i thought that little bauble meant more to you than you were letting on to vorreedi and vorobyev ivan crowed miles stuffed the medal down out of sight and out of reach under his bedding i frigging earned it speaking of blood ivan grinned and stopped circling for a swoop on miless possessions and settled down into the tiny cabins station chair ive thought about it you know miles went on what its going to be like ten or fifteen years from now if i ever get out of covert ops and into a real line command ill have had more practical experience than any other barrayaran soldier of my generation and its all going to be totally invisible to my brother officers classified theyll all think i spent the last decade riding in jumpships and eating candy how am i going to maintain authority over a bunch of overgrown backcountry goonslike you theyll eat me alive well ivans eye glinted theyll try to be sure i hope im around to watch secretly miles hoped so too but he would rather have had his fingernails removed with pliers in the oldfashioned impsec interrogation style of a couple of generations ago than say so out loud ivan heaved a large sigh but im still going to miss the ghemladies and the food theres ladies and food at home ivan true ivan brightened slightly sfunny miles lay back on his bunk shoving his pillow behind his shoulders to prop himself halfup if fletchir giajas late celestial father had sent the hautwomen to conquer barrayar instead of the ghemlords i think cetaganda would own the planet right now the ghemlords were nothing if not crude ivan allowed but we were cruder he stared at the ceiling how many more generations dyou think before we can no longer consider the hautlords human i think the operative question is how many generations till the hautlords no longer regard us as human well im used to that even at home sort of a preview of things to come i think cetaganda will remain potentially dangerous to its neighbors as long as the haut are in transition to wherever theyre going empress lisbet and her predecessors and her heiresses are running this twotrack evolutionary racethe haut fully controlled the ghem used as a source of genetic wild cards and pool of variations like a seed company keeping strains of wild plants even when they only sell a monoculture to permit development in the face of the unexpected the greatest danger to everybody else would be for the haut to lose control of the ghem when the ghem are allowed to run the showwell barrayar knows what its like when half a million practicing social darwinists with guns are let loose on ones home planet ivan grimaced really as your esteemed late grandfather used to tell us in gory detail but if the ghem fail to be consistently militarily successful in the next generation or soour generationif their little expansionist adventures continue to be embarrassing and costly like the vervain invasion debacle maybe the haut will turn to other areas of development than the military in their quest for superiority maybe even peaceful ones perhaps ones we can scarcely imagine good luck snorted ivan luck is something you make for yourself if you want it and i want it more oh yes keeping one eye out for sudden moves from his cousin miles rehung his medallion you going to wear that i dare you no not unless i have a need to be really obnoxious sometime but youre going to keep it oh yes ivan stared off into space or rather at the cabin wall and into space beyond by implication the wormhole nexus is a big place and constantly
