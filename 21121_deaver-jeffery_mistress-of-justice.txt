jeffery deaver mistress of justice authors note two of my most heartfelt beliefs about writing suspense fiction are these first its a craft a skill that can be learned and refined and improved with practice second we writers of suspense fiction have a duty to entertain and to as the other moniker for the genre suggests thrill our readers in rereading the first version of this book which i wrote thirteen years ago i realized that while it was a perfectly acceptable dramatic characterdriven study of life on wall street it didnt make my and presumably my readers palms sweat it didnt in other words thrill i considered just letting the book stand as a curiosity among the suspense novels ive written but i felt the nag of the second belief i mentioned above that overarching duty to readers i know how much i enjoy the experience of reading a roller coaster of a story and i felt that the premise of this novel and the characters id created would lend themselves to more of a carnival ride of a book hence i dismantled the book completely and rewrote nearly all of it i had a chance recently to write an introduction to a new edition of mary shelleys frankenstein and during the course of researching her work i learned that she significantly revised the novel thirteen years after it was first published hows that for a coincidence many of the changes in the later edition of frankenstein reflected the authors altered worldview not so in the case of mistress of justice the current edition stands true to its view of wall street in the chaotic era of the s takeover fever uncontrolled wealth toochicforwords manhattan clubs ruthlessness in boardrooms and bedrooms and the many hardworking lawyers who wished for nothing more than to help their clients and to make a living at their chosen profession my special thanks to editor kate miciak for giving me this chance and for helping this book realize its potential j d pacific grove ca one conflicts of interest let the jury consider their verdict the king said for about the twentieth time that day no no said the queen sentence first verdict afterwards lewis carroll alices adventures in wonderland chapter one the drapery man had been warned that even though it was now well after midnight sunday morning of the thanksgiving holiday there would very likely be people in the firm here attorneys and paralegals still working and so he carried the weapon at his side pointed downward it was a curious thing not a knife exactly more of an ice pick but longer and made of a blackened tempered metal he held it with the confidence of someone who was very familiar with the device and who had used it before dressed in gray coveralls bearing the stencil of a bogus drapery cleaning service and wearing a baseball cap the big sandyhaired man now paused and hearing footsteps slipped into an empty office then there was silence and he continued on through shadows pausing for a long moment frozen like a fox near a ground nest of skittish birds he consulted the diagram of the firm turned along one corridor and continued gripping the handle of the weapon tightly in his hand which was as muscular as the rest of his body as he neared the office he sought he reached up and pulled a paper face mask over his mouth this was not so that he wouldnt be recognized but because he was concerned that he might lose a fleck of spit that could be retrieved as evidence and used in a dna match the office which belonged to mitchell reece was at the end of the corridor not far from the front door of the firm like all the offices here the lights were left on which meant that the drapery man wasnt sure that it was unoccupied but he glanced in quickly saw that the room was empty and stepped inside the office was very cluttered books files charts thousands of sheets of papers still the man found the filing cabinet easily there was only one here with two locks on it and crouched pulling on tight latex gloves and extracting his tool kit from his coverall pockets the drapery man set the weapon nearby and began to work on the locks scarf mitchell reece thought drying his hands in the law firms marbleandoak rest room hed forgotten his wool scarf well he was surprised hed managed to remember his coat and briefcase the lanky thirtythreeyearold associate having had only four hours sleep had arrived at the firm around a m yesterday saturday and had worked straight through until about an hour ago when hed fallen asleep at his desk a few moments before something had startled him out of that sleep hed roused himself and decided to head home for a few hours of shuteye the oldfashioned way horizontally hed grabbed his coat and briefcase and made this brief pit stop but he wasnt going outside without his scarf wins had just reported the temperature was degrees and falling reece stepped into the silent corridor thinking about a law firm at night the place was shadowy but not dark silent yet filled with a white noise of memory and power a law firm wasnt like other places banks or corporations or museums or concert halls it seemed to remain alert even when its occupants were gone here down a wide wallpapered corridor was a portrait of a man in stern sideburns a man who left his partnership at the firm to become governor of the state of new york here in a small foyer decorated with fresh flowers was an exquisite fragonard oil painting no alarm protecting it in the hall beyond two keith harings and a chagall here in a conference room were reams of papers containing the magic words required by the law to begin a corporate breach of contract suit for three hundred million dollars and in a similar room down the hall sat roughly the same amount of paper assembled in solemn blue binders which would create a charitable trust to fund private aids research here in a locked safefile room rested the last will and testament of the worlds thirdrichest man whose name most people had never heard of mitchell reece put these philosophical meanderings down to sleep deprivation told himself to mentally shut up and turned down the corridor that would lead to his office footsteps approaching in a soldiers instant the drapery man was on his feet the ice pick in one hand his burglar tools in the other he eased behind the door to reeces office and quieted his breathing as best he could hed been in this line of work for some years hed been hurt in fights and had inflicted a great deal of pain hed killed seven men and two women but this history didnt dull his emotions his heart now beat hard his palms sweated and he fervently hoped he didnt have to hurt anyone tonight even people like him vastly preferred to avoid killing which didnt mean hed hesitate to it if he were found out here the steps grew closer mitchell reece walking unsteadily from exhaustion moved down the corridor his feet tapping on the marble floor the sound occasionally muffled when he strode over the turkish rugs carefully positioned throughout the firm and carefully mounted on antiskid pads law firms are extremely cognizant of slipandfall lawsuits in his mind was a daunting list of tasks to complete before the trial that was scheduled in two days reece had graduated from harvard law fourth in his class largely thanks to lists memorizing for his exams volumes of cases and rules of law and statutes he was now the firms most successful senior litigation associate for much the same reason every single aspect of the case the civil trial of new amsterdam bank trust ltd v hanover stiver inc was contained in a complicated series of lists which reece was constantly reviewing and editing in his mind he supposed hed been reviewing his lists when hed neglected to pick up his scarf he now approached the doorway and stepped inside ah yes there it was the tan cashmere given to him by a former girlfriend it sat just where hed left it next to the refrigerator in the coffee room across from his office when hed arrived that morning well make that yesterday morning at this point hed stopped first in this canteen room to make a pot of coffee and had dropped the scarf on the table while getting the machine going he now wrapped it around his neck and stepped out into the corridor he continued to the front door of the firm he hit the electric lock button and hearing the satisfying click that hed come to know so well thanks to his thousands of late hours at the firm mitchell reece stepped into the lobby where he summoned the elevator as he waited it seemed to him that he heard a noise somewhere in the firm nearby a faint whine of a door hinge maybe followed by the snicksnick of two metal objects faintly colliding but then the elevator arrived reece stepped in and began once again reciting his scrolls of lists silently to himself i think we may have a misunderstanding taylor lockwood said not really returned the voice also female though much older from the phone taylor dropped into her squeaky chair and rolled against the wall of her cubicle not really what did that mean she continued im the lead paralegal on the scb closing thats at four today it was am the tuesday after the thanksgiving holiday and shed just arrived back here after a few hours sleep at home having spent most of the night at the firm editing assembling and stapling hundreds of documents for the closing this afternoon ms strickland on the other end of the line said youve been reassigned something urgent thisd never happened that taylor knew about it was general knowledge as solid as newton s laws that a law firm partner was incapable of handling a business closing without the presence of the paralegal whod worked on the deal law is manifest in the details and a firms paralegals are the gurus of minutiae the only reason for a lastminute reassignment was if a major screwup had occurred but taylor lockwood did not screw up and a cursory review of her ballbusting work on the case over the past weeks revealed no glitches the remedy for which would involve her summarily getting kicked off the deal whatre my options she asked the paralegal supervisor actually the word stretching into far more syllables than it had there are no options taylor spun her chair one way then the other a paper cut inflicted by a ucc security agreement last night had started to bleed again and she wrapped her finger in a napkin with a happy turkey printed on it a remnant from a firm cocktail party the week before why mitchell reece needs your help reece taylor reflected so ill be playing with the big boys good news but still odd why me ive never worked for him apparently your reputation has preceded you ms strickland sounded wary as if she hadnt known that taylor had a reputation he said you and only you is this longterm im taking a vacation next week im scheduled to go skiing you can negotiate with mr reece i mentioned your schedule to him what was his reaction he didnt seem overly concerned why would he be hes not the one going skiing blood seeping through the napkin had stained the turkeys smiling face she pitched it out be in his office in an hour what sort of project a pause while ms strickland perhaps selected from among her quiver of delicate words he wasnt specific should i call mr bradshaw its all taken care of im sorry taylor asked whats been taken care of everything youve been transferred and another paralegal two actually are working with mr bradshaw already be in mr recces office in one hour ms strickland reminded all right oh one more thing whats that mr reece said youre not supposed to mention this to anyone he said that was very important not to anyone then i wont they hung up taylor walked through the carpeted cubicles of the paralegal pen to the one window in this part of the firm outside the financial district was bathed in earlymorning overcast light she didnt care much for the scenery today too much old grimy stone like weathered eerie mountains in one window of a building across the way a maintenance man was struggling to erect a christmas tree it seemed out of place in the huge marble lobby she focused on the window in front of her and realized she was looking at her own reflection taylor lockwood was not heavy but neither was she fashionably bony or angular earthy that was how she thought of herself when asked her height she would answer fivefive she was fivefour and a quarter but she had a dense black tangle of hair that added another two inches a boyfriend once said that with her hair hanging frizzy and loose she looked like she belonged in a preraphaelite painting on days when she was in a good mood she believed she resembled a young mary pickford on notsogood days she felt like a thirtyyearold little girl standing pigeontoed impatiently waiting for the arrival of maturity decisiveness authority she thought she looked her best in imperfect reflections like storefronts painted black or wall street law firm windows she turned away and walked back to her cubicle it was now close to nine and the firm was coming awake growing busier catching up with her this was usually the case taylor lockwood was often one of the first employees to arrive other paralegals were making their way to their desks shouts of greetings and warnings of impending crises were crisscrossing the paralegal pen war stones of subway snarls and traffic jams were exchanged she sat down in her chair and thought about how abruptly the course of life can change and at someone elses whim mr reece said youre not supposed to mention this to anyone he said that was very important not to anyone then i wont taylor glanced at her finger and went to find a bandaid for the paper cut chapter two on a warm morning in april of a balding thirtytwoyearold sideburned lawyer named frederick phyle hubbard walked into a small office on lower broadway slipped his silk hat and prince albert coat onto a hook and said wryly to his partner good morning mr white have you secured any clients yet the life of a law firm began both hubbard and george c t white had graduated from columbia law school and had promptly come under the acutely probing eye of walter carter esquire the senior partner at carter hughes cravath carter hired them without pay for a year then turned them into professionals at the end of their probation by paying them the going salary of twenty dollars a month six years later the two men as ambitious as carter had pegged them to be borrowed three thousand dollars from whites father hired one law clerk and a male secretary and opened their own firm though they dreamed of offices in the stateoftheart equitable building at broadway they settled for less rent in the old building they chose near trinity church was sixtyfour dollars a month which bought the partners two dark rooms still their quarters had central heat though they kept the offices two fireplaces going throughout most of january and february and an elevator that one operated by pulling a thick rope running through the middle of the car with pieces of tapestry carpeting hubbards wife had cut and stitched the felt pads provided by the building management were hubbard felt inelegant and he feared they might impress clients adversely over lunch at delmonicos on fifth avenue where hubbard and white sunk much of their first profits feeding existing and wouldbe clients they would brag about the firms new letterpress which used a damp cloth to make copies of firm correspondence the firm had a typewriter but the lawyers wrote most of their correspondence in ink with steel pens hubbard and white both insisted that their secretary fill the firms inkblotting shakers with lake champlain black sand the men had looked at though rejected a telephone it would have cost ten dollars a month besides there was no one to call but court clerks and a few government officials in school both men had dreamed of becoming great trial lawyers and during their clerking days at carter hughes theyd spent many hours in courtrooms watching famous litigators cajole charm and terrorize juries and witnesses alike but in their own practice economics could not be ignored and the lucrative field of corporate law became the mainstay of their young practice they billed at fiftytwo cents an hour though they added arbitrary and generous bonuses for certain assignments those were the days before income tax before the antitrust division of the justice department before the sec corporations rode like assyrians over the landscape of american free enterprise and messrs hubbard and white were their warlords as their clients became exceedingly wealthy so did they a third senior partner colonel benjamin willis joined the firm in he died several years later of pneumonia related to a world war one mustard gassing but he left as a legacy to the firm one railroad two banks and several major utilities as clients hubbard and white also inherited the matter of what to do with his name appending it to theirs had been the price for both the colonel and his fat clients nothing of the bargain was in writing but after his death the remaining partners kept their word the firm would forever be known as a triumvirate by the time the mantles passed in the late s hubbard white willis had grown to thirtyeight attorneys and had moved into its cherished equitable building banking corporate law securities and litigation made up the bulk of the work which was still performed as it had been in the nineteenth century by gentlemen and a certain type of gentleman only attorneys seeking work who were in fact or by appearance jewish italian or irish were interviewed with interest and cordiality and were never offered positions women were always welcome good stenographers being hard to find the firm continued to grow occasionally spinning off satellite firms or political careers invariably republican several attorneys general issued from hubbard white willis as did an sec commissioner a senator two governors and a vice president of the united states yet the firm unlike many of its size and prestige on wall street wasnt a major political breeding ground it was common knowledge that politics was power without money and the partners at hubbard white saw no reason to forsake one reward of wall street practice when they could have both the presentday hubbard white willis had over two hundred fifty attorneys and four hundred support employees placing it in the mediumsized category of manhattan firms of the eightyfour partners eleven were women seven were jewish including four of the women two were asianamerican and three were black one of whom was to the great delight of the eeocconscious executive committee latino as well hubbard white willis was now big business overhead ran million a month and the partners had upped the billing rates considerably higher than the small change charged by frederick hubbard an hour of a partners time could hit and in big transactions a premium referred to by associates as a nofuckup bonus of perhaps would be added to the clients final tab twentyfiveyearold associates fresh out of law school made around a year the firm had moved from sooty limestone into glass and metal and now occupied four floors in a skyscraper near the world trade center an interior designer had been paid a million dollars to awe clients with dramatic understatement the theme was lavender and burgundy and sea blue rich stone smoky glass brushed metal and dark oak spiral marble staircases connected the floors and the library was a threestory atrium with fiftyfoot windows offering a stunning view of new york harbor the firms art collection was appraised at close to fifty million dollars within this combination moma and interior design centerfold conference room was the only one large enough to hold all of the partners of the firm this tuesday morning though only two men were sitting here at the end of a ushaped conference table surfaced with dark red marble and edged in rosewood amid an aroma of baseboard heat and brewing coffee they together read a single sheet of paper gazing at it like next of kin identifying a body lord i cant believe this donald burdick the man pinning the sheet to the table had been the head of the firms executive committee for the past eight years at sixtyseven he was lean and had sleek gray hair trimmed short by a barber who visited burdicks office fortnightly the old italian brought to the firm in the partners rolls royce fetched as burdick said people often described the partner as dapper but this was offered only by those who didnt know him well dapper suggested weakness and a lack of grit and donald burdick was a powerful man more powerful than his remarkable resemblance to laurence olivier and his suedeglove manners suggested his was a power that could not be wholly quantified it was an amalgam of old money and old friends in strategic places and old favors owed one aspect of his power however did lend itself to calculation the enigmatic formula of partnership interest in hubbard white willis which was not in fact so mysterious at all if you remembered that the votes you got to cast and the income you took home varied according to the number of clients you brought to the firm and how much they paid in fees donald burdicks salary was close to five million dollars a year and augmented often doubled by a complicated network of other investments to use his preferred euphemism my lord he muttered again pushing the sheet toward william winston stanley sixtyfive years old stanley was stout ruddy grim you could easily picture him in pilgrim garb cheeks puffing out steam on a frigid new england morning as he read an indictment to a witch burdick was dartmouth and harvard law stanley had gone to fordham law school at night while working in the hubbard white mailroom by a crafty mix of charm bluntness and natural brilliance for business hed fought his way up through a firm of men with addresses locust valley and westport as foreign to him as his canarsie in brooklyn was to them his saving grace among the societyminded partners was membership in an episcopalian church burdick asked how can this be accurate stanley gazed at the list he shrugged how on earth did clayton do it burdick muttered how did he get this many in his camp without our hearing stanley laughed in a thick rasp we just have heard the names contained on the list had been compiled by one of burdicks spies a young partner who was not particularly talented at practicing law but was a whiz kid at getting supposedly secret information out of people at the firm the list showed how many partners were planning on voting in favor of a proposed merger between hubbard white willis and a midtown law firm a merger that would end the life of hubbard white as it then existed as well as burdicks control of the firm and very likely his practice of law on wall street altogether until now burdick and stanley were convinced that the promerger faction led by a partner named wendall clayton would not have enough votes to ram the deal through but if this tally was accurate it was clear that the rebels probably would succeed and the memo contained other information that was just as troubling at the partnership meeting scheduled for later this morning the promerger side was going to try to accelerate the final merger vote to a week from today originally it had been planned for next january burdick and stanley had been counting on the month of december to win or bully straying partners back into their camp moving the vote forward would be disastrous burdick actually felt a sudden urge to break something his narrow dry hand snatched up the paper for a moment it seemed he would crumple it into a tight ball but instead he folded the paper slowly and slipped it into the inside pocket of his trimfitting suit well hes not going to do it burdick announced what do we do to stop him stanley barked burdick began to speak then shook his head rose and stately as ever buttoned his suit jacket he nodded toward the complicated telephone sitting near them on the conference table which unlike the phones in his office was not regularly swept for microphones lets not talk here maybe a stroll in battery park i dont think its that cold out chapter three his eyes were the first thing about him she noticed they were alarmingly red testifying to a lack of sleep but they were also troubled come on into the lions den mitchell reece nodded taylor lockwood into his office then swung the door shut he sat slowly in his black leather chair the mechanism giving a soft ring lions den i should tell you right up front taylor began ive never worked in litigation i he held up a hand to stop her your experience doesnt really matter not for what i have in mind your discretions whats important ive worked on a lot of sensitive deals i appreciate client confidentiality good but this situation requires more than confidentiality if we were the government i guess wed call it top secret when taylor was a little girl her favorite books were about exploration and adventure the two at the top of her list were the alice stories wonderland and through the lookingglass she liked them because the adventures didnt take the heroine to foreign lands or back through history they were metaphoric journeys through the bizarre side of life around us taylor was now intrigued lions den top secret she said go ahead coffee sure just milk no sugar reece stood up stiffly as if hed been sitting in one position for hours his office was a mess a hundred files bulging manila folders and redwelds stuffed with documents filled the floor the credenza his desk stacks of legal magazines waiting to be read filled the spaces between the files she smelled food and saw the remains of a takeout chinese dinner sitting in a greasy bag beside the door he stepped into the canteen across the hall and she glanced out watched him pour two cups taylor studied him the expensive but wrinkled slacks and shirt there was a pile of new brooks brothers shirts on the credenza behind him maybe he wore one of these to court if he didnt have time to pick up his laundry the tousled dark hair the lean physique she knew that the trial lawyer with dark straight hair a touch long to go unnoticed by the more conservative partners was in his midthirties he specialized in litigation and had a reputation of his own the firms clients loved him because he won cases the firm loved him because he ran up huge tabs doing so taylor had heard that hed once billed twentysix hours in a single day working on a flight to l a hed taken advantage of the time zones young associates idolized reece though they burned out working for him partners were uncomfortable supervising him the briefs and motion papers he wrote under their names were often way beyond the older lawyers skills at legal drafting reece also was the driving force behind the firms probono program volunteering much of his time to represent indigent clients in criminal cases on the personal side reece was the trophy of the firm according to many women paralegals he was single and probably straight the proof wasnt conclusive a divorce but the ladies were willing to accept that circumstantial evidence as entirely credible hed had affairs with at least two women at the firm or so the rumor went on the other hand they lamented he was your standard type a workaholic and thus a land mine in the relationship department which nonetheless didnt stop most of them from dreaming if not flirting reece returned to his office and closed the door with his foot handed her the coffee he sat down okay here it is our clients been robbed he said she asked as in what they do to you on the subway or what they do at the irs burglary really taylor again swallowed the yawn that had been trying to escape and rubbed her own stinging eyes what do you know about banking law he asked the fee for bounced checks is fifteen dollars thats all im afraid so but im a fast learner reece said seriously i hope so heres your first lesson one of the firms clients is new amsterdam bank trust you ever work for them no she knew about the place though it was the firms largest banking client and had been with hubbard white for nearly a hundred years taylor took a steno pad out of her purse and uncapped a pen dont write i like to get the facts straight she said no dont write he said bluntly well okay the pad vanished reece continued last year the bank loaned two hundred fifty million dollars to a company in midtown hanover stiver inc what do they do they make things i dont know widgets baubles bangles bright shiny beads reece shrugged then continued now the first installments of the loan were due six months ago and the company missed the payments they go back and forth the bank and hanover but its pretty clear that the companys never going to pay the money back so under the loan agreement the whole amount comes due a quarterbillion dollars whatd they do with the money good question my feeling is its still sitting somewhere hell they didnt have time to spend that much but anyway what happens at new amsterdam our revered client is this the economy melts down and the banks reserves are shrinking now the government says to all banks thou shall have x amount of dollars on hand at all times but new amsterdam doesnt have x amount anymore they need more in their reserves or the fedsre going to step in and the only way to get a big infusion of cash is to get back hanover s loan if they dont the bank could go under and that results in a couple of problems first amsterdam is donald burdicks plum client if the bank goes under he will not be a happy person nor will the firm because they pay us close to six million a year in fees the other problem is that new amsterdam happens to be a bank with a soul they have the largest minoritybusiness lending program in the country now im not a flaming liberal but you may have heard that one of my pet projects here the criminal pro bono program right and ive seen firsthand that the one thing that helps improve shitty neighborhoods is to keep businesses in them so i have a philosophical stake in the outcome of this situation and what exactly is the situation mitchell earlier in the fall we filed suit against hanover for the two hundred fifty million plus interest now if we can get a judgment fast we can levy against the assets of the company before the other creditors know what hit them but if theres a delay in enforcing that judgment the companyll go into bankruptcy the assetsll disappear and new amsterdam might just go into receivership taylor tapped the pen on her knee she didnt mean to be projecting the impatience she felt though she knew maybe she was and the burglary part he replied im getting to that to loan the money the bank made hanover sign a promissory note you know a negotiable instrument that says hanover promises to pay the money back its like your savings bond not like one of mine taylor reflected considering what theirs was worth now the trial was set for yesterday i had the case all prepared there was no way wed lose reece sighed except when youre going to sue to recover money on a note you have to produce the note in court on saturday the bank couriered the note to me i put it in the safe there he nodded at a big filing cabinet bolted to the floor there were two heavy key locks on the front shocked taylor said thats what was stolen the note reece said in a low voice somebody took it right out of my fucking safe just walked right in and walked out with it you need the original cant you use a copy we could still win the case but not having the notell delay the trial for months i managed to finagle a postponement till next week but the judge wont grant any more extensions she nodded at the file cabinet but when how was it stolen i was here until about three on sunday morning i went home to get some sleep and was back here by ninethirty that morning i almost thought of camping out he gestured toward a sleeping bag in the corner i should have whatd the police say he laughed no no no police burdickd find out that the notes missing the client too the newspapers he held her eyes so i guess you know why i asked you here you want me to find out who took it actually id like you to find the note itself i dont really care who did it she laughed the whole idea was ridiculous but why me i cant do it by myself reece leaned back in his chair the singing metal rang again he looked at ease as if she had already accepted his offer a bit of haughtiness that irritated her some whoever took itll know i cant go to the cops and hell be anticipating me i need somebody else to help me i need you i just i know about your ski trip im sorry youd have to postpone it well so much for the negotiations ms strickland mitchell i dont know im flattered you called me but i dont have a clue how to go about it well let me just say one thing we work with a lot of you know private eyes sam spade sure actually no not sam spade at all thiss what im saying the best detectivesre women they listen better than men theyre more empathic they observe more carefully youre smart popular at the firm and if we can mix our gender metaphor for a minute the grapevine here says youve got balls does it now taylor asked frowning and feeling immensely pleased and if you want another reason i trust you trust me she wondered he doesnt even know me he but then she understood she smiled and you know i didnt steal it ive got an alibi reece nodded unabashedly yep you were out of town shed gone to maryland to spend the thanksgiving holiday with her parents taylor said i couldve hired somebody i think whoever was behind the theft did hire somebody a nod toward the cabinet its a professional breakin the burglar picked the lock and whatever you see in the movies that aint easy but the point is that you dont have a motive and motive is the number one reason somebody becomes a suspect in a crime why would you steal it you have a good relationship with everybody at the firm you dont need money youve applied to law school three of the best in the country besides i just cant imagine samuel lockwoods daughter stealing a note she felt a troubled jolt that hed peered so far into her life well i suspect ted bundy had upright parents too its just that this is out of my depth mitchell you need a pro one of those private eyes youve hired before that wouldnt work he said bluntly as if it were obvious i need somebody with a reason to be here who wont raise eyebrows youll have to poke into a lot of different places at the firm like alice on the other side of the looking glass still seeing the hesitancy in her face he added it could work out well for you too he toyed with his coffee cup she lifted an enquiring eyebrow and he continued im a trial lawyer and i lost my delicacy the first time i ever stood up in court the fact is if that note doesnt turn up and i lose the case then im not going to make partner this year and that just isnt acceptable i might even get fired but if we can find it and nobody learns about the theft then its pretty likely ill make partner here or if i dont want to stay at hubbard white at some other firm and she asked still not certain where his comments were headed ill be in a position to make sure you get into whatever law school you want and get you a job when you graduate ive got contacts everywhere corporate firms the government public welfare law environmental law firms as a paralegal taylor lockwood had learned that the engine of law ran on many fuels and that it would seize and burn without the delicate web of contacts and networks and unspoken obligations that reece was not so subtly referring to but she also knew that you could always take a higher path and with luck sweat and smarts make your own way in this world she said stiffly i appreciate that mitchell but my undergrad professorsre writing me all the letters of recommendation i need he blinked and held up a hand look im sorry that was out of line im used to dealing with clients whore either crooks or greedy bastards a sour laugh and im not sure which are my pro bono criminal clients and which are the whiteshoe folks we wine and dine at the downtown athletic club she nodded accepting his apology but glad certain ground rules were clear reece looked her over for a moment as if he suddenly saw her differently a faint smile bloomed on his face im kind of like you how do you mean she asked i get the sense that you never ask for help she shrugged i dont either never but now i need help and its hard for me to ask i dont even know how to so let me try again a boyish laugh will you help me he asked in a voice filled with what seemed to be uncharacteristic emotion taylor looked out the window the pale sun went behind thick clouds and the sky became as dark as its reflection in the choppy harbor i love views she said in my apartment you can see the empire state building provided you lean out the bathroom window silence reece brushed his hair aside then rubbed his eyes with his knuckles the brass clock on his desk ticked softly taylor mentally asked the opinion of alice the young girl in the english countryside who decided out of summer boredom to follow a talking white rabbit down its hole to a world very different from her own finally taylor said to the lawyer all right i frankly dont have a clue what to do but ill help you reece smiled and leaned forward suddenly then stopped fast theres a code of chastity within law firms whatever liaisons occurred in hotel rooms or attorneys beds at home when you were within the labyrinth of the office cheeks were not kissed and lip never met lip even embracing was suspect recces concession to gratitude was taking taylor s hand in both of his she smelled a mix of expensive aftershave and sweat in his wake as he sat back so first of all she said what does it look like the note nothing fancy one piece of eightandahalfbyeleven paper he showed her a binder containing a copy of it she looked over the undistinguished document then asked tell me what happened and when the bank messengered the note to me at five in the afternoon on saturday they were closed on sunday and since the trial started at nine on monday i needed it early to make copies for pleadings well i locked it in my file cabinet as soon as it came in i made the copies about ten or eleven that night put it back in the cabinet locked it i left at three on sunday morning i got some sleep came back around ninethirty i noticed some scratch marks on the lock and opened it up the note was gone i spent the rest of sunday looking for it i appeared in court yesterday got the continuance for a week from today and then came back here to find somebody to help me did you see anybody at the firm that night not after five or six not a soul but i was at my desk practically the whole time well she sat back reflecting you mentioned motive who has a motive to steal it you said it was negotiable could somebody cash it in no nobody in the worldd take paper like that too big and too easily traced im sure it was just to delay the case to give lloyd hanover a chance to hide his assets who knew you had it the messenger didnt know what was in the bag but it was an armed courier service so theyd know it was valuable at the bank as far as i know the only one who knew i took delivery was the vice president who worked on the deal could he have been bribed by hanover reece said anythings possible but hes a career officer been with the bank for twenty years i know him personally he and his wife live in locust valley and theyve got plenty of money on their own anyway hes the point man on the deal if the bank doesnt collect on this note hell be fired who here knew you were working on the case reece laughed he slid a memo across to her from m a reece to attorneys of hubbard white willis re conflicts of interest i am representing our client new amsterdam bank trust in a lawsuit against hanover stiver inc please advise if you have ever represented hanover stiver or have any other conflicts of interest involving these companies of which the firm should be aware this is the standard conflicts of interest memo to let everybody know who were suing if any lawyers here have ever represented hanover we have to drop the case or do a chinese wall to make sure there was no appearance that we were compromising either client so in answer to your question everybody here knew what i was doing and by checking copies of my correspondence in the file room they could figure out when id be receiving the note taylor prodded the conflicts memo with the fork of her fingers what do you know about the executives at hanover ive had murderers in the pro bono program whore more upright than the ceo lloyd hanover hes unadulterated scum he thinks hes some kind of smooth operator you know the kind late fifties crewcut tanned has three mistresses wears so much gold jewelry hed never get through a metal detector thats not a crime taylor said no but his three sec violations and two rico and one irs convictions were ah taylor glanced out the window across the street was a wall of office windows a hundred of them and beyond that building were others with more office windows and still more beyond that taylor lockwood was momentarily overwhelmed by the challenges they faced needles and haystacks she asked are you sure were looking for something that still exists how do you mean if nobodys going to cash the note why wouldnt they just burn it good question ive thought about that when i was an assistant u s prosecutor and when i do my criminal defense work now i always put myself in the mind of the perp in this case if the note disappears forever that implies a crime if its just misplaced until hanover s hidden his assets and then it resurfaces well that suggests just legal malpractice on hubbard whites part nobody looks any farther for a bad guy than us thats why i think the notes still in the firm maybe in the file room maybe stuck in a magazine in a partners office maybe behind a copier wherever the thief hid it thief lockwood felt her first uneasy twinge not only at the impossibility of the task but that there was potential danger too in wonderland the queen of hearts favorite slogan was off with their heads she sat back i dont know mitchell it seems hopeless therere a million places the note could be we dont have the facts yet theres a huge amount of information at the firm about where people have been at various times and what theyve been doing billing department payroll things like that i guess the first thing id do is check the door key entry logs and time sheets to find out who was in the firm on saturday she nodded at the lock but we think it was a pro dont we not a lawyer or employee still somebody had to let him in either that or they lent him their key card or one theyd stolen reece then took out his wallet and handed her a thousand dollars in hundreds she looked at the cash with a funny smile embarrassed curious for expenses expenses did he mean bribes she wasnt going to ask taylor held the bills awkwardly for a moment then slipped them into her purse she noticed a sheet of paper on recces desk it was legalsized and pale green the color of corridors in old hospitals and government buildings she recognized it as the court calendar the managing attorney of hubbard white circulated throughout the firm daily it contained a grid of thirty days beginning with today filling these squares were the times and locations of all court appearances scheduled for the firms litigators she leaned forward in the square indicating one week from today were the words new amsterdam bank trust v hanover v stiver jury trial ten am no continuance he looked at his watch lets talk again tomorrow but we should keep our distance when were at the firm if anybody asks tell them youre helping me with some yearend billing problems but whod ask whod even know he laughed and seemed to consider this a naive comment hows the vista hotel at ninethirty sure if i call you at home i can leave a message cant i ive got an answering machine no i mean there wont be anybody else there to pick it up right i heard you lived alone she hesitated momentarily and said only you can leave messages there chapter four i have a breakfast meeting in half an hour then the partnership meeting for the rest of the morning wendall clayton said into the phone get me the details as soon as possible ill do what i can wendall sean lillick a young paralegal who worked for clayton regularly replied uneasily but its like pretty confidential like confidential it is confidential or not a sigh from the other end of the phone line you know what i mean the partner muttered you meant it is confidential well find out who has the information and aristocratize them i want the particulars which you might just have found out before you called youd know id want them sure wendall lillick said the partner dropped the phone into the cradle wendall clayton was a handsome man not big under six feet but solid from running he didnt jog he ran and tennis and skippering the fortytwofoot ginny may around newport every other weekend from april through september he had a thick bundle of professorial hair and he wore european suits slitless in the back forgoing the burdened sacks of dark pinstripe that cloaked most of the pearshaped men of the firm killer looks the women in the firm said another three inches and he could have been a model clayton worked hard at his image the way nobility worked hard a duke had to be handsome a duke enjoyed dusting his suits with pigbristle brushes and getting a radiant glow on his burgundycolored ballys a duke took great pleasures in the small rituals of fastidiousness aristocratize them sometimes clayton would write the word in the margin of a memo one of his associates had written then watch the girl or boy flustered trying to pronounce it aristocratize hed made up the term himself it had to do with attitude mostly much of it was knowing the law of course and much was circumstance but mostly it was attitude clayton practiced often and he was very good at it he hoped sean lillick would in turn be good at aristocratizing some underling in the steno department to get the information he wanted by searching through the correspondence files time sheets and limousine and telephone logs the young paralegal had learned that donald burdick had recently attended several very secretive meetings and made a large number of phone calls during firm hours that had not been billed to any clients this suggested to clayton that burdick was plotting something that could jeopardize the merger that might not be the case of course his dealings could be related to some private business plans that burdick or his lucrezia borgia of a wife vera were involved in but clayton hadnt gotten to his present station in life by assuming that unknown maneuverings of his rivals were benign hence his sending lillick off on the new mission to find out the details the tuesday morning light filtered into his office the corner office located on the firms executive row the seventeenth floor the room measured twentyseven by twenty a size that by rights should have gone to a partner more senior than clayton when it fell vacant however the room was assigned to him even donald burdick never found out why clayton glanced at the tiffany nautical clock on his desk nearly time he rocked back in his chair his throne a huge construction of oak and red leather he had bought in england for two thousand pounds aristocratize he ordered his secretary to have his car brought around he rose donned his suit jacket and left the office the breakfast gettogether he was about to attend was perhaps the most important of any meeting hed been to in the past year but clayton didnt go immediately to the waiting car rather he decided hed been a bit harsh on the young man and wandered down to lillicks cubicle in the paralegal department to personally thank the young man and tell him a generous bonus would be forthcoming you ever been here wendall the man across the burnished copper table asked when clayton spoke however it was to the captain of the carleton hotel on fiftyninth street off fifth avenue the nova frederick no mr clayton the captain shook his head not today thanks ill have my usual very good mr clayton well that answers my question john perelli said with an explosive laugh hows the yogurt today freddie thats a joke perelli barked gimme a bowl dry wheat toast and a fruit cup yessir mr perelli perelli was stocky and dark with a long face he wore a navy pinstripe suit clayton shot his cuffs revealing eighteenkaratwedgwood cuff links and said i feel in answer to your question right at home here though this was not completely true recently wendall clayton had been coming to this dining room where many of perellis partners breakfasted and lunched to make inroads into midtown yet this was not his natural turf which had always been wall street upper fifth avenue his weekend house in redding connecticut his tenroom cabin in newport clayton had a stock portfolio worth around twentythree million depending on how the gods of the dow were feeling at any particular moment hanging on the oak paneling in his upper east side den were a picasso three klees a mondrian a magritte he drove a jaguar and a mercedes station wagon yet his wealth was of the hushed victorian sort a third inherited a third earned at the practice of law and cautious investment of the proceeds the rest from his wife but here in midtown he was surrounded by a different genre of money it was loud money acquired from new wellsprings this money was from media from advertising from public relations from junk bonds from leveraged buyouts from alligator spreads and dividendsnatching commission money sales money real estate money italian money jewish money japanese money claytons wealth was money with cobwebs and therefore it was ironically suspect at least around here in this part of town when it came to wealth the slogan was the more respectable the less acceptable he tried not to give a damn yet here clayton felt as if he were without passport the phrase whose acronym gave rise to the derisive term for italians wendall clayton in midtown was an immigrant in steerage so why the call wendall perelli asked clayton replied we need to move faster im trying to accelerate the vote on the merger faster why the natives are restless perelli barked what does that mean i dont know what it means that your people wanta go forward or that burdick and his cronies trying to fuck the deal a little bit of both whats donald doing setting up an office in dc and london to goose up your operating expense something like that im finding out clayton conceded with a nod the waiter set the plates on the table clayton hunched over the soft mounds of eggs and ate hungrily cutting the food into small bites perelli waited until the server was gone then examined clayton carefully and said we want this to work weve got labor clients we can parlay into your sec base weve got products liability cases that are gold mines youve got corporate people and litigators whod be a natural fit obviously we want your banking department and you want our real estate group its made in heaven wendall whats burdicks problem old school i dont know the fact weve got jewish partners the fact we have eyetalian partners probably but theres more to it right the keeneyed perelli asked cut the crap wendall youve got an agenda thats scaring the shit out of burdick and his boys what okay clayton thought this is it he reached into his jacket and handed perelli a piece of paper perelli read then looked up questioningly a hit list clayton tapped the paper dramatically yep thats who i want out within a year after the merger there are what twentyfive names here perelli read burdick bill stanley woody crenshaw lamar fredericks ralph dudley wendall these men are hubbard white willis theyve been there for decades theyre deadwood hasbeens this is the last piece of the deal john for the merger to work they have to go perelli chewed some of his toast and washed it down with coffee you said you wanted to accelerate the merger he waved at the paper but if youre asking us to agree to this itll only slow things up ive got to run these names by the management committee well have to review each one of their partnership contracts christ theyre all over fortyfive you know the kind of trouble they could make in court for us clayton laughed with genuine amusement john with my connections you really think the eeoc would be a problem all right maybe not but thesere still dangerous men and theyre the ones whore bleeding the firm dry they have to go if we want to the firm to succeed they have to go he pushed aside his empty plate a week john i want the merger papers signed in a week impossible considering that you might have to move slightly more quickly clayton said we would be willing to alter our partnership share price you if we ink the deal next week hubbard white and willis is willing to reduce our firstyear share take by eight percent are you out of your fucking mind youre talking millions of dollars wendall thirteen million dollars this meant that the hubbard white and willis partners would in effect give the incoming partners a huge bonus simply for expediting the deal and for ousting burdick and his cronies clayton continued well claim it has to be done by year end for tax reasons thatll be our excuse just tell me if i insisted that burdick stay for say five years would you still be willing to proceed clayton signed his name to the check he offered no credit card let me tell you something john twenty years ago donald burdick was asked by the president to head a special committee looking into abuses in the steel industry the justice department was involved i heard about that burdick was picked because he was known in both albany and washington the executive committee at hubbard white it was called a steering committee then was ecstatic publicity for the firm a chance for burdick to do some serious stroking on the hill afterward a triumphant return well donald burdick told the committee hed accept the appointment on one condition that when he returned he and a man of his choosing would be placed on the executive committee and three particular partners would be asked to leave the firm now john that was at a time when law firms did not fire partners it simply was not done and three months later a memo went around the office congratulating three partners who were unexpectedly leaving hubbard white and starting their own firm clayton pushed back from the table the answer to your question is this the only way the deal works is without burdick and everyone else on that list thats the quid pro quo what do you say you really fucking want this dont you deal clayton asked sticking out his hand perelli hesitated for a moment before pronouncing deal and shaking claytons hand but the delay was merely because he had to swallow the piece of bacon hed snuck off claytons plate and wipe his fingers who are these men and women what do i know about them other than the baldest facts of their wealth their brilliance their aspirations in the back of the massive sixteenthfloor conference room donald burdick heard the grandfather clock chime and begin its ringing climb toward ham the partners were arriving most carried foolscap pads or stacks of files and their ubiquitous leather personal calendars over the years ive seen men like this women now too display stubbornness and brutality and brilliance and cruelty and generosity and sacrifice but those are the mere manifestations of their souls whats truly in their hearts the partners took their places around the table in the dark conference room some the less confident the younger ones examined the dings in the rosewood and traced the pattern of the marble with their fingers and eyes and made overly loud comments about their thanksgivings and about football games they wore jackets with their suits others the veterans were in shirtsleeves and had no time for chatter or the admmistrivia of meetings like this they appeared inconvenienced and why shouldnt they isnt the point of a law firm after all to practice law theyre my partners but how many are my friends donald burdick sitting at the apogee of the table however understood that this was a pointless question the real one was how many of my friends will stab me in the back if the tally that bill stanley had showed him earlier was accurate the answer to this question was one hell of a lot to stanley burdick whispered nearly fifteenll be missing that could swing it one way or another theyre dead stanley replied in a growl and well never find the bodies wendall clayton entered the room and took a seat in the middle of one leg of the u he wasnt particularly far away from burdick and not particularly close he busied himself jotting notes and smiling chatting with the partner next to him at elevenfifteen burdick nodded for a partner to close the door the lock mechanism gave a solid click it seemed to burdick that the pressure in the room changed and that they were sealed in as if this were a chamber in the great pyramid donald burdick called the meeting to order minutes were read and not listened to a brief report from the executive committee on staff overtime went ignored committee reports were recited at breakneck speed with uncharacteristically few interruptions and little debate do you want to hear about the hiring committees schedule asked a sanguine young partner who had probably stayed up half the night to prepare it i think well postpone that one burdick said evenly and seeing several partners smile realized that the royal pronoun was an unfortunate slip there was silence in the room punctuated by the popping of soda cans and papers being organized dozens of pens made graffiti on legal pads burdick studied the agenda for a moment and then it was time for wendall clayton to make his move he slipped his suit jacket off opened a file and said may i have the floor burdick nodded in his direction in a rehearsed baritone wendall clayton said id like to make a motion relevant to the proposed merger of our firm with sullivan perelli burdick shrugged you have the floor sipping had stopped doodling had stopped some partners like the aging oblivious ralph dudley were confused because the final vote on the merger wasnt scheduled until january they were terrified that they might have to make a decision without someones telling them what to do im moving to change the date of the ratification vote regarding the merger to november one week from today claytons trim young protégé randy simms iii whom burdick detested said quickly second there was complete silence and burdick was mildly surprised that claytons bid caught some people off guard but then burdick and his wife were rumored to have the best intelligence sources on wall street and were often one step ahead of everybody else one voice called can we discuss it the rules of order allow for debate clayton said and debate ensued clayton was clearly prepared for it he met every objection making a good case for the acceleration the yearend tax planning for instance hinting that the merger would put significant money into the pockets of all the partners and that they needed to know before december how much this might be more voices joined in and a tide of comments and tensionbreaking laughter filled the room clayton managed to insert into the discussion a comment on sullivan perellis income cap on the executive committee partners burdick observed that this was irrelevant to the immediate motion under consideration but would not go unnoticed by the younger poorer partners the gist of the comment was that after the merger the senior partners could earn no more than two million a year leaving that much more to be distributed to the rest of the partners hubbard white willis currently had no such cap which was the reason that five partners on the executive committee such as burdick and stanley earned percent of the firms income and junior partners often earned less than they did as salaried associates what is the cap one partner obviously impressed asked goddamn socialism burdick thought then he interrupted the youngster to say bluntly were not here now to discuss the substantive issue of the merger its merely a procedural matter on when the vote should be and my opinion is that its impossible to review the material in one week we need until january well donald clayton pointed out youve had everything for two weeks already and id imagine you like all the rest of us read it as soon as they messengered the binders to us from perelli sullivan he had read it of course and so had the team of lawyers he and vera had hired a new partner at the end of the table made a comment i dont think we can debate this too much its not inappropriate to talk about the substance of the merger now i think his dialect put him within five minutes of the charles river yes it is inappropriate burdick said shortly silencing him then to clayton go ahead with your vote it makes no sense to me but if two thirds of the partners are in favor clayton gave a very minuscule frown a simple majority donald burdick shook his head a trace of confusion now crossed his face majority no wendall i dont think so the issue is the merger of the firm and that requires a vote of two thirds clayton said no wed be voting simply on establishing an agenda and timetable under the partnership rules donald that requires only a simple majority burdick was patient yes but its an agenda and timetable that pertain to a merger each of the two partners pulled out a copy of the partnership documents like dueling knights drawing swords section fourteen paragraph four subparagraph d clayton said this as if reading from the tome though everyone knew hed memorized it long ago burdick continued reading for a few moments its ambiguous but i wont make an issue of it well be here all day at this rate and i for one have some work to do for clients the senior partner knew of course that clayton was absolutely correct about the majority vote on this matter however it had been vitally important to make clear to everyone in the room exactly where burdick stood on the merger how adamantly against it he was go ahead burdick said to stanley as the rotund partner growled off names burdick sat calmly pretending to edit a letter though he was keeping a perfect tally in his head of the fors and againsts distraction on his face agony in his heart burdick added them up his mood slipped from cautious to alarmed to despairing clayton prevailed and by almost a twothirds majority the magic percentage needed to win the entire war the list stanley had shown burdick earlier was not accurate clayton was stronger than theyd thought clayton looked at burdick studying his opponent from behind the emotionless guise of the great his gold pen danced on a pad if anyone needs any information from perelli to make a betterinformed decision next week just let me know burdick said thank you wendall i appreciate the time youve spent on the matter looking around the room at both his supporters and his judases with as neutral a face as he could muster he added now any more issues we ought to discuss chapter five dimitri taylor lockwoods voice was a whisper dont say satin touch tonight please hey come on the man replied in a deep greekaccented voice the guys in the audience they like it its embarrassing its sexy he replied petulantly no its not and all it does is get me moony looks from the lechers hey they like to fantasize so do i you got the lights she sighed and said yeah i got the lights from the amplifier his voice filled the bar ladies and gentlemen miracles pub is pleased to bring you the silky and ohsosmooth satin touch of taylor lockwood on the keys a warm round of applause please and dont forget to ask your waitress about the miracles menu of exotic drinks ohsosmooth satin touch taylor clicked the switch that turned the house lights down and ignited the two overhead spots trained on her dimitri had made the spotlights himself pineapple cans painted black smiling at them all even the moony lechers she began to play gershwin on the battered baldwin baby grand it wasnt a bad gig the temperamental owner of the club in the west village a lech himself had figured that an attractive woman jazz pianist would help sell bad food so hed hired her for tuesday nights subject only to sporadic preemption by dimitris soninlaws balalaika orchestra with her day job at the firm and this gig taylor had found a type of harmony in her life music was her pure sensual love her paralegal job gave her the pleasures of intellect organization function she sometimes felt like those men with two wives who know nothing of the other maybe someday shed get nailed but so far the secret was safe a half hour later taylor was doing the bridge to anything goes when the front door swung open with its familiar d to bflat squeak the woman who entered was in her midtwenties with a round sweet bigsister face framed by hair pulled back in a ponytail she wore a sweater decorated with reindeer black ski pants and on her petite outturned feet topsiders she smiled nervously and waved broadly to taylor then stopped suddenly afraid of disrupting the show taylor nodded back and finished the tune then she announced a break and sat down carrie thanks for coming the young girls eyes sparkled you are so good i didnt know you were a musician where did you study like juilliard taylor sipped her seagrams and soda juilliard try mrs cuikovas a famous music school freddy bigelow went there and bunny grundel i never heard of them nobody has we were all in the same grade school wed go to frau cuikovas in glen cove every tuesday and thursday at four to be abused about arpeggios and finger position several men in the audience were restless about to make their moves so taylor did the lech maneuver positioning her chair with her back to them and turned her whole attention to carrie taylor had spent the day looking through documents on the new amsterdam bank v hanover stiver case collecting the names of everyone whod worked on it partners associates and all the paralegals typists messengers and other support staff but the case had been in the works for months and the cast of characters at hubbard white whod been involved totaled nearly thirty people she needed to narrow down the suspects and to get the key entry logs and the time sheets as reece had suggested but to do this shed found you needed to be a registered user and to have a pass code carrie mason a friend of hers at the firm was the paralegal who oversaw the billing and time recording system and so taylor had asked the girl to meet her here after work taylor now looked at the girls coach attaché case youve got what i asked for i feel like a you know spy the girl joked though uneasily she opened the briefcase and pulled out stacks of computer papers i wouldnt have asked if it werent important are these the door key logs yeah taylor sat forward and examined the papers on top was a copy of the computer key entry ledger for the firms front and back doors like many wall street firms hubbard white had installed computer security locks that were activated with id cards to enter the firm you had to slide the card through a reader which sent the information to the central computer to leave or to open the door for someone outside you had only to hit a button inside the firm taylor read through the information noting whod used their keys to get into the firm on saturday and sunday morning there were fifteen people whod entered on saturday two on sunday wherere the time sheet reports more documents appeared on the table it was on these time sheets that lawyers recorded in exasperating detail exactly how they spent each minute at the firm which clients they worked for and what tasks theyd performed when they took personal time during office hours when they worked on business for the firm that was unrelated to clients taylor looked through papers and crosschecking the owner of the key code with the hours billed learned that fourteen of the fifteen whod checked in on saturday morning had billed no more than six hours which meant they would have left by four or five in the afternoon a typical pattern for those working weekends get the work done early then play on saturday night the one lawyer whod remained was mitchell reece flipping to the sunday key entries she saw that reece had returned as hed told her later that morning at but there was an entry before that well before it in fact someone had entered the firm at am but the only lawyer for whom there were time sheet entries was reece why on earth would somebody come into the firm that late and not do any work maybe to open the door for a thief who would steal a gazilliondollar note she flipped through the key assignment file and found that the person whod entered at had been thomas sebastian sebastian taylor tried to picture him but couldnt form an image so many of the young associates looked alike what do you know about him carrie rolled her eyes gag me hes a total party animal goes out every night dates a different girl every week sometimes two if you want to call it a date we went out once and he couldnt keep his hands to himself is he at the firm now tonight when i left maybe a half hour ago he was still working but hell probably be going out later around ten or eleven i think he goes to clubs every night you know where he hangs out theres a club called the space taylor said sure ive been there she then asked did you bring copies of the time sheet summaries from the new amsterdam v hanover stiver case carrie slid a thick wad of xerox copies to taylor who thumbed through them these would show how much time each person spent on the case those more familiar with the case taylor was figuring would be more likely to have been the ones approached by hanover to steal the note of the list of thirty people whod been involved though only a few had spent significant time on it burdick and reece primarily man taylor whispered look at the hours mitchell worked fifteen hours in one day sixteen hours fourteen on a sunday he even billed ten hours on thanksgiving thats why i love being a corporate paralegal carrie said sounding as if she devoutly meant it you do trial work you can kiss personal time so long look at this taylor frowned tapping the paralegals column on the case roster linda davidoff carrie stared silently at her frothy drink then she said i didnt go to her funeral were you there yes i was many people at the firm had attended the suicide of the pretty shy paralegal last fall had stunned everyone in the firm though such deaths werent unheard of the subject wasnt talked about much in wall street law circles but paralegals who worked for big firms were under a lot of pressure not only at their jobs but at home as well many of them were urged by their parents or peers to get into good law schools when they in fact had no particular interest in or aptitude for the law there were many breakdowns and more than a few suicide attempts i didnt know her too good carrie said she was kind of a mystery a faint laugh like you in a way i didnt know you were a musician linda was a poet you know that i think i remember something from the eulogy taylor said absently eyes scanning the time sheets look in september linda stopped working on the case and sean lillick took over for her as paralegal sean hes a strange boy i think hes a musician too or a standup comic i dont know hes skinny and wears weird clothes has his hair all spiked up i like him though i flirted with him some but he never asked me out you ask me mitchells cuter carrie played with the pearls around her neck and her voice flattened to a gossipy hush i heard you were with him all day taylor didnt glance up with who she asked casually but felt her heart gallop mitchell reece she laughed howd you hear that just the rumor around the paralegal pen some of the girls were jealous theyre dying to work for him who the hell had noticed them she wondered she hadnt seen a soul outside his office when she entered or left i just met with him for a few minutes is all mitchells hot the girl said is he taylor replied i didnt take his temperature nodding at the papers can i keep them sure theyre copies can i get any of this information myself not if its in the computer you need to be approved to go online and have a pass code and everything but the raw time sheets before theyre entered anybody can look at theyre in the file room organized by the attorney assigned as lead on the case or deal the other stuff just tell one of the girls what you want and theyll get it for you uhm taylor can you like tell me whats going on she lowered her voice and looked gravely into the eyes of the young woman there was a mega mixup on the new amsterdam bill i dont know what happened but the clients totally pissed it was kind of embarrassing with all the merger talks going on and everything mitchell wanted me to get to the bottom of it on the q t i wont say a word taylor put the rest of the papers into her attaché case ms satin touch dimitri called from behind the bar in a singsongy voice brother taylor grimaced gotta go pay the rent she said and climbed back under dimitris homemade spotlights a trickle of fear ran through her as she began to play who else had seen mitchell and her together taylor suddenly gave a brief laugh as she realized the title of the tune she found herself playing selected by some subconscious hiccup the song was someone to watch over me hey the young man shouted over the music cascading from the clubs milliondecibel sound system im sorry im late are you still speaking to me the blond woman glanced at the chubby man what she called i cant believe i kept you waiting she looked over his smooth babyfatted skin the newscasters perfect hair the gray suit wing tips cartier watch he examined her right back red angular dress paisley black stockings black hat and veil small tits he noticed but a lot of skin was exposed what she shouted again though shed heard his words he knew she had i got held up he explained hands clasped together in prayer i cant really go into it its an unpleasant story these were lines he used a lot in clubs like this cute lines silly lines as soon as the women realized that theyd never seen him before and that he was hitting on them in a major way they usually rolled their eyes and said fuck off but sometimes just sometimes they didnt this one said nothing yet she was taking her time she watched him sending out morse code with something in his hand tapping it against the bar absently while he smiled his flirts toward her tap tap tap i thought for sure you wouldve left wouldve served me right keeping a beautiful woman waiting said this young man with a slight swell of double chin and a belly testing his triplers inch alligator belt the process of scoring in a place like this was of course like negotiating you had to play a role act be somebody else tap tap tap the club was an old warehouse sitting on a commercial street in downtown manhattan deserted except for the cluster of supplicants crowding around the ponytailed baggyjacketed doorman who selected those who might enter with a grudging flick of a finger thom sebastian was never denied entrance tap tap tap true mostly the women roll their eyes and tell him to fuck off but sometimes they did what she was doing now looking down at the telegraph key a large vial of coke and saying hi im veronica he reacted to the gift of her name like a shark tasting blood in the water he moved in fast sitting next to her shaking her hand for a lengthy moment thom he said the sound systems speakers as tall as the sixfootsix bluegowned transvestite dancing in front of them sent fluttering bass waves into their faces and chests the smell was a pungent mix of cigarette smoke and a gassy ozonelike scent from the fake fog tap tap tap he offered his boyish grin while she rambled on about careers she sold something in some store somewhere but wanted to get into something else sebastian nodded and murmured singleword encouragements and mentally tumbled forward caught in the soft avalanche of anticipation he saw the evening unfold before him theyd hit the john duck into a stall and do a fast line or two of coke no nookie yet nor would he expect any after that theyd leave and go over to megs where he was a regular then out for pasta after that when it was pushing am hed ask her with mock trepidation if she ever went north of fourteenth street a carservice lincoln up to his apartment your condom or mine and later after a val or lude to come down theyd sleep up at eightthirty the next morning share the shower take turns with the hair dryer give her a kiss shed cab it home hed down some speed and head to hubbard white willis for another day of lawyering tap tap tap hey thom said interrupting her as she was saying something how about but there was a disturbance another incarnation of veronica appeared a young woman walking toward them different clothes but the same high cheeks pale flesh laces silks a flea markets worth of costume jewelry floral perfume they were interchangeable these two women clones they bussed cheeks behind veronica ii stood a pair of quiet preoccupied young japanese men dressed in black hair greased and spiked high like porcupine quills one wore a medal studded with rhinestones sebastian suddenly detested them not because of the impending kidnapping of his new love but for no reason he could figure out he wanted to lean forward and ask the young man if hed won the medal at iwo jima veronica nodded to her other half lifted her eyebrows at sebastian with regret and a smile that belied it and disappeared into the mist tap tap tap quo vadis veronica sebastian whispered pronouncing the vs like ws the way his latin professor had instructed he turned back to the bar and noticed that somebody had taken veronicas space someone who was the exact opposite of her homey pretty dressed conservatively but stylishly in black she was vaguely familiar he mustve seen her here before the woman ordered a rum and coke gave a laugh to herself she was hardly his type but sebastian couldnt help raise an eyebrow at the laugh she noticed and said in response that woman over there shes decided im her soul mate i dont know what she wants but i dont think its healthy instinctively he glanced where the woman was nodding and studied the gold lame dress the stiletto heels he said well the good news is its not a woman what truly but the bad news is that im betting what he has in mind is still pretty perverse maybe i better head for the hills she said naw hang out here ill protect you you can cheer me up my true love just left me the true love you just met four minutes ago the woman asked that true love ah you witnessed that did you she added mine just stood me up i wont go so far as to say true love he was a blind date his mind raced yes she was familiar she now squinted at him as if she recognized him too where did he know her from here the harvard club piping rock he wondered if hed slept with her and if he had whether hed enjoyed it shit had he called her the next day she was saying i couldnt believe it the bouncer wasnt going to let me in it took all my political pull political a portrait of alexander hamilton she slung out the words and sebastian thought he heard something akin to mockery in her voice as if he wasnt quick enough to catch the punch line gotcha sebastian said feeling defensive this drink sucks the coke tastes moldy now he felt offended too taking this as a criticism of the club which was one of his homes away from home he sipped his own drink and felt uncharacteristically out of control veronica was easier to handle he wondered how to get back in the drivers seat look i know i know you youre taylor lockwood they shook hands thom sebastian right she said understanding dawning in his eyes with this his mind made the connection hubbard white corporate paralegal hey you ever fraternize with us folks only if we blow this joint lets go theres nothing happening here the tall goldclad transvestite had begun a striptease in front of them while ten feet away tina turner and calvin klein paused to watch there isnt taylor asked sebastian smiled took her hand and led her through the crowd chapter six the drapery man was having a busy night he pushed a canvas cart ahead of him filled with his props draperies that needed to be cleaned but never would be they were piled atop one another and the one on top was folded carefully it hid his icepick weapon resting near to hand this man had been in many different offices at all hours of the day and night insurance companies with rows of ghastly gray desks bathed in green fluorescence ceos offices that were like the finest comp suites in vegas casinos hotels and art galleries even some government office buildings but hubbard white willis was unique at first hed been impressed with the elegant place but now pushing the cart through quiet corridors he felt belittled he sensed contempt for people like him sensed it from the walls themselves here he was nothing his neck prickled as he walked past a dark portrait of some old man from the s he wanted to pull out his pick and slash the canvas the drapery mans face was a map of vessels burst in fistfights on the streets and in the various prisons hed been incarcerated in and his muscles were dense as a bulls he was a professional of course but part of him was hoping one of these scrawny prick lawyers hunched over stacks of books in the offices he passed no glances no nods no smiles well fuck you and your mother hoping one of them would walk up to him and demand to see a pass or permit so he could shank them through the lung but they all remained oblivious to him an underling not even worth noticing glancing around to make sure no one was approaching he stepped into the coffee room on the main floor and took a dusty container of coffeemate from the back of a storage shelf in thirty seconds hed slid out the tape recorder removed the cassette put in a new one and replaced the unit in the canister he knew it was safe in this particular container because hed observed that the prissy lawyers here insisted on real milk halfandhalf or percent and wouldnt think of drinking or serving their clients anything artificial the coffeemate tube had been here untouched for months making sure the corridor was empty again the drapery man walked across the hall to mitchell recces office and listening carefully for footsteps checked the receiver of recces phone on saturday night when hed been here to steal the promissory note hed placed in the handset of the phone unit an ashika electronics omnidirectional ambientfiltering microphone and transmitter the device was roughly the size of a susan b anthony silver dollar it was however considerably more popular and was used by every security private eye or industrial espionage outfit that could afford the eightthousanddollar price tag this bug broadcast a razorclear transmission of all of reeces conversations on the phone or with anyone else in the office to the radio receiver and tape recorder in the coffeemate container across the hall one feature of the transmitter was that it contained a frequencycanceling feature which made it virtually invisible to most commercial bugdetecting sweepers checked the battery and found it was still good when he was finished he spent another three or four minutes arranging the drapes so they looked nice this was after all his purported job he peeled off the gloves and walked out into the halls which greeted him once again with their silence and their real or imagined disdain i suffer from the fallacy of the beautiful woman the lincoln town car limo crashed through the meatpacking district in the western part of greenwich village near the river taylor leaned sideways to hear thom sebastian over the crackly sound of the talk show on the drivers am radio he continued which is this that because a woman is attractive she can do no wrong you think christ the way she lights a cigarette is the right way the restaurants she picks are the right restaurants the way she fakes an orgasm pardon my french is the right way so i must be doing something wrong for instance were now on our way to megs the club you know it absolutely no idea there my point exactly im thinking jesus im doing something wrong taylor is a primo woman but she doesnt know about this club ive fucked up ive got it wrong taylor smirked does this usually work sebastian paused then slouched back in the cab seat and lit a cigarette what that line the one youre using on me now sebastian waited a few more seconds and mustve decided thered be no recovery from her busting him youd be surprised at some of the lines ive gotten away with he laughed the thing is women suffer from the fallacy of the man who knows what hes doing we never do of course he gave her what might pass for a sincere glance and said i like you they pulled up in front of nothing a row of warehouses and small factories not a streetlight in sight only the distant aurora borealis of industrial jersey across the hudson river welcome to my main club here yep im here six seven nights a week sebastian led them through an unguarded unmarked door into what looked like a victorian bordello the walls were covered with dark tapestry the tables were marble and brass oak columns and sideboards were draped with tooling and floral chintz tiffanyesque lamps were everywhere the uniform for men was tuxedo or italian suits for the women dark closefitting dresses with necklines that required pure willpower to keep nipples hidden the rooms were chockablock with highlevel celebs and politicos the sort that regularly make new york magazine and liz smiths columns sebastian whispered the three little piggies and pointed out a trio of hip young novelists whom a times critic had just vivisected en masse in an article called id as art the care and feeding of selfindulgence skinny women hovered around the threesome sebastian eyed the women with dismay and said why are they wasting time with those dudes didnt they see the article taylor said dryly you assume they can read and bumped into richard gere he glanced at her with a polite acknowledgment apologized and continued on oh my god she gasped staring at the mans broad back hes here yes sebastian said bored and so are we the music wasnt as loud as at the previous club and the pace was less frantic sebastian waved to some people whatre you drinking he asked stick with r c they sipped their drinks for a few minutes sebastian leaned over again and asked whats your biggest passion after handsome men like me i mean skiing i guess taylor was circumspect about telling people her second career the music and was particularly reluctant to give a robbery suspect too much information about herself skiing sliding down a mountain getting wet and cold and breaking bones is that it breaking bones is optional i did some exercise once sebastian said shaking his head i got over it im okay now she laughed and studied him in the mirror the lawyer didnt look good his eyes were puffy and red he blew his nose often and his posture was terrible the coke and whatever other drugs he was doing were taking their toll he seemed deflated as he hunched over his drink sucking his cocktail through the thin brown straw suddenly he straightened slipped his arm around her shoulders and kissed her hair does anyone ever get lost in there she kept the smile on her face but didnt lean into him she said evenly its true that i had date failure tonight but i still do things the oldfashioned way real slow she eased away and looked at him just want the ground rules understood he left his arm where it was for a noncommittal ten seconds then dropped it fair enough he said with a tone that suggested all rights reserved you go out a lot she asked work hard and play hard by the time i burn out at fortyfive his voice faded and he was looking at her expectantly tap tap tap she saw his hand swinging against the bar a brown vial you want to retire to the facilities with me build strong bodies twelve ways not me i have to keep in shape for breaking bones he blinked surprised yeah you sure never touch the stuff he laughed then put the bottle away just then another man appeared from the crowd and walked up to sebastian though his attention seemed fixed on taylor he resembled sebastian some but was thinner shorter a few years younger he wore a conservative gray suit but bright red sunglasses from which a green cord hooked to the earpieces dangled down the back of his neck she noted sebastians surprise when the young man approached sebastian said hey taylor meet my main man bosk hey bosk taylor they shook hands will you marry me bosk asked her in a slurred voice hed had a great deal to drink and she knew that beneath the silly elton john sunglasses his eyes would be unfocused oh gosh she answered brightly i cant tonight story of my life he turned back to sebastian hey you never fucking called me back weve gotta talk he called and wanted to know where bosk suddenly fell silent and as taylor reached for her drink she observed in the mirror behind the bar two very subtle gestures by sebastian a nod toward her and a wag of his finger whose only possible meaning was that the topic bosk was raising was not to be discussed in front of her bosk recovered though not very well by saying what it is ive still got some room on that new jersey project if youre interested how leveraged bosk said well need to come up with probably six five no fucking way sebastian laughed sea bass come on three eight was the top dumbo im not going over three eight these figures might have referred to percentages or shares of stock or money in which case considering that the context was new york metro area business or real estate they might be talking about hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars and alice thought wonderland was topsyturvy dont be such a fucking wuss bosk muttered drunkenly studying taylor sebastian grinned and grabbed bosk swung him into a neck lock then rapped him on the head bosk broke away and shouted laughing youre a fucking cow chip you know that he replaced his gaudy sunglasses hey you want to come out to long island for dinner on friday my motherll be out with her cook bunch of the gang brittany said she like forgives you for not calling an electronic pocket calendar appeared in sebastians pudgy hand he studied it can do dude he said at last they slapped palms and bosk vanished primo guy sebastian said hes a lawyer among other things we go way back were doing some projects together projects as vague a euphemism as there was like real estate taylor asked yeah but she heard a lie in his voice taylor turned back to her drink id like to do some investing but i got one problem no money whys that a problem sebastian said frowning genuinely perplexed you never use your own money use somebody elses its the only way to invest hubbard white lets you work on your own dont you have to clear it with somebody sebastian laughed a sharp exhalation of bitterness that surprised her we arent on such good terms lately messrs hubbard white and willis and myself he apparently decided to drop the fastlane image deflated he sighed and muttered they passed me over for partner his lips tightened into a bleak smile and she got what she thought was her first real look at thom sebastian im sorry taylor knew that this would have been a devastating blow to him partnership was the golden ring young associates strived for they worked sixty or seventy hours a week for years for the chance to be asked to join the firm as one of the partners the owners taylor on the trail of a thief after all sensed he might be revealing a motive to lift the promissory note revenge and wanted him to keep talking she said mustve been tough after they told me i tried to convince myself i didnt really want to be partner i mean christ you can make more money at real estate or investment banking i said fuck it who needs them its just a bunch of old men well thats what i told myself but damn i wanted it bad ive worked all my professional life to get my name on the letterhead of hubbard white willis and this is what they do to me did they tell you why his pale jaw round with fat trembled bullshit i mean finances was what they said effecting economies if i may quote but that wasnt the reason he turned to her and said see i dont fit the hubbard white mold whats the mold ha thats the catch they cant tell you they just know whether youve got it or not and that prick clayton didnt think i had it wendall clayton what did he have to do with it im not one of his chosen few most of the partnership slots this year got filled with his boys and girls look at that asshole randy simms she had a vague memory of a young squarejawed blond partner randy simms iii sebastian spat out the third he mused bitterly but hey hes gotta be the end of that family line though im sure the guy doesnt have a dick but claytons not even on the executive committee taylor said he laughed what difference does that make hes got ten times more power than burdick or stanley think hes going to ramrod the merger through the merger she said thats just a rumor its been going around for months sebastian looked at her and detected no irony he snorted just a rumor you think that then you dont know wendall clayton two months from now you wont be able to recognize our firm his voice dwindled i should say your firm aint mine no more whatre you going to do he was about to say something but grew cautious she could sense he was selecting his words carefully oh ill get a new job probably go inhouse become chief general counsel for a client thats what happens to most senior associates after they cut your balls off okay taylor told herself go for it then whyre you working so hard she asked if i got passed over i sure wouldnt be working holiday weekends a brief hesitation weekends he asked yeah you were in the firm on sunday morning werent you he took a long sip of his drink then said me no i was here all night i left about three when they were getting ready to close she frownedthats funny i was doing some billing for who was it i dont remember anyway i saw your key card number you came in real early on sunday he looked at her for a long moment his face was completely blank but she sensed that his thoughts were grinding hard and fast then he nodded in understanding ralph dudley he said angrily dudley the old partner yeah grandpa yesterday he dropped my key off in my office he said i left it in the library and hed picked it up by mistake on friday he mustve used it on sunday she couldnt tell whether to believe him or not agitated at this news sebastian fished in his pocket and found the little vial he held it up you sure she shook her head and he looked toward the mens room excusezmoi after he disappeared taylor motioned the bartender over to her and said you working last saturday night he normally didnt get questions like this he polished glasses but finally he said yeah was thom in here from one to three or so on sunday morning i dont remember she slid two twenties toward him furtively he blinked this only happened in movies and the man seemed to be considering how his favorite actor would handle it the bills disappeared into tight black jeans no he left around one without a girl that never happens if hes by himself usually he closes the place hes even slept here a couple times when sebastian returned he took taylor s purse and slipped it around her over one shoulder and under the other arm the way paranoid tourists do come on im wound im flying like a bird i gotta dance but he pulled her onto the small floor after fifteen minutes her hair was down streaming in thick sweaty tangles her toes were on fire her calves ached sebastian kept jerking away in time to the reggae beat eyes closed lost in the catharsis of the motion and music and the coke taylor collapsed on his shoulder enough i thought you were a skier exhausted she was gasping his brow arched and the surprise in his eyes was genuine but we havent eaten yet taylor said its one a m ive been up for nearly twentyfour hours time for penne but come on one plate of darling little squigglies of pasta in alfredo sauce with cilantro and basil one teeny endive salad one bottle of mersault taylor was weakening belgium endive then he lowered his head okay sebastian the negotiator was now speaking hows this for a deal we have dinner and you can tell me about the pine breath inn in vermont or wherever the hell it is you ski and well call it a night or i can take you home now and youll have to fight off my frontal assault at your door few women have been able to resist thom i take no prisoners she lowered her head on his shoulder then straightened up smiling does this place have spaghetti and meat balls with thick red sauce a la ragu ill never be able to show my face there again but if you want it ill force the chef to make it she sighed took his arm and together they made their way toward the door chapter seven the alarm clock wailed like a smoke detector taylor lockwood opened one eye was this the worst headache of her life she wondered she lay still for five minutes while the votes rolled in yes no sitting up decided the contest a clear victory for the pain she slammed her palm down on the alarm then scooted gingerly to the edge of the bed she still wore her panty hose and bra the elastic bands had cut deep purple lines into her skin and she was momentarily concerned that shed have permanent discolorations oh man i feel lousy taylor s onebedroom apartment was small and dark it was located in the fifth avenue hotel a dark gothic building distinguished only by the prestige of the street it was located on and its reputation for being the place that new york s judge crater was supposedly on his way to when he disappeared seventy years before still an open case on the nypd books her parents had offered to send her whatever furniture she wanted from their eightbedroom house in chevy chase or from one of their summer homes but taylor had wanted this apartment to be exclusively hers it was furnished postcollegiate conrans crate barrel pottery barn a lot of fake stone formica black and white plastic a huge pillow sofa canvas chairs that looked at straight on seemed to be grinning a number of interesting pieces from the twentysixth street flea market on sixth avenue the bedroom was the homiest room in the place decorated with lace tulle art deco lamps and old furniture battered but loaded with personality a hundred books souvenirs from the trips young taylor took to europe with her parents on the wall was a large poster one of arthur rackhams sepia illustrations of lewis carrolls alices adventures in wonderland the picture wasnt like the disney cartoon or the original sir john tenniel drawings but was a masterful work by the brilliant artist it showed an alarmed alice lifting her hands to protect herself as the red queens playing card soldiers flew into the air the caption read at this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying down upon her the framed poster had been a graduation present from her roommates at dartmouth taylor loved the carroll books and alice memorabilia were sure bets as birthday and christmas presents there were many other wonderland and through the lookingglass artifacts throughout her apartment taylor sent her tongue around her parched mouth she didnt enjoy the trip she staggered into the bathroom where she downed two glasses of water and brushed her teeth twice she squinted at the clock lets see sebastian had dropped her off at about four do the math okay were talking about three and a half hours sleep and more troubling it turned out that shed largely wasted her time thom sebastian had denied being in the firm on saturday or sunday and had remained tightlipped about his dealings with bosk though hed continued to talk bitterly about the firms decision to pass him over hed had no response when shed casually mentioned hanover stiver inc she kneaded her belly which swelled slightly over the top of her panties recalling that there were a hundred fifty calories in each cocktail she squeezed her temples her vision swam a blinking red light across the room coincided with the throbbing in her head it was her answering machine indicating a message from last night she hit the play button thinking it might be a call from mitchell reece remembering his asking her if it was okay to call her at home beep hello counselor ah her father she realized with a thud in her turbulent stomach just wanted to tell you you owe me lunch earl warren was chief justice when the case was decided call when you can love you click shit she thought i shouldntve bet with him taylor didnt mind losing to him of course half the lawyers in washington d c had lost a case or motion or argument to samuel lockwood at one time or another in their careers the washington post had called him the unbeatable legal eagle the article was framed and displayed prominently in their living room at home no it was that even though she could see clearly that he was testing her shed weakened and agreed to the pointless bet it was very very difficult to say no to samuel lockwood he called her two or three times a week but unless he had something specific to ask her he usually picked safe times during the day hed call her home at night hed call the firm leaving messages fulfilling his parental duty and making his royal presence felt in her territory but making sure he didnt waste time actually talking to her she noted cynically that she might reasonably have been expected to be home last night when hed phoned because the purpose of that call had been to gloat well she could hardly point fingers taylor did the same generally calling home when she knew he was working so she could chat with her mother untroubled by the brooding presence of her father hovering near the receiver a presence she could sense from even three hundred miles away she winced as the headache pounded on her again just for the pure fun of it it seemed a glance at the clock okay alice you got twenty minutes to get yourself up and running go for it sitting before mitchell reece in the glaringly lit vista hotel dining room was a plate of scrambled eggs hash browns bacon and a bagel taylor was nursing a grapefruit juice and seltzer shed already been stared down by her dry toast reece said you feeling okay i was out dancing last night till four all work and no play taylor grunted the good news is ive got us a suspect the juice was reviving traces of rum lurking in her bloodstream this resuscitation was not pleasant thom sebastian she explained to him about crossreferencing the computer key entries and the time sheets brilliant he told her lifting an eyebrow she nodded noncommittally and downed two more advils sebastian reece pondered in the corporate group right hes done work for new amsterdam in the past he might evenve done some of the work on the original loan to hanover but whats his motive money revenge he was passed over for partner ouch sympathy crept into recces face which revealed the fatiguedulled skin and damp red eyes that taylor knew matched hers still his suit of textured charcoal wool was perfectly pressed and his shirt was as smooth and white as the starched napkin that lay across his lap his dark hair was combed back slick and smooth from either a recent shower or some lotion he sat comfortably upright at the table and ate hungrily taylor braved the toast again and managed to eat a small piece and he acted real odd about something hes got a quote project going on with somebody nicknamed bosk another lawyer here in town young kid but he wouldnt talk about it he also claims he was in a club on saturday but the bartender there said he wasnt he left about one i asked sebastian about it and he claims ralph dudley took his computer door key old man dudley working on sunday at onethirty no way past his bedtime reece then reconsidered funny though i heard dudley had money problems hes borrowed big against his partnership equity taylor said howd you find that out the individual partners financial situations were closely guarded secrets as if citing an immutable rule of physics reece said always know the successful partners from the losers ill check out dudley today i cant imagine he was in the firm on legitimate business dudley hasnt worked a weekend in his life but i also cant see him as our thief hes such a bumbler and hes got that granddaughter of his hes looking after i dont see how hed risk going to jail and leaving her alone she doesnt have any other family that cute little girl he brought to the outing last year shes about sixteen i heard that dudley s son abandoned her or something anyway shes in boarding school in town and he takes care of her he laughed kids i cant imagine them taylor asked you dont have any he grew wistful for a few seconds no i thought i would once the stoic lawyers facade returned immediately but my wife wasnt so inclined and after all it does take two you know when i hit thirtyeight im going to find a genetically acceptable man get pregnant and send him on his way you could always try marriage of course oh yeah ive heard about that he looked at her eyes for a moment then started laughing she asked what i was thinking we should start a group what the visine club he said i can get by with seven hours sleep less than that no way reece said fives pretty much standard for me he finished the bacon and held a forkful of eggs toward her she smiled fought down the nausea and shook her head she noticed behind the bar a stack of wine bottles and felt her stomach twist reece ate some of his breakfast and asked where you from burbs of d c chevy chase in maryland well i was born on long island but my parents moved to maryland when i was in middle school my father got a job in the district oh i read that article in the post about him last month his argument before the supreme court tell me about it she grumbled ive heard the blowbyblow a halfdozen times he overnighted me a copy of his argument for my leisuretime reading i guess so howd you end up on wall street reece asked very long story she said with a tone that told him that this was not the time or place to share it school dartmouth music and poly sci music i play piano jazz mostly this seemed to intrigue him he asked who do you listen to billy taylors my fave i guess but theres something about the fifties and sixties cal tjader desmond brubeck reece shook his head im mostly into horn dexter gordon javon jackson no kidding she said surprised usually only jazzophiles knew these players i love jabbo smith he nodded at this sure sure im also a big burrell ian she nodded guitar i still like wes montgomery ive got to admit for a while i was into a howard roberts phase reece said too avantgarde for me oh yeah i hear you she said a melody thats what musics got to have a tune people can hum a movies got to have a story a piece of musics got to have a tune thats my philosophy of life you perform sometimes right now my big push is to get a record contract i just dropped a bundle making a demo of some of my own tunes i rented a studio hired union backup the works sent them to about a hundred companies yeah he seemed excited give me a copy if you think about it you have any extra she laughed dozens even after i give them away as christmas presents this year hows the response been next question she asked sighing ive sent out ninetysix tapes agents record companies producers so far ive gotten eightyfour rejections but i did get one maybe from a big label theyre going to present it to their a r committee ill keep my fingers crossed thanks so he asked hows the music jibe with the law school track oh i can handle them both she said without really thinking about her response she wondered if the comment came off as pompous he glanced at his watch and taylor felt the gesture abruptly push aside the personal turn their conversation had taken she asked there is one thing i wanted to ask you about linda davidoff worked on the hanover r stiver case right linda the paralegal yeah for a few months when the case got started it struck me as a little curious that she quit working on the case pretty suddenly then she killed herself he nodded thats odd yeah i never thought about it i didnt know her very well she was a good paralegal but real quiet it doesnt seem likely shed be involved reece said but if you asked me it if was likely somebodyd steal a note from a law firm id say no way the waitress asked if they wanted anything else they shook their heads you women always dieting reece said nodding at her uneaten toast taylor smiled thinking we women always trying not to throw up in front of our bosses whats up next he asked time to be a spy she said taylor sat in her cubicle at the firm and dialed a number she let the telephone ring when the system shifted the call over to voice mail she hung up left her desk and wandered down the halls up a flight of stairs she turned down a corridor that led past the lunchroom then past the forms room where copies of prototype contracts and pleadings were filed at the end of this corridor in the law firms siberia was a single office on the door was a nameplate r dudley most of these plates in the firm were plastic this one though it designated the smallest partners office in hubbard white was made of polished brass inside the office were crammed an italian renaissance desk a tall bookcase two shabby leather chairs dozens of prints of nineteenthcentury sailing ships and eighteenthcentury foxhunting scenes through a small window you could see a brick wall and a tiny sliver of new york harbor on the desk rested a large brass ashtray a picture of an unsmiling pretty teenage girl a dozen metropolitan opera playbills a date book and one law book a supreme court reporter taylor lockwood opened the reporter and bent over it her eyes though camouflaged by her fallen hair were not reading the twin columns of type but rather ralph dudleys scuffed leather date book opened to the present week she noticed the letters ws penned into the box for late saturday evening or early sunday morning just before the time dudley if sebastian was right had used the associates key to get into the firm the initials ws were also she observed written in the pm slot for tomorrow who was this person a contact at hanover the professional thief taylor then opened the calendar to the phone numberaddress section there was no one listed with those initials she should can i help you a mans voice snapped taylor forced herself not to jump she kept her finger on the reporter to mark her spot and looked up slowly a young man she didnt recognize stood in the doorway blond scrubbed chubby and peeved ralph had this reporter checked out from the library she said nodding at the book i needed to look up a case taking the offensive she asked bluntly whore you me im todd stanton i work for mr dudley he squinted who are you taylor lockwood a paralegal she forced indignation into her voice a paralegal his tone said oh well that doesnt really count does mr dudley know youre here no if you need anything you can ask me for it mr dudley doesnt like he sought the least disparaging term anyone in his office when hes not here ah taylor said and then turned back to the book and slowly finished reading a long paragraph stanton shifted then said with irritation excuse me but taylor closed the book softly hey she said offering a concerned glance dont sweat it youre excused and walked past him back into the deserted corridor chapter eight dactyloscopy the man said repeat after me dactyloscopy taylor did more or less good the man said now you know the first thing about fingerprinting its called dactyloscopy the second is that it is a royal pain in the butt she sat in the office of john silbert hemming his card explained that he was a vice president in the corporate security department at manhattan allied security inc the man in his midthirties had been recommended by a friend from the music world who did word processing for allied security to support his addiction to the saxophone taylor had spent most of the day at hubbard white poring over records of the new amsterdam bank v hanover stiver case trying to find a reference to anyone who might have shown unusual interest in the promissory note or whod requested files on the deal when there didnt seem to be a reason for them to do so but after nearly eight hours of mindnumbing legal babble taylor found not a shred of evidence to suggest that ralph dudley or thom sebastian or anyone else was the thief shed decided to give up on the subtle approach and try a more traditional tack a la kojak or rockford files hence the tall shamus she was now sitting across from when hemming had come to meet her in the reception area shed blinked and looked up he was six feet ten his height had led he had explained on their way back to his office to his becoming a backroom security man the company technical and forensic expert youve got to be unobtrusive in private detective work a lot of what we do is surveillance you know she said tailing pardon dont you say tailing you know like you tail somebody hmmm no we say surveillance oh if you stand out like me thats not so good when we recruit we have a space on our evaluation form is subject unobtrusive we mean boring his hair was tawny and unruly and taylor s impression of hemming was that he was a huge little boy he had eyes that seemed perpetually amused and that belied a face that was dramatically long what else could it be given that it sat atop a body like his despite this quirky appearance there was something rather appealing about him now john silbert hemming was aiming a startingly long finger at her and saying i hope you mean that about wanting to know everything because theres a lot and here it comes lets start with what are fingerprints uh i know you paid the money ive got the answers but i like people to participate i like interaction times up no idea id suggest you avoid jeopardy now fingerprints are the impressions left by the papillary ridges of the fingers and thumb primarily in perspiration also called friction ridges there are no sebaceous glands in the fingertips themselves but people sometimes leave fingerprints in human oils picked up elsewhere on the body yes in answer to the first mostoftenasked question they are all different even more different than snowflakes i can say safely because for hundreds of years people have been collecting fingerprints from all over the world and comparing them and nobody none of my close friends ill tell you have been doing that with snowflakes go ahead ask the nextmostpopular question uh do animals have fingerprints primates do but who cares we dont give apes government clearances or put them on the tenmostwanted list thats not the question the question is twins twins and the answer is that twins quadruplets duodeceplets they all have different fingerprints now who first discovered fingerprints i have a feeling youre going to tell me guess scotland yard taylor offered prehistoric tribes in france were aware of fingerprints and used them as cave decorations in the sixteen and seventeen hundreds they were used as graphic designs and trademarks the first attempt to study them seriously was in dr j e purkinje an anatomy professor came up with a crude classification system fingerprints became sexy in the late s sir francis galton who was a preeminent scholar in the field of he cocked his eyebrows at taylor daily double dactyloscopy nice try but no in the field of heredity he established that all fingerprints are different and they never change throughout ones life the british government appointed edward richard henry to a commission to consider using fingerprints to identify criminals by around the turn of the century henry had created the basic classification system they use in most countries his system is called coincidentally the henry system new york was the first state to start fingerprinting all prisoners around while she found this fascinating the urgency of the hanover case kept prodding her when he came up for air she asked if one were going to look for fingerprints how would one do it one he asked coyly you no just one well it depends on the surface you excuse me one should wear cloth gloves not latex if the surface is lightcolored one would use a carbonbased dark powder on dark one would use an aluminumandchalk mixture its light gray one would dust on the powder with a very soft longbristle brush then one removes the excess how flip a coin the detective said one blows it off a lot of rookies think that but you tend to spit and ruin the whole print no use a brush now powders only work on smooth surfaces if youve got to take a print from paper there are different techniques if the prints oily maybe itll show up in iodine vapor the problem is that you have to expose it in an enclosed cabinet and take a picture of the print very quickly because the vapors evaporate right away sometimes latents come out with a nitrate solution or ninhydrin or superglue but thats the big league probably over your ones skill level now once one has the print he or a nod toward her she has to capture it you lift it off the surface with special tape or else take a picture of it remember fingerprints are evidence they have to get into the courtroom and in front of an expert witness now she said just speaking theoretically could someone like me take fingerprints if you practiced sure but could you testify that prints a and b were the same no way could you even tell if they were the same or different not easy mama not at all they squoosh out they move they splot they look different when theyre the same they look identical except for some little significant difference you miss no it isnt easy fingerprinting is an art how bout a machine or something a computer the police use them sure the fbi but not private citizens say ms lockwood taylor she prompted perhaps if you told me exactly what your problem is i could offer some specific solutions its somewhat sensitive it always is thats why companies like us exist best to keep mum for the time being understood just let me know if youd like another lesson though i do recommend keeping in mind the experts he grew serious and the charming banter vanished should the matter become lets say more than sensitive a lot of our people here have carry permits carry theyre licensed to carry weapons oh she said in a soft voice just something to think about thanks john then she said i do have one question the hand in which a basketball would look so at home rose and a finger pointed skyward allow me to deduce the inquiry is where you can get a dick tracy fingerprint kit before she answered yes he was writing an address on the back of his business card its a police equipment supply house you can buy anything but weapons and shields there shields badges you know those you can buy one can buy in times square arcades for about ten bucks but youre not supposed to oh not to be forward but i did happen to write my home phone number on the back of the card in case any questions occur to you after hours say she decided she liked this guy thiss been fascinating john thank you she stood and he escorted her toward the elevator pointing out a glass case containing a collection of blackjacks and saps oh and miss lockwood taylor yes before you leave i was just wondering would you like to hear the lecture i give to our new employees on the laws against breaking and entering and invading privacy taylor said no i dont believe i would shell be moody today ralph dudley sat in his creaky office chair the nape of his neck eased into the tall leather back and he stared at the thin slice of sky next to the brick wall outside his window gray sky gray water november yes junie would be in one of her moods it was a talent this intuition of his whereas donald burdick to whom he constantly obsessively compared himself was brilliant ralph dudley was intuitive he charmed clients he told them jokes appropriate to their age gender and background he listened sympathetically to their tales of sorrow at infidelities and deaths and to their stones of joy at grandchildrens births he told war stones of his courtroom victories with a dramatic pacing that only fiction which they were of course permits with his patented vestigial bow dudley could charm the daylights out of the wives of clients and potential clients he had sense and feeling while burdick had reason and logic and sure enough he was now right here came fifteenyearold junie a sour look on her face trooping sullenly into his office ignoring the woman from the word processing pool who was handling a typing job for him the girl stopped in the doorway a hipcocked stance unsmiling come on in honey dudley said im almost finished she wore a jumper white blouse and white stockings a large blue bow was in her hair she gave him a formal kiss on the cheek and plopped into one of his visitors chairs swinging her legs over the side sit like a lady now she waited a defiant thirty seconds then slipped on her walkman headset and swiveled slowly in the chair planting her feet on the limegreen carpet dudley laughed he picked up the handle of his dictating machine look ive got one too a recorder she looked perplexed and he realized she couldnt hear what he was saying and would probably have thought his joke was idiotic if shed been able to but dudley had learned not to be hurt by the girls behavior and he unemotionally proceeded to dictate a memo that gave the gist of some rules of law he believed he remembered at the end of the tape he included instructions to todd stanton his associate at the firm who would rewrite the memo and look up the law dudley hoped existed to support his points ralph dudley knew they sometimes laughed at him the young associates here he never raised his voice he never criticized he was solicitous toward them he supposed the young men dudley had never quite come to terms with the idea of women lawyers held him in all the more contempt for this obsequiousness there were a few loyal boys like todd but on the whole no one had much time for old man dudley grandpa hed heard that the associates called him partners too although somewhat more subtly joined in the derision yet though this treatment soiled his days here and obliterated whatever loyalty he had once felt for hubbard white willis he was not overly troubled his relation with the firm became just what his marriage to emma had been one of respectful acknowledgment he was usually able to keep his bitterness contained junies eyes were closed her patentleather shoes swaying in time to the music my god she was growing up fifteen it gave him a pang of sorrow at times he had flashes poses she struck the way the light might catch her face of her as a woman in her twenties he knew that she abandoned in adolescence earned the seeds of adulthood within her more fertilely than other children and he often felt she was growing up far too fast for him he handed the dictated tape to the typist who left so he said to the girl are we going to do some shopping i guess that question she heard perfectly dudley observed well lets go she shrugged and hopped off the chair tugging at her dress in irritation which meant she wanted to be wearing jeans and a tshirt clothes that she loved and that he hated they were at the elevator when a womans voice asked ralph excuse me you have a minute he recognized the young woman from around the firm but couldnt recall a name it stung him slightly that she had the effrontery to call him by his first name but because he was a gentlemen he did nothing other than smile and nod yes youre taylor lockwood sure of course this is my granddaughter junie junie say hello to miss lockwood shes a lawyer here paralegal actually taylor smiled and said to the girl pleasantly you look like alice huh alicein wonderland its one of my favorite books the girl shrugged and returned to the oblivion of her music dudley wondered what this woman wanted had he given her some work an assignment id like to ask you something whats that you went to yale law school didnt you thats right i did im thinking of applying there dudley felt a bit of alarm he hadnt quite graduated despite what hed told the firm and so couldnt exactly send a letter of recommendation for her but she added my application and letters and everythingre in i just want to know a little about the school im trying to decide between there and harvard and nyu relieved dudley said oh i went there before you were born i dont think anything id have to tell you would be much help well somebody here said you helped them decide to go to law school that you were very helpful i was sort of hoping you could spare a half hour or so dudley felt the pleasure he always did at even minor adulation like this tonight she said i was thinking tomorrow night maybe after work i could take you out to dinner a woman taking a man out to dinner dudley was nearly offended the paralegal added unless you have plans he did of course plans he wouldnt miss but that was at pm he said im busy later in the evening but how would seven be a charming smile ill take you to my club junie of the selective hearing said like poppie you told me they didnt let women in there dudley said to her thats only as members honey to taylor he said come by tomorrow at six well take a cab uptown then calculating the taxi fare he added no actually a subway would be better that time of day traffic is terrible now hes going after the clients donald burdick knotted the silk tie carefully with his long fingers he liked the feel of good cloth the way it yielded yet was tough tonight though the smooth texture gave him little pleasure first he rams through the accelerated vote and now i hear hes targeting the clients the clients vera burdick repeated nodding we shouldve thought of that she sat at her dressing table in the bedroom of their park avenue coop rubbing prescription retina cream on her neck she wore a red and black silk dress which revealed pale freckled skin along the unzipped v in the back she was leaning forward studiously watching the cream disappear a resolute woman in her early sixties shed battled age by making tactical concessions she gave up tanning fifteen years ago and carefully gained a little weight refusing to join in the dieting obsession of many of her friends who were now knobby scarecrows she let her hair go white but she kept it shiny with italian conditioner and wore it pulled back in the same style as her granddaughter shed allowed herself one facelift and had flown to los angeles to have a particular beverly hills surgeon perform the operation she was now as shed always been attractive reserved stubborn quiet and virtually as powerful as the two men whod influenced her life her father and donald burdick her husband of thirtytwo years arguably she was more powerful in some ways than each of these men because people were always on guard with the masters of wall street like donald burdick but tended to get careless around women and be too chatty to give away secrets to reveal weaknesses burdick sat on the bed his wife offered her back and he carefully zipped up the dress and hooked the top eyele the partner continued claytons moving against them its pretty clever i have to admit while bill stanley and lamar and ive been taking on as much debt as we can to poison the merger wendalls been spending time with the clients trying to convince them to pressure the partners at the firm to support the merger vera too felt admiration for what wendall was doing although a firms clients have no official vote in firm affairs they ultimately pay the bills and accordingly can exert astonishing influence over which way the partners vote shed often said that if clients unionized against law firms it would be time for her husband to find a new line of work hows he doing it she asked curious to learn his technique probably promising big discounts in legal fees if they support the merger those that still dont go along with him my clients or bills the ones who wont support the merger in any case were afraid hes going to sabotage sabotage oh my whats the vote so far its closer than it should be youve got the longterm lease with rothstem right vera asked that should slow him up some when are you signing it friday or the weekend he answered glumly not till then she winced i know he said the fastest they could get the papers together but its okay clayton doesnt know anything about it then ive been talking to steve nordstrom at mcmillan holdings vera recalled your biggest client steves the chief financial officer right a nod im closer to him than i am to ed gliddick the ceo im going to get them to lobby some of the other partners against the merger and stevell agree im sure he will gliddicks in charge but he listens to steve wendall doesnt know about that either ive been excruciatingly discreet i burdick realized that he sounded desperate and hated the tone of his voice then he glanced at his wife who was gazing at him with a savvy smile on her face we can do it she said claytons not in our league dear neither was that cobra on vacation last year that doesnt mean hes not dangerous but look what happened to it hiking in africa burdick had accidentally stepped on the snake in the brush it had puffed out its hood and prepared to strike vera had taken its head off with a swipe of a sharp machete burdick found his teeth clenched wendall just doesnt understand what wall street law practice is hes crude he bullies he has affairs irrelevant she began on her makeup oh i think it is relevant im talking about the survival of the firm wendall doesnt have vision he doesnt understand what hubbard white is what it should be and how do you define should be touché burdick thought he grinned involuntarily all right what ive made it bill and lamar and i wendall wants to turn the firm into a mill into a big mergerandacquisition house every generation has its own specialties thats very profitable work she set down the blush im not justifying him darling im only saying we should stay focused we cant make logical arguments against the nature of the legal work he wants the new firm to handle we have to remember that the risk is that as part of the merger hes going to burn the firm to the ground and then sow the ashes with salt thats why we have to stop him she was as usual right he reached for her hand but the phone rang and he walked to the nightstand to answer it burdick took the call and listened in dismay as bill stanleys gruff voice delivered the message he hung up and looked at his wife who stared at him clearly alarmed by his drawn expression hes done it again clayton burdick sighed and nodded he walked to the window and gazed outside into the trim windswept courtyard theres a problem with the st agnes case donald burdicks oldest and secondmostlucrative client was manhattan s st agnes hospital it had recently been sued for malpractice and fred ladue a litigation partner was handling the trial which was in its fourth day now the case was routine and it was likely that the hospital was going to win stanley had just reported however that the plaintiffs attorneys from a tough midtown personal injury firm had found a new witness a doctor whose testimony could be devastating to st agnes even though he was a surprise witness the judge was going to let him testify tomorrow the judgment could be for tens of millions and a loss this big might mean that st agnes which was selfinsured would fire hubbard white willis altogether even if the hospital didnt do so though the credibility of burdick and his litigation department would be seriously eroded and the hospital might push to support the merger john perellis firm was renowned for its brutal handling of personal injury defense work damn burdick muttered damn veras eyes narrowed you dont think that wendall slipped your clients files to the other side do you it did occur to me vera took a sip of scotch and set the waterford glass down on the table burdicks eyes were distant trying to process this news his wifes however had coalesced into dark dots one thing id say darling the wind rattled the leadedglass windows burdick glanced at the sound she said with a man like wendall we have to hit him hard the first time we wont have a second chance burdicks eyes dropped to the pakistani carpet on the bedroom floor then he picked up the phone and called the night operator at the law firm this is donald burdick he said politely please locate mitchell reece and have him call me at home tell him its urgent chapter nine taylor lockwood walked through the breezy evening streets of the east village the curbs banked with trash and thought of a funeral shed attended several months earlier shed sat in the front pew of the church in scarsdale north of the city a woodandstone building built someone behind her had whispered by contributions from tycoons like j p morgan and vanderbilt although taylor had been in black that color did not seem to be requisite at funerals any longer any somber shade was acceptable purple forest green even duskbrown tapestry she sat on the hard pew and watched the family members lost in their personal rituals of grief tears running in halting streams hands squeezing hands fingers rubbing obsessively against fingers the minister had spoken of linda davidoff with genuine sorrow and familiarity he knew the parents better than the daughter that was clear but he was eulogizing well most attendees had seemed sad or bewildered but not everyone had cried suicide makes for an ambivalent mourning the minister had closed the service with one of lindas poems one published in her college literary magazine as hed read images of linda had returned and the tears that taylor lockwood had told herself not to cry appeared fast stinging the corners of her eyes and running with maddening tickles down her cheeks even though she hadnt known the paralegal very well then the organ had played a solemn cue and the mourners had filed outside for the drive to the internment as shed told reece nothing that shed found suggested that linda davidoff had had any connection with hanover stiver or the loan deal but there was something suspicious to taylor about the way the girl had worked such long hours on the case then stopped abruptly and then committed suicide she felt she needed to follow up on this question alice after all had wandered everywhere throughout wonderland a place however in which you sure wouldnt find the disgusting sixstory tenement she now stood in front of in the foul entry foyer the intercom had been stolen and the front door was open swinging in the breeze like a batwing door in a ghost town saloon she started up the filthy steps it may look impressive but the bank owns most of it sean lillick said the young paralegal was sitting on the drafty floor shirtless and shoeless shoving a backpack under the bed as she walked in taylor lockwood catching her breath from the climb was surveying what lillick was referring to a wall of keyboards wires boxes a computer terminal speakers guitar amps easily fifty thousand dollars worth of musical equipment lillick thin darkhaired about twentyfour was smelling socks discarding them he wore black jeans a sleeveless tshirt his boots sat in front of him the only clue as to his day job at hubbard white willis were two dark suits and three white shirts in various stages of recycling hanging on nails pounded crookedly into the wall he studied her for a moment you look impressed or confused i cant tell your place is a little more alternative than i expected the apartment was a patchwork someone had nailed pieces of plywood plastic or sheet metal over cracks and holes joints didnt meet plaster was rotting floorboards were cracked or missing in the living room one hanging bare bulb one floor lamp one daybed one desk and a ton of bankowned musical instruments and gear have a seat she looked helplessly about her oh well try the daybed hey taylor listen to this i just thought it up im going to use it in one of my pieces you know what a preppy is i give up a yuppie with papers she smiled politely he didnt seem concerned about the tepid response and wrote the line down in a notebook so what do you do she asked standup comedy performance art i like to rearrange perceptions ah musically speaking she joked youre a rearranger he seemed to like her observation too and mentally stored it somewhere taylor walked over to a music keyboard lillick said youre thinking organ i know but im thinking yamaha dx synthesizer with a digital sampler midi and a linn sequencer that should store about a hundred sequences in ram you mind he laughed and waved his hand she sat on a broken stool and clicked on the yamaha she ran through aint misbehavin lillick said this machine cannot deal with music like that i think its having a breakdown what do you play she asked him postmodern postnew wave what i do is integrate music and my show i call myself a sound painter is that obnoxious taylor thought it was but just smiled and read through some of his lead sheets in addition to standard musical notation they included drawings of pans and hammers lightbulbs bells a pistol when i started composing i was a serialist and then i moved to minimalism now im exploring nonmusical elements like choreography and performance art some sound sculpture too i love what philip glass does only im less thematic laurie anderson that sort of thing i believe there should be a lot of randomness in art dont you think she shook her head recalling what shed told reece that morning how she believed music should stay close to melodies that resonated within peoples hearts she said youre talking to ms mainstream sean and shut off the system she asked got a beer oh sure help yourself ill take one too while youre at it she popped them and handed him one he asked you perform you wouldnt approve piano bars they serve a valuable function irritated by his too hip and too righteous attitude taylor asked are you being condescending no i mean it i like classics too lillick was up hobbling on one boot to his rows of records and cds and tapes charlie parker i got every bird record ever made here listen he put on an lp which sounded scratchy and authentic man that was the life lillick said you get up late practice a bit hang out play sax till three watch the sunrise with your buddies taylor lost in one of birds solos mused man died young thirtyfive lillick said world lost a lot of music maybe it wouldnt have been so you know deep so righteous if hed lived longer taylor said maybe just the opposite hooked on smacks gotta affect you he nodded at his record collection which did contain a lot of mainstream jazz see im not a snob we need people like that if you dont have rules and traditions theres nothing to break if it aint broke dont fix it taylor thought but she wasnt here to debate the philosophy of music with him lillick retrieved a fat joint and lit it up he passed it toward taylor she shook her head and examining the musical armada of equipment asked whatre you doing at a law firm youre so into artsyfartsy steady salary what else the way i look at it hubbard white willis is supporting the arts he seemed uneasy as if the conversation was going down paths he didnt want to tread he suddenly pulled out a pad of music staff paper and a pencil keep talking i work best when im only using half my mind she asked what i came to ask you about you took over for linda davidoff on the hanover stiver case right yeah what do you know about her lillick looked at his cracked plaster walls for a moment and wrote a measure of music she sensed he was performing for her playing the distracted artist linda davidoff she repeated after a moment he looked up sorry linda well we went out a few times i thought she was more interesting than most of the prep princesses you see around the firm she wanted to be a writer it didnt go very far between us whyd she stop working on the hanover case silent for a moment lillick thought back im not sure i think she was sick sick what was wrong with her i dont know i remember she didnt look good she was pale taylor recalled yeah exactly i saw her filling out insurance forms a couple of times i asked her about it but she didnt tell me anything do you know why she killed herself taylor asked no but ill tell you i wasnt wildly amazed she did she was too sensitive you know she took things too much to heart i dont know what she was doing working for a law firm lillick erased and rewrote a line he hummed it give me a bflat diminished taylor turned on the dx and hit the chord thanks he wrote some more musical notations whered she live i dont know in the village somewhere i think whats up why re you so interested in linda screwup with the new amsterdam bill going way back they were majorly underbilled and im supposed to check out what happened when you took over for her did she say anything about the case lillick shook his head taylor asked youre still billing time on the case arent you some but mitchells handling most of it himself lillick didnt seem to have any reaction to her questions anybody she was close to her roommate danny stuart hes an editor or something lives in the west village over on greenwich street i think he rummaged in a stack of papers ive got the number somewhere he handed it to her hey back in a flash he ducked into the john which gave taylor the chance shed been waiting for she dropped to her knees and found the backpack that lillick had been stashing when shed entered it had seemed to her that hed hidden it just a little too quickly when she walked inside a fast unzip revealed cash a lot of it taylor had only ten seconds for a fast estimate but figured the total would probably be something on the order of thirty or forty thousand dollars an amount equal to his yearly salary at the firm which didnt of course pay in greenbacks and a regular of the downtown performing circuit herself taylor knew that to quote her father there was no way in satans backyard that anyone would ever make any kind of serious money playing music in bars which meant that no sean the bank didnt own most of your equipment shed come here only for information but had found another suspect taylor shoved the bag back a few seconds before the young man returned better roll she said thanks for the beer you like goat what im thinking of going over to this place on fourteenth the goats the best in the city its a totally happening place the thought of another night partying was more than she could handle besides she had a mission back at the firm not tonight hey this place is mondo cool bowie hangs out there its so packed you can hardly get in and they play industrial out of one set of speakers and the sex pistols out of the other i mean in the same room like at a thousand decibels kills me to say no sean but ill take a pass wendall clayton liked the firm at night he liked the silence the jeweled dots of boat lights in new york harbor liked taking a mouthful of cigar smoke and holding it against his palate free from the critical glances his secretary and some of the more reckless younger lawyers shot his way when he lit up a macanudo in the firm this afterhours atmosphere took him back to his days just after law school when hed spend many of his nights proofreading the hundreds of documents that make up typical business deals loan agreements guarantees security agreements crosscollateralization documents certificates of government filings corporate documents and board resolutions proofreading and carefully watching the partners he was working for oh hed learned the law yes because in order to be good a lawyer must have a flawless command of the law but to be a great lawyer that requires much more it requires mastering the arts of demeanor tactics leadership extortion anger and even flirtation sabotage too he now looked over statements by a witness in a case that hubbard white was currently defending on behalf of one of donald burdicks prize clients st agnes hospital in manhattan sean lillick and randy simms claytons head of the ss had dug up the identity of a doctor who had firsthand knowledge of the hospital malpractice st agnes was allegedly guilty of clayton had slipped the identity of this man to the plaintiff in effect scuttling the case against his firms own client this troubled him some of course but as he read through the witnesss statements and realized that the st agnes doctors had indeed committed terrible malpractice he concluded that his sabotage was in fact loyalty to a higher authority than the client or the firm loyalty to abstract justice herself he rolled these thoughts around in his complex mind for a few minutes and reached this conclusion that he could live with st agnes hospitals extremely expensive loss in the trial he hid these documents away and then opened another sealed envelope sean lillick had dropped it off just before hed left for the night he read the memo the paralegal had written him claytons money was being well spent he decided lillick had apparently aristocratized the right people or begged them or fucked them or whatever in any case the information was as valuable as it was alarming burdick was taking an extreme measure the firms lease for its present office space in wall street would be up next year this expiration had been a plus for claytons merger because it meant that the firm could move to perellis midtown office which was much cheaper without a difficult and expensive buyout of an existing lease the purpose of the secret talks lillick had learned about between burdick stanley and harry rothstem the head of the partnership that owned the building was to negotiate a new extremely expensive longterm lease for the existing office space by entering the lease the firm would take on a huge financial commitment that would cost millions to buy its way out of this would make hubbard white a much less attractive target for a merger the full partnership didnt need to approve the lease only the executive committee which burdicks side controlled the lease agreement lillick had learned wouldnt be signed until this weekend son of a bitch he raged well hed have to stop the deal somehow he put lillicks memo away and began thinking about defensive measures if burdick learned what clayton was up to particularly with the st agnes case and the lease he and his bitchy wife would strike back hard clayton began to worry about loose ends he picked up the phone and called lillick the boys cheerful voice drooped when he realized who the caller was that information was helpful this was one of claytons highest forms of compliments helpful like i mean im glad im a little concerned though sean you are being careful arent you the boy hesitated and clayton wondered if there was anything more to his uneasiness than a phone call from his boss of course im aware of people asking questions around the firm sean anybody been asking you questions uh no you are making sure you cover tracks being a good boy scout or nature guide or something yeah im not stupid wendall no of course youre not just make sure everythings covered up carefully no way to trace what you and ive been up to you know legal defense fees can be so expensive they can eat up all ones savings in a flash the boys silence told him that the threat had been received clayton looked up into the doorway where a young woman stood at attention better go sean be in early tomorrow snip any ends okay sure the partner hung up his eyes on the woman she was one of the night stenographers from the word processing department her name was carmen and she was slim and had a complexion like a weekold tan she wore tight blouses and dark skirts that would be too short for the day but on the evening shift the dress code was more relaxed i got your call mr clayton you need some dictation clayton looked at her legs then her breasts yes i do carmen had a fiveyearold son fathered by a man who was currently in prison she lived with her mother in the bronx she had a patch of stretch marks on her lower belly and a tattoo of a rose on her left buttock why dont you close the door he said we dont want the cleaning staff to disturb us she waited until hed taken his wallet from his suit jacket pocket and opened it up before she swung the door shut and locked it chapter ten it was nearly pm but for some reason the closing of a corporate merger that had begun at that afternoon ran into difficulties and was not yet completed some delay in japanese regulatory approvals the hubbard white willis lawyers and paralegals working on the case clutching stacks of documents scurried back and forth between the several conference rooms devoted to the closing like ants stealing bread crumbs from a picnic though with considerably more content faces than their insect counterparts presumably because ants dont make a collective per hour for carting around bits of soggy food the clients on the other hand the payers of those legal fees were nothing but frustrated back from her trip to lillicks apartment taylor lockwood had learned many intimate details about the closing because shed been dodging the lawyers and clients for the past hour like the clients in the delayed deal taylor had her own frustrations john silbert hemming had neglected to tell her that dactyloscopy powder didnt come off shed just finished fingerprinting reeces burglarized file cabinet and painstakingly transferring the sticky tape of the two dozen latents shed found to cards she thought back to what hemmingd told her yes hed mentioned the different kinds of powders hed mentioned how to spread it around and how to brush not blow the excess away but he hadnt told her the stuff was like dry ink once you once one dusted it onto the surface the damn stuff didnt wipe off the smear just got bigger and bigger she wasnt concerned about the file cabinet that had contained the note she was concerned about mitchell reeces coffee mug emblazoned with worlds greatest lawyer which shed dusted to get samples of his prints to eliminate those from the ones she lifted off his cabinet fingerprinting powder coated the mug like epoxy paint she did her best to clean it then noticed shed gotten some on her blouse she pinched the midriff of the shirt and fluffed the poor garment to see if that would dislodge the powder no effect she tried to blow it away and as her tall private eye had warned spit into the smear which immediately ran the powder into the cloth permanently she suspected taylor sighed and pulled on her suit jacket to cover the smudge she hurried down to ralph dudleys office where she lifted samples of his fingerprints then on to thom sebastians where she did the same finally back in the paralegal pens she took samples of sean lillicks prints from several objects in his cubicle then back in her own cubicle she put the fingerprint cards in an envelope and hid it under a stack of papers in the bottom drawer of her desk she found the phone number that lillick had given her danny stuart linda davidoffs roommate and called him he wasnt in but she left a message asking if they could meet there was something about linda she wanted to ask him about she hung up and then happened to look down at her desktop and with a twist in her gut noticed the managing attorneys daily memo in the square for tuesday of next week were these words new amsterdam bank trust v hanover stiver jury trial ten am no continuance as she stared there was suddenly a huge explosion behind her taylor spun around inhaling a scream her eyes met those of a young man in a white shirt he was standing in the hall staring back at her he held a bottle of french champagne hed just opened hey sorry he said then smiled we just closed we finally got bank of tokyo approval im happy for you she said and snagged her coat then started down the hallway as he turned his groggy attention to opening more bottles and setting them on a silver tray the drapery man watched her pull her overcoat on and step into the lobby the door swinging shut behind her he patiently waited a half hour just in case shed forgotten anything and when she didnt return he walked slowly down the corridor to taylor lockwoods cubicle pushing the drapery cart in front of him his hand near his icepick weapon upstairs the firm was bustling like midmorning some big fucking business deal going on dozens of lawyers and assistants ignoring him but down here the place was dark and empty he paused in the lockwood womans cubicle checked the hallways again and dropped to his knees in two minutes hed fitted the transmitting microphone like the one he planted in mitchell recces phone into hers the drapery man finished the job tested the device ran a sweep to make sure it wasnt detectable and walked to the entranceway of the paralegal cubicles nearby was a conference room in which he saw a halfdozen open bottles of champagne sitting on a silver tray when he touched one with the back of his hand he found it was still cold he glanced behind him pulled on his gloves and lifted the first bottle to his mouth he took a sip then ran his tongue around the lip of the bottle he did the same with the others then feeling the faint buzz from the dry wine and a huge sense of satisfaction he returned to the hallway and started pushing his cart toward the back door never take a job sean lillick said pensively holding the door open where you have to hold things in your teeth carrie mason standing in the door of his shabby east village walkup blinked never what she asked entering thats a line from a piece im working on right now im like a performance artist this ones about careers i call it w blues like your w form the tax thing its spoken over music never take a job that pained she said i dont think i get it theres nothing to get he explained a little irritated its more of a social comment you know than a joke its about how were defined in terms of what we do for a living you know like the first thing lawyers say when you meet them is what they do for a living the point is we should be human beings first and then have a career she nodded so when you just said you were a performance artist that was like being ironic now he blinked then even more irritated he nodded yeah exactly ironic he examined her from the corner of his eye the girl was hardly his type although on the whole lillick preferred women to men hed had his share of both since he came to new york from des moines five years ago the sort of women he wanted to fuck were willowy quiet beautiful and passed cold judgment on anyone they bothered to glance at carrie mason didnt come close to meeting his specifications for one thing she was fat well okay not fat but round round in a way that needed pleated skirts and billowy blouses to make her look good for another she was polite and laughed a lot which was evidence that she would rarely pass moody judgments on anyone at all lillick also suspected she blushed frequently and he couldnt see himself getting involved with anybody who blushed you know she said after a moment tailors hold pins and things in their teeth fashion designers too and carpenters hold nails when theyre building houses that was true he hadnt thought of that and her comment made him even angrier with her i meant more like you know maybe holding bits of tape or tools or something then he added quickly the point is like just to make people think about things well it does make you think she conceded lillick took her coat you want a beer she was studying the keyboards and computers sure have a seat she ran her hand over the tiedye bedspread and glanced at her fingers to make sure the coloring didnt come off excuse me your royal highness she sat down he opened a pabst and handed it to her thinking only after he did that he probably should have poured it into a glass but to take it back and find a clean mug would now seem stupid i was surprised when you called sean yeah lillick punched on a meredith monk tape ive been meaning to you know you work with somebody and you think im going to call her up yadda yadda yadda but you get caught up in things thats sure true anyway i was thinking of going over to this place for goat but he stopped speaking fast thinking what the hell would his buddies from the east village say if they saw him at carlos with a fat preppy princess but he didnt need to worry carrie wrinkled her nose at the food goat maybe he said well find someplace else whatta you like burgers and fries and salads usual stuff you know i usually hang out at the bars on third avenue theyre fun you know sing along when irish eyes are smiling god in heaven save me you want me to carrie began huh well i was going to say if you want me to iron your shirt im like way good at that sort of thing the garment was a tan shirt printed with tiny brown scenes of european landmarks it was one of his favorites and the cloth was wrinkled as a prune he laughed you iron this poor thing itd curl up and die carrie said i like ironing its therapeutic like washing dishes in his five years in manhattan hed never ironed a single piece of clothing he did do the dishes occasionally outside a mans scream cut through the night then another followed by a long moan carrie looked up alarmed lillick laughed its just a hooker theres a guy turns tricks across the air shaft hes a howler he pointed to a machine thats a digital sampler its a computer that records a sound and lets you play it back through your synthesizer on any note you want carrie looked at the device lillick continued i recorded the screaming one night it was totally the best he laughed i performed a piece from bachs welltempered clavier only instead of the harpsichord sound its a gay hooker shouting deeper deeper she laughed hard then looked out the window toward the diminishing walls i dont get downtown as much as id like where do you live east eightyfourth ah i know she said blushing as hed predicted its not so cool but i kinda ended up there and ive got a threeyear lease so hows mexican he asked he glanced down at his shirt it wasnt that fucking wrinkled theres a place around the corner i call it the hacienda del hole kinda a dive but the foods good sure whatever then she suggested or we could just hang out here like maybe order pizza watch the tube carrie nodded at his dusty tv set i like cheers she said and mash lillick only watched tv to pick up on pop culture icons he could trash in his performance pieces he had to admit though he liked mash well and lucy reruns and gilligans island though not a soul in the universe knew that its kinda broken i mean the receptions pretty shitty he walked over to his yamaha keyboard and turned it on the amps sent a moan of anticipation through the warm air ill show you how the sampler works ill play something for you good id like to hear it hey got another beer he went to the fridge those were the last how bout wine sure he poured two large tumblers and handed one to her they tapped glasses she picked a piece of cork or lint or something out of hers and they both drank then she slipped off her white plastic headband and lay back on the bed she ran her hand over the middle part of the mattress whats this what this lump i dont know a pillowcase i think but carrie was frowning no its like weird you better check it out he stood up and sat on the bed next to her rummaged under the covers to find the lump it turned out to be not a pillowcase but a womans red highheel shoe howd that get there carrie laughed teasing i used it in one of my pieces uhhuh she said not believing him its true goddamn it he thought angrily im not a fucking transvestite she looked into his eyes and without even thinking about it he leaned forward and kissed her he tasted lipstick and the binaca shed sprayed into her mouth when he was busy pouring the wine then she lifted the red shoe away dropped it on the floor and directed his hand to her breasts this is weird carrie reached up and turned off the skewed floor lamp the only illumination in the room was from the display lights on the synthesizer weird he began to kiss her hard desperately and she kissed him right back she pulled off her jeans and sweater lillick stared at the huge breasts defined by the netlike cloth of her bra nipples dark circles he kissed her for a full minute weird lillick realized that hed left the recorder on the sampler running it would store every sound in the room for the next twenty minutes he supposed he should shut it off but in fact he didnt really want to get up besides he figured you never knew when you could use some good sound effects chapter eleven taylor wasnt sure when the idea occurred to her probably or am as she lay in bed listening to the sounds of the city she was in a halfwaking halfdreaming state in wonderland or on the far side of the looking glass shed been thinking about the evidence shed gathered a brief comparison of the prints on the safe with her suspects sebastian lillick and dudley wasnt conclusive but it was more likely than not that sebastian had left several prints on the safe but was there any way to verify that he or someone else had been in the firm that saturday night other than through the time sheets and key card entry logs sure she realized there was the thief mightve taken a cab or car service limo to the firm that late at night and he mightve just used his real name and employee number on the reimbursement or payment voucher and copiers too if hed been in the firm for some legitimate reason he mightve used a copier you had to use a special key with your number on it to activate the machine or she thought excited about these leads the thief might have logged onto one of the lexisnexis computers or used the phone every service or function within the firm that can be charged to a client plus a delightful percent markup for overhead is recorded in the firm computers she glanced at the clock am brother exhausted she rolled out of bed at least she didnt have a hangover and shed managed to change into boxers and a tshirt last night saving her skin from more stigmatas of victoria s secret lets go alice this is getting curiouser and curiouser at am exactly taylor was standing in the accounting department at hubbard white willis im doing a bill for mitchell reece she told the computer operator can you let me see the copier card taxi and car service voucher ledger phone records and lexisnexis logons for last saturday and sunday its not the end of the month the operator snapped her gum mitchell wants to give the client an estimate snap an estimate of disbursements it couldnt be more than a thousand bucks whod care if you dont mind taylor said sweetly please snap i guess the woman hunched over the keys and typed several lines she frowned and typed again taylor bent over the computer screen the screen was blank snap snap i dont know whats going on there s no taxi vouchers there always are on saturday taylor knew this very well the rule was if you had to work on saturday the firm paid for your taxi to and from your apartment or house alarmed taylor said how about the copiers the fingernails tapped the operator squinted tapped some more and stared at the screen well thiss damn funny nobody made any copies either you got it snap phones lexisnexis the clattering of keys nothing taylor asked you think the files were erased hold on a minute her fingers tapped as noisily as her popping gum snap snap the young woman looked up thats it erased mustve had a software hiccup or something the disbursement and incidental expense files for the past weekve been deleted taxis meals copiers even the phones all gone has that ever happened before nup never snap sean lillick stopped by carrie masons cubicle to say good morning to her he could tell immediately how pleased she was to see him comply with the famous morningafter rule they talked for a few minutes and then he said how much he wanted a cup of coffee and as hed expected she was on her feet immediately and asking him how do you want it black he answered because even though he liked a lot of sugar it was cooler to say black sure ill be right back you dont have to he started to say no problem she trotted off down the hallway which gave him the chance to put her computer room access card back into her purse thats whatd been so weird last night the fact that the sex had been initiated by her because the whole point of calling her up was to get her over to his place get her drunk seduce her and when she was dozing afterward steal her access card which would allow him to erase the telltale files of expenses like the taxi hed taken from the firm to the office of the plaintiffs lawyer in the st agnes case or the phone calls hed made about the new lease with rothstem after hed talked to wendall clayton earlier lillick had realized that he had been pretty careless and needed to as the partner had said snip some ends hence the grand seduction last night weird carrie now returned with the coffee and when she handed it to him their hands met and they looked into each others eyes for a moment it took perhaps two seconds for the guilt to prod him into looking away and he said quickly got a big project better run ill call you donald burdick believed that bringing ones first client into a law firm was the most significant milestone in the career of a wall street lawyer unlike graduation from law school unlike admission to the bar unlike being made partner all of which are significant but abstract stages in a lawyers life hooking a moneypaying client was what distinguished in his metaphor the nobility from the gentry many years ago burdick a young newly made partner at hubbard white willis had just finished the eighteenth hole at meadowbrook club on long island when one of the foursome turned to him and said say donald i hear good things about you legalwise im saying you interested in doing a little work for a hospital that had been on a sunday afternoon and two days later burdick had presented to the executive committee of the firm his first signed retainer agreement with the huge st agnes hospital complex in manhattan at ninethirty this morning donald burdick sat in his office with the chief executive officer of st agnes a tall middleaged mildspoken veteran of hospital administration also present were fred ladue the senior litigation partner handling the malpractice case against the hospital and mitchell reece three of these four appeared very unhappy though for different reasons burdick because of what hed learned last night that with the new witness st agnes would probably lose the malpractice trial which would make the hospital throw its support to clayton and the promerger crowd the ceo of course because his hospital now stood to lose millions of dollars lawyer ladue because burdick had summarily ordered that he stand down today and that a young associate mitchell reece take over the crossexamination of the new witness reece on the other hand was calm as a priest though it was clear the man hadnt had more than a few hours sleep hed been preparing virtually nonstop since burdick and ladue had briefed him last night around pm who is this guy the ceo asked the witness thats the problem he was working at st agnes when they brought the plaintiff in he didnt treat the patient himself but he was in the room the whole time one of our own people testifying against us the ceo was dumbfounded apparently he was a visiting professor from uc san diego cant we object i did ladue said plaintively judge overruled me the best he did was give us a chance to depose the witness before he goes on reece said ill do that in a half hour the guy goes on the stand at eleven how bad do you think his testimonys going to be the administrator asked from what the other sides lawyer said reece explained bluntly it could lose you the case burdick who realized he had been squeezing his teeth together with fierce pressure said well mitchell perhaps it isnt as hopeless as youre painting it reece shrugged i dont think its hopeless i never said its hopeless but the plaintiffs lawyersve upped their settlement offer to thirty million and theyre holding firm that means that this witness is the smoking gun ladue sat and stewed the doughy man was as pale as always though at this particular moment his waxen complexion was largely due to the fact that hed done a very clumsy job at the trial so far burdick played with a manicured thumbnail he was furious that clayton had probably spent thousands of dollars to trackdown this witness and had anonymously sent his name to the plaintiffs attorney what do you have in mind mitchell ladue asked howre you going to handle the cross reece looked up and started to answer but then burdicks secretary walked into the doorway mr reece your secretary said youve just got an important call you can take it in the conference room there thank you he said to her then glanced at his watch ill be busy for the rest of the morning gentlemen ill see you in court chapter twelve if she hadnt been initiated taylor lockwood would never have known she was watching a trial she saw a bored judge rocking back in his chair distracted lawyers she saw clerks walking around casually no one really concentrating on what was going on she saw dazed jurors and few spectators a half dozen or so retirees she guessed like the unshaven men who take trains out to belmont or aqueduct racetracks in the morning just for a place to spend their slow days shed found reece in the hall at the firm earlier and wanted to update him on what shed learned the fingerprints and the erased files but he was jogging from the library to his office two huge redweld folders under his arms he paused briefly to tell her that hed been called in to handle an emergency crossexamination and that he could see her at the courthouse on centre street later around noon taylor had decided to sit in on this portion of the trial and catch him in the hall afterward maybe they could have lunch she now looked around the courtroom in which marlow v st agnes hospital and health care center was being tried and located the plaintiff mr marlow sat in a wheelchair pale and unmoving unshaven his hair disheveled his wife was nearby with her hand resting on his arm taylors father a trial lawyer himself had instilled enough cynicism in his daughter to make her believe that while undoubtedly the man had suffered a serious injury the wheelchair might just be a prop and there was no need for him to be looking as destroyed as he did here the door opened and in walked a man she recognized from the firm it took her a moment to place the name randy simms either the iii or the iv she recalled that he was a protégé of wendall clayton he sat in the back row by himself putting away a cellular phone he put his hands in his lap and sat perfectly still perfectly upright she scanned the rest of the visitors and was surprised to find donald burdick himself in the gallery he too glanced at randy simms a faint frown on the old partners face finally papers were sorted out and the judge pulled off his glasses in a gruff voice he told the plaintiffs counsel that he could present his witness the lawyer rose and called to the stand a handsome grayhaired man in his midfifties he gazed pleasantly out at the jury under questioning from the plaintiffs counsel he began his testimony taylor lockwood worked primarily for corporate lawyers at hubbard white willis but she knew the basics of personal injury law this mans testimony was clearly devastating to st agnes dr william morses credentials were impeccable and unlike many expert witnesses who testify based only on what theyve read in reports long after the accident he was actually present at the hospital when the alleged malpractice occurred the jury members took in his comments and looked at each other with lifted eyebrows obviously impressed with the mans demeanor and by what he was saying lets reiterate what happened here the plaintiffs lawyer said in march of last year a doctor at st agnes treated a patient mr marlow there in the wheelchair the plaintiff in this case who was suffering from arthritis and adrenal insufficiency with seventy milligrams of cortisone acetate in conjunction with one hundred milligrams of indomethacin thats correct morse said did you observe him do this i saw the injection and then looked at the chart afterward and told him immediately the mistake hed make and why was that a mistake mr marlow had a preexisting ulcerous condition everyone knows that such a patient should absolutely not be treated with the drugs he was administered id object sir reece said politely the witness cant speak for quote everyone dr morse corrected the medical literature is quite clear that such a patient should not be treated with those particular drugs the plaintiffs lawyer continued what was this doctors reaction when you told him that he said that i was not on the staff i was a visiting physician and in effect i should mind my own business objection reece called again hearsay the plaintiffs lawyer said ill rephrase sir after you called attention to what you perceived as a dangerous condition did anyone take any steps to correct it no what happened then i told a nurse to monitor the patient carefully and that i thought he might have serious adverse reactions then i went to see the chief of staff that would be harold simpson yessir and what was his reaction dr simpson was not available i was told he was playing golf objection hearsay he was not available the witness corrected what happened then i returned to mr marlows ward to see how he was doing but he was unconscious comatose the nurse id left to monitor his condition was gone we stabilized his condition but he remained comatose would it have been possible when you called attention to the drugs that had been improperly prescribed to administer an antidote objection reece called hes suggesting that we poisoned the plaintiff you did dr morse snapped your honor reece asked a more neutral term counselor the judge said to the plaintiffs lawyer yessir dr morse would it have been possible to administer other drugs to counteract the damaging effects of the drugs that the st agnes staff doctor administered absolutely but it would have to be done immediately and what happened then that was my last day at the hospital i returned to california the next day and as soon as i arrived i called the hospital to check on the status of the patient i was told that hed come out of the coma but had suffered irreparable brain damage i left messages for the chief of staff the head of the procedures committee and the head of the department of internal medicine no one ever called me back no further questions a murmur from the peanut gallery at the deadly testimony taylor concurred with the apparent reaction she thought okay we just lost the case the judge rocked back in his chair and said mr reece crossexamination mitchell reece stood and in smooth motions buttoned his jacket straightened his paisley tie thank you your honor first of all he turned to the jury id like to introduce myself im mitch reece i work for hubbard white willis along with my friend and colleague fred ladue who i think you know and hes been gracious enough to let me visit with you for a few hours today he smiled creating a camaraderie with six men and women bored numb from days of medical testimony hunkered down behind two octogenarian trial buffs taylor watched him pace back and forth slowly reece said now sir you know im getting paid for asking you questions the witness blinked i reece laughed its not a question im just telling you that im getting paid to be here and i assume youre getting paid to testify but i dont think its fair to ask you how much youre getting if im not prepared to tell you how much im getting and im not lawyersre overpaid anyway laughter filled the room so well just let it go at the fact that were both professionals are we all together on that yessir good the plaintiffs lawyers grew wary at this one of the first ways crossexamining lawyers attack experts is to make them sound like mercenaries now doctor reece said let me ask you how often do you testify at medical malpractice cases like this one rarely how rare would that be the witness lifted his hand ive probably testified three or four times in my life only when i feel a terrible injustice has been done and reece held up his hand and still smiling said maybe if we could just stick to answering my questions please the jury will disregard the witnesss last sentence the judge mumbled so its safe to say that you spend most of your time practicing medicine not testifying against other doctors thats right thats so refreshing doctor i mean that its clear you care about your patients helping patients is the most important thing in the world to me i applaud that sir and i welcome your appearance here i mean that because these are very tricky technical matters that my friends on the jury and i have to wrestle with and cooperative witnesses like you can make the issues clearer the witness laughed i have had a bit of experience lets talk about that sir now you practice internal medicine correct thats correct youre boardcertified in internal medicine i am and you have occasion to administer various drugs oh yessir would you say you have great experience administering them i would say so sure those ways of administering them would include sublingual thats under the tongue right thats right reece continued and rectally as well as administering injected medicines like the sort that the plaintiff received thats true i dont want you to think im up to anything here sir youve testified that my client did something wrong in administering certain medicines and all i want to do is make it clear that your observations about what my client did are valid because of your expertise were all together on that all together yessir good taylor could see that the jury had brightened up something was happening reece was being nice to the witness shouldnt they be screaming at each other the jury was confused and because of that theyd started paying attention she noticed something else though she hadnt seen him change his appearance reeces jacket at some point had become unbuttoned and in lifting his hand to straighten his hair hed mussed it he looked boyish she thought of him suddenly as a young southern lawyer a hero in a john grisham book the witness too had relaxed he was less stiff less cautious taylor though thought that reece had gone too far with the goodoldboy approach the witness was looking good in the eyes of the jury the credibility of his testimony was improving by now she reflected her father wouldve cut the balls off this doctor and had him cowering on the stand reece said now let me quote from the record as best i can he squinted and recited in march of last year a doctor from st agnes treated a patient mr marlow there in the wheelchair the plaintiff who has arthritis and adrenal insufficiency with seventy milligrams of cortisone acetate in conjunction with one hundred milligrams of indomethacin thats right and you testified that you wouldnt have done that correct because of his preexisting ulcerous condition yes but ive looked through his charts theres no record of his having an ulcer the witness said i dont know what happened with the charts but he told the doctors he had an ulcer i was there i heard the exchange he was in the emergency room reece said generally a busy place a lot of doctors trying to cope with all kinds of problems ive been in them myself cut my thumb bad last year reece winced and smiled at the jury im a real klutz he told them then back to the doctor so will you agree that its possible that the person mr marlow told about his ulcer wasnt the person who administered the drugs that doesnt reece smiled please sir its possible but please just the question taylor saw that reece was preventing the witness from reminding the jury that it didnt matter who knew before the injection because dr morse had brought it to the staffs attention just after the injection when there was still time to correct it but the staff had ignored him its possible reece let this sit for a moment now dr morse theres been a lot of talk in this trial about what is and is not an accepted level of medical treatment right morse paused before answering as if trying to figure out where reece was going he looked at his own lawyer then answered some i suppose im thinking that if as you say you wouldntve treated the patient with these medications then i assume you feel that st agness treatment was below the standards of proper medical care certainly reece walked to a whiteboard in the corner of the courtroom near the jury and drew a thick line horizontally across it doctor lets say this is the standardofcare line all right sure reece drew a thin dotted line an inch below it would you say that the level of care st agnes provided in administering those drugs was this far below the standard level of care just a little bit below morse looked at his lawyer and was greeted with a shrug no it wasnt just a little bit below they almost killed the man well reece drew another line farther down this far i dont know another line this far below dr morse said in a solemn voice it was very far below reece drew another two lines then stopped writing he asked once you get below a certain level of the standard of care well howd you describe that another uncertain look at his lawyer then the witness answered id say id guess id say it was malpractice youd characterize st agness treatment of mr marlow reece said in a sympathetic voice as malpractice well yes i would a murmur of surprise from several people in the courtroom not only was reece befriending the witness but his crossexamination was having the effect of making the witness repeat over and over again that the hospital had made a mistake he had even gotten the witness to characterize the staffs behavior as malpractice a legal conclusion that no defense lawyer in the world would have accepted from a plaintiffs witness yet it had been reece himself who elicited this opinion what was going on here taylor glanced at burdick and saw him sitting forward clearly troubled a dozen rows behind him claytons representative randy simms sat immobile though with a slight smile on his face the judge looked at reece opposing counsel looked at reece i appreciate your candor doctor malpractice malpractice reece walked back to the table slowly letting the word sink into the jurys consciousness he stopped and then added brightly oh doctor if you dont mind i just have a few matters of clarification not at all reece said doctor where are you licensed to practice as i said before california new jersey and new york no other state no reece turned to look into morses eyes how about any other country country yessir reece said im just curious if youve ever been licensed to practice in any other country a hesitation then a smile no have you ever practiced medicine in another country i just said i wasnt licensed i caught that sir but what i just asked was practiced doctor not licensed have you ever practiced medicine anywhere outside of the united states the man swallowed a look of horror in his eyes ive done some volunteer work outside of the country yes thats right and would you be so kind as to tell us which country if that isnt too much trouble doctor mexico mexico reece repeated what were you doing in mexico i was getting a divorce i liked the country and i decided to stay for a while this was when eight years ago and you practiced medicine in mexico morse was looking at his fingertips yes for a while before i moved back to california i set up a practice in los angeles i found los angeles to be reece waved his hand im much more interested in mexico than los angeles doctor now why did you leave mexico dr morse took a sip of water his hands trembling the plaintiffs lawyers looked at each other even the poor plaintiff seemed to have sat up higher in his wheelchair and was frowning the divorce was final i wanted to move back to the states is that the only reason the witness lost his composure for a moment as a timelapse bloom of anger spread on his face finally he controlled it yes reece said did you run into some kind of trouble down in mexico trouble like the food he tried to laugh it didnt work and he cleared his throat again and swallowed doctor what is ketaject pause morse rubbed his eyes he muttered something louder please reece asked his own voice calm and utterly in control of himself the witness the universe the doctor repeated its the brand name of a drug whose generic name i dont recall could it be the brand name for ketamine hydrochloride the witness whispered yes and what does that do morse breathed deeply several times it is a general anesthetic his eyes were joined to recces by a current full of fear and hate and what is a general anesthetic doctor you know everybody knows tell us anyway please its a solution or gas that renders a patient unconscious doctor when you were in mexico did you have a patient a miss adelita corrones a seventeenyearold resident of nogales hands gripped together silence he wanted water but was afraid to reach for the glass doctor shall i repeat the question i dont recall well im sure she recalls you why dont you think back to the st teresa clinic in nogales think back seven years ago and try to recall if you had such a patient did you it was all a setup they set me up the locals the police and the judge blackmailed me i was innocent doctor reece continued please just respond to my questions his tie was loose his face was ruddy with excitement and even from the back of the courtroom taylor could see his eyes shining with lust on september seventeenth of that year pursuant to a procedure for the removal of a nevus that is a birthmark from miss corroness leg did you administer ketaject to her and then when you perceived her to be unconscious partially undress her fondle her breasts and genitals and masturbate until you reached a climax objection marlows lead lawyer was on his feet the judge said overruled no its a lie the witness cried reece returned to the counsel table and picked up a document your honor i move to introduce defense exhibit double g a certified copy of a complaint from the federal prosecutors office in nogales mexico he handed it to the judge and a copy to the plaintiffs counsel who read it grimaced and said in disgust let it in so admitted the judge intoned and looked back to the witness dr morses head was in his hands they set the whole thing up they blackmailed me i paid the fine and they said theyd seal the record well i guess its been unsealed reece responded now the report goes on to say that the reason miss corrones was aware you were molesting her was that you not only administered the wrong dosage of ketaject but that you injected it improperly so that most of the drug didnt even reach her bloodstream is this what the prosecutors report says i true or not true answer the question they set me is this what the report says sobbing the man said yes but wouldnt you say sir that you can hardly state my client is guilty of malpractice because of the improper administration of drugs when you cant even knock out a teenager enough to rape her objection withdrawn they set me up the witness said just to blackmail me they reece turned on him well then doctor did you at any time contact the law enforcement authorities in mexico city or in the united states to report that you were being blackmailed no he raged i paid them the extortion money and they said i could leave the country and theyd seal the record i you mean reece said you paid the fine for your punishment like any other criminal no further questions taylor found herself sitting forward on the edge of the pew she now saw recces brilliant tactic first hed gotten the jurys attention expecting petty bickering theyd seen reece befriend the witness surprising them and getting them to sit up and listen then he got the man to say the magic word that by rights reece or ladue or anyone on the st agnes legal team would try never even to allow into testimony let alone elicit themselves malpractice and then in a masterful stroke hed linked that characterization that one magic word to the witness s terrible behavior and completely destroyed his credibility taylor saw a gleam in recces face a flushing of the cheeks fists balled up in excitement reece turned he noticed donald burdick in the back of the courtroom the two men looked at each other neither smiled but burdick touched his forehead in a salute of respect taylor turned and looked at burdick then behind him finally randy simms showed some emotion his lips were tight and his eyes bored into the back of donald burdicks head he rose and stepped out of the courtroom which was utterly silent except for the sobbing of the witness chapter thirteen she stopped him in the hallway of the court reece smiled when he saw her howd i do how do you think id say you mopped up the floor with him well see reece continued what most lawyers dont realize is that crossexamination isnt about being an orator its about having information i called a private eye ive used out in san diego and he dug up the dirt on the guy cost me well cost st agnes fifty thousand but it saved them a lot more than that you enjoyed it didnt you handling the cross yep he hesitated a moment and finally spoke though whether it was what hed originally intended to say or not she couldnt tell i sometimes feel bad for them people like that witness when i tear apart their testimony but in this case it was easy he was a rapist you believe he did it what happened in mexico he considered i chose to believe he did something wrong its a mindset thing hard to explain but yes i believe it taylor reflected you could certainly argue that their client the hospital had done something wrong too destroying the plaintiffs life and she wasnt sure if the rape if it had actually occurred undermined the legitimacy of morses opinion about that she said nothing about any of this though and indeed she secretly envied reece his fervent view of right and wrong for her justice wasnt quite as clear as that it was a moving target like the birds shed watch her father hunt every fall some he hit and some he missed and there was no grand design as to which listen she said ive got some leads have time for lunch cant im meeting one of the vice presidents from new amsterdam ive got to be at the downtown athletic club fifteen minutes ago he looked around lets talk later but tell you what come over to my place for dinner im playing mata hari tonight whats tomorrow friday hows that make it saturday im meeting with the bank people all day tomorrow and im sure itll go into dinner he fell silent as someone walked by a sandyhaired man in coveralls who glanced at them quickly and then continued on reeces eyes followed the man uneasily as he walked away paranoid he muttered with a smile gave her hand a fast squeeze and then left the courthouse on her way back to the firm taylors willpower faded her lust for a fastfood burger won and she decided shed get something to eat this was how she found out that mitchell reece had lied to her instead of going back to the office shed headed north to a burger king and as she turned the corner she saw reece ahead of her but he was walking away from the downtown athletic club where hed said he was going for lunch she slowed stung at first then thinking no he probably meant another athletic club the new york athletic club on central park south in midtown only if that was so why was he disappearing into the lexington avenue subway stop the train went uptown but there were no stops anywhere near the nyac and why was he taking a train in the first place the rule on wall street was that if you went anywhere on firm business you always took the car service or a cab taylor had had four or five serious relationships in her life and one thing about men that irked her was that their fondness for the truth fell far short of other appreciations honesty was her new standard for love and she didnt think that it was too much to ask reece of course was nothing more than her employer but still the he hurt she was surprised at how much well maybe his plans had changed maybe hed checked his messages found the witness had canceled and was on his way to triplers to pick up a couple of new shirts but on impulse she found herself pulling a token out of her purse and hurrying down the subway stairs why she wondered because she was alice that was the only answer and once you slip into the rabbit hole taylor lockwood had learned you go where fate directs you which happened to be grand central terminal taylor followed the lawyer climbing up the stairs skirting a small colony of homeless she watched reece buy a train ticket and walk toward the gates she stopped squinting though the misty afternoon light that spilled across the huge cavern of the terminal she caught a glimpse of him standing at a vending cart in front of a gate a crowd of passengers walked between them obscuring him she jockeyed aside to get a better view then she laughed to herself when she saw what hed bought one mystery of mitchell reece had been solved he was walking to one of the commuter trains carrying a large bouquet of flowers he had a girlfriend after all digging another token from her purse she descended once more into the piquant subway to return to the firm sometimes he felt like a juggler thom sebastian was thinking of an offbroadway magic show hed seen some years ago sebastian remembered the juggler most clearly he hadnt used balls or indian clubs but a hatchet a lit blowtorch a crystal vase a full bottle of wine and a wineglass from time to time sebastian thought of that show of the tension that wound your guts up as the man would add a new object and send it sailing up in an arc a smile on his face eyes at the apogee everyone waited for the metal to cut the torch to burn the glass to shatter but nope the mans nosweat smile silently said to the audience so far so good sebastian sitting in his office this afternoon feeling depleted coked out phetamined out now told himself the same thing so far so good when he had learned that hubbard white willis had chosen not to make him a partner thom sebastian had held a conference with himself and decided after considerable negotiation to cut back on his working hours he was going to relax but that didnt work clients still called they were often greedy they were occasionally bastards but a lot of times they were neither and whether they were or not was irrelevant they were still clients and they were scared and troubled and needed help that only a smart hardworking lawyer could give them sebastian found to his surprise that he was physically incapable of slowing down he continued at a frantic pace his hours completely absorbed by two refinancings a leveraged buyout a revolving credit agreement by his own real estate transactions by his special project with bosk by his girlfriends by arranging buys with his drug dealer magaly by his family by his pro bono clients all in motion all spinning all just barely under control so far he desperately wanted sleep and that thought momentarily brought to mind another the brown glass vial hidden in his briefcase but it was no more than that a passing image sebastian did not even consider slipping into the mens room to partake he never did drugs within the walls of hubbard white willis that would be a sin so good he closed the door to his office then pulled a manila envelope out of his desk he removed the computer printouts and began to read all about ms taylor lockwood he found the information fascinating he jotted a few notes and hid them under the blotter on the desk then fed the printouts themselves and the envelope through the shredder in his office sweeping the phone from the cradle sebastian dialed her number from memory hello hey taylor he heard tension and anxiety in his own voice this was bad take charge thom yeah how you doing fine but guilty im finishing a whopper with any other woman hed have jumped on that line with both feet and flirted relentlessly but he resisted and said casually hey you survived an evening with me not a lot of girls can make that claim oops women meant to say women have i offended you yet youre not even on the radar screen ill try harder in fact he wasnt really in the mood to joke but he forced himself to maintain a certain level of patented sebastian banter you realize that were leaving for the airport in a half hour and the we would be who you and me ah our elopement your friend bosk was first in line you can be best lawyer damn she was fast hed run out of jokes listen speaking of your betrothed im going out to dinner in the hamptons tomorrow with him and a few other folks i remember you mentioning that she had that was interesting whyd she been paying attention to their offhand comments hey its totally lastminute i know but any chance youd like to come itll give me the chance to kill him so that i can move to the number one spot chivalrous he added gravely i have to warn you yes its not a stretch limo thats not a dealbreaker whats the occasion its take someone to dinner in the hamptons day you do know about that dont you i saw the card rack at hallmark i thought id have to celebrate by myself with popcorn and the tube how bout it leave early fiveish well be back by midnight one fair enough dress business cool she said ill come by your office sebastian set down the receiver and closed his eyes he breathed deeply he relaxed the motion of his imaginary juggler slowed unnecessary thoughts fell away projects that werent immediate dissolved the image of the chineseamerican girl hed picked up last night and would be meeting at the space tonight vanished some technical financial aspects of his project with bosk rose then faded as did a nasty dark portrait of wendall clayton finally sebastian was left with two thoughts tossing them around slowly one was the loan agreement he was working on spread out on his desk before him the other was taylor lockwood he pulled the agreement toward him and looked at the words with a grave intensity but ten minutes passed before he started to read them for donald burdick there was no square in new york city more beautiful than that at lincoln center the buoyant fountain the soaring white rock architecture the energetic chagall these all came together as a testament to the power of culture and moved him now as they always did it was especially stunning on fall nights like this when the concert halls radiated their rich glow into the misty dimness of the city burdick his hands in his cashmere coat pockets paced slowly in front of the fountain it was chilly but waiting inside the metropolitan opera where he and his wife had tickets for stravinsky later that night would undoubtedly require him to speak to any number of other box holders who like him were major patrons of the arts and arrived early for dinner in the private dining room at the moment he didnt want to be distracted he glanced up and saw the silver cloud ease to the curb and sergei leap out to open veras door she stepped onto the pavement in her sable coat he remembered how a few years ago as vera had waited for a light to change on madison avenue an animal rights activist had sprayed her mink with orange paint his wife had grabbed the young womans arm and wrestled her to the ground pinned her there until the police arrived they hugged and she took his arm as they walked to the private entrance that led to the club reserved for the most generous patrons burdick had once calculated that even adjusted for the charitable deduction each glass of champagne here cost him roughly two hundred dollars they let another couple go ahead of them so they could take an elevator alone st agnes vera asked abruptly mitchell won well they dropped their settlement offer to five million well pay one thats nothing everybody at the hospitals ecstatic good she said and the lease did you sign it up not yet its on for monday now rothstem i hate dealing with him and we have to keep everything hushhush so wendall doesnt find out monday she said troubled then his wife glanced at her reflection in the elevators metal panel she turned back to her husband i made some calls today talked to bill obriens wife this was an executive of mcmillan holdings which was hubbard whites biggest client the company was burdicks client alone and he took home personally about three million a year from mcmillan trouble burdick asked quickly apparently not wendall hasnt approached them about the merger good burdick said he doesnt even know the boards meeting in florida this week or if he does he hasnt made any rumblings about going down there burdick had assumed that clayton wouldnt waste the time trying to sway mcmillan since it was so firmly in the antimerger court but the boards been talking among themselves theyre wondering if the mergerd be good or bad for them bills wife knows that vera nodded matteroffactly shes sleeping with one of the board members frank augustine burdick nodded i wondered who he was seeing vera said i think you have to get down to florida and talk to them as soon as possible hold their hands rally them against the merger warn them about clayton ill go this weekend itll be a good excuse to miss claytons party on sunday last thing in the world i want to do is spend time in that pompous asss house vera smiled ill go she said cheerfully one of us should be there i think just to keep him a little unsettled and burdick thought as the elevator door opened youre just the woman to do it chapter fourteen ms lockwood we cannot thank you enough for the opportunity to review your demo tape taylor hurried to her apartment from her buildings mailroom clutching three return envelopes from three record companies shed called dudley and told him that she wanted to change before seeing him for dinner at his club in midtown and that shed meet him there as she walked down the hallway she fantasized about the contents of the envelopes it so captivated the initial screener that he sent it to our a r department where it made the rounds in record forgive the pun time your masterly reinterpretations of the old standards in juxtaposition with your own works masterpieces in fusion make the tape itself worthy of production but we would propose a threerecord project of primarily original material enclosed you will find our standard recording contract already executed by our senior vice president and as an advance a check in the amount of fifty thousand dollars a limousine will be calling for you not able to wait until she got inside she ripped the envelopes open with her teeth all of them at once the tornoff tops lay curled like flat yellow worms on the worn carpet behind her as she read the form rejection letters which were a far cry from the one that her imagination had just composed the one that said the most about the music business she decided began with the salutation dear submitter shit taylor stepped out of the elevator and tossed the letters into the sandfilled ashtray next to the call button inside her apartment she saw a blinking light on her answering machine and pushed the replay button as she stripped off her coat and kicked her shoes in an arc toward the closet her machine had a number of messages ralph dudley giving her the address of his club again sebastian confirming dinner tomorrow reece confirming dinner on saturday danny stuart linda davidoffs roommate apologizing for not getting back to her but suggesting they meet for lunch in the village tomorrow three dinners and a lunch damn how do spies manage to stay trim one more message remained she hit play hello counselor got some news ill be in town in a week or so and im going to take my little legal eagle out to dinner call me and well make plans taylor instantly looked around her room to see how straightened up it was as if the phone contained a video camera beaming the images directly to her fathers law office she sat down slowly on the arm of the couch samuel lockwoods call reviving a question mitchell reece had asked yesterday so howd you end up in new york taylor recalled perfectly sitting in front of her father two years ago the man of medium build jowly and pale by rights he should have broadcast an anemic image but he filled the living room of their house in chevy chase maryland with his powerful image she tried to gaze back at him but couldnt of course finally the sound of spring lawn mowing from outside was broken by his asking you can simply try it taylor i have other priorities dad priorities the lawyer said quickly pouncing see that very word suggests that there are several directions youd want to go in a smile in the back of your mind youre already entertaining the possibility that youd like to be a lawyer i mean what had she meant she was too flustered to remember my talent and you are talented darling ive always recognized that your grades honey as in every government politics philosophy course youve ever taken and in music composition music theory improvisation and performance music too he added with perfect timing diffusing her anger then he laughed but theres no way in satans backyard that anyone would ever make any kind of serious money playing music in bars i dont do it for the money dad you know that look you should pursue everything lord knows i do and he had law business golf tennis skydiving sailing teaching its just that its easier to get your law degree now going back after youre older it limits your opportunities reduced to a child before him taylor could think of no logical retorts well the best legal minds in the country had engaged in forensic battle with samuel lockwood and lost she said weakly i just feel alive when i play music dad thats all there is to it and what a feeling that must be he said but remember that we go through stages in life what excites us now isnt necessarily what sustains us all forever i pitched a dozen nohitters in college and i never felt higher than being on the pitchers mound what a thrill that was but making that my life a pro ball player no i had other things to do and i found getting up in court gave me exactly the same thrill even better in fact because i was in harmony with my nature music isnt a sport to me dad she believed she was whining and hated herself for it of course not i know its an important part of your life he then tactically reminded i was at every single one of your recitals a pause im only saying that it would be better to excel in a profession doesnt have to be the law not by any means oh right and work at the music parttime that way if the you call them gigs right if they dont happen well youd still have something or you could do both your music could come first and law could be second he seemed to have forgotten that hed absolved her from the practice of law just a moment earlier continuing samuel lockwood said theres a whole different approach to practicing nowadays there are parttime arrangements a lot of women have other priorities families and so on firms are flexible im supporting myself playing dad not a lot of people are not that the eighteen thousand a year shed made in clubs and playing weddings and a few corporate shows last year could be considered supporting herself and what a feather in your cap that is he said then frowned ive got a thought how about a compromise what if you got a job as a paralegal at one of the firms in washington one of our affiliated firms ill get you in you can try out law firm life see if you like it ill put aside some funds for school shed said no at first but samuel lockwood was relentless and shed finally given in but ill get a job on my own dad ill support myself if i like it ill apply to law school but ill play music at nights nothings going to interfere with that taylor he frowned its the best i can do and not in d c ill go to new york he took a breath and then nodded his concession to her victory over him youve got backbone counselor and he gave her a smile that chilled her soul because it unwittingly revealed that this spontaneous thought of his had been born some time ago and nurtured over many nights as he lay in his twin bed three feet from his wifes trying to figure out exactly how to manipulate her taylor was furious with herself for letting her guard down hed never intended that she work in washington wouldnt have presumed to link her with him by getting her a job and would never have threatened her music directly out of fear that hed push her away completely in the end even though shed defiantly resisted him it turned out that taylor had played right into his hand you understand im doing this because i love you and care for you he said no she thought i understand youre doing this because the thought of being unable to control the slightest aspect of your life is abhorrent to you shed said i know dad but as it turned out the paralegal life was not as bad as shed anticipated smart tireless unintimidated by the culture of wall street money and manhattan society taylor had made a reputation for herself at the firm quickly becoming one of the most popular paralegals always in demand she found that she enjoyed the work and had considerable aptitude for it so when a cycle came around for applying to law schools and samuel lockwood asked her which schools shed decided to apply to not if she intended to apply she said what the hell and plunged forward with a yes and basked in the sunlight of her fathers approval taylor lost in this complex answer to recces simple question now realized that she was still frozen in place perched on a sofa arm her hand floating above her answering machine why exactly was her father coming here where could they eat would the place she picked please him would he want to come see her perform they sure couldnt eat at miracles or one of the other clubs she played at hed make a fuss about the menu want to know what kind of oil they cooked with send food back if it wasnt prepared just right the electronic woman in the answering machine told her to save this message press two to erase this message press three she hit two and walked into the bedroom to dress for her mata hari date this is a midtown club she thought taylor had expected that it would be more well spiffy more of a power platinumcard corporate watering hole and less of a tawdry college lounge well maybe old money was allowed a little shabbiness in any case taylor lockwood looked at the fiercely bright lighting the dusty moose head sprouting from the wall the threadbare school banners and uncarpeted floor and asked herself again this is a club but ralph dudley was excited about the knickerbocker businessmens club he was at home here and buoyant at showing off his nest to a stranger come along now the partner said and he ushered her into the clubs dining room he walked to what mustve been his regular table and amusing her beyond words actually held the chair out for her and bowed after shed sat have the steak miss lockwood they have chicken too but order the steak rare like mine the old partners excitement was infectious his eyes gleaming as if he were back in the arms of his alma mater they ordered dudley took instantly to his task as mentor and launched into a series of stones about his law school it seemed an endless tumble of hard work harmless collegiate pranks chorale singers respectable young gentlemen in suits and ties and tearfully inspiring professors all forty years out of date if it wasnt complete fiction she nodded smiled till she felt jowls and said uhhuh or no kidding or how bout that every so often she got good mileage out of thats very helpful just what i was wondering the waiter brought the steaks charred and fatty and although she wasnt particularly hungry she found hers tasted very good dudley made sure she was looked after he was a natural host they ate in silence for a few minutes as taylor took in the young men at the tables around them recent grads she assumed in white shirts and striped ties and suspenders they were just beginning the journeys that in four decades would take them to the destinations at which donald burdick and ralph dudley and bill stanley had arrived she looked at her watch you said you had some plans tonight i dont want to interfere with them i hope youre not working late he gave her a charming smile just meeting some friends the mysterious ws taylor took a sip of the heavy wine hed ordered id rather work late than on weekends weekends he shook his head never really she asked casually i was in on saturday night i thought i saw you actually i think it was early sunday morning he hesitated a moment but there was nothing evasive about his demeanor when he answered not i maybe it was donald burdick yes that was probably it im told we look alike no i havent worked on a weekend since lets see or that was a case involving the seizure of foreign assets iranian i think yes it was let me tell you about it fascinating case which it may very well have been but taylor wasnt paying any attention she was trying to decide if hed been lying or not well looking at his frayed cuffs and overwashed shirt she observed a motive for stealing the note money dudley was a charming old man but he wasnt a player in wall street law and probably never had been his savings dwindling his partnership share decreasing as he made less and less money for the firm he would have been an easy target when somebody from hanover approached and asked him to let a man inside the firm an industrial spy theyd probably said dudley finished his story and glanced at his watch it was ninethirty and he was meeting ws in a half hour she recalled he signed the bill and they wandered out of the club into the cold damp ozone of a new york evening on the shag end of november taylor hoped the cool air would wake her but it had no effect the narcotics of red wine and heavy food numbed her mind she groggily followed the partner down the front steps halfwishing she partook in thom sebastians magic wakeup powder she thanked dudley for his insights and for dinner and said that his school had slipped into the frontrunner spot this seemed to genuinely please him he said you all right taylor fine just a little tired tired dudley said as if he had never heard of the word ill walk you to the subway he started down the sidewalk in long enthusiastic but gentlemanly strides chapter fifteen wait sean lillicks voice was sufficiently urgent that wendall clayton stopped frozen in the back entrance of the knickerbocker club what is it the partner asked there didnt you see them it was ralph dudley and taylor lockwood they were going out the front clayton frowned it was a constant source of irritation that a hasbeen like dudley belonged to the same club that he did he resumed his aristocratic stride so what are they doing here lillick wondered uneasily fucking clayton suggested he glanced toward the stairway which led to the clubs private bedrooms no they came out of the dining room it looked like maybe he bought her dinner and now hes going to fuck her i wonder if he can still get it up i dont want them to see us lillick said why not i just dont clayton shrugged he looked at his watch randys late whats going on lillick said ive got to leave about midnight wendall if its okay his suit didnt fit well and he looked like a college boy out to dinner with dad midnight its important whats up clayton smiled do you have a date he dragged the last word out teasingly just seeing some friends i dont think its okay not tonight lillick said nothing for a moment then its pretty important ive really got to clayton examined the young man like most denizens of the east village he seemed damp and unclean one of your performances yeah yeah the partner mocked yes lillick corrected himself instantly though in a tone that approached rebellious weve got so much to do i mentioned it a week ago and what a busy week its been dont you agree itll just be a few hours ill still be at the office at six if you want clayton had let him dangle enough he said this once i suppose its all right he had plans of his own tonight and didnt give a rats rosy ass what lillick did after they were finished here thanks clayton waved him off and gave a reserved smile to randy simms who now walked through the revolving door of the club ignoring lillick as he always did simms said i saw ralph dudley outside with a woman piqued again by the reference to the old partner clayton snapped appreciate the weather report randy simms was six feet three thin and solid ralph lauren might have designed a line of connecticut sportswear around him a mother and her teenage daughter entered the lobby they eyed the young lawyer with similar degrees of desire howd they get the lowdown on our witness clayton was referring to the evisceration of dr morse on the witness stand in the st agnes hospital case reece used some private eye in san diego fuck that was good clayton said with admiration he didnt know reece well but hed make sure the associate was guaranteed a partnership slot next year or the year after whens our guest arriving clayton asked him any minute now give me the details his names harry rothstem senior partner in the general partnership that owns the firms building hes got full authority to go forward or pull the plug he and burdick are planning to sign the new lease on monday rothstem doesnt seem to have any mistresses but i found some accounts in the caymans sons got two drug convictions what kind cocaine i mean what kind of convictions felony one sale one possession is he a good friend of burdicks simmss face eased into a faint smile whats that supposed to mean clayton snapped again how can he be a friend of donalds simms asked rothstems a jew a tall bald man walked through the door and looked around thats him simms said claytons face broke into a huge smile as he strode forward mr rothstem im wendall clayton he called come join us my friend at the corner of madison avenue and fortyfourth street taylor and ralph dudley paused and shook hands he inclined his head toward her in a victorian way she found quaint and said which trainre you taking ill walk ill cab it i suppose good luck to you let me know how you fare with yale he turned and walked away taylor had thought shed have to do a privateeye number hey follow that cab theres a fiver in it for you but no dudley didnt flag down a taxi at all he was on foot going to meet the mysterious ws whom he had visited the night the note was stolen when he was a half block away taylor followed they moved west through the eerie illumination of a city at night the glossy wetness of the streets and storefront windows lit for security still plenty of traffic some theaters letting out now people leaving restaurants en route to clubs and bars taylor felt infused with the luminous energy of new york she found that shed sped up to keep pace with it and had nearly overtaken dudley she slowed and let him regain a long lead out of the brilliant cold fake daylight of times square only now did taylor feel the first lump of fear as she crossed an invisible barrier into pimp city the public relations firms hired by new york developers called this area clinton almost everyone else knew it by its historical name the more picturesque hells kitchen taylor continued her pursuit even when dudley hit twelfth avenue near the river and turned south where the streetlights grew sparser and the neighborhoods were deserted abandoned even by the hookers then dudley stopped so suddenly catching taylor in midthought that she had to jump into a doorway to avoid being seen the concrete reeked of sour urine hugging the shadows she felt nauseous when she looked again dudley was gone taylor waited for five minutes breathing shallow gasps of cold air listening to the sticky rush of traffic on the west side highway then she walked toward the spot where dudley had disappeared the doorway of a small twostory building there were no lights radiating from the windows she saw they were painted over an old sign faded read west side art and photography club ws on his calendar so a place not a person hed come here on saturday night and then possibly gone to the firm around the time the note had disappeared but was there a connection or was this just his hobby taking pictures or attending lectures on ansel adams and picasso she cocked her head and listened she thought she heard something wait wait taylor tried to block out the rush of the cars and trucks and believed she heard music something syrupy full of strings like mantovani standing in the doorway her feet stinging from the unaccustomed exercise in very unsensible joan and david heels she leaned against the stone and watched a cluster of intrepid rats browse through a garbage pile across the street he goes in she figured hes got to come out forty minutes later he did the door swung wide taylor caught an image of pink and lavender soft music and softer light spilled out into the street a radio cab owned by the company that the firm used pulled up dudley vanished immediately into the car which sped away the question was what would mitchell do no that wasnt the question at all she knew what he would do the question really was did she have the guts to do the same thing the grapevine says youve got balls yeah well taylor walked to the front door and pressed the buzzer a handsome black man large and trapezoidal opened the door yes he asked poised and polite taylor said um im here her voice clogged yes you are im here because a customer a member right a member referred me the bouncer looked past her and then opened the door taylor stepped inside it was like the lobby of an exclusive hotel smoky pastels brushed copper leather furniture a teak bar three japanese men all in dark suits sat on a plush couch smoking furiously they looked at taylor briefly hopefully then when she met their gaze with chill defiance looked away fast a woman in her forties wearing a conservative navy suit and white blouse walked silently up to her how may i help you the smile of a maitre d i had a little time free tonight i thought id check the place out well the woman said now playing tour director the west side art and photography club is one of the oldest art appreciation clubs in the city heres some literature she handed taylor a glossy brochure there were programs of music art shows classes but how could she find out who dudley met here taylor nodded ralph cant say enough good things about you ralph ralph dudleys a friend i was going to meet him here earlier but oh the woman said quickly you just missed him you shouldve said you knew him she took back the brochure and tossed it in a drawer sorry i didnt know hed referred you id please i drivers license or passport what was alice to do play by the rules of topsyturvy what else she handed the license over and crossed her arms as the woman compared face and picture then went to a computer and typed in some information apparently favorable results came back and the woman returned the license cant be too careful you know now our membership fee is one thousand and the hourly fee is five hundred per model if you want a man hell have to wear a condom oral sex is completely up to the individual model most do some dont tipping is expected the fee includes any standard toys but if you want something special it can probably be arranged will that be cash or charge uh american express itll show up as art instruction on your statement one hour one hour sure the woman took the card and asked do you have any special requests taylor said actually i was thinking about something a little unusual could i have the uh model that ralph dudley sees the hostess trained to be unflappable didnt look up from the charge voucher but hesitated for a millisecond youre sure thinking shed never been less sure about anything in her life taylor lockwood gave a slight smile and said positive theres a premium double no problem smiling taylor took the credit card slip and a pen see the steadiness of my hand as i sign for the two thousand jesus christ what am i doing dollars the hostess disappeared into the back room muzak played quietly a guitar rendition of pearly shells she returned a moment later with a key ive talked to her she hasnt been with too many women but shes game to try good i think youll find her quite nice up the stairs last room on the right liquors free coke we can give you at cost thats okay taylor walked into the cool corridor topsyturvy she knocked on the door a voice called come on in taylor took a deep breath exhaled and pushed into the room she stopped total shock in her eyes an expression that perfectly matched the one on the face of the girl who stood topless in the center of the room it was the teenage girl shed met in dudley s office junie his granddaughter the garter belt in the girls hand fell to the floor with a dull clink she said oh shit like its you chapter sixteen you gotta like close the door junie said regaining some composure its a rule johnny hes the bouncer comes around and gets pissed you dont taylor stepped into the room shut the door junie said darkly like ralph isnt going to be so happy this happened you know taylor whispered youre his granddaughter like helloooo whatta you think of course not thats only what he tells people the girl was heavily made up with dark streaks of brown and blue eye shadow that made her face sleek and serpentine she retrieved the garter and began untangling it what it is hes one of my oldest customers then she laughed i mean one of the dudes ive been seeing for the longest time but you know hes one of the oldest too probably like the oldest taylor looked at a plush armchair can i sit down its your hour have a drink you want taylor poured sparkling wine into a crystal champagne glass you want any me junie looked horrified i cant drink im underage you know taylor blinked the girl laughed thats like a fucking joke of course i drink only they dont let us when were working taylor said you mind as she eased her shoes off a swell of pain went through her feet then slowly vanished mind usually people take off a lot more than their shoes so tell me about you and ralph i guess i oughta ask why he could be in trouble i need to find out whether he is or not the girl shrugged meaning thats not a good enough answer ill pay you this was a better response i guess i oughta see the duckets the what the girl held her palm out taylor opened her purse she hadnt brought much of reeces bribe money she wadded together about two hundred dollars keeping twenty for herself for cab fare home i get that as a tip for a blow job junie said if the son of a bitchs cheap taylor handed her more money thats all i have junie shrugged and put the money in a dresser drawer she pulled out a tshirt and worked it over her head so poppie thats what i call him he likes girls my age he came to the house last year and we had a date it was like totally bizotic but we kind of hit it off you know she whispered we started meeting outside the club they get really pissed they find out but we did it anyway he brought me some totally def clothes nice shit you know from the good stores anyway we did some weird things like he took me to this art museum which was a real bore but then we went to the zoo like ive never been there before it was way wild we just kept hanging out more and more hes lonely his wife died and his daughter is a total bowhead junie is that really your name june i like june june last saturday night was ralph here yeah when around ten or eleven i guess we had our regular appointment you know im his on saturday night sorta a tradition then what she fell silent shrugged another two hundred the girl said i thought you dont have any more money i can give you a check a check junie laughed i promise it wont bounce that was what five hundred you said taylor hesitated you have a good memory she wrote the check out and handed it to her mitchell youre going to see a very weird expense account for this project junie slipped the check into her purse okay but he didnt want me to tell anybody he went to your company the law firm yeah what was he doing thats the thing he wouldnt say im like whatre you going there for this time of night i mean its midnight or whatever he said he had to something about a lot of money but he wouldnt tell me what and he told me never tell anybody at least anybody who didnt pay her seven hundred dollars taylor asked has he ever mentioned a company called hanover stiver naw but he dont talk i mean he doesnt talk about his business too much hes always correcting what i say its so mundoboring taylor stood slowly slipped her swollen feet back into her shoes she walked painfully to the door she paused how old are you eighteen and ive got a drivers license ive had fake ones too honey okay im sixteen but i tell ralph im fifteen he likes it that im younger do you go to school or anything a laugh wherere you from i made sixtyeight thousand dollars last year and have a hundred gs in a you know retirement fund why the fuck would i want to go to school why indeed taylor let herself out into the hallway through which echoed a cacophony of voices and sounds very different from those she was used to at hubbard white willis at lunchtime the next day her feet only marginally recovered from their abuse the day before taylor lockwood was sitting across from a diminutive young man in a west village diner danny stuart linda davidoffs former roommate the menu of the place which had been stuarts choice was heavy on foods that had swayed in the wind when alive and light on main courses that had walked around on two or four legs the latter being by far taylors favorite so she asked you know sean lillick too not at all really i met him through linda and went to some of his shows but hes a little avantgarde for me youre an editor thats mostly a hobby some of us put together an alternative literary magazine im a computer programmer by profession taylor yawned and stretched a joint popped the walls of the place were badly painted swirls of dark paint didnt cover the lighter enamel underneath the decorations were a la mother jones and woodstock but the space she knew had been a beat club in the fifties william burroughs and allen ginsberg had hung out here the ancient floor felt spongy under the chairs and the wooden columns were carved with the initials of hundreds of former patrons what these walls have heard she thought danny ordered sprouts and nuts and yogurt taylor a garden burger bacon no bacon the waitress replied through her pierced lips ketchup taylor tried we dont have ketchup mustard sesamesoy paste or eggless mayo cheese not your kind of cheese the waitress responded plainll be just fine the woman vanished stuart said i think i remember you from lindas funeral taylor nodded i didnt know many people there except the ones from the firm you a lawyer he asked paralegal how did you meet her just a fluke you know your typical new york story you come to new york from a small town look for a place to live you need a roommate cause the rents are so high the guy i was rooming with got aids and moved back home i needed to split the rent and lindad been staying at some residence hall for women she hated it we roomed together for i guess about nine or ten months until she died did you know her well pretty well i read some of her pieces and did some editing for her she wrote reviews for us and i was hoping eventually to publish some of her poems was she good she was young her work was unformed but if shed kept at it i know she wouldve gone someplace what was her style like plath taylor had read some of sylvia plaths poetry and recalled that she too had committed suicide stuart said her poetry was more traditionally structured than plaths but her personal life yep just as turbulent the wrong men always heartbroken too stoic she needed to scream and throw things more but she kept it all inside the food came and danny stuart dug eagerly into his huge mass of rabbit food taylor started working on the sandwich which she decided should be named not the garden but the cardboard burger how did it happen the suicide she asked she was up at her parents summer house in connecticut the back deck was above this big gorge one night she jumped the fall didnt kill her but she hit her head and got knocked out she drowned in a stream taylor closed her eyes and shook her head did she leave a note he nodded well it wasnt really a note it was one of her poems when you called and said you were curious about her i thought youd like to see it i made you a copy its dated the day before she died it talks about leaving life behind her all the cares i was going to publish it in my magazine but you know i havent had the heart he handed her the xerox copy taylor read the title when i leave she looked at danny and said i hope i can ask you something in confidence something that wont go any further sure do you think linda killed herself because of something that happened at work no you sound pretty certain i am i know exactly why she killed herself i thought no one knew well i did she was pregnant pregnant i dont think anybody knew except me she got an ept kit it was just a couple of weeks before she died i saw the kit in the bathroom and asked her about it you know we were like girlfriends she confided in me but why would she kill herself i think the father dumped her who was the father i dont know she was seeing somebody but never talked about him or brought him around the apartment she was real secretive about him breaking up that upset her so much she killed herself stuart considered she thought studying his face poets eyes artists eyes unlike sean lillick this was the real thing he said theres more to it see linda had no business working at that law firm she was too sensitive the business world was way too much for her she got thrown too easily then when her personal life came crashing down i think it pushed her over the edge but you dont know if there was anything specific at the firm that upset her anything she mightve felt guilty about nope she never mentioned a word about that and she probably would have as i said she and i were like well sisters so the rabbit hole of wall street had proved too much for poor linda davidoff without the heart to read the girls suicide poem taylor put it in her purse and continued to eat her bland lunch while she and danny talked about life in the village her face broke into another major yawn she laughed and stuart joined her not getting enough sleep lately he wondered the problem she explained is that ive been living an afterhours life when im not an afterhours person im a duringhours person chapter seventeen alice was on another trip through the looking glass this time in a limo taylor and thom sebastian were speeding down the long island expressway friday after work the drivers eyes flicked to the radar detector needle as often as they glanced at the highway im totally psyched you came sebastian said with apparent sincerity i thought you were going to boogie in with the big e e excuse you know i get that a lot she filled in yeah he grimaced now let me tell you about bosk whats the story behind the name his real handles brad ottington smith bos bosk im seabastian sea bass get it okay his father and mother have been separated practically since he was born she has a house in boston and his father has an apartment on the upper east side they kept the summer place in the hamptons and have it on alternate weeks they thats the parents they cant talk to each other without bloodshed so they have their lawyers schedule the visits to the house and were the mothers week right sounds like its going to be a bucket of kicks and giggles what is she a wicked witch taylor asked all ill say is shes more powerful than his father what does he do dad what he does is hes rich hes a senior partner at ludlum morgan the investment bank bosk she laughed i feel like i want to give him a milkbone when i call him that what firm does he work at as hed done the other night though he grew reluctant to give much away about bosk professionally little shop in midtown sebastian busied himself opening a budweiser handed it to her popped another the mother ada travels entertains does what any fiftyfiveyearold sorority sister does manages her portfolio its about a hundred million sebastian sipped the beer and let his hand stray accidentally on purpose to her knee ho boy taylor thiss gonna be primo good food good drink good people she lifted his pudgy fingers off her skirt and good behavior sebastian moaned then sat back in silence and they gazed out the dim windows as dusk enveloped the flat sandy landscape the ottington smith family manse was a threestory gothic victorian house white with dark blue rim about a hundred miles east of new york on the south shore of long island two towers rose to widows walks which overlooked a huge yard and three connected outbuildings the house itself was covered with skeletons of vines and wisteria a spiked wroughtiron fence surrounded a labyrinth of grounds much of the property had been reclaimed by tangles of forsythia which sported sparse tags of brown and yellow leaves addams family taylor said the circular driveway was full of cars the limo paused and they got out god more german cars than in brazil sebastian said porches i love porches taylor said she sat on a wooden swing and rocked back and forth wish it were thirty degrees warmer he rang the bell a woman in her midfifties came to the door her dry blond hair swept sideways jackie kennedystyle and was sprayed firmly into place she wore a limegreen silk dress woven with pink and black triangles that pointed feverishly in all directions taylor birdspotted chanel the womans face was long and glossy the high bones holding the skin like a taut sail her jewelry was large a blue topaz on her tanned wrinkled finger was easily fifty carats thomas they pressed cheeks and taylor was introduced to ada smith introduced then promptly examined the dynamics of the eyes the contour of skin the mouth especially the review was mixed and taylor believed she understood why bosks little girlfriends age twentythree or twentyfour could be forgiven their youth taylor had broken the threeoh barrier and yet had hardly a crows foot or defining jowl she hates me taylor thought yet ada s smile and charm didnt waver shed been brought up right call me ada please i dont know where bradford is the others are in the den bradford s the cocktail and cigar director im in charge of dinner that will be at eight then she was gone from the back hallway a bellowing voice sea bass sea bass sebastian ran toward him and grunted boskmeister yo they slapped fists reminding taylor of bull rams smacking horns their host was in chinos topsiders and a green harvard sweatshirt his hands and face were red his eyes watering from the cold weve been chopping wood for the fire a girl giggled at the apparent lie well bosk said carting it in same as chopping it just as much work bosk leaned forward his arm on sebastians shoulders he whispered jennies here and she brought billyboy you can believe it no way is she totally fucked or what sebastian looked around uneasily and how bout brittany couldnt make it the lawyers eyes were immeasurably relieved and taylor remembered something from the club about unreturned phone calls then bosks eyes danced to taylor lo youre taylor lockwood right youre the one who wont marry me true but youre in good company she nodded at sebastian i wont marry him either you have a nice place here thanks ill show you around later come on inside weve got a fire going after shed washed up she joined the crowd in the den they were mostly in their twenties names went past rob and mindy and gaygay and trevor and windham and mackenzie the latter both female clusters of contemporary syllables more distinct than the faces of the handsome men and pretty women they identified taylor smiled and waved and forgot the names instantly they were friendly but reserved and taylor wondered what they were thinking of her a woman with more wop and mick in her than brit with a mass of kinky black hair not a pert ponytail and wearing a long paisley skirt and a black blouse not a j crew stitch upon her body suspicion that was the message from the women from the men there was something very different something between casual flirtation and a kneejerk invitation to hump taylor supposed that soon thered be a lot of female fingers twining possessively through the belt loops of their men bosk made martinis for the crowd but taylor stuck with beer are you a lawyer one blonde asked a paralegal oh the woman said blinking thats interesting we need you folks one handsome young man said as he tinkered nervously with his rolex you save our butts every day it seemed he wasnt being condescending he was simply embarrassed for her and trying to salvage her pride wherere you from boston right i detect bostonian born on the north shore oh locust valley a pretty blond woman asked the residence of the crème de la crème j p morgans home no glen cove a pleasant but stripmailed city but we moved to maryland when i was twelve is your father or mother in the business which business would that be taylor asked innocently law banking as if no other businesses existed he manages a convenience store she replied sebastian whod already commented about her father and his renowned law practice glanced at her with a cryptic look well retail one girl finally said nodding with robust approval good margins in retail lately very good somebody else added and to her relief taylor lockwood ceased to be a human being as far as they were concerned and their own conversation the real and important conversation resumed dinner was ada s jurisdiction she presided with the quiet authority of someone for whom social propriety is statutory somewhere in a threedecadesold volume of emily post this very layout of waterford and wedgwood was represented though the clothing was supposed to be casual adas appearance in a rustling silk dress blackvelvet headband and necklace gripping a lemoncolored stone the size of a fat thumb made it clear that whatever happened in the frat dining halls or eating clubs these youngsters were accustomed to dinner in this particular house would be governed by a respectable modicum of formality taylor tried a vain end run around the seating oh im sorry was i supposed to sit there ada smilingly steered her away from bosks girlfriend a potential source of information about the project scolding boy girl boy girl lobster bisque a pearandcamembert salad tiny veal chops surrounded by a yinyang swirl of pureed peas and carrots a green salad a real butler served the meal between polite words with the young man on her right taylor tried to overhear the conversation between bosk and sebastian but ada s voice was too loud she was a lockjawed caricature of long island money she touched the mens arms with her dark bony fingers and flirted fiercely yet their hostess knew this game as well as she knew the proper wording for breadandbutter notes she had no intention of seducing these boys the only organ at play here was her ego though sex was a strong undercurrent of the meal and crude jokes some of them really disgusting flew back and forth the upper class taylor remembered had by and large not been puritans halfway through the profiteroles and espresso with anisette the doorbell rang bosk rose and a few minutes later returned with a man of about fortyfive he was introduced as dennis callaghan taylor disliked him at once she wasnt sure why what she might in fairness have read as groomed discerning and charming she believed was vain spun sprayed hair combed forward a closefitting suit with shot cuffs gold bracelet pompous a disdaining look at the children around him and dishonest a broad smile he could not have felt he was also insulting he ignored taylor while he studied the bloused or sweatered breasts of every woman younger than herself at the table before turning a flattering smile on ada with the respect due a matriarch taylor then noticed that the climate at the table had changed considerably sebastians expression was one of anger he shot a dark mystified glance at bosk who shrugged with a look that meant it wasnt my fault when she saw that taylor s interest immediately perked up perhaps callaghan had some connection with the project the visitor whose beach house was apparently nearby announced that hed played hooky from wall street today to hold a couple of meetings out here and happened to notice the cars as he was driving back to the city he thought hed stop in and see bosk and sebastian the man glanced at sebastian and taylor saw another finger wag just like the other night callaghan nodded subtly and so the conversation remained social as he sat down at the table and took a glass of wine hed eaten already they talked about problems in finding groundskeepers and the advantages and risks of helicoptering into manhattan sebastian remained nervous as hell and when taylor asked callaghan what he did for a living the young lawyer answered for the businessman offering quickly wall street darling everybody out heres on wall street well youve got an artist or two from time to time taylor s a musician by the way really the conversation turned back to her momentarily and before she could ask anything more about callaghan dinner was over and sebastian had quickly shepherded bosk and the businessman downstairs explaining that they were going to check out bosks cigar cellar no one else was invited but the herd of preppies didnt take any offense ada nodded toward the port sherry and liqueur and armed with yet more alcohol this contingent ambled into the panoramic living room for more gossip it was then that taylor recalled she hadnt told sebastian that she was a musician soon several people lit up cigarettes ada among them the smoke gave taylor an excuse to drain her grand marnier and say she was going to step outside to get some air whether anyone thought this was rude or suspicious didnt matter they all seemed relieved that the eleven heiress was leaving and they could spend some time dishing in earnest she took her leather jacket from the closet and walked out the front door then strolled around the house until she spotted a fourfootdeep window well she climbed down into it a piece of glass was loose and she worked it free she could not see the three men downstairs but their words earned on the warm air streamed up to her with the awkwardsounding hesitancies of conversations overheard but not witnessed got to be more careful sebastian said jesus i shit when i saw you here callaghan said weve still got some details to work out and youre impossible to get ahold of thom well we cant just fucking waltz into each others office and take a meeting now can we weve got to be careful about it set it up ahead of time keep everything secret callaghan sighed ive been doing this sort of thing a lot longer than you have thom were going to get away with it stop worrying so much im thinking about the phones bosk said you really think theyre bugged sebastian said of course theyre fucking bugged jesus dont be so naive bosk well i cant run downstairs to make a call from a pay phone every time i want to talk to you somebody sees me doing that a couple of times and whatre they going to think sebastian well thats what youre going to have to do you can pick up cell phone transmissions even easier than landlines callaghan what we could do ive done this before what we could do is get an answering service you call and leave messages ill call on a separate line and pick them up well have a second answering service going the other way clever taylor lockwood thought though being truly clever thom would have meant wearing gloves when you check out the file cabinet youre about to break into so you dont leave fingerprints suddenly she felt a curious thrill what was it the excitement of the pursuit she supposed getting closer to her quarry what reece felt in the courtroom yesterday what her father undoubtedly felt in court on the golf course with his beloved shotgun out in the fields when she was young her father would take her with him when hed go hunting on saturday mornings in the fall shed hated those times wanted to be back home in bed watching cartoons or playing on her upright piano shopping with her mother but samuel lockwood eyes keen and hungry for a kill had insisted she come along hed carried the tiny stillwarm corpses of the birds back to the car where came the moment she dreaded to make her understand that the dead birds couldnt hurt her he had her touch each one with her index finger there that wasnt so bad was it didnt hurt they cant bite when theyre dead taylor remember that dennis callaghan now said look yeah we have to be careful but we cant let this paralyze us were fucking thieves sebastian said am i the only one taking this seriously bosks laugh was flinty well whatta you want thom you want to get walkietalkies and scramblers disguises im just a little paranoid okay there was a weird fuckup what well last saturday night when i was in the firm right callaghan offered i made sure nobody knew i was there on friday i taped the back door latch down so i could get in without leaving any record i was in but what happens is this old asshole a partner cops my key and uses it to get in early sunday morning so now im in the system gotcha thought taylor lockwood john silbert hemming her tall private eye would be proud of her shit bosk said whyd he do it how the fuck do i know alzheimers callaghan said not the end of the world they dont know what you were doing there right i dont think so well relax youve covered up everything real well thom oh here got a present ah nectar of the gods sebastian said sure bosk said a long pause then a sniff another the magic powder boosted sebastians spirits considerably when he spoke next he said with a laugh i like this fucking the firm that fucked me and getting rich in the process you want a lamborghini callaghan asked bosk said seriously i dont like the ride rough you know sebastian i live in manhattan whatm i gonna do alternatesideofthestreet parking with a twohundredthousanddollar car keep it out at your summer house thom like we all do i dont have a summer house and i dont want one the wind was dicing her face and ears she closed her eyes against the cold her legs and thighs the last stronghold of heat were going numb she touched the glass that separated her from a room that was fifty degrees warmer where she heard the sounds of two chubby spoiled boys sniffing the residue of cocaine into their nostrils bosk said so whats with this taylor cunt she put out fuck you sebastian said unemotionally no does she fuck you thats what im asking callaghan sniffed his white powder then said youve got gonads for brains bosk is that all you think about sex money too i think a lot about money but mostly i think about sex tell me about taylor i dont want to talk about her sebastian said menacingly does she have big tits i couldnt tell hey chill will you man thats a fucking scary look i was just curious there was a pause and with an ominous tone in his voice sebastian said well dont get too interested in her you hear me taylor felt a ping of fear at that im just you hear what im saying hey chill i hear you sea bass i hear you then the conversation turned to sports and stinging with cold taylor left them to their banter she walked inside and rejoined the crowd in front of the fireplace observing how the conversation grew sedate when she entered the room she nudged herself into the center of the group and sat on the hearth with her back to the fire until the pain from the cold became a fierce itch and then finally died away around pm the drapery man walked through greenwich village under huge trapezoids of bruisepurple clouds lit from the perpetual glow of the city he was concentrating on the buildings and finally arrived at the address he sought at the service entrance which smelled of sour garbage he inserted his lock gun and flicked the trigger a dozen times until the teeth of the tumblers were aligned the door opened easily he climbed to the fourth floor and picked another set of locks on the door of the particular apartment he sought inside he slipped his icepick weapon into his belt handle up ready to grab it if he had to and began to search he found a bag of needlepoint one a christmas scene that sure wouldnt be finished in time for the holiday a box of weight watchers apple snacks a garter belt in its original gift box apparently never worn canons of musty sheet music an elaborate expensivelooking reeltoreel tape recorder dozens of tape cassettes with the same title the heat of midnight songs by taylor lockwood inside the womans briefcase in addition to sheet music he found time sheets key entry logs and other documents from hubbard white willis he looked through them carefully and memorized exactly what they contained he found and read through the womans address book her calendar and her phone bills he listened to her answering machine tapes his client had hoped that shed have a diary but very few people kept diaries anymore and taylor lockwood was no exception the drapery man continued his search walking slowly through the apartment taking his time he knew his client would grill him at length about what hed found here and he wanted to make sure he overlooked nothing chapter eighteen taylor dropped into the chair in her cubicle it was sixthirty saturday morning the gods of the furnace had decided that not even type a attorneys would be in the office yet and so hubbard white r willis was cold as anchorage she shivered both from the temperature and from exhaustion too she and thom sebastian had arrived back in the city late last night the lawyer had been subdued shed sensed that he was worried shed ask about callaghan and he wouldnt be able to come up with a credible story but there was something else troubling him his jokey self was gone and once she caught him looking at her with an odd troubled expression on his face she had an image of herself as a condemned prisoner and him as a prison guard distancing himself from someone about to die ridiculous she thought still she could hear his words in her head well dont get too interested in her what did that mean and how the hell had he known she was a musician she noticed a flashing light on her phone indicating that she had a message she picked up the receiver to check voice mail reece had called again to remind her about dinner at his place that night there was one other message beep hey counselor how you doing saw an article about your shop in the law journal about the merger youve probably seen it but im faxing it to you always stay on top affirm politics if you only knew dad she thought were planning christmas dinner and weve got an rsvp from a supreme court justice ill let you guess who im putting him next to you at the table just keep your more liberal views to yourself counselor im serious about that okay ill be in town week after next your mother says hi supreme court samuel lockwood never did anything without a purpose what did he have in mind was the dinner table placement intended to help her career she wondered or his she appended cynically taylor found the fax her father had sent about the merger of the firms scanned it quickly it described the vicious infighting among the partners at hubbard white willis burdick v clayton and how despite the animosity the merged firms would probably succeed much better in the new business climate than if they remained separate the picture featured burdick and his wife an idea occurred to her she wrote on the top thom fyi and signed her name using this as an excuse she hurried to his office propped the article on his chair and with a glance into the deserted corridor proceeded to search the room like an eager rookie cop on crime scene detail in his desk she found condoms bamboo paper an unopened bottle of chivas regal matches from the harvard club the palace hotel and assorted latenight clubs around town dozens of takeout menus from downtown restaurants chatty letters from his brother and father and mother all neatly organized some with margin notes brokerage house statements checkbooks jesus whered he get all this money some popular spy and military paperbacks a coffeestained copy of the lawyers code of professional responsibility assorted photographs from vacations newspaper articles on bond issues and stock offerings the pennystock news candy bars crumbs and paper clips nothing about the note no information linking him bosk or callaghan to hanover stiver on sebastians bookshelves were hundreds of huge books bound in navy and burgundy and deep green theyd contain copies of all the closing documents in a business transaction that sebastian had worked on they would be great places to hide stolen promissory notes and other incriminating evidence but it would take several days to look through all of them she saw sebastians name embossed in gold at the bottom of each one it was then that she noticed the corner of a piece of paper protruding from beneath sebastians desk blotter another glance into the corridor still no signs of life and she pulled the paper out the jottings were brief and to the point taylor lockwood fifth avenue her age schools attended home address in chevy chase phone numbers at the firm and at home the unlisted one too father samuel lockwood mother housewife no siblings applied to law school employed by hww for two years merit raises and bonuses at top levels musician every tuesday miracles pub the son of a bitch she whispered then replaced the sheet exactly where shed found it she left his office and returned to the chilly corridor hearing echoes of footsteps hearing the click of guns being cocked and the hiss of knives being unsheathed and hearing over and over thom sebastians words well dont get too interested in her in the firms library she logged on to several of the computer databases that the firm subscribed to including the lexisnexis system which contains copies of nearly all court decisions statutes and regulations in the united states as well as articles from hundreds of magazines and newspapers around the world she spent hours trying to find information about dennis callaghan bosk and sebastian there wasnt much that was helpful bradford smith had been admitted to the new york and federal bars and currently practiced at a midtown firm which didnt however seem to have any connection to hanover stiver or new amsterdam bank dennis callaghan wasnt a lawyer but a businessman he dabbled in dozens of different activities and had been under investigation for stock fraud and real estate scams though hed never been indicted he was currently connected with about twenty different companies some of which were incorporated offshore and which she guessed were fronts but still no connection between any of them and hanover stiver the information about sebastian found in alumni magazine archives and legal magazines hed contributed articles to wasnt incriminating either though she found interestingly that the upper east side preppy image was fake sebastian had grown up outside of chicago his father the manager of a kroger grocery store hence she realized another reason for the funny look when hed heard her tell the youngsters at adas that dad managed a convenience store sebastian did have an undergrad degree from harvard but it had taken him six years because hed gone parttime presumably while working to support himself the yale law school certificates shed noticed on his wall must have been for continuing education courses hed gotten his law degree from brooklyn law at night while working as a process server during the day serving subpoenas in some of the toughest parts of the outer boroughs so there was a different thom sebastian beneath the jokey party animal one who was driven ambitious tough and taylor knew recalling the conversation in ada s downstairs den also a thief fucking the firm that fucked him more associates were filing into the library now and she didnt want anybody to see what she was doing so she logged off the computer and went to the administrative floor there she walked into the file room carrie mason had told her about a large dingy space filled with row upon row of cabinets it was here that the billing department kept the original time sheets that lawyers filled out daily making certain the room was empty taylor opened the d drawer where ralph dudleys sheets would reside and found the most recent ones they were little blue slips of carbon paper filled with his imperial scrawl describing every tenminute period during working hours she read through and replaced them and then did the same in the l drawer for lillick and the s for thom sebastian taylor rose to leave but then paused the r cabinet was right next to her she rested her fingers on the handle and after a moments hesitation pulled it open and looked inside she stared in astonishment at the booklets with mitchell recces name on them there were hundreds of them christ almighty nearly twice as many as for most other lawyers she pulled one out at random september and thumbed through it looking at a typical day in the life of mitchell reece new client relations hour new amsterdam bank trust v hanover stiver hours depositions weston electronic et al v larson associates hours motion to quash subpoena j brietell state of new york v kowalski hour conference with das office pro bono state of new york v hammond hour meeting with defendant pro bono in re summers publishing hours research briefing chapter bankruptcy issue she skimmed ahead lasky v allied products mutual indemnity of new jersey v new amsterdam bank state of new york v williams she totaled the hours sixteen were billed to clients that was sixteen hours of productive work not commuting time lunch trips to the rest rooms and the water fountain sixteen hours in one day and every day was pretty much the same arguing motion arguing motion on trial writing brief on trial on trial settlement conference arguing motion on trial pro bono meetings with criminal clients and prosecutors on trial on trial on trial he never stopped a thought occurred to her and she smiled to herself yes no go for it alice she opened the binder containing the most recent of his sheets she flipped through them until she found the day that shed followed him to grand central station for the three hours he was out of the office hed marked the time code which meant personal time the time you spend at the dentists office the time you spend at pta conferences the time you spend in westchester with your girlfriend taylor felt her skin buzzing with embarrassment as she flipped through other lunch hours over the past several months in september hed done the same taken long lunches only usually it was two or three times a week recently in the month of november for instance hed done so only once a week three hours in the middle of the day for a workaholic like reece well taylor lockwood understood shed had lovers herself she put the time sheets back and closed the drawer outside the air was cold but the city was ablaze with christmas decorations and she decided to walk home she slipped her walkman headset on then her earmuffs and began to walk briskly thinking about the evening ahead dinner with mitchell reece at least until the hiss of the cassette grew silent miles davis started into seven steps to heaven and the rest of the world was lost to taylor lockwood chapter nineteen well look at this mitchell reece couldve been a professional interior designer taylor would have thought hed have no time for decor or interest in the subject so when he opened his door and ushered her into the huge loft she exhaled a sharp surprised laugh she was looking at a single room probably twentyfive hundred square feet there was a separate elevated sleeping area with a brass railing around it containing an oak armoire and a matching dresser and a bed which caught her attention immediately it was dark mahogany with a massive headboard that would have dwarfed any smaller space the headboard was carved in a gothic style and the characters cut into the wood were cracked and worn she couldnt tell exactly what they were perhaps gargoyles and dragons she thought of the mythical creature in through the lookingglass beware the jabberwock my son the jaws that bite the claws that catch around the loft were plants sculpture antiques tall bookshelves tapestries pin spots shot focused streams of light onto small statues and paintings many of which looked ugly enough to be very valuable the walls were brick and plaster painted mottled white and gray and pink the floors were oak stained white if this boy cooks she joked to herself i may just reconsider my babybymail plan and marry him you did this just to impress me i know he laughed let me take your coat reece wore baggy pants and a blousy white shirt sockless slippers his hair was still damp from a shower taylor had chosen noncommittal vamp black stockings but shoes with low functional heels a black carolina herrera dress tight but highnecked cleavage a roommate had once bluntly assessed forget boobs taylor avoid lowcut but the rest of your body its to die for wear short and tight remember that short and tight taylor noted the sweep of recces eyes all along her body he was subtle but not subtle enough she caught him in reflection in one of the mirrors near the jabberwock bed okay ms westchester she thought to reeces mysterious girlfriend can you shoehorn into a dress like this she followed him across an oriental rug the dinner table had feet and on the side carved faces of the sun they were solemn your table looks unhappy he gets bored i dont have much company hell be happy tonight as reece took the wine shed brought she looked at him carefully and decided he wasnt very happy either his eyes were still bloodshot and he seemed to be forcing himself to relax to push the intruding distractions of the law firm away he walked into the kitchen area and put the chardonnay into a refrigerator she looked inside it contained nothing but wine you should try groceries sometime she said lettuce oranges you can even get chicken im told ready to cook wine cellar reece said laughing he pulled out a bottle of white a pulignymontrachet her fathers favorite burgundy taylor recalled reece added the fridges over there he pointed to a tall subzero then took two crystal goblets in one hand and carried the wine and a ceramic cooler out into the living area man she thought hes really slick at this he poured and they touched glasses to winning taylor held his eye for a moment and repeated the toast the wine was rich and soursweet more like a food than a drink the goblet was heavy in her hand they sat and he told her how hed found the loft it was raw space when hed moved in and hed had it finished himself the project had taken nearly a year because hed had three fullfledged trials that year and had been unable to meet with the contractors i slept in sawdust a lot he explained but i won the cases have you ever lost a trial she asked of course everybody loses trials i seem to win a few more than most people but thats not magic or luck preparation is the key and will to win preparation and will that could be your motto maybe i should get a crest i wonder what itd be in latin taylor rose and walked toward a long wooden shelf my mother she said would call this a knickknack shelf i used to think knickknack was french for small ugly ceramic poodle he laughed she found herself looking at an army of metal soldiers i collect them reece said winston churchill probably had the biggest collection in the world and malcolm forbess wasnt too shabby either ive only been at it for twenty years or so what are they tin lead taylor said one year my father got the idea that i should get soldiers not dolls for christmas i mustve been eight or nine he gave me bags and bags of these green plastic guys he gave me a b too so i nuked most of them and went back to barbie and pooh you have other things too like cannons and catapults everything soldiers horses cannons and caissons she sipped the wine and was thinking sometimes in life this craziness falls right on top of you and you find yourself almost floating up and away from your body like a guru or psychic looking down at yourself and all you can say is shit a brick this is so weird i mean here i am alice in wonderland in a fab loft next to a handsome man im playing detective with drinking hundreddollar wine and talking toy soldiers taylor told herself not under any circumstances to get drunk reece played with some of the figures i have a british square i made it when i was sixteen like a park like trafalgar square reece was laughing taylor british square a fighting formation you know gunga din kipling she said he nodded the ranks divided into two lines one stood and reloaded the other knelt and fired the fuzzywuzzies were the only warriors to break through the square the uh zulus african tribal warriors ah boer war that was twenty years later oh sure she said seriously nodding in recognition youre laughing at me arent you she shook her head but couldnt keep a straight face and said through the grin definitely he hit her playfully on the arm and let his hand pause on the thin cotton of her blouse for a moment he put on some music jazz any word about your demo tapes the responses aint been jimdandy it only takes one record company she shrugged and glanced at an antique clock eightthirty she could smell nothing simmering well scratch one he cant cook maybe they were going out but the door buzzer sounded excuse me he let a young man into the loft he nodded politely to taylor and from a large shopping bag took out plates wrapped in stippled foil reece set the table with bone china plates silver and a candlestick the portable butler said would you like me to pour the wine mr reece no thank you anyway robert reece signed the proffered slip of paper a bill changed hands then good night sir dinner turned out to be blini with beluga caviar and sour cream veal medallions with slivers of fresh truffles in a marsala sauce braised endive and cold marinated green beans no fake burgers and sprouts for this boy they sat at the table and began to eat reece said now tell me what youve found out about the note taylor organized her thoughts first somebody got into the computer and erased all the disbursements expenses and phone call logs for saturday and sunday all of them he winced she nodded all last week actually everything thatd link a particular person to the firm except the door card keys and the time sheets okay he nodded taking this in who can get into the system its not that hard you need an access card but itd be easy to steal one more of the wonderful wine hed opened a second bottle let me go through the suspects first thom sebastian he nodded go ahead well i fingerprinted your safe and found his on the top and side he laughed you did what i got a privateeye kit deerstalker cap and decoder ring the works i dusted the scene of the crime and came up with twentyfive latents thats prints to you fifteen completely unrecognizable the other ten most were partials but seven seem to be the same person you im pretty sure i dusted your coffee cup i owe you a new one by the way the powder didnt come off too well i threw it out i wondered what happened to it and three others a couple of prints are unidentified but there are a dozen or so thatre smooth smudges as if somebodyd worn gloves thomsre pretty clear thom reece frowned son of a bitch she said i dont think he actually broke into the safe from the position on the metal it looks like the guy who did that was the one wearing the gloves the pro but sebastian may have checked it out before or tried to open it that night and when he couldnt called in an expert is there any reason why hedve been going through your files hes worked for new amsterdam in the past though not on the hanover stiver deal not that ive heard about anyway hed have no business going through anybodys office without asking he laughed and looked at her admiringly fingerprints that never occurred to me she continued explaining to him that sebastian had lied about how late hed stayed at the club on saturday night and that shed confirmed he was in fact in the firm she told him too about bosk and dennis callaghan how theyd talked about stealing something from the firm and how they were going to spend their money she asked you ever hear the name callaghan in connection with the hanover stiver case no reece shook his head but what about sebastians motive hes risking prison just to get even with the firm why not the firm was his entire life besides hes got a dark side to him he was a process server in brooklyn and queens reece nodded yeah those guys are tough sebastians implicit threat echoed in her mind again she said i think he wants revenge but mostly i think he looks at the money hanoverd pay him to lose the note as something the firm owes him for not getting made partner think about it hes a product of hubbard white whichs been training him for six or seven years to go for the throat look only at the bottom line hes also been checking me out you she nodded hes got a little dossier on me why know your enemy she then continued remember i mentioned dudley well are you ready for this she told him about junie and the west side art and photography club whoa reece blurted that little girls a hooker dudley s mad theyll put him away forever for that statutory rape contributing to the delinquency and it looks like hes paying a thousand bucks a week cash for her you told me hes got money problems to start with thats his motive and as for being in the firm on saturday i know he was there and he told junie that some project he was working on was going to mean a lot of money i checked his time sheets and he didnt bill any time saturday or sunday so whatever he was doing at the firm then was personal taylor added now weve got a thirdparty candidate who sean lillick the paralegal hell hes been working for me on the case he knows all the details about the note but whats his motive also money i found thousands of dollars hidden in his apartment he didnt get it from a paralegals salary and he sure didnt make it doing that performance art crap of his but he wasnt in the firm when the note was stolen was he im not sure he did come in saturday morning according to his key entry card i assumed he left because he only billed a few hours to a client but he mightve stayed all night reece had a thought something interesting lillick hangs around with wendall clayton a lot she nodded shed seen them together but you know whats curious reece mused lillicks assigned to the litigation department not corporate whyd he be working for clayton i dont know a frown on the lawyers face lillickd be familiar with the st agnes files too he mightve fed clayton some information that led him to that surprise witness from san diego you think claytons behind that she asked reece shrugged st agnes is donalds client and sos new amsterdam bank all clayton cares about is getting the merger through and sabotaging burdicks clients is a pretty efficient way to do it he stood walked into the kitchen and returned with two glasses of cognac he handed one to taylor the liqueur leaving thin syrupy waves on the glass tomorrow wendalls having a party at his connecticut place why dont you come along you might be able to find something oh i couldnt go im just a paralegal its a firm function they just have it at his house a party for the new associates an annual thing you can come with me we shouldnt be seen together well split up once we get inside well get there late and just slip in he tipped his glass to her good job counselor they clinked glasses but she mustve winced a bit what counselor you dont like that my fathers pet name for me fingernails on the blackboard noted he said i can imagine its tough being samuel lockwoods child if you only knew she thought echoing the words shed just directed to her fathers phone message earlier that day they sipped the cognac and talked about the firm partners affairs who was gay who was on partnership track and who was not she supplied most of the information and was surprised he knew so little about the gossipy side of the firm and its politics it was more astonishing to her that he knew so little about the merger although the lawyers and staffers of hubbard white spent more hours debating the merger than billing time for clients reece seemed oblivious to the whole thing she mentioned the rumor that clayton had a german lawyer inquire about accounts burdick might have opened in switzerland really reece asked with what seemed unsophisticated surprise arent you worried about it taylor asked about whatll happen if wendall wins he laughed no doesnt make a bit of difference to me as long as i can try cases good cases thats all i care about whether its donald in charge or wendall or john perelli doesnt matter together they cleared the dishes he nodded toward the leather sofa and they walked over to it sitting and sinking into the deep supple piece of furniture there was a moment of quiet the ticking clock a siren far away a distant shout that was when he kissed her and she kissed him back they embraced for a moment his right hand sliding down the side of her face but coming to rest ambiguously at her collarbone his palm started downward but it stopped perhaps because he sensed something coming from her the reserve the caution that she in fact suddenly felt sorry he said im impulsive and pushy tell me to go to hell i would if i wanted to if you only knew he sat back and after a moment said theres something i wanted to say sure its nothing really but its been bugging me remember when i said i couldnt have lunch after the cross yesterday right she found her heart beating hard i didnt have a meeting she pictured the threehour lunch reference on the time sheet the flowers i went up to westchester taylor nodded said nothing he continued theres something i dont talk about too much my mothers in a home up there oh im sorry mitchell he was stoic but she believed she could see pain somewhere behind his eyes schizophrenia its pretty bad i go to see her a couple times a week sometimes she remembers me he smiled yesterday she was pretty good i took her some flowers and she went on and on about them for a long time shes on medication oh yeah and the nurses at the home are real good to her the thing is its hard for me to talk about it in fact youre the only one ive told she felt a burst of pleasure at this confidence even more than being singled out by reece to help him find the promissory note i won t say anything if theres anything i can do hey how bout just a kiss to forgive me for not being honest she laughed and squeezed his arm and leaned forward kissed him quickly then eased her arms around his neck and kept kissing him hard where are we going with this she wondered as she kissed and was kissed as she touched and was touched her mind counted her marriage proposals two the livein boyfriends three the men shed slept with thirteen she thought of the ones she felt mere fondness for whod claimed they were madly in love with her and the flip side the ones shed lusted or pined for who hadnt cared she existed but maybe this time would be different she thought maybe getting older maybe simply getting by surviving in this world had changed her made her more discerning given her better judgment maybe shed broken into a different place that wonderland where her father and mitchell reece resided where she was their equal but be careful she thought remember thom sebastians myth of the beautiful woman well beware the myth of the absolute moment a moment like this when we sit or lie close together muscles ticking limbs at their most relaxed bathed in the certainty of love the absolute moment when conversation soars confidences are shared coincidences between you and your lover pop up like crocuses in april the absolute moment when we forget that most loves arent forever that most words are mere vibrations of insubstantial air that most unions are a nest of comic and aching differences that no other animal in the world would tolerate let alone desperately pursue she eased back slightly wiped the war paint of lipstick off his cheek he glanced down at her empty glass he stood up and filled both of theirs again and returned sat down slouching back into the leather playing with the top button of his shirt his hair was mussed he tried to brush it back but the thick comma stayed put know what he asked whats that im glad about what taylor felt it then that unwinding feeling within her despite the keen warning to herself a moment ago the spring had been set loose was it going to be good or bad the time was coming soon quick as a wetleaf skid okay decide good or bad decide fast alice youve got about three minutes im glad we havent caught our thief yet i like working with you his voice was husky reece held his glass up come on this is the moment now you going or staying youve still got the power it hasnt tipped yet you can do it easy diffuse the whole thing thank him for dinner stand up thats all it would take one way or another decide in the end is this good or bad she lifted her glass too and tapped but as he sipped some of the cognac spilled onto the front of his shirt oh hell he muttered come on good or bad make it your decision choose here let me clean it up she said good or bad she thought that question to herself a dozen times in the space of five seconds or maybe two seconds or maybe just one but it never got answered his mouth closed on hers and his hands surprisingly large and strong for a bookish man were covering her breasts and she felt the heat in his ringers as they then slid inside her dress probing for fasteners taylor in turn sought the smooth cloth of his shirt gripped it hard and pulled him down on top of her good or bad good or bad this saturday night late donald burdick and bill stanley sat beside each other in tallbacked leather chairs and looked into the valet room of their private club on broad street it was in that room that every morning one of the club employees would iron the new york times international herald tribune and wall street journal for the members this had been a perk ever since the club had been founded in the mids at that time of course when new york city boasted more than a dozen papers the valet was busy all day long now however with no evening papers of worth the room was used at night only for its junction box to which telephones on long wires were connected when a call came in these phones were earned to members cellular phones were of course forbidden in the club burdick and stanley watched the poised black man in a dinner jacket now carrying one of these phones to burdick who took it with a nod of thanks the conversation lasted only four minutes burdick absorbed the information closed his eyes and thinking that in roman days the messenger would have been killed had he delivered news like this nonetheless politely thanked the caller he dropped the receiver into the cradle the valet appeared instantly and removed the phone what the hell was that stanley asked the lease burdick said shaking his head oh no stanley grumbled burdick nodded he did it somehow clayton deepsixed the lease the caller had been an underling of rothstems the head of the real estate syndicate that owned the building where hubbard white willis was located the syndicate had suddenly withdrawn from the negotiations for the expensive longterm lease and was going to let the current lease lapse this meant that it would now make much more financial sense to merge the firm with perelli and move into the midtown firms space damn burdick clenched his fist claytons telling jews what to do with their manhattan real estate stanley barked there was no need to lower his voice the only nonprotestant sect represented in the club was papist and none of the three catholic members was here tonight how the hell did he do it burdick didnt know and didnt care but as his wife had admitted not long ago he couldnt help but admire clayton he hadnt thought that the partner even knew about the negotiations let alone that he could put together some bribery or extortion plan to sabotage the lease this quickly now with the lease gone all burdick had left to use as leverage was urging mcmillan holdings to take a stand against the merger im going down to florida tomorrow he said mcmillan stanley asked burdick nodded their board meeting ill do whatever i have to to make sure they let perelli know where they stand thatll help some i guess then stanley muttered something that burdick couldnt hear what was that the partner asked him i said remember the days when all we had to do was get clients and practice law no burdick replied sourly that mustve been before my time chapter twenty the law professor and legal philosopher karl llewellyn wrote a book called the bramble bush the foliage in his title was a metaphor for the study and practice of law and his meaning was that this field in all its many incarnations is endless in that book he wrote that the only cure for law is more law by which he was suggesting that you cannot dabble at the profession when you are overwhelmed by the case the business deal the jurisprudential study when you are exhausted when you cannot bear the thought of proceeding one more moment you can find salvation only by pushing forward deeper into the tangle the law he was suggesting is an infinitely complex uncompromising mistress wendall clayton thought of professor llewellyns writing now as he sat across his desk from randy simms late sunday morning at the firm the smarmy young lawyer had just delivered troubling news they had managed to sabotage the longterm lease that burdick had been trying to put into place but some of the oldguard partners at the firm were refusing to vote in favor of the merger burdicks win in the st agnes trial had heartened them and a bit of cheerleading on bill stanleys part had gotten them to switch their votes back to burdicks camp which meant that there was now some doubt that clayton would have enough votes come tuesday for the merger to be approved how close is it clayton asked pretty evenly balanced right down the middle more or less then we have to make it less pretty even yessir stay on call ill be right back clayton rose and walked down the stairs to the paralegal pen to his surprise he found sean lillick was not alone the pretty boy was standing with a girl another paralegal in the firm clayton didnt understand what lillick saw in her she seemed shy timid unassertive a bit well rotund too a consolation fuck at best when they saw him coming they stepped apart and clayton noticed though he pretended not to that theyd been fighting about something the girls eyes were red from crying and lillicks otherwise pasty face was flushed sean the partner said the boy nodded hi wendall and you are carrie mason ah i hope im not interrupting anything clayton said no not at all carrie said quickly we were just talking ah talking well if youll excuse us carrie sean and i have some business neither of them moved lillick looked at the floor carrie cleared her throat and said weve got some documents to copy for the sci deal clayton didnt say anything he just stared from one to the other lillick said to her why dont you get started she hesitated then hefted an armful of papers and walked moodily down the hall on her solid legs clayton said youll be at my party tonight wont you carrie my place in connecticut the girl looked back and said to the partner yeah ill be there im so pleased the partner said smiling when shed vanished clayton said to the young man weve got some problems about the vote i need some information good information and i need it fast the votes day after tomorrow it was of course the paralegals and the support staff who had the best access to information at the firm as with the butlers and maids on upstairs downstairs the higher echelons of the firm babbled like schoolgirls in front of the hired help at hubbard white willis this is why clayton had swooped down on poor lillick last year and began bribing him for information lillick swallowed and looked down i think ive already done enough youve been very helpful the partner agreed smoothly i dont want to help you anymore he looked in the direction carrie had disappeared clayton nodded there were times to push and times to placate i know its been tough for you but everything youve done has been for the good of everybody who works here he rested his hand on the boys shoulder were very close sean close to winning and if we win well thatll be rewarding for the whole firm you included when the paralegal said nothing more clayton said thereve been some defections i need any unusual phone calls that burdick mightve made travel plans anything like that hes a desperate man and desperate men are his enemys best friends know why because they make mistakes you understand that yessir youre grasping it youre committing it to memory yes good find something and itll be worth a lot of money i mean fivefigure money clayton said nothing further but just leveled his eyes at the boy after thirty seconds lillick said slowly let me look around see if i can find something sort of helpful ah wonderful clayton said actually though it really has to be very helpful i dont have any time left for subtleties every color clashed taylor lockwood looked over the apparel of the crowd milling in the living room of wendall claytons country home in redding connecticut she saw plaid she saw lemon yellow with orange she saw lime shirts with red slacks she saw madras her mother had told her about madras in the ancient regime of the sixties starburst tiedye marked the hippies madras flagged the nerds to be fair the collision of hues was almost exclusively on the frames of the older lawyers the younger crowd of associates were in chinos and izod shirts or skirts and sweaters a lot of pearls a lot of blond hair a lot of pretty faces it was sunday around fivethirty and reece and taylor had cruisecontrolled their way here along the wide parkway in a car hed rented they had found claytons place after asking directions twice and after theyd parked had walked into the house without knocking they stood unnoticed in the entrance foyer were overdressed she observed reece pulled his tie off and stuffed it in his pocket how do i look like an overdressed lawyer who lost his tie he said ill take the first floor you take the second okay she said quickly then she hesitated whats wrong reece asked were kind of like burglars arent we he recited quickly burglary is entering a dwelling without permission with the intention of committing a felony he gave her a fast smile weve got permission to be here therefore its not burglary if you say so reece disappeared and taylor found the bar the bartender was doing a big business with mugs of sweet mintlaced southsiders taylor shook her head at the offered drink and got a glass of stags leap chardonnay before the first sip a man was right beside her gripping her arm thom sebastian she shivered hearing in her minds ear sebastians comment to bosk his warning not to get too interested in her the dangers it implied hey the pudgy associate said you recovered okay recovered from a night out with me nothing to report to any official governmental bodies excellent his eyes were evasive almost as if he had something he wanted to confess to her after a glance around the room he asked casually you doing anything tomorrow night what was on his mind i think ive got some time free maybe dinner sure she said great ill call you he gazed at her expressionless for a moment and she believed suddenly as she looked into his cryptic eyes that if he was the thief he wanted to come clean with her and if he confessed and produced the note what then she wondered reece or her father well they would of course destroy sebastians life force him into leaving the practice of law in new york but her inclination would be to reward a confession with anonymity and to let him go but as she watched him walk down a corridor in search of more liquor she realized that she was getting ahead of herself find the note first then well consider justice taylor made her way through the hallway as she did she noticed an older woman scrutinizing her carefully with a look of almost amused curiosity the woman reminded her of ada smith bosks mother taylor tried to avoid her but once their eyes met and held she felt the power of a silent summons and she remained where she was as the woman approached youre taylor lockwood the woman said yes im vera burdick donalds wife nice to see you taylor said recalling the name from the newspaper article her father had just faxed to her they shook hands the woman must have seen the surprise in taylor s face surprise that the burdick camp would be represented in enemy territory vera said donald had business tonight he asked me to come in his stead its a nice party taylor said wendall was kind enough to donate his house for the evening he does the same for the summer associates in july its a sort of freshair outing for lawyers silence filled the small space between them taylor broke the stalemate with well i think ill mingle a little vera burdick nodded as if her examination of taylor had produced all the information she needed a pleasure seeing you again dear and good luck taylor watched the partners wife join a cluster of associates nearby good luck as the womans voice rose in laughter taylor started again for the stairs shed gotten halfway across the hall when she heard another voice a mans voice soft directed at her and who are you again her neck hair bristled taylor turned to look into the face of wendall clayton she was at first surprised that he was only a couple of inches taller than she then she noticed that he was much more handsome up close than he seemed from a distance and then her mind went blank for three or four seconds she was utterly without a conscious thought claytons eyes were the reason they were the eyes of a man who knew how to control people a man to whom it would be excruciating to say no even if he made his demands with silence a man exactly like her father pardon taylor asked he smiled i asked who you were again she thought the same person ive always been no again about it hotshot then she got lost in his eyes once more and didnt try a snappy comeback she said taylor lockwood im wendall clayton she said yes i know id thank you for inviting me wendall but im afraid i crashed are you going to kick me out she found a smile somewhere and slipped it on reminding herself to resist the urge to call him mr clayton on the contrary youre probably the only person in this crew worth talking to i dont think id go that far he took her arm she had never been touched in this way his grip wasnt a disciplinarians or a friends or a lovers in the contraction of the muscles was a consuming pressure of authority as if hed squeezed her soul after a moment he lowered his hand clayton said would you like a tour of the house sure its an authentic s i taylor youre here carrie mason trotted up to them hello carrie welcome clayton took carrie masons hardpumping hand seans not here carrie hesitated and said no he had something else to do it seemed there was a darkness in her face ah maybe one of his performances carrie taylor said wendall was just going to give me a tour of his house join us sure the chubby girl said clayton didnt appreciate that they were now a threesome but his reaction vanished as vera burdick walked past the woman stopped and extended a hand to clayton he smiled and shook it graciously clasping hers in both of his vera how good to see you again donald made it i hope unfortunately not that fundraiser at city hall when the mayor summons you clayton said the governor actually she corrected you better go taylor felt the tension between them like sparking wires vera burdick clearly detested the partner and while clayton obviously returned the feeling it was she who easily held his eye and the lawyer who looked defensively away as he made trivial conversation in this tableau taylor recognized a truth about clayton while the partner knew men and how to handle them he was only comfortable with women he could sexualize or control as his lessers she was nearly queasy observing a man like this feeling threatened a powerful man and considering that he might have engineered the theft of the new amsterdam note one who was quite dangerous ill leave you to your friends vera said the disdain visible like breath on a cold spring day a glance at taylor and carrie a meaningless smile clayton said i hope donald enjoys the fundraiser donald youre white as snow damn it man youve got to get more fresh air brought your racket i hope burdick leaned against the railing of the penthouse suite in the fleetwood hotel in miami beach and looked at the cool disk of the setting sun more business than pleasure today im afraid steve burdick was tired the firms private canadair jet hadnt been available some maintenance problem and hed had to fly down to miami in a commercial airliner first class of course but hed still had to stand in lines and then thered been a delay on the runway that put him an hour off schedule hed arrived exhausted but had ordered the car service to bring him directly here before checking in to a room steve nordstrom shaking martinis like an ace bartender was the president of mcmillan holdings he was thick and square with gray hair trimmed so impeccably it might have been injectionmolded in the companys teterboro plant and was wearing a purple izod shirt and white slacks drink burdick didnt want alcohol but he knew he would take the offered glass from nordstrom a man of fifty whose face was already in bloom from the damaged blood vessels hows the board meeting going burdick asked nordstrom licked martini off his finger he grinned happily were cutting a melon this year donald three sixtythree a share ah burdick said approvingly you read the journal you read the times everybodys cratering but us hey tomorrow were meeting on the new industry association you want to sit in cant but tell your people to watch what they say i told you that justice is heating up again and antitrust is looking at pricefixing dont even mention dollars no numbers at all remember what happened in always looking out for your client donald nordstroms question contained the silent modifiers biggest and most lucrative they sat down at a table the bellboy who had been waiting patiently brought out lobster salads in half pineapples and set them on the balcony table the men ate the salad and raisin rolls the lawyer struggling to down the food which he had no appetite for while they talked about vacations and family and house prices and the administration in washington when they were finished eating burdick accepted another martini and pushed away from the table which of our boys is down here helping you with the board meeting steve from hubbard white stan johannsen is here and thom sebastian did most of the advance work last week hes covering the front in new york i understand he didnt make partner what happened hes a good man burdick looked out over the flat scenery at a line of cars shooting flashes of glare from the expressway after a moment he realized he had been asked a question and said i dont remember exactly about thom he wished bill stanley were with him or vera he wanted allies nearby nordstrom frowned but thats not what youre here for is it about the board meeting no steve its not burdick stood and paced hands clasped behind his back hubbard whites been doing your legal work for lets see thirtyfive years about that before my time steve id ask you to keep what im going to tell you between you and me and ed gliddick for the time being at least no bullshit between us never has been the businessman looked the partner over coyly thiss about the merger i assume yes and theres more to it than meets the eye burdick explained to him about clayton and his planned massacre after the merger was completed nordstrom said so youd be out thats crap youve made the firm what it is you are hubbard white burdick laughed i hate to put it this way steve but mcmillan is our largest single source of revenue well you give us good service and were happy to pay for it so when you or ed talk partners at the firm listen and you want me to talk against the merger itd be bad for you and bad for dozens of other clients wendall clayton has no vision of what a law firm should be he wants to turn us into some kind of assembly line profits all he thinks about nordstrom picked up a fat piece of lobster and sucked it clean of dressing then chewed and swallowed it slowly whats the time frame clayton ramrodded the merger vote through early itll be this tuesday day after tomorrow fuck me nordstrom said that man is crazy he probed for more lobster he settled for raisins eds in a dinner meeting right now but he should be free in an hour or so ill have him call and well have afterdinner drinks about ten or so by the pool over there dont worry donald well work something out chapter twentyone clayton moved them quickly through his old manse like a tour guide goosed by a tight schedule it was a rambling house big though the rooms themselves were small and cockeyed beams were uneven floorboards sprung much of the furniture was painted in drab colonial colors the gewgaws were of hammered tin and wicker and carved wood he led them upstairs taylor pretended to be studying portraits of horses shaker furniture and armoires while in fact she looked for places where he might have hidden information about hanover stiver or the note she glanced into a small room that seemed to be an office and saw a desk are you with us taylor clayton asked and she hurried to join them he continued the tour mark twains house the house he died in isnt far from here are you a son of the american revolution carrie asked clayton spoke with a feigned indignity that rested on real pride the revolutionaries they were newcomers my family was one of the original settlers of new nederlands we came over in are you dutch no my ancestors were huguenots taylor said i always got those mixed up in school the huguenots and the hottentots clayton smiled coldly ooooh doesnt like potshots into the family tree the huguenots were french protestants he explained they were badly persecuted in the s cardinal richelieu ordered a siege of la rochelle a large huguenot town my family escaped and settled here new rochelle new york by the way is named after la rochelle carrie asked what did your ancestors do when they got here there was considerable prejudice against the huguenots even here we were barred from many businesses my family became artisans silversmiths mostly paul revere was one of us but my family were always better merchants than craftsmen we moved into manufacturing and then finance though that field had largely been preempted by other groups for a moment he looked wily and taylor suspected he was suppressing an opinion about early jewish settlers my family he continued ended up in manhattan and stayed there upper east side i was born within a fiveblock radius of my fathers and grandfathers birthplaces that touched taylor you dont see that much anymore today everybodys spread all over the world you shouldnt let that happen clayton said sincerely your family history is all you have you should keep your ancestry and be proud of it this year im steward of the french society carrie of the front row in law school blinked oh ive heard of that sure clayton said to taylor after the holland society its the most prestigious of the hereditary societies in new york the chubby paralegal was impressed but another need intruded say mr clayton wheres the little girls room oh honey dont fail me now taylor wanted carrie to keep clayton busy giving her a chance to take a look in the office but he said weve been having problems with the one up here why dont you go downstairs well meet you there in a bit carrie trotted off and it was then that taylor realized they had ended the tour at claytons bedroom the room was dramatic filled with ralph lauren rust and red florals englishhunt green brass this was the room of a nobleman beware the jabberwock my son clayton closed the door youre very attractive taylor sighed doesnt go much for subtlety does he she said i should be getting downstairs he took her hand to her astonishment she let him and the next thing she knew some undefinable pressure overwhelmed her she found herself sitting on the bed next to him wendall look at me taylor did feeling a growing power from the partner a magnet tugging at her soul and at everything around her it seemed to taylor that her hair actually stirred in this invisible wind she thought of the playingcard soldiers swirling around alice beware the wendall i want to tell you one thing he said calmly this has to be completely clear whatever happens or doesnt happen has no affect on your career at hubbard white is that understood she pulled her arm away i dont even know you ive never even spoken to you before but she was shocked to hear that her words seemed weak as if she were wavering he shrugged spoken to me i dont want to have a discussion i want to make love to you there was no physical impediment to her leaving he wasnt even standing in her way one foot then the other and she could troop right out the door yet she didnt clayton crossed his legs he brushed the tassel of his hair off his forehead i have commitments she explained no no no dont say that youre meeting his argument its like making excuses to your father tell him to fuck off forget who he is forget the case just say it now fuck off fuck off say it well taylor we all have commitments thats not really the issue she felt her throat thicken dont swallow its a weakness she swallowed we dont even know each other clayton smiled shaking his head hey look i dont want to marry you i want to make love to you thats all two adults im telling you that youre an attractive woman i have to go its not a compliment he continued its an observation i know how to make love to women im good at it dont you find me attractive thats not the point so you do he said quickly he stroked the bed and repeated i want to make love with you harmless and simple taylor smiled you dont want to make love at all you want to fuck me no he whispered harshly then he smiled i want us to fuck together mistake girl he likes dirty talk look he waved his hand in front of his crotch like a magician he was erect you did this not everybody does she found herself leaning back first her palms on the rich bedspread then her elbows do you know the first thing i noticed about you clayton whispered touching a renegade strand of her hair your eyes even from across the room she rolled onto her side she glanced down between his legs and said youre a pretty gifted man wendall i would have thought that with all the excitement at the firm youd be more distracted he hesitated then asked excitement the merger he didnt move for a moment shed thrown him off stride he laughed seductively ive got a pretty big appetite taylor scanned his face which was no more than twelve inches from hers i read somewhere that hunters make love before the hunt she said sex is supposed to steady the hand she shook her head me i think its dissipating ah dissipate me dissipate me but the words fell short of their intended playfulness and he sounded like a college boy making an inappropriate joke and suddenly the balance of this contest shifted barely to her he whispered lie down put your head on the pillow he spoke in a mesmerizing voice and taylor was suddenly aware of his penis pressing through layers of cloth against her leg clayton said i have some toys do you i can make you feel very very good like youve never felt before she laughed and more power slipped to her side of the board when the spell wasnt working his lines began to sound silly she asked why do you hate donald burdick im not interested in talking about him or about the merger why not id rather make love to you the merger is all everybodys talking about are you worried about your job you wont have to be i promise you that he said i havent worried about a job for years im mostly just curious why you dislike donald burdick so much she sat up clayton seemed befuddled the evidence of his passion hadnt diminished but he seemed uncertain as if he had met and overcome all types of reluctance in seducing women over the years yet had suddenly run into a new defense a barrage of questions go on she said tell me why well clayton finally offered i dont dislike donald personally hes one of the most charming men i know socially i admire him hes a fine representative of old money the rumor is that you want to destroy him clayton considered his answer i hear lots of rumors at the firm i suspect those that i hear arent any more accurate than the ones you hear the merger is solely business destroying people is far too timeconsuming finally the partners spell broke completely taylor lockwood rolled off the bed and ran her fingers through her hair you should go downstairs i think you are the host after all clayton tried one last time but his hand strayed across the bulging front of his slacks you know wendall taylor said smiling thats the best compliment ive had in months does a girls heart good but if youll excuse me after leaving the bedroom taylor walked into the upstairs bathroom which she noticed seemed to be in perfect working order there she waited until clayton was out of sight then she slipped into his office inside in addition to the desk were an armchair a victorian tea serving table several floor lamps two large armoires there were no closets she turned on a lamp and pushed the door partially closed the desk was unlocked its cubbyholes were filled with hundreds of slips of paper bank statements canceled checks memos notes personal bills receipts taylor sighed at the volume of material shed have to look through then sat in the redleather chair and started going through the items one by one shed been doing this for fifteen minutes when she heard a voice in the doorway say ah here you are the man speaking was wendall clayton chapter twentytwo taylor spun around and stood up knocking a stack of papers to the floor the sheets spread like spilled water wendall clayton was outside the door talking to someone else just out of his line of sight she reached toward the papers then heard clayton say lets go inside here for a minute shall we desperately she kicked the papers under the desk they disappeared except for the corner of one letter she reached down for it but the door was swinging open taylor leapt behind the largest armoire she pressed herself flat against the wall her head pressing painfully into the hard cold plaster another voice spoke a mans voice one she recognized ralph dudley asked what is it exactly you wanted to see me about wendall the door closed clayton said have a seat is something wrong claytons voice was curious i dont remember this light being on taylor eased back harder against the wall silence what were they doing could they see the tips of her shoes the corner of the paper under the desk was the chair shed sat in still warm clayton said ralph youre part of i guess id call it the old guard the oldboy network at the firm i go back a ways thats true you and donald started at about the same time didnt you bill stanley too and lamar fredericks i see you at the dac with joe wilkins and porter quite a bit dont i yes we go there often what do you enjoying yourself tonight are you quite wendall the old partners voice was filled with anxiety as clayton asked these pleasant questions with a slightly sadistic edge silence feet shifting clayton continued young people here tonight lots of young people its funny isnt it ralph when i was their age i was making fifty seventyfive dollars a week these youngsters make ninety thousand dollars a year amazing wendall is there something you want ralph i want you to vote in favor of the merger on tuesday thats what i want a long pause the old mans voice was trembling when he said i cant wendall you know that if the merger goes through i lose my job donald loses his a lot of people do youll be well provided for ralph a good severance i cant i cant afford to retire no of course not youve got expenses dudley sounded very cautious now thats right it costs a lot to live here manhattan most expensive city on earth im sorry wendall ill have to say no to the merger silence again taylor imagined dudleys thoughts racing to catch up with claytons taylors however had already arrived at their sad destination you dont mind blunt talk clayton asked of course noti appreciate candor and if you dont vote in favor of the merger ill go public with your affair with a sixteenyearold girl the choked laugh didnt mask the despair what are you talking about ralph i respect your intelligence i hope youll respect mine the little whore the one you dress up and parade around as your granddaughter which makes it all the more disgusting you taylor heard the slap of a blow a laugh of surprise from clayton feet dancing in the awkward shuffle of wrestling finally a sad desperate groan from dudley a sound filled with pain and hate and hopelessness clayton laughed again really ralph are you all right there sit down now are you hurt dont touch me dudley said his voice cracking the sounds of the older mans sobbing echoed softly in the room clayton said patiently lets not be emotional theres no reason for me to tell anyone lets negotiate a little bit youre the firms charmer arent you youre suave debonair youre a holdout from the days when a lawyers manners were as important as his intelligence so now hows this you and three of your cronies switch your votes in favor of the merger and i wont share your secret three others say joe porter pick somebody else but heres the good part you bring me any more and ill kick in fifty thousand each to your severance package that should keep you in teenage pussy for another year or so youre vile dudley spat out more vile than you clayton asked i wonder the votes day after tomorrow ralph why dont you think about it claytons was the voice of luxurious moderation just think about it its your decision come on go downstairs have a drink relax if you only understood claytons voice cut through the room like a knife oh but thats the point ralph i cant understand and no one else will either the door opened two pairs of feet receded both slowly one pair in triumph one in despair but the sound they made was the same still in the quiet den taylor was concentrating on a single noise rhythmic and soft she had stayed here hiding behind the armoire after the partners had left because clayton had remained upstairs shed heard his voice from nearby then after five minutes or so the sound began what is that a voice chanting primitive music she couldnt place it at first it seemed very familiar but she associated it with an entirely different place rhythmic and soft no couldnt be she walked to the far wall and pressed her head against the plaster again the sound was coming from the other side claytons bedroom oh taylor realized thats the sound of course not one voice but two the nature of the activity didnt surprise taylor much considering what she now knew about wendall clayton what did surprise her however was that the other participant was carrie mason who was contributing half of the sound effects fuck me fuck me fuck me im almost there yeah yeah yeah carrie may have finished quickly but it took clayton considerably longer long enough in fact for taylor to go through the partners desk carefully the sound track conveniently helped her gauge how much time she had she found only one thing that interested her an invoice for a security firm the bill was for ongoing services which had begun last month the job description was as directed by client she debated stealing it what would her detective friend john silbert hemming do hed use a spy camera she guessed but illequipped taylor lockwood did the next best thing she carefully copied all the information and put the invoice back downstairs she noticed the crowd had dwindled considerably as youd expect for a sunday night party only the hardcore partyers remained thom sebastian for instance who swooped in for another sloppy bear hug she ducked away from it he said goodbye and reiterated his dinner invitation for tomorrow taylor ambled through the house aiming toward the buffet and listening to the snatches of muted often drunken conversation hes going to do it for sure next month were going to be hubbard white willis sullivan perelli youre out to lunch dude no way burdick let it happen do you realize the vote is tuesday day after tomorrow you hear about the detective that was going through burdicks swiss accounts you hear burdick had somebody check claytons law review article to see if he plagiarized thats bullshit you want to talk bullshit this merger is bullshit nobodys getting any work done wheres donald he doesnt need to be here he sent himmler instead who his wife see burdick would charm a man out of his balls verad just cut em off you know the stories about her dont you lady macbeth taylor noticed that burdicks wife was no longer here she then surveyed the long table where thered once sat mounds of caviar roast beef steak tartare and sesame chicken all that now remained was broccoli taylor lockwood hated broccoli on the patio deck of the fleetwood hotels penthouse on the miami beach strip ed gliddick sent a golf ball near the putting cup embedded in the roofs astroturf hell he said of the miss and looked at the trim young man near him who watched the shot without emotion standing ramrodstraight he offered gliddick no false compliments and said only i play tennis not golf the man was randall simms iii wendall claytons protégé it was he whod pirated the hubbard white willis chartered jet to beat donald burdick down to florida to meet with the executives of mcmillan holdings while burdick himself was cooling his heels with the secondincommand of the company steve nordstrom simms had been meeting with gliddick the chairman of the board and ceo of mcmillan mcmillan was a company that did nothing but own other companies which either manufactured obscure industrial parts or provided necessary though obscure services to other businesses or in turn owned other companies or portions of them the vagaries of this structure and function however were not to suggest that gliddick didnt know how to satisfy a market need when he saw one mcmillan was consistently in the top twenty of the most profitable companies in the world at sixtyfive gliddick was stooped and paunchy amidships his ruddy skin was wrinkled from years of sun on golf courses and tennis courts around the world sparse gray hair a hook of a nose so he said to simms wendall didnt come down to see me he sent you instead simms said nothing gliddick held up a hand which means only one thing youre the muscle right unsmiling simms folded his arms and watched gliddick miss another easy putt wendall wanted a little distance between himself and what im going to say to you thiss all about that fucking merger isnt it id suggest we go inside simms said somebody could have an antenna trained on us they really make those things you know theyre not just in the movies i know gliddick walked into the room shut the window and drew the curtains simms mixed whiskey sours for them both gliddick wondered how this man whom hed never met had known that this was his drink the chairman sipped the sweet concoction you know donald burdicks meeting with steve nordstrom right now we know we so what is it that you want i mean wendall wants we want you to let it be known around the firms ours and john perellis that you want the merger to go through why would we not want it to go through simms said bluntly donald and his cronies wont be there afterward ah gliddick nodded i see you might feel some loyalty to him simms said fuck i do feel loyalty to him of course you do youve been friends for years but putting that aside for a moment lets talk about why you would want the firms to merge simms said this is one slick boy i like him gliddick thought but immediately gave up the idea of trying to wrest him away from hubbard white to work for mcmillan wendall clayton was not somebody you stole employees from simms continued weve gone over your billings ed burdicks robbing you blind your legal costs are totally out of control youre paying two hundred bucks an hour for firstyear associates who know shit youre paying for limo deliveries when messengers can take public transportation youre paying premium bonuses for routine legal work if you help the merger along well pare your expenses by an easy five million a year five five and if the merger goes through perelli can take over your labor law work right now youve got mavern simpson handling it and frankly theyre idiots they didnt do shit to keep the unions out of your subs oregon and washington state operations perellis the toughest labor lawyer in new york hell fuck your unions in the ass gliddick shook his head donald was on our board for i dont know how long hes got friends all over the company therere a lot of people wont take it kindly that weve sold him out kindly simms said the word as if it were in a foreign language well loyaltys important but it works both ways id think youd have to earn loyalty and do you think a lawyer who misses a takeover plan against his client deserves it a whatre you talking about theres a rumor only a rumor but wendall and i think its valid were always hearing that hell we beat projections every quarter last year everybodyd love to acquire us but does everybody contact your institutional investors on the sly gliddicks glass froze halfway to his mouth who gci in toronto wemraub that fucking jew prick a glance to simms to see if the young man was semitic but the results of the scan came back reassuringly aryan i saw him just last week in london he gave me the great stone face simms continued were thinking four months till a tender offer if you wait youll pay a takeover firm a million or two to defend perelli can preempt it for a quarter of that and he can handle it in a way that your stockholders and key employees wont get nervous and bail out thats what he does best donald doesnt know about it nope we found out through perelli he finished his drink simms poured another randy i dont know i cant argue with what youre saying with the numbers its a moral decision i dont like moral decisions maybe there was a knock on the door a young woman blond about fivetwo wearing a short leather miniskirt and tight white blouse walked into the suite mr simms ive got the file you asked for thank you jean he took a thick manila folder jean this is mr gliddick they shook hands gliddicks eyes skimmed the white silk over her breasts the lacy bra clearly visible beneath jeans an assistant with a firm we use down here occasionally nice to meet you jean simms tapped the folder theres a lot of other material in there about how the mergerd be good for your company ed he looked at his watch say ive got a conference call scheduled now ill make it from my room so i dont bother you look over that stuff think about what im saying sure gliddick said eyes still scanning jeans figure she smiled broadly at the paunchy businessman say jean simms said you know miami right well now ive lived here all my life came the lilting accent then maybe you could help mr gliddick figure out a place where he and i could go listen to some music jazz or cuban or something id be happy to the young woman sat on the bed and picked up an entertainment guide her skirt hiked up high if thats all right with him id appreciate your input gliddick said simms said were offduty now jean how bout you fix yourself a drink and another one for mr gliddick too thanks randy i believe i will ill be back in about an hour simms said thatd be fine gliddick replied setting the file on the table and watching jean scoot pertly off the bed and walk to the bar somehow her shoes had come off in the process moral decision as simms was about to step through the door gliddick said one thing randy the tall lawyer turned maybe you could call first before coming back to the room not a problem ed at pm as reece was accelerating south onto the highway that would take them from claytons connecticut home back to the city taylor stretched out in the reclining seat of the rented lincoln she was listening to the moan of the transmission the flabby suspension swayed her nearly to sleep shed told him about claytons blackmailing dudley and then about the invoice shed found clientdirected security services reece asked then he nodded a euphemism for industrial espionage good job finding that how much was it for two thousand a month thats pretty low for stealing a note maybe its for spying on people for the merger did you hear the talk at the party my god these are firstyear associates and all they were talking about was the merger wendalls out on a limb if he doesnt get it through hes lost a lot of credibility reece laughed ha if he doesnt get the merger through hes lost his job he looked over and caught her in the midst of another huge yawn you okay i used to sleep i tried it once reece said shrugging it wears off he reached over and began massaging her neck oh thats nice she closed her eyes you ever made love in a car never have i never have either ive never even been to a drivein movie reece said one time when i was in high school i jesus a huge jolt taylors eyes snapped open and she saw a white car directly in front of them itd veered into their lane reece swerved onto the shoulder but the lincoln slipped off the flat surface and started down a steep embankment mitchell taylor screamed and threw her arms up as trees and plants raced at them at seventy miles an hour the undercarriage scraping and groaning metal and plastic supports popping apart then brush and reeds were flashing past the cars windows reece called that car that car he ran us off the road he ran us he was braking trying to grip the wheel as it spun furiously back and forth the front tires buffeted by rocks and branches the car slowed as it chewed through the underbrush the buffcolored rushes and weeds whipping into the windshield taylors head slammed against the window she was stunned she felt nausea and fear and a huge pain in her back then they were slowing as the slope flattened out the car was still skewing but the wheels started to track coming under control she heard reece say reverently son of a bitch and saw him smile as the car started a slow skid on the slippery vegetation thirty miles an hour twentyfive okay okay reece muttered to himself he steered carefully into the skids braking lightly regaining control losing and then regaining it okay come on he whispered seductively to the huge lincoln the car slowed to ten miles an hour taylor took his arm and whispered oh mitchell they smiled at each other giddy with relief but as she looked at his face his smile vanished god he shoved his foot onto the brake with all his weight taylor looked forward and she saw the brush disappear as they broke out of the foliage and dropped over a ridge onto a steep incline that led down to the huge reservoir a half mile across its surface broken with choppy waves the locked wheels slid without resistance along the frost and dewy leaves taylor he called were going in were going in with a last huge rocking jolt the scenery and the distant gray horizon disappeared a wave of black oily water crashed into the windshield and started coming into the car from a dozen places at once chapter twentythree at eleven that night in miami the phone in donald burdicks hotel room rang the partner had been waiting for ed gliddick all evening and had fallen asleep fully dressed on the couch in his room yes hello he asked groggily mr burdick a womans voice asked thats right whos this my names jean im calling for mr gliddick jean burdick wondered who was this ed gliddick had had the same secretary helen for twenty years and never traveled anywhere without her yes jean well ive been waiting to see ed all night is he all right mr gliddick asked me to call you and apologize he wont be able to see you im afraid burdick was angry and disappointed but he said well its late anyway we can meet for breakfast ill actually sir im afraid he wont be able to see you at all this trip hes got meetings nonstop for the next two days and then hes got to get home to battle creek burdick closed his eyes and sighed so ambushed by clayton yet again i see by any chance was there another attorney from hubbard white willis in town tonight i wouldnt know sir okay burdick said wearily realizing it would be pointless to call steve nordstrom the coward wouldnt even pick up the phone if you could deliver a message to ed for me id be happy to and you too brutus do you have that uhm i do sir will he know what it means im sure he will burdick dropped the phone in the cradle then picked it up once more to call his wife in front of them the huge reservoir extended in faintly lapping waves to the trees on the opposite shore the moon reflected off the water broken into a thousand crescents on the textured surface it wouldve been quite romantic if they hadnt been wet and freezing taylor lockwood and reece sat in the front seat of the rental lincoln legs crossed to keep their feet out of the six inches of water that filled the bottom of the cars interior after the skid to the bottom of the hill with its dramatic conclusion a braking splash like a disneyland ride the lincoln had settled into about eighteen inches of water and stopped sinking the reservoir was huge but here apparently very shallow theyd laughed edgy and a bit hysterical but then the humor wore off quickly when they realized that while they could open the door theyd have a thirty or fortyfoot trek through freezing water up to a deserted road where theyd have to wait for help with no way to keep warm reece called the police on his cell phone and then they curled their legs up and huddled in their coats the dispatcher had assured them that a squad car and rescue truck would be there in ten minutes but that had been sometime ago and since reece had been unable to tell them exactly where theyd run off the road he guessed their rescue might not be imminent even now who was it taylor asked the thief i assume i didnt get a good look at him middleaged guy white hat collar turned up i didnt even see what kind of car it was just a white streak an accident no way reece answered he was steering for us who was at the party whod know we were there reece shrugged thom sebastian dudley and most of claytons little goosestepping clones except randy simms then he fell silent for a moment finally saying im thinking its time to tell the police what happened tell them everything no she shook her head i didnt think this was going to happen taylor i never thought it could turn violent she said it wouldnt make sense to kill us thatd bring the police in for sure and he doesnt want that any more than we do he didnt know wed go off the road he was just scaring us reece considered taylor scooted closer to him were almost there i can feel it the trials day after tomorrow lets just hold out until then she took his head in both her hands just until then i dont know but he was weakening she repeated just until then though when she said the words this time they were not spoken as a question but as a command he opened his mouth to protest but she shook her head and touched his lips with her finger he leaned close following the motion of her finger to her own lips they kissed hard and their arms wound around each other a moment later this embrace was interrupted by several probing flashlights their fierce halogen beams converging on the car as reece and taylor leapt apart they could hear a laugh and an amused voice whoa lookit that car looks like its floating hank lookit i mean you ever seen anything like that to which another voice replied i surely havent not in a month of sundays at lunch on monday the day before the new amsterdam trial taylor lockwood sat in mc sorleys old ale house in manhattan and watched john silbert hemming down a mug of ale he may notve been the traditional private eye who tossed back scotch on the job but this boy loved his beer the tall man finished his sixth mug of dark brew and called for three more theyre small true they were though taylor was having trouble with her second shed drunk more wine than shed intended at claytons and had not gotten much sleep thanks to the dip in the reservoir and reeces presence in bed next to her she told hemming about the supreme court case that required the pub to allow women in for many years it had been a menonly establishment some achievement hemming muttered looking at the carvedup bare wood tables the wishbone collection growing a dark fur of dust and the crowds of young frat boys shouting and hooting he glowered at a drunk beerspilling student stumbling toward them the boy caught the huge mans gaze and changed direction quickly with some true curiosity in his voice the detective asked taylor are we having a date i dont think so ah he said and nodded how did the fingerprints work out not bad ill send you a postcard if you want ill show you how to do planters vegetable prints very good but no feet ms lockwood taylor feet taylor handed him the piece of paper with the information from the invoice shed found in wendall claytons desk john have you ever heard of this company he read triple a security theyre not around new york but we can assume its a sleazy outfit whys that its an old trick to get in the front of the phone book to have your listing first name your company with a lot of as you want me to check it out can you sure a waiter carrying fifteen mugs in one hand swooped past and dropped two more unaskedfor would somebody from a security service say this disreputable triple a outfit commit a crime jaywalking worse stealing apples that category more valuable than fruit he sat up and towered over her for an instant then hunched forward again at the big security firms like our place absolutely not you commit a crime you lose your license and your surety bonds invalidated but these small outfits he tapped the paper theres a fine line between the good guys and the bad guys i mean somebodys got to plant the bugs that my company finds right and planting bugs is illegal any funny stuff thats not a term of art in my profession say hypothetically trying to run somebody off the road run somebody off taylor whispered the road hemming hesitated a moment and said this sort of place triple a security yeah you could possibly find somebody there who might be willing to do that worse too taylor finished the bitter dark ale she opened her purse pulled out a twenty and signaled the waiter is there a mr lockwood hemming asked yes but you wouldnt really like my father well anything in the fiancéboyfriend category you know those pesky fellows that tend to get there first not exactly john silbert hemming said how about dinner cant i was going to let you take me out so you could deduct it she laughed and said ive got plans for the immediate future plans are what contractors and shipbuilders use some other time she asked i mean it sure hemming said then as she started to stand he held up a finger which returned her to her seat one thing theres this friend i have he wears a badge and works at a place called one police plaza and i was thinking maybe its time you gave him a call just to have a chat taylor replayed the drive through the foliage down to the reservoir last night and thought hemmings was an excellent idea but she answered no chapter twentyfour they walked together through battery park ralph dudleys eyes were on the statue of liberty rising from the harbor like a sister of the figure of blind justice junie walked silently beside him he wanted to hold her hand but of course he did not like tourists they were on their way to see the monument up close dudley wondered how many people junies age knew the lines carved on the base of the statue knew they were from a poem called the new colossus by emma lazarus give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free the wretched refuse of your teeming shore hardly any but he also wondered how many wall street lawyers knew it not many of them either is it like cold on the boat youre saying like again a lot remember you were going to watch it whatever im sure we can sit downstairs where its warm well get some hot chocolate or a beer she muttered ha dudley said come on over here for a minute he nodded to a bench and they sat down dudley wondering as he had for a thousand times that year why he was so taken with this little creature yo so wassup she said sometimes she talked black and there was nothing he could say to get her out of this mode hed learned that it was best to ignore her affectations they went away sooner or later ive got some papers here for you to sign we couldnt do it in the firm she put her walkman headsets on he took them off her and smoothed her hair she wrinkled her face youve got to sign them like okay he dug them out of his briefcase and handed them to her okay she said snapping her gum gimme a pen dudley reached into his jacket pocket and found that hed accidentally picked up his cross mechanical pencil damn i forgot mine i like have one she reached into her purse and pulled it out but as she did a piece of paper fell to the ground dudley had picked it up and started to hand it back when he looked at the check he saw junies name he saw taylor lockwoods name his hand froze in midair between them dudley looked at her with rage in his face what is this i what the hell have you done poppie she asked dropping her walkman it broke apart on the asphalt how could you he whispered how could you the going rate to get alice into the rabbit hole of a manhattan apartment was a sob story jed so stupid ralph dudleys my uncle and my aunt thats his wife passed away two years ago today and he was feeling really lousy i wanted to make him dinner just to cheer him up she held up the food emporium bag as evidence heres fifty for your trouble dont say anything okay its a surprise taylor lockwood had dressed in her business finest to allay the doormans concerns he looked her over pocketed the money slipped her a spare key and turned back to a tiny television she knew dudley wouldnt be here shed run into him in the halls and hed told her that he was taking the afternoon off to show junie the statue of liberty the sullen girl had been in the lobby waiting for him taylor shivered at the thought of the two of them together for the girls part she looked from dudleys face to taylors and back again and just seemed bored taylor now walked inside and found that dudleys apartment was much smaller and more modest than shed expected although she knew about his financial problems shed assumed that an elderly wall street law firm partner like dudley would be living at least in simple elegance jaded though it might be in fact the four rooms in the prewar building didnt not have much more square footage than her own apartment the walls were covered with cheap paint which blotched where it was thin and peeled where the painters had bothered to apply several coats there was no way the windows would ever open again she gave a cursory onceover to the living room which was filled with old furniture some of whose tattered cracked arms and legs were tied together neatly with twine she saw chipped vases lace that had been torn and carelessly resewn books afghans walking sticks a collection of dented silver cigarette cases walls were covered with old framed pictures of relatives including several of dudley as a young man with a large unfriendlylooking woman he was handsome but very thin and he stared at the camera with solemn introspection in his bedroom beside a neatly made bed she found what looked like a wooden torso with one of dudleys suit jackets hanging on the shoulders a clothes brush rested on a small rack on the torsos chest and on the floor in front of it was a pair of carefully polished shoes with wellworn heels his fussiness made her job as burglar easy each of the pigeonholes in his oak rolltop desk contained a single wellmarked category of documents con ed bills phone bills letters from his daughter the leastfilled compartment business correspondence warranty cards for household appliances letters from his alumni organization receipts he separated opera programs from symphony programs from ballet programs taylor finished the desk in ten minutes but could find nothing linking dudley to the note or to hanover stiver discouraged and feeling hot and filthy from the search she walked into the kitchen illuminated with pallid light from the courtyard that the rooms one small window looked out on taylor leaned against the sink in front of her was dudleys small kitchen table on either side of which were two mahogany chairs one side of the table was empty on the other was a faded place mat on which sat an expensive nicked porcelain plate a setting of heavy silverware a wineglass all arranged for his solitary dinner that evening a starched white napkin rolled and held by a bright red napkin ring rested in the center of the plate the gaudy ring was the one item glaringly out of place taylor picked up the cheap plastic the kind sold at the bargain stores in times square where tourists buy personalized souvenirs cups dishes tiny license plates she turned it over the name sloppily embossed in the plastic was poppie a present from june the object of his perverse desire her hour was up book on outta here alice nothing she thought angrily i didnt find a thing not a single hint as to where the note might be she stuffed the grocery bag which had been filled only with waddedup newspapers into the trash chute and left so can we eliminate dudley she wondered no but we can put him lower on the list than thom sebastian well dont get too interested in her shed charm the young lawyer interrogate him the prick whod been collecting information on her she remembered his troubled expression yesterday maybe a confession would be forthcoming at dinner tonight she still held out that hope outside she paused for a moment rubbed her eyes tomorrow she thought in alarm the trial was tomorrow taylor stepped into the street to flag down a cab thom sebastian sat at the bar of the blue devil on the far edge of west fiftyseventh near the hudson river an excellent place he assessed it had a mostly black audience dressed supersharp he was working on a vodka gimlet imagining his juggler and thinking so far so good but also thinking goddamn im nervous he was considering what was about to happen tonight was this a waymajor mistake for a while hed thought so but now he wasnt so sure had no idea but it was going to happen the die had been cast he thought phrasing the situation in a cliché that he found unworthy of a lawyer of his caliber he found himself coolly considering partnership at hubbard white willis and he remembered almost with amusement that hed always considered achieving partnership a matter of life and death death after wendall clayton had called him into his office and told him in that soft voice of his that the firm had concluded it would be unable to extend the offer of partnership to him sebastian had sat motionless for three or four minutes smiling at the partner listening to the man describe the firms plans for sebastians severance a smile yes but it was really a rictus gaze what to clayton had the fucking prick even noticed must have seemed like a grin of madness teeth bared eyes crinkling in a psychotic squint wed like to make you a partner thom youre respected here but you understand that economies have to be effected meaning simply that sebastian was not a clone of wendall clayton and was therefore expendable effecting economies oh how that term pure corporate speak had inflamed him like acid listening to clayton hed lowered his head and had seen something resting on the partners desk an inlaid dish of arabic design sebastians eyes had clung to the dish as if he could encapsulate the terrible reality in the cloisonné and escape leaving his sorrow trapped behind him and now he thought about the problem of taylor lockwood but he tried as hard as he could to push her away put her out of his mind and replaced her with the image of the juggler once more he glanced at his watch okay lets do it he stood up from the bar told the bartender hed be back in five so far without really thinking about it the man in the dodge reached over to the passenger seat and felt the breakdown a remington automatic gauge shotgun six shells in the extended magazine six more wedged into the seat business end down he wasnt concentrating on the hardware though his eyes were on the woman walking down the street toward the fat boy thom sebastian who waved at her smiling a weird smile looking all shithispants all right so this bitch was the one the man in the dodge watched her wondering what kind of body she had underneath the overcoat he wouldve liked it if shed been wearing high heels he liked high heels not those stupid black flat shoes this broad wore the man in the dodge checked for blueandwhites and pedestrians who might block the shot clear street clear shooting zone he eased the car forward then braked slowly to a halt twenty feet from the woman she glanced at him with casual curiosity her eyes met his and as he lifted the gun she realized what was going down she screamed holding up her hands nowhere for her to run he aimed over the bead sight and pulled the trigger the huge recoil stunned his shoulder he had a fast image of the woman as she took one load of buckshot in the side a glancing hit he fired two more toward her back but the way she fell it seemed that only one cluster struck her and even that wasnt a square hit well if she wasnt dead yet she probably would be soon and at the very worst shed be out of commission for months people screamed and horns wailed as cars screeched to a halt avoiding the pedestrians who dived into the street for safety the man in the dodge accelerated fast to the next intersection skidded through the red then slowed and once out of sight of the hit drove carefully uptown well within the speed limit diligently stopping at every red light he came to chapter twentyfive thom sebastian hands cuffed was led into the precinct house by two uniformed cops everybody stared at him the cops the drunk drivers the hookers a lawyer or two man somebody whispered it was the blood which covered sebastians jacket and white shirt nobody could figure out how somebody could be covered with this much blood and not have a dozen stab wounds the chubby lawyer slumped on a bench waiting for the booking officer to get around to him staring at his brown wing tips a girl sat next to him a tall black hooker with a tank top and hot pants under her fake fur coat she looked at the blood then shook her head quickly a shiver jesus she whispered sebastian felt a shadow over him someone walking close he looked up and blinked taylor lockwood said are you all right the blood sebastian nodded then closed his eyes and lowered his head again slowly nosebleed he muttered the desk sergeant said gruffly to her whore you taylor said what happened he looked over her black nylons short black skirt and leather jacket get outta here lady hes missin his date for the night a bit of her fathers temper popped within her and im making the trip down here to meet with my client so i guess im missing mine too anything else youd like to put on the record the mans face reddened hey i didnt know you was a lawyer she had no idea what had happened shed shown up at the restaurant and found a crime scene investigation under way somebodyd been shot and sebastian had been arrested she barked whats he been booked on nothing yet the arrestings on the phone to the medical examiner he turned back to a mass of papers man that was a lot of blood a uniformed officer came up a thin man slickedback hair gray at the temples he looked over taylor and was not pleased his would be a joint prejudice against defense lawyers in general who spent hours tormenting cops on the witness stand and reducing them to little piles of incompetence and women defense lawyers in particular who had to prove they could torment more brutally than their male counterparts taylor lockwood cocked her head and tried to look like a ballbuster im mr sebastians lawyer whats going on suddenly a roar of a voice filled the station house hey taylor she froze oh brother why now it was one of those moments when the gods get bored and decide to skewer you just for the fun of it taylor gave an inaudible sigh and turned toward the voice now booming again taylor lockwood right a huge cop a faceful of burst vessels tan from a vacation in vegas or the bahamas stalked across the room he was offduty wearing designer jeans and a windbreaker early forties thirty pounds overweight trim razorcut blond hair a boyish face there was nothing to do she decided but go all the way her fathers advice if youre going to bluff bluff like theres no tomorrow hey she said smiling its tommy blond dontcha remember tommy bianca from the pogiolli case sure tommy how you doing she took his massive callused hand the man was looking down at sebastian he okay nosebleed is all the arresting said we thought hed taken one too ems looked him over said hell be okay he keeps an eye on his nostrils tommy blond looked at the arresting and the desk sergeant hey treat this lady right shes okay she was working with the lawyer got off joey youse remember joey pogiolli from the sixth got him off last year some asshole sued him said joey worked him over on a bust hey taylor you was a paralegal then what you go to law school nights taylor said grinning and wondering if the nervous sweat that had gathered on her forehead would start running down to her chin and carrying her makeup with it thats great my kids applying to brooklyn wants to be fbi i told him agents dont got to have law degrees anymore but he wants to do it right maybe sometime he could talk to you about school got a card none with me sorry she glanced at sebastian staring at the floor tommy blond said whatsa story frank the arresting said we got a vic got took out outside the blue devil name of magaly sanchez upscale coke dealer moving into the wrong territory we think whoever did her wasnt sure what she looked like and was using him he nodded toward sebastian to id the hit or maybe they wanted to whack her in front of a customer send a message you know she had about ten grams on her all packaged and ready for delivery and mr sebastian had a quarter gram thats why we brought him in taylor rolled her eyes a quarter gram come on you guys taylor i know what youre asking tommy blond said then thats a lot of blood youre sure its just a nosebleed she remembered a buzzword what was your probable cause for search probable cause the arresting blinked in surprise he was waving at a known drug dealer who got whacked right in front of him thats not probable cause thats fordamnfuckingsure cause lets talk she walked over to the bulletin board tommy blond and the arresting looked at each other and then followed her she stood with her head down and whispered harshly to the arresting come on hes never been arrested before sure the guys an asshole but a quarter gram you and i both know a collar like

oughta count for something joey taylor remembered was the patrolman who maybe did get a little carried away with his nightstick on that black kid who maybe lifted a wallet but maybe didnt and who maybe reached for that tire iron even though funny thing it was found twenty feet away from the scuffle took the er fiftyeight stitches to repair officer joeys handiwork on the kids face the arresting

nobody around have him down to narcotics at the plaza next week and give em a statement he wrote a name on a card ask for this detective here taylor said thanks gentlemen tommy blond shook her hand again proud of you little lady a lawyer thats all right he walked off toward the locker room taylor walked back to sebastian whod been slumped in his seat out of earshot of the bargaining he didnt yet know he was free she knelt down next to him looked at the blood on his face and shirt it was quite brilliant she said thom i may be able to help you out but ive got to ask you something i need an honest answer look at me boys eyes indignant hurt scared boys eyes you went through mitchell recces file cabinet sometime recently why a furrow ran through his bloody forehead as he frowned he sniffed

his cheeks mitchell does trial work for new amsterdam i handle a lot of their corporate work i probably needed some files he had youve been in his safe file sebastian frowned again that thing hes got

takes em out to dinner and plays tennis with them im the one whos up till three a m doing the documents im their lawyer he sighed yeah i know them pretty well taylor looked into his eyes and she believed him but she persisted you were in the firm on saturday night a week ago you lied to me about it you snuck in through the back door how did you know that he asked but his voice faded as he noticed her gaze grow cold again im sorry yeah i was there i did lie but i had to look when i got passed over for partner i decided to start my own firm thats what bosk and ire doing dennis callaghans

showed up in my life all of a sudden you were just there and i didnt know why you were interesting i liked you i was trying to find out about you thats what i do im a lawyer thats how i work she looked over the miserable fat boy and knew he was innocent he glanced at her once but had to look away quickly as if he were frightened by what he saw an odd feeling swept through her her face burned she felt queasy and she understood that for the first time in her life shed done what her father would have done what mitchell reece would have done shed been brutal in victory power that was what she sensed sebastian defeated in front of her bloody and fearful as a child was hers the cops were hers the sensation was exhilarating can you tell me whats going on he asked no she replied firmly i cant she stood up he looked uneasily at the cops its okay she said you can go home i can you can leave its all right sebastian rose to his feet slowly and she took his arm to steady him they started toward the door the hooker watched them leave and said cynically my my this be some justice system we got ourselves anybody gotta aggie late monday evening the merger vote a mere fifteen hours away wendall clayton sat in a conference room across across from john perelli fatigue had settled on clayton like a wet coat but unlike perelli clayton had not loosened his tie or rolled up the sleeves of his white sea island cotton shirt he sat the way he had been sitting for the past four hours upright only occasionally lowering his head to rub his bloodshot eyes or to stretch beside him sat randy simms and another of claytons young partners perelli too had several of his lieutenants here simms and the other young man were on the executive committee of hubbard white burdick had rallied hard to keep them off but clayton had maneuvered their elections through though burdick had retained control before them were drafts of a document the merger agreement spread out like a patient under a surgeons careful eyes clayton glanced outside the door at a young woman a secretary from a freelance legal services staffing firm the woman knew every major word processing system in the united states could take dictation and could keyboard words a minute these skills were fetching her fortytwo dollars an hour though at the moment she was being paid that fee solely to sip coffee and read a battered paperback called surrender my love he wondered if hed still have the energy to fuck her in an hour or two after the final negotiations were completed clayton thought it might be dicey he was utterly exhausted perelli wore halfrim glasses low on his nose he looked up and stared into claytons eyes i should tell you my people arent happy about your demand about ousting burdick even with the giveback whatre you saying clayton asked coolly he could sue older man eeoc he could make a mess were lawyers our job is to make messes go away wed prefer to keep him for a while say a year phase him out clayton laughed you dont phase people like donald burdick out either hes in charge or hes gone completely thats his nature perelli pulled off his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose the gesture explained that thered been considerable rebellion in the ranks at perellis firm over burdick and clayton knew that he had to act immediately if you want hubbard white burdick has to go he continued casually he gestured in an aristocratic way toward the window outside of which wall street at night glistened if you want burdick john go find yourself another firm youd walk and not look back perellis assistants shifted uncertainly in their chairs a moment passed and not a cell in wendall claytons face revealed the electric tension he felt finally perelli laughed goddamn you and ire going to make some serious fucking money together he and clayton shook hands with finality perelli stood and stretched you going to use a special pen to sign the merger agreement wendall like the president does no ill just use this old thing he displayed a battered parker fountain pen one he had used for years not long after clayton had started at hubbard white he found himself at a closing without a pen donald burdick had shot him a gruff glance and slid this very pen to him you should always be prepared wendall keep that one as a reminder wendall clayton put the pen away and helped the other men organize the documents while he dictated instructions for the copying and assembly of the execution copies to the surrender my love woman after the firm approved the merger tomorrow these papers would be brought into the large conference room for the signing of the agreement with perellis partners itself since so many people had to sign the logistics of closing the deal were massive a half hour later walking back toward his office clayton stopped and turned quickly aware of someone approaching fast from down a dark corridor the person was making right for him for a moment he actually thought that donald burdick had lost his mind and was about to assault him but no it was sean lillick the redeyed paralegal raged at clayton you fucked her you son of a bitch quiet you little shit clayton whispered john perelli hadnt left yet you fucked her who carrie mason clayton regarded the young man with some amusement and how could you do it last time i looked sean that girl was over eighteen and unattached he lifted an eyebrow was she wearing your art carved engagement ring a tasteful but small solitaire i didnt notice one i dont want your fucking sarcasm wendall so the puppy has some teeth hed never seen them bared before calm down sean what the hell is she to you shes a fat little inbred preppy and youre the point man of the avantgarde capulets and montagues you have nothing in common except gonads engorged by your differences how could you treat her like that i treated her very well besides the word consensual comes to mind she was drunk she thinks you used her shes an adult what she thinks is her business not yours or mine clayton glanced back toward the conference room he lowered his face and asked what did you think you two were going to move to locust valley and have babies for gods sake sean youre not crazy go find some girl with a crew cut pierced labia and dirty fingernails i hate you no you dont sean but even if you did your hatred is irrelevant what is relevant is that you need me now the merger votes tomorrow and i dont have time for this learn a lesson son if somebody fucks your girlfriend the question isnt who did it and how can i get even its why did she want to think about that the boy fell silent clayton could still see the anger and bitterness in his face in a calmer tone he said it happened once she was drunk i was drunk i have no intention of ever seeing her again this was as close to a sincere apology as wendall clayton would ever come lillick seemed to realize this he wasnt pleased but clayton saw that hed pulled the rug out from underneath his rage ill tell her clayton joked what a wonderful human being you are clayton held up an finger he said tomorrow early in my office weve got a big day tomorrow weve got a thousand documents to get ready the phalanxes will be marching through rome chapter twentysix north of fourteenth street where taylor lockwood had risen from the hot pungent subway on her way to mitchell reeces the broad sidewalks were sparse after shed put thom sebastian into a cab taylor had returned to her apartment changed and was now on her way to report to reece that one suspect had been eliminated but that she still had no clue where the note might be the note that hed need in court tomorrow morning a little over twelve hours from now she zigged around patches of ice remembering how her music teacher taught her to think of footsteps as musical beats as she walked shed break the spaces between the tap of the steps into half notes quarter notes eighths triplets dotted quarters and eighths whispering the rhythms one two and uh three four a noise behind her footsteps on the gritty concrete she turned quickly but saw no one a block farther now the streets were completely deserted this area chelsea near sixth avenue contained some residential lofts and cavernous restaurants but this particular street was the home of professional photographers printers warehouses and korean importers at night it was empty a gloomy dark functional place and she felt another chill of uneasiness one and two and three and suddenly the scenery vanished as the arm went around her chest and a hand clamped over her mouth she screamed the man started to drag her into the alley goddamn no she struggled to free herself but managed only to force her attacker to fall still clutching her fiercely around the neck they landed on some boxes and tumbled to the slick cobblestones the man ended up on top of her and knocked the breath from her body choking gasping she threw her hands over her face unable to call for help the man rose to his knees taylor took this chance to twist away smelling rotting bean sprouts and chicken bones and garlic from restaurant trash she saw a fist rise up about to come plunging down toward her face but anger detonated within her and still breathless she pushed hard with her legs slamming into the mans hip and knocking him against a wall taylor grabbed the first thing she could find as a weapon a piece of jagged concrete and staggered to her feet about to swing the sharp stone her hand paused as she heard the mans sobbing the raspy voice wheezed between the sobs why why why you she whispered ralph dudley wiped his face and stared at her at her in raw hatred he didnt pay any attention to the rock in her hand he stiffly rose walked to an overturned trash drum and sat on it gasping for breath why did you do it are you out of your mind she pitched the rock away and began brushing her coat off rubbing at the oil and grease stains look at this are you crazy the old partner stared blankly at the ground i followed you from your apartment i dont know what i wanted to do i actually thought about killing you what are you talking about you followed me you bribed my you bribed junie to find out about me then i asked an associate if hed seen you in my office and he said you had taylor shrugged you lied to me ralph you lied about being in the firm a week ago saturday so he smoothed his mussed hair examined his damaged coat what were you doing in the firm its not any of your business maybe not but maybe it is what were you doing i love that girl taylor said nothing she makes me feel so alive i hate it that shes in that business she does too i know she does but she doesnt have any choice in her mind she saw the cheap red plastic napkin ring poppie taylors fear had changed into pity the desires to flee to slap him to put her hand on his shoulder and comfort him were balanced he lifted his head the cold light shining down from above hit his narrow face and made him look deranged and cadaverous he started to speak then lowered his face into his hands a dozen cars crashed over a pothole in the street next to them before he spoke why did you do it do what ralph tell wendall clayton about us i didnt tell clayton anything somebody he wiped his face again somebody told him oh please taylor laughed that law firm is like machiavellis villa everybodys got spies but why did you go to the west side club why did you follow me there are problems at the firm i needed to know where some people were at a certain time i got the feeling you were lying to me so i followed you after dinner now tell me what you were doing at the firm he shook his head just as she had with the cop whod arrested sebastian taylor now lowered her head and said ralph i can put you in jail for a long time because of that girl and ill do it if you dont cooperate no bullshit tell me what you were doing in the firm the look of hatred in his face chilled her but he finally said junies father died two years ago and left her some money but her mother and stepfatherre keeping it all tied up theyre trying to get it for themselves ive been spending every weekend and half my nights at the firm learning trusts and estates and fiduciary law im going to get the money back for her he wiped tears i couldnt tell anybody at the firm because theyd find out shes not my granddaughter and then they might find out the real situation besides ive borrowed against my partnership draw so much the firmd fire me if they knew i was spending my time on a project that wasnt making hubbard white any money he looked up wretched and lost im really not a very good lawyer i can charm people i can entertain clients but this is the only real law ive done in years prove it to me he said stiffly i dont think i owe you anything more once again the same dark power shed felt before filled taylor lockwoods heart and she whispered harshly prove it to me or i go to the cops a wounded animal dudley hesitated then he glanced down opened his briefcase shoved it toward her she knew little about trusts and estates law but it was clear that these documents petitions to the surrogates court copies of cases and correspondence bore out what hed told her you were in the firm early sunday morning after thanksgiving yes he answered as if he were a witness under crossexamination you used thom sebastians key yes i didnt want anybody to know i was in that night i got there about onethirty after id been to the west side club she asked where were you in the firm just the library and my office the rest room the canteen for some coffee did you see anyone else there dudley rocked slowly back and forth on the trash can under the rain of harsh streetlight his breath popped out in small puffs as he worried the tear in his coat as a matter of fact he answered i did the loft door was open she paused in the hallway seeing the trapezoid of ashen light fall into the corridor taylor felt a jab of panic in a burst of frightening memory she remembered the white car driving them off the road and though at the time she believed the thief had intended only to scare them she thought for an instant that the man had come back and killed mitchell she ran to the door and pushed inside he was lying on the couch wearing blue jeans and a wrinkled dress shirt his hair was mussed and his arms lolled at his sides his eyes stared unmoving at the ceiling mitchell she asked are you all right he turned on his side slowly and looked at her a faint smile mustve dozed off taylor crouched next to him and took his hand i thought you were hurt or something she felt the slight pressure of his hand on hers he looked at her jacket and jeans what happened to you taylor laughed little wrestling match are you all right you should see the other guy then she said i know who the thief is what his eyes returned to life who wendall clayton how do you know i eliminated thom and dudley she told him about sebastians adventure with the police and the old partners attack on her then she said clayton let the thief in that night but he wasnt in the firm reece said yes he was dudley saw him and claytons key entry didnt show up because he got to the firm on friday reece nodded eyes closing at the obvious answer of course he was there all weekend working on the merger he didnt leave until sunday he stayed two nights mustve slept on the couch i shouldve thought about that taylor continued i just went back to the firm and checked his time sheets we wouldve seen that hed ordered food in and made phone calls and photocopies but all those records were erased remember reeces smile faded that doesnt mean he stole the note though but dudley told me something else about threethirty or four on sunday morning he saw this man like a janitor walking through the firm with an envelope dudley thought it was odd that he was carrying something like that he noticed he went into claytons office with the envelope but came out without it dudley didnt say anything to him or to anyone else about him because he was working on something unrelated to firm business i talked to my private detective he said there is a triple a security the receipt i found in wendalls desk and he checked the grapevine its in florida he said theyre a firm that has a reputation for doing labor work which he tells me is a euphemism for rough stuff like stealing documents and bugging offices and even driving people off the road thats who dudley saw clayton let him into the firm and he stole the note after you went home reece said and you think the notes in that envelope i think so like you said he probably hid it in a stack of documents in his office im going to search it only we have to wait he was still at his desk when i left the firm and it didnt look like he was going to leave anytime soon ill go back to the firm and wait till he leaves for the night taylor what can i say he hugged her hard and she threw her arms around him their hands began coursing up and down each others backs and suddenly it was as if all the compressed tension theyd felt over the past week had been converted into a very different kind of energy and now suddenly erupted the room vanished into motion his arms around her under her legs sweeping her up reece carried her to the huge dining room table and lay her upon it books falling papers sailing off onto the floor he eased her down onto the tabletop her blouse and skirt spiraling off and away his own clothes flying in a wider trajectory he was already hard he pressed his mouth down on hers their teeth met and he worked down her neck biting pulling hard on her nipples her stomach her thighs she tried to rise up to him but he held her captive her butt and leg cut by the sharp corners of a law book the pain added to the hunger then he was on top of her his full weight on her chest as his hands curled around the small of her back and tugged her toward him she was completely immobile her breath forced out of her lungs by his demanding strokes taylor felt a similar hunger and she dug her nails into his solid back her teeth clenched in a salivating lust for the pain it was causing they moved like this for minutes or hours she had no idea finally she screamed as she shuddered her toes curling her head bouncing against the table he finished a moment later and collapsed against her taylor lifted her hands two nails were bloody she shoved the law book out from underneath her it fell with a resonant thud she closed her eyes and they remained locked this way for a long time she dozed briefly when she awoke a half hour later she found that reece was at his desk dressed only in a shirt scribbling notes reading cases she watched his back for a moment then walked to him kissed the top of his head he turned and pressed his head against her breasts its up to you now he said im going to proceed with the case as if we cant find the note he nodded at the papers surrounding him but ill hope for the best at three in the morning wearing her cat burglar outfit of levis and a black blouse taylor lockwood walked into hubbard white willis her black sportsac contained a pair of kidskin gloves a set of screwdrivers a pair of pliers a hammer the firm seemed empty but she moved through the corridors in complete quiet pausing in darkened conference rooms listening for voices or footsteps nothing finally she made it to wendall claytons office and began her search by fourthirty shed covered most of it and found no sign of the note but there were still two tall stacks of documents on the floor beside his credenza that she hadnt looked through yet she continued searching she finished one and found nothing she started on the second one which was when jaunty footsteps sounded on the marble floor in the corridor nearby and wendall claytons voice boomed to someone the merger votes in six hours i need those fucking documents now chapter twentyseven he didnt truly live anywhere but here in murky echoing rotundas of courthouses like this in marble corridors lit by milky sunlight filtering through fiftyyearold grimy windows in oak hallways smelling of bitter paper from libraries and file rooms at counsel tables like the one at which he now sat mitchell reece studied the courtroom around him where the opening volley in new amsterdam bank trust ltd v hanover stiver inc would be fired in a short while he studied the vaulted ceilings the austere jury box and a judges bench reminiscent of a conning tower on a warship the dusty flag the pictures of stern nineteenthcentury judges the room was unlit at the moment there was a scuffed wellworn aspect to the place it reminded him of old subway cars well that was appropriate after all justice was just another service provided by government to its citizens like public transportation and trash collection he sat for a few minutes but grew restless he stood suddenly and began to pace and what he speculated would happen if taylor didnt find the note he supposed he could find alternatives but because mitchell reece was so very driven because he was someone who as taylor had once said had left behind reason and logic and even safety in this mad sojourn he felt a fierce desperation to find that tiny piece of paper he wanted to win this one ohsobadly he rose and walked to the soiled window through which he watched men and women hurrying along centre street attorneys and judges and clients everyone was wearing a suit but making the distinction among them was easy lawyers earned big litigation bags clients carried briefcases and judges earned nothing he wandered to the judges bench then to the jury gallery theater winning is about theater he reflected the revelation had come to him early in his career he was representing a young boy blinded in one eye when a lawn mower fired a rock out of the grass chute and into the childs face the boys father had used a hacksaw to cut off the safety deflector panel believing the motor labored harder with the deflector in place and used more gas reece sued the manufacturer claiming that the unit was defective because there was no warning that users should not cut the panel off it was understood by virtually everyone that because the proximate cause of the injury was the fathers removal of the device reece had absolutely no chance of winning the bored judge knew this as did the arrogant lawyer for the defendant and the complacent lawyer for the defendants insurance company seven people did not know the impossibility of the suit however one was mitchell reece the others were the six members of the jury who awarded the snotty selfpitying little kid one point seven million bucks theater that was the key to litigation a dab of logic a bit of law a lot of personality and considerable theater he glanced at the door to the courtroom willing it to open and taylor lockwood to hurry inside the note in hand but of course it remained closed after hed heard nothing more from her after she left to go to the firm at am hed gotten a few hours sleep shaved and showered then dressed in his finest litigation armani hed gathered his documents called the clients to have them meet him at the courthouse then hurried downtown where he slipped into the cavernous domed cathedral of new york state supreme court well the matter was out of his hands he now reflected either taylor would find it and life would move in one direction or she would not and an entirely different set of consequences would occur mitchell reece had not prayed for perhaps thirty years but today he addressed a short message to a vague deity whom he pictured looking somewhat like blind justice and asked that she keep taylor lockwood safe and to please please let her find the note youve done so much taylor now do just a little more for both of us taylor lockwood stood in wendall claytons private bathroom the time was now am and shed hidden here for hours waiting for the partner to take a break so that she could continue going through the remaining stack of papers but clayton had never even stood up to stretch in this entire time hed remained rooted at his desk reading picking up the phone and calling partners and clients the news he was receiving was apparently good for his side it was clear to her that the merger would be approved and that both firms would sign it up later in the day reece would be in court by now probably desparing that he hadnt heard from her but there was nothing she could do other than wait ten minutes passed then ten more and finally clayton rose thank god he was going to check on something she would grab the remaining stack and flee with it to her cubicle looking through it there then her gut jumped hard clayton wasnt leaving the office at all he needed to use the rest room and was walking directly toward where taylor lockwood now hid a room without a single closet or shower stall where she might hide bench conference your honor mitchell reece asked he was standing in front of the plaintiffs table the judge looked surprised and reece could understand why the trial had just started the opening statements had been completed and it was rare that a bench conference a brief informal meeting between lawyers out of earshot of the jury should occur at this early stage nothing had happened so far that the two attorneys could argue about the judge raised his eyebrows and hanover stivers slick grayhaired lawyer rose to his feet and walked slowly to the bench the courtroom was half empty but reece was distressed to see some reporters present he didnt know why they were here they never covered cases of this sort someones political hand he wondered at the defendants table sat lloyd hanover tanned and trim his hair combed forward in bangs his face an expression of blasé confidence the two lawyers stood at the bench reece said softly your honor i have a bestevidence situation id like to move to introduce a copy of the promissory note in question hanovers lawyer turned his head slowly to look at reece it was the judge however who was more astonished you dont have the note itself no one in the jury box or elsewhere in the courtroom could hear this exchange but the surprise on the jurists face was evident several spectators looked at each other and a reporter or two leaned forward slightly sharks smelling blood the hanover lawyer said tersely no way not acceptable ill fight you on this all the way reece the judge said was it a negotiable instrument yes your honor but there is precedent for admitting a copy at this stage as long as the original is surrendered before execution of the judgment assuming you get a judgment the hanover lawyer countered bickering pisses me off gentlemen when the jury wasnt listening the judge could curse to his hearts delight sorry sir hanovers lawyer murmured contritely then he said you prove to me the notes destroyed i mean show me ashes and then you can put a copy into evidence but if not im moving for dismissal what happened to the original the judge asked we have it at the firm reece said casually were having some technical failure accessing it technical failure accessing it the judge blurted what the fuck does that mean our security systems arent functioning right as i understand it well wouldnt that be convenient to have the note disappear just now the hanover lawyer said especially since we intend to call into question certain aspects of the execution of the note reece gave a bitter laugh let me get this right youre saying that you gladly took my clients money but now youre not sure they executed the loan agreement correctly so you dont have to pay it back our thinking is that the bank tried to give itself an out because interest rates turned and they want to invest the capital elsewhere your client missed six months of interest payments reece said raising his voice just loud enough for the jury to hear how exactly was i not making myself goddamn clear no bickering no fucking comments on the merits of the case in a bench conference now mr reece this is very unusual a suit on a note especially a negotiable note requires the original document under the bestevidence rule if you cant explain the notes destruction youre precluded from entering a copy into evidence reece said calmly id like to make a motion to submit other evidence of the existence of the note your honor opposing counsel said i would point out that it is mr recces client that sued on the note it alleges is properly executed it is his responsibility to present that note a copy wont show that theres been tampering on the part of mr reeces client reece countered your honor it is very important that the administration of justice not get bogged down in technicalities the note is merely evidence of the debt owed and remaining unpaid i should point out by hanover stiver it is true that the bestevidence rule generally requires the original but there are exceptions were all familiar with the rules of civil procedure im sure but this isnt a bill of sale mr reece the judge said its a negotiable instrument worth hundreds of millions of dollars with all due respect to mr reece the hanover lawyer said i am reminded of a case once in which a similar claim of a missing note was made and it turned out that the document in question had been sold by the bank to a third party i would never suggest that new amsterdam bank was guilty of such wrongdoing but we cant take that chance reece walked to the counsel table and returned with some documents he handed one copy to the lawyer and one to the judge motion papers i move to allow the introduction of secondary evidence of the note ive briefed the issue in here if you would like to recess for twentyfour hours to allow my opponent here to respond no more delays the judge snapped this case has fucked up my calendar enough the other lawyer shook his head you lost the note reece im ready for trial your honor i move for a directed verdict in my clients favor the judge flipped through the lengthy brief that reece had prepared then lifted an impressed eyebrow good work mr reece brilliant analysis then he tossed the brief aside but it doesnt cut it no secondary evidence will be allowed reeces heart sank on the other hand i wont grant a directed verdict for hanover what i will do is grant a motion to dismiss without prejudice that will allow mr reece to bring his case in the future however given the nature of defendants financial condition i doubt theyll have much money for your client to collect mr reece youd better talk to your malpractice earner i think your client may look to you for restitution in this matter and thats to the tune of two hundred and fifty million dollars the opposing counsel began the formalities your honor i move for dismissal of mitchell a womans voice called from the back of the courtroom the judge looked up glaring at the intrusion everyone in the gallery and the jury box swiveled to watch taylor lockwood hurry down the aisle its customary to ask permission before shouting in my courtroom young lady the judge snapped sarcastically forgive me sir i need to speak to plaintiffs counsel for a moment hanovers lawyer said your honor i the judge waved him silent and nodded taylor forward chapter twentyeight i am sorry your honor taylor lockwood said judges were public servants catering to the will of the people but as her father had reminded from a young age you could never be too deferential to jurists or as he put it even to gradeschool taylor you could never kiss too much judicial ass she walked to reece and handed him an envelope inside was the promissory note looking as mundane and matteroffact as the copy hed showed her at their first meeting mitchell reece took out the document and exhaled slowly your honor at this time the plaintiff would like to introduce exhibit a he handed it to the opposing counsel who looked at taylor with a gaze of distilled hate no objection he returned the note to reeces unsteady hands reece walked back to his favorite space in front of the jury box your honor before continuing with my case i first must apologize to the court and to the jury for this delay he smiled contritely the six men and women smiled or nodded back and forgave him the interruption had added an element of drama to the case fine fine mr reece lets move this along the judge grumbled his chances for a fast escape to golf or tennis ruined one moment your honor the hanover stiver attorney bent toward one of his clients probably lloyd hanover taylor guessed to judge from his slick tanned appearance which matched what reece had told her of him after a bit of conversation the attorney stood up approach the bench again with opposing counsel the judge gestured them up the defense lawyer said your honor my clients would like to present a settlement offer to the plaintiff the judge lifted an eyebrow to reece taylors father had also taught his daughter that settlement was the holy grail of judges burdened by an endless workload they infinitely preferred the parties agreeing to work out their differences rather than slugging it out at trial the judge might even be able to get in nine holes today well entertain it reece said stiffly the lawyer moved closer to reece and whispered look you can get a judgment entered for the face value of the note plus interest but theres no way therell be enough cash left in the company to collect that much by the time you enforce it not to mention your legal fees eating up a lot of the rest a number reece said just give me a number the judge give him a number sixtyfive cents on the dollar reece said eighty cents on the dollar us cash not negotiable instruments or assets or tangible property even gold were trying to be cooperative but we have to be realistic hanovers lawyer said then he added ominously the money just wont be there in a few months then well just have to go alookin reece said cheerfully now lloyd hanover personally guaranteed the debt im ready to interrogate excuse me depose every one of his relatives and every business associate of his for the past ten years to find out where he hid the money he didnt hide well look into every deal hes ever been involved in every charity he ever gave money to his kids college funds hes completely innocent of secreting funds if thats what youre suggesting reece shrugged dismissal without prejudice eighty cents on the dollar cash and we close within one week if not then lloyd hanover and everybody hes ever known wont have a minutes peace the lawyer held his eye for a moment and strode back to his client who listened gave a searing look to reece then whispered something to the lawyer when the man returned he said agreed reece nodded and said well execute the stipulation now we dont want to take the courts time i suggest i think his honor would prefer to spend a few extra minutes now rather than risk being back here in a few weeks for a fullfledged trial am i right about that your honor you are mr reece write out the stipulation by hand and well get it signed up the defense lawyer sighed and scurned back to give the bad news to the client after the paperwork was completed hands were shaken among comrades glares delivered between opponents and the courtroom emptied in the courthouse rotunda the new amsterdam vice presidents and executives clustered together enjoying their relief taylor followed reece to a small vestibule that contained public phones which unlike most in the city were in oldfashioned booths with closing doors he pulled her inside one and kissed her hard after a moment he released her and leaned back what on earth happened where were you i was almost through searching claytons office but he came in early to take care of some lastminute things for the merger i hid in the bathroom jesus what happened then about nine or so he had to use the john but i unscrewed the lightbulbs before he got there so he went up the hall when he did i grabbed the last stack of paper and ran down to my cubicle with them i found all of this in the envelope the note was in reece took the sheets of paper that taylor offered shaking his head he looked at them closely a copy of a letter to the national law journal re careless security costs firm client the letter blamed burdick and the executive committee there was also a typewritten list with the names of several other clients and cases that clayton was going to sabotage while presumably shifting the blame to burdick from her purse taylor then took a small tape recorder and held up a tiny microcasette this was in the envelope too she inserted the cassette into the player and hit a button they heard reeces voice thick with static talking to her about the promissory note she shut it off son of a bitch reece said he bugged my office thats how he knew we were after him hes known all along he then reece paused and looked at his watch oh no what the firms voting on the merger any minute now weve got to tell donald about this itll change everything he grabbed the phone and dug in his pocket for some change perpetual motion does exist in business in fact where the mere laws of science mean zip compared with the power of greed and ambition its one of the essential principles donald burdick sensed the undercurrent of this energy surrounding each partner as he or she entered the big conference room mostly they were uneasy they lingered at the door pretending to leave messages with the conference room secretary pretending to wait for comrades so they might enter with human shields or at least with allies to deflect the glare of the partners representing the other side of the merger issue from theirs as always few of the younger partners would make eye contact with burdick but this morning he felt this evasion was due not to distance in social station but to hostility on the part of his opponents and shame in the hearts of those who had betrayed him the danish pastries on the limoges china the coffee in the sterling urn were practically untouched burdick looking down reviewed a loan document that did not need reviewing he heard conversations about the jets and giants about concerts about vacations about closings about the faux pas of opposing counsel about the supreme courts latest excursions to olympus about rumors of other law firms breaking up finally at eleven oclock burdick started to call the meeting to order he was about to ask for a quorum vote when excuse me said randy simms whom donald burdick couldnt help but picture as a handsome leech yes burdick drew the word out threateningly simms said were not all present eyes coursing leisurely around the table burdick said but we have a quorum well mr clayton isnt here either we have a quorum in which case the meeting proceeds or we do not in which case it doesnt whom that quorum is made up of is not to my memory an issue of any concern in roberts rules of order im just thinking that it might be appropriate but the slick young sycophants words were interrupted by a bold knock the door opened and burdicks secretary walked inside with a sealed envelope ignoring everyone in the room the older partner took it slit the seal open with his gold pen and read the note he handed it to bill stanley who blinked in surprise burdick said if youll excuse us for a moment please theres something that needs attending to well adjourn for fifteen minutes bill you come too donald burdick was as angry as taylor had ever seen him he glanced at her and she looked away from his towering fury they sat in burdicks office bill stanley was on the couch a fat ankle resting on a fat knee and read over the papers taylor had found in claytons office stanley muttered what a stupid stupid thing to do but burdick was venting at reece why the hell didnt you tell me about the note reece said it was a judgment call i didnt want word to get out i had my own way of handling it you almost lost the case burdick spat out you almost got yourselves killed reece withstood the anger easily clayton wasnt going to hurt us im sure the car incident was just to scare us as far as losing goes well yes i took that chance you risked our client because you were afraid youd lose your job the associate fired back of course that was one reason but it was also because if word got out it would be bad for the firm in my assessment we had to act covertly covertly you sound like a damn spy burdick took the papers and the tape recorder from stanley he wanted the merger so badly hed do this burdicks anger was giving way to astonishment stanley considered something you introduced the note into evidence right reece nodded hanovers agreed to settle were going to close in boston next week well then clayton willve heard you found it hell know hes in trouble burdick nodded thats why hes not at the meeting the old partner rubbed his eyes what a mess fucking scandal stanley growled last thing we need give me some thoughts on the damage assessment burdick said to the rotund partner probably not terrible he nodded at reece and taylor they didnt tell anyone a piercing glance at taylor right you didnt mention it to anybody no of course not when i found those things in claytons office i took them right to mitchell at the courthouse i didnt even call because i thought the phones might be bugged nobody else knows what i was doing stanley nodded and continued the problems going to be talking him into leaving he knows were afraid of publicity so were not going to go to the police or going to sue him fucking clever when you think about it he arranges to misplace a note nearly loses our client and when we catch him redhanded hes practically got immunity from the liability burdick was shaking his head well find a way to oust him that man has to his voice faded as there was an urgent knock on the door come in the door opened fast and one of burdicks secretaries stood there her face was white and her eyes were red from crying what is it carol oh no taylor thought just what they were afraid of had happened word had gotten out that clayton had stolen the note but the tragedy was of a somewhat different order the woman gasped oh mr burdick its terrible they just found wendall clayton in the garage downstairs in his car hes what carol he shot himself hes dead two men of most renowned virtue you will observe the rules of battle of course the white knight remarked putting on his helmet i always do said the red knight and they began banging away at each other with such fury that alice got behind a tree to be out of the way of the blows lewis carroll through the lookingglass chapter twentynine only a few hours had elapsed since claytons suicide but it seemed to taylor lockwood that days had passed given all the conjuring that donald burdick had done in the wake of the tragedy first hed appeared at the merger vote meeting and delivered the news to the partners then leaving the stunned men and women to make what they would of the mans death hed returned immediately to his office where reece and taylor had been ordered to remain the senior partner had handled an endless stream of phone calls and meetings with his cronies so far hed talked to the mayors and the governors offices the medical examiners office the police the justice department the press taylor was startled to see burdicks wife make an appearance walking into her husbands office unannounced without the least acknowledgment of reece or taylor the woman apparently knew all about the suicide and she and her husband retired to the small conference room off his office and closed the door five minutes later burdick returned alone he sat down leaned back in the chair and then asked reece and taylor do you have anything else that has to do with wendall or the theft anything at all reece shook his head and looked at taylor who said numbly i didnt think this would happen burdick looked at her blankly for a moment then repeated anything else no she said he nodded and took an envelope out of his pocket there was that suicide note in the car the one the police found talking about pressures at work being despondent burdick looked at both reece and taylor he added but he wrote another one it was on his desk addressed to me he handed a sheet of paper to reece who read it and then passed it on to taylor donald forgive me im sending this to you privately to keep my theft of the note out of the news it will be better for everyone i want you to know that i truly believed the merger would save the firm but i lost sight of how far i should go all ill offer is this from milton men of most renowned virtue have sometimes by transgressing most truly kept the law burdick took the letter back and locked it in his desk im going to try to keep this note quiet he nodded at the drawer ill talk to the police commissioner and i dont think hell have a problem with it this is hubbard whites dirty laundry and no one elses publicity would be bad for everyone bad for the firm bad for claytons widow too widow taylor asked suddenly burdick replied yes wendall was married didnt you know no she said she wasnt in connecticut the other day ive never seen her at any of the firm functions he never wore a ring well i guess he wouldnt now would he given his extracurricular activities his widow the words stung before his death clayton the man had been hidden beneath clayton the ruthless aristocrat that he had a wife and maybe children or living parents siblings was a shock the newspapersll get a watereddown story burdick continued ive called the public relations company bill stanleys with them now theyre preparing a statement if anybody asks well refer questions to them he lowered his head and looked into recces eyes then taylor s she had the same sense as when she met reeces gaze or claytons or her fathers they drew you in made you forget who you were forget your own thoughts in burdicks eyes she saw will and confidence strong as bronze her mind went blank he asked will you back me on this if i thought there was anything to be gained by a full disclosure i wouldnt hesitate to reveal everything but i cant see any upside to it men of most renowned virtue reece said i wont perjure myself donald but i wont volunteer anything fair enough the partner looked at taylor she nodded sure i agree the hairs on the back of her neck stirred widow taylor looked into the conference room inside which vera burdick her gray hair piled on her head in a stately bun was on the telephone she glanced back and caught taylor s gaze the woman halflose and swung the door closed burdicks phone rang and he took the call he mouthed something about its being from someone at city hall but taylor was preoccupied she was seeing in her minds eye the real suicide note tucked away in burdicks desk she vaguely heard burdick speaking to the caller in a low reassuring tone she watched his long jowly face carefully shaved his sparse gray hair brushed into precise alignment and taylor lockwood thought what the hell had she been doing all along what did she think would happen when she fingered the thief had she ever considered the consequences never once renowned virtue burdick hung up the receiver and nodded with satisfaction i think well get away with it taylor tried to figure out what he meant the medical examiners office is going to rale the death suicide the ag agrees and we can keep our other suicide note private reece blurted an astonished laugh the me ruled already burdick nodded then looked at taylor and reece with a vaguely ominous gaze which she interpreted as dont be too curious about this the partner looked at his watch he held out his hand to reece then to taylor who first wanted to wipe her palm it was damp as a washcloth burdicks was completely dry you two get some rest youve been through a hellish week if you want any personal time ill arrange it wont come out of your vacation or sick leave are you busy now reece walked toward the door ive got the hanover settlement closing in boston next week thats the only thing on the front burner you ms lockwood no nothing she replied still numb then take some time off in fact id urge you to might be best taylor nodded and began to speak but hesitated she was waiting for some significant thought to arrive some phrase that neatly summarized what had just happened nothing occurred her mind had jammed get away with it oh mitchell burdick said smiling as if the suicide no longer occupied even a portion of his thoughts reece turned congratulations on the hanover settlement the partner said i myself would have settled for seventy cents on the dollar thats why youre a litigator and im not he rose and walked to the small conference room where his wife awaited him burdick didnt open the door right away though he waited taylor noticed until she and reece had left the office they walked in silence to the paralegal pen everyone in the corridors seemed to be staring at her as if they knew the part shed played in the partners death near her cubicle in a place where the hall was empty reece took her by the arm he bent down and whispered i know how you feel taylor i know how i feel but this wasnt our fault theres no way we couldve anticipated this she said nothing he continued even if the policed been involved the same thing wouldve happened i know she said in a soft voice but it sounded lame terribly lame because of course she didnt know anything of the kind reece asked come over for dinner tonight she nodded okay sure hows eight then he frowned wait its tuesday youre playing piano at your club right was it tuesday the thought of the leches in the audience and dimitris reference to her satin touch suddenly repulsed her think ill cancel for tonight reece gave a wan smile ill see you later he seemed to be looking for something to add but said nothing more he looked up and down the hallway to make sure it was empty then hugged her hard and walked away taylor called ms strickland and told her she was taking the rest of the day off she couldnt get the supervisor off the line though all the woman wanted to do was talk about claytons suicide finally she managed to hang up taylor avoided carrie mason and sean lillick and a half dozen of the other paralegals and snuck out the back door of the firm at home she loaded dirty clothes into the basket but got only as far as the front door she stopped and set the laundry down she turned on her yamaha keyboard and played music for a few hours then took a nap at six that night she called reece at home look she said im sorry i cant come over tonight sure he said uncertainly then he asked are you all right yeah ive got the fatigues bad i understand but he sounded edgy is this come on tell me is what happened going to affect us oh brother you can hardly ever get men to talk seriously and then at the worst possible time you cant stop them no mitch its not that i just need some r r time whatever you want he said thats fine ill be here its just i guess i miss you night sleep well call me tomorrow she took a long bath then called home taylor was troubled to hear her father answer jesus taylie what the hell happened at your shop no counselor now they were regressing to her gradeschool nickname i just heard her father continued was that somebody you worked for this clayton fellow i knew him yeah not too well well take some advice you keep a low profile young lady what she asked put off by his professorial tone you keep your head down the firms going to have some scars from a suicide we dont want any of it to rub off on you how can scars rub off taylor thought cynically but of course she said nothing other than im just a paralegal dad reporters from the times arent going to be writing me up although she added to herself if theyd told the whole story by rights they should killed himself samuel lockwood mused if you cant stand the heat stay out of the kitchen maybe there was more to it than standing the heat dad he took the cowards way out and he hurt your shop not mine taylor said but her voice was soft and samuel lockwood didnt hear you want to talk to your mother he asked please ill get her just remember what i said taylie sure dad her mother whod clearly had a glass of wine too many was happy to hear from her daughter and to taylors relief wasnt the least alarmist about what had happened at the firm taylor slipped into a very different mode with her far less defensive and tense and the women began chatting about soap operas and distant relatives and taylors christmas trip home to maryland the woman was so cheerful and comforting in fact that taylor on a whim upped the length of her stay from three days to seven hell donald burdick wants me to take some time off okay ill take some time off her mother was delighted and they talked for a few minutes longer but then taylor said she had to go she was afraid her father would come back on the line she put a frozen pouch of spaghetti into a pot of water that and an apple were dinner then she lay on her couch watching a cheers rerun mitchell reece called once but she let her answering machine do the talking for her he left a short message saying only that he was thinking of her the words shored her up a bit but still she didnt call back taylor lockwood curled on the old sofa the tv yammering mindlessly in front of her thought about when she was a teenager and her labrador retriever would pile into bed next to her and lie against an adjacent pillow until she scooted him off shed then he still waiting for sleep while she felt in the warmth radiating from the empty pillow the first glimmerings of understanding that the pain that solitude conjures within us is a false pain and has nothing to do with solitude at all indeed being alone was curative she believed she thought about reece and wondered if he was different if he was like her father who sought company when he was troubled though it was not the presence of his family samuel lockwood had ever needed but that of business associates politicians fellow partners and clients but thats a different story she thought wearily she lay back on the couch and ten hours later opened her eyes to a gray morning she took the next day off and spent much of the morning and early afternoon christmas shopping when she returned home in the late afternoon there was another call from reece and a curious one from sean lillick he seemed drunk and he rambled on for a few minutes about claytons death an edge to his voice he mentioned that carrie mason wasnt going to claytons memorial service with him and asked if taylor wanted to go no she thought but didnt call him back thom sebastian too had left a message asking her to phone back she didnt call him either she rummaged through the mail shed picked up downstairs and found mixed in among the christmas cards a selfaddressed envelope from a music company her heart sank as she felt the thick tape inside and realized what it contained ripping the envelope open she upended it and let her demo tape clatter out onto the table this wasnt the last of the tapes shed sent out for consideration there were still about a half dozen out at various companies but it was the important one the only tape that had made it to a labels artists and repertoire committee there was no response letter someone had simply jotted on her own cover note thanks but not for us she tossed it into a macys box with the rest of them and finally opened that mornings newyork times she read the article shed been avoiding all day headlined wall street lawyer kills self pressure at whiteshoe firm cited in death of partner burdick apparently had indeed gotten away with it his artistry was astonishing not a word about the hanover stiver case nothing about the theft of the promissory note nothing about her or mitchell or the merger burdick was quoted calling the death a terrible tragedy and saying that the profession had lost a brilliant attorney the reporter also quoted several members of the firm bill stanley mostly well the pr firm discussing claytons huge workload and his moodiness the article reported that in the past year clayton had billed over twentysix hundred hours a huge number for lawyers of his seniority there was a sidebar on stress among overworked professionals she sighed and threw the newspaper away then washed the ink off her hands as if it were blood at fivethirty the doorbell rang who could it be neighbors thom sebastian assaulting her to beg for a date ralph dudley simply assaulting her she opened the door mitchell reece wearing a windbreaker walked inside and asked her if she had a cat what she asked bewildered by his quick entrance a cat he repeated no why are you allergic what are you doing here or fish or anything you have to feed regularly she was so pleased to see him in a playful mood so different from the shock in his face after claytons death that she joked back just occasional boyfriends but none at the moment as i think you know come on downstairs i want to show you something but he held his finger to his lips lets go she followed him out to the street where a limo awaited a black lincoln he opened the door and pointed inside where she saw three large bags from paragon sporting goods and two sets of new rossignol skis propped across the seats taylor laughed mitchell what are you doing time for my lesson dont you remember you were going to teach me to ski where central park you know of someplace called cannon its in new hampshire i just called the weather number four inches of new powder i dont know what that means but even the recorded voice sounded excited so i assume its good but when but now he said just like that the firms jets on the ramp at la guardia and they bill us by the hour so i suggest you hustle your butt go pack this is crazy what about work donald called he or his wife found out you like to ski so he ordered us to take some time off hes giving us the trip allexpensespaid he called it a christmas bonus ive bought everything we need i think the store told me what to get skis poles black stretch pants boots bindings sweaters goggles and he held up a box whats that taylor asked that the most important thing of all she opened it a crash helmet thats for me he shrugged maybe youre a teacher he smiled and maybe youre not chapter thirty the helmet wasnt a bad idea reece had been on the bunny slope at the cannon ski resort in new hampshire for only fifteen minutes when he fell and jammed his thumb one of the resort doctors a cheerful indian had taped it is it broken reece had asked no is no fracture why does it hurt so much lots of nerves in fingers the doctor said beaming many many nerves afterward they sat in the small lounge in the inn oh mitchell i feel so bad she said but you did a very respectable first run my thumb doesnt feel too respectable is it always this cold cannons got the coldest windiest runs in new england dear she said pulling his head against her neck people have frozen to death not far from here really well we wouldnt want to have too much fun now would we reece actually didnt seem too upset about either the accident or the weather and she soon learned why he preferred to sit out the day with what he had smuggled with him files from the hanover settlement closing taylor too didnt mind she was eager to get out onto the doublediamond trails and kick some ski butt not babysit him on the beginner slopes or worry about him on the intermediates she kissed him sit in the lodge and behave yourself as she crunched her way toward the lifts he called good luck i assume you dont say break a leg she smiled stomped into her skis and slid down the slight incline to the bottom of the lift at the top of the mountain she eased off the chair and braked to a stop just past the lift house she bent down and washed her goggles in snow the white mountains were as shed told him sonofabitch cold and the wind steadily scraped across her face she pulled silk hand liners on and replaced her mittens then poled her way into position and looked down the mountain her impression had always been that most runs never look as steep from the top as they do from the bottom but as she gazed down toward the lodge over a half mile straight below her she saw a plunge not a slope her pulse picked up and immediately she realized how right mitchell had been to arrange the trip how important it was to get away from the city to distance herself from hubbard white willis from wendall claytons ghost she pushed off the crest of the mountain it was the best run of her life suddenly there was nothing in her universe but speed and snow and the rhythm of her turns speed speed speed which was all she wanted her mouth was open slightly in the ellipse that suggests fear or sexual heights her teeth dried and stung in the frigid slipstream but the pain only added to her surge of abandon taylor danced over moguls the way girls skip doubledutch jump rope on playgrounds once her skis left the ground and she landed as if the snow had risen timidly to stroke the bottom of the fiberglass trees bushes other skiers were a swiftratcheting backdrop sweeping past everyone hushed it seemed listening to the cutting hiss of her rossignol she was sure she was hitting sixty or seventy miles an hour her hair was whipping her shoulders and back she wished shed borrowed recces helmet not for safety but to cut the wind resistance of the tangled mass of drag then it was over she brodied to a stop near the base of the run her thighs in agony but her heart filled with a glorious rush of fear and victory she did four runs this way until on the last one on a big mogul she lost control and had to windmill her arms to regain her balance it sobered her okay honey one suicide a week is enough at the bottom of the mountain she kicked out of her skis and loosened her boot clasps a tall thin man came up to her and said in a germanic accent hey that was a you know pretty okay run you feel maybe like another one uh no not really okay okay hey how about a drink sorry she picked up her skis and walked toward the cabin im here with my boyfriend and she realized suddenly that by god she was taylor returned to find reece in great spirits the tiny room cluttered with papers and documents delivered by fedex or dhl he was on the phone but he motioned her to him and kissed her hard then resumed his conversation she sat on the bed wincing as she pulled off her sweater and stretch pants and began massaging her thighs and calves it was around that time that reece hung up the phone and stacked the files away in a corner when they awoke in midafternoon they went to several antique stores which werent the precious collections of cheese dishes and brass surveying instruments you find in connecticut or new york these were barns packed with furniture rows of dusty chairs and tables and dressers and pickle jars and canopy beds and armoires very rustic and practical and well cared for none of the shopkeepers seemed to expect them to buy anything and they didnt that night they ate in one of the halfdozen interchangeable inns in the area their menus virtually the same theyd found veal chop steak chicken duck a lorange salmon or trout afterward they had a drink in the common room in front of a huge fireplace after they made love that night and reece had fallen asleep taylor lockwood lay under the garden patch quilt of a hundred hexagons of cotton and felt the reassuring pressure of a mans thigh beside her she smelled the cold air as it streamed through the inchopen window and gathered on the floor she tried to forget about wendall clayton about hubbard white willis about life on the other side of the looking glass at am she finally fell asleep on thursday morning taylor was first in the lift line she skied her first run fast smelling the clean electric scent of snow the biting perfume of fireplace smoke hearing the sharp hiss of her turns in the granular snow today however the speed had none of the cleansing effect that itd had on her first day out she felt alone frightened vulnerable like the first time her father made her ride her bike without training wheels hed put her on the tall schwinn aimed it down a hill and pushed shed refused to scream until the wobbly front wheel hit a curb and shed gone over the handlebars onto the sidewalk she made mistakes skied too defensively and nearly wiped out bad at the bottom of the mountain she loaded her skis and boots into the rental car no dad im not getting back on the fucking horse she thought now she drove to their inn and went back to the room where reece was taking a shower she poured coffee from the pot hed ordered and dropped into the musty armchair thinking where and for a first cause of action taylor lockwood did willfully outside she could see other skiers heading down the mountain some fast some timidly and with full knowledge of the consequences without a warrant or other license enter the office of one wendall clayton the decedent and she sipped the coffee where and for a first cause of action taylor lockwood did willfully ascertain and make public certain facts about one wendall clayton the decedent that caused taylor sat back in the chair closed her eyes that caused said decedent to blow his fucking brains out mitchell reece wrapped in a towel opened the bathroom door and smiling with pleasant surprise walked up to her kissed her on the mouth back early you okay i dont know wasnt fun thumb still hurt she asked a bit i tell you im no good at this sort of thing im much better with simpleminded safe sports he seemed to be groping for a joke something cute about sex probably but he sensed that she was upset he sat down on the bed opposite her so whats up taylor she shook her head what is it he persisted mitchell you know history he motioned with an open palm for her to continue she asked you know what the star chamber was just that it was a medieval english court why we learned about it in my european history course in college it came back to me last night the star chamber was a court without a jury run by the crown when the king thought the regular court might decide against him hed bring a case in the star chamber you got hauled up before these special judges the kings privy counselors theyd pretend to have a trial but you can guess what happened if the king wanted him guilty he was guilty very fast justice very efficient he looked at the coffee swirled it he set it down without drinking any more his face was somber she blurted christ mitchell the man is dead and you think its your fault a spasm of anger passed through her why cant he understand i was so stupid taylor looked at him briefly wondering how clayton had felt lifting the gun had it been heavy had there been pain how long had he lived after pulling the trigger what had he seen a burst of yellow light a second of confusion a wild eruption of thoughts then nothing taylor reece said with measured words clayton was crazy no sane man wouldve stolen the note in the first place and no sane man wouldve killed himself if hed been caught you cant anticipate people like that she gripped his arm firmly but thats the point mitchell youre thinking the problem is that wendall outflanked us that our fault was we werent clever enough but the fault was that we shouldntve been playing the game in the first place that firms like wonderland its got its own set of rules which dont even make sense half the time but you never think about that because youre so deep in the place topsyturvy everythings topsyturvy whatre you saying that we shouldve gone to the police and we shouldve let the chips fall wherever so new amsterdam wouldve left the firm well so what and you youre one of the best lawyers in new york you wouldve landed on your feet he rose and walked to the window finally he said softly i know i know you think i havent been living with exactly what youre talking about he turned to face her but if i dont lay part of the blame at claytons feet it undermines all my beliefs as a lawyer he touched his chest it undermines all that i am you know this is something im going to have to live with too i mean you did what i asked you to do but ultimately it was my decision so here was another aspect of mitchell reece not allpowerful not in control not immune to pain she walked next to him lowered her head onto his shoulder his hand twined through her hair im sorry mitchell this is very odd for me its not the sort of thing ms or savvy prepares the working girl for he rubbed her shoulders can i ask a favor she said sure can we go back he was surprised you want to leave ive had a wonderful time but im in such a funky mood i dont want to spoil our time together and i think id be a drag to be with but i havent learned to ski yet are you kidding youre a graduate of the taylor lockwood school of skiing injury you can go out now and break arms and legs all by yourself with that kind of education theres no telling how far you can go let me see when i can get the jet chapter thirtyone thursday afternoon taylor lockwood stood in front of the metropolitan museum of art on fifth avenue looking up at a brown brick apartment building across the street about as far from the wilderness of new hampshire as you could get conceptually speaking she checked the address again and verified that she had found the right building inside a solemn doorman regarded her carefully and then called upstairs to announce her she was approved and he nodded toward the elevator sixth floor he said which apartment she asked he looked confused for a moment then said its the whole floor oh she stepped into the leatherpadded elevator and was slowly transported to a private entryway she smoothed her hair looking into a brass mirror a huge thing the foyer was in dark red and filled with georgian yellow and white dovetail trim the pictures were old english hunting scenes plaster scrolls and cherubs and angels and columns were everywhere an ageless unsmiling woman in a plain navy shift answered the door asked her to wait then disappeared down the hallway taylor glanced through the doorway the rooms were larger versions of the foyer she looked back into the mirror and stared at herself at a person who was thinner than shed expected thinner and what else more drawn gaunter grimmer she tried smiling it didnt take a shadow passed across her and mrs wendall clayton stood in the doorway a middleaged woman wearing the stiff straightcut bigpatterned clothes that people who learned style in the sixties still sometimes favor her straight hair was swept back and sprayed perfectly into place her thin face was severe the foundation makeup had been applied thickly but her skin wasnt good and taylor could see red patches beneath the pancake they shook hands and made introductions taylor followed the woman into the living room why the hell am i doing this she wondered suddenly what possible point could it have im here to give you my deepest sympathy im here to say i worked with your husband im here to say that even though hes dead dont feel too bad because he tried to seduce me mrs clayton sat upright in an uncomfortable satin wingback taylor in a spongy armchair im here because i helped kill your husband the widow asked tea coffee no thank you taylor said and then realized that the womans dress was red and that this was hardly a household in mourning the room was festooned with antique christmas decorations and there was a faint but rich scent of pine in the air classical christmas music played on the stereo taylor looked at the womans cocked eyebrow and her expression which wasnt one of bitterness or sorrow it was closer to curiosity i worked with your husband mrs clayton yes i just came to tell you how sorry i was and taylor understood then only at that moment that uttering those words was all she could do watching this stolid lone woman taylor couldnt picture her as one half of the claytons light a cigarette she understood that the spirits of donald burdick and vera burdick and messrs hubbard white and willis themselves had accompanied her here and were laying cold fingers on her lips she could not even here in claytons home do what she desperately wanted to do explain explain that shed been the one whod uncovered the terrible secrets about her husband that she was the cause the proximate cause the law would say of his death no thered be no confession taylor knew what bound her in this joint venture hubbard white willis had secured her soul thats very kind of you after a pause the woman asked did i see you at the funeral there were so many people i wasnt there no taylor eased back in the chair uncomfortable and crossed her arms wished shed asked for coffee to keep her hands busy now she looked around the room aware of its size the ceilings were twenty feet high it reminded her of national trust mansions and palaces in england taylor said he was an excellent lawyer claytons widow said i suppose she was examining a tabletop it seemed to be a dust inspection but then we didnt talk much about his career taylor was counting the squares in the carpet trying to figure out the designs finally st george and the dragon she believed beware the jabberwock the widow paused the truth is ms lockwood im a little bewildered i dont know you though we may have met before but you seem genuinely upset by my husbands death and i cant quite figure out why youre not like the little sycophants whove come by since he died the associates at the firm they thought they were covering it up but i could see through them in their eyes you could tell that they were amused at his death i know theyd chuckled about it over their beers when they were alone do you know why they were here taylor was silent they came because they thought word would get back to the firm that theyd done their duty theyd made an appearance that might earn them another point or two get them a step closer to being partner she pressed out her cigarette which is so ironic of course because they didnt grasp the situation at all they shouldve been avoiding this house as if it were a leper colony if word gets back to burdick that young samuel and frederick and douglas were paying respects to me well then my god theyre in dutch at worst theyd had the bad judgment to pick the wrong side at best they were displaying an oblivion about law firm politics so you see ms lockwood i am a little perplexed by your sympathy call a smile that sounds appropriately victorian doesnt it sympathy call well you arent here to toady you arent here to gloat your dress and demeanor tell me you couldnt care less about what the donald burdicks and wendall claytons of the world think of you youre clearly not one of the little malleable things he picked for his dare i use the euphemism girlfriends no youre genuinely upset i can see that well you may have respected my husband as a lawyer and an ambitious businessman but i doubt very much if you respected him as a human being and i know without a doubt that you didnt like him you had a loss in your life and im sorry taylor said evenly i didnt mean anything more or less than that she fell silent watching this shrewd woman light another cigarette with bony red hands it seemed as if the smoke that floated out of her nose and mouth had over the years taken with it her weight and softness mrs clayton finally laughed well i appreciate that ms lockwood forgive my cynicism i hope i havent offended you but dont feel sorry for me heavens no youre young you dont have any experience with marriages of convenience well lets not go that far taylor thought replaying many images her parents twin beds her mother with her glass of wine sitting alone in front of the television her father calling at midnight saying he was staying at his club night after night after night claytons widow said i guess youd say our relationship wasnt even a marriage it was a merger his assets and mine a certain camaraderie love was there any love between williams computing and rfc industries when they consolidated to name just one of the deals that took so much of wendalls time she looked out over the park spindly with branches the residue of snow faintly surviving in shadows and thats the irony you see what love there was never any between us and yet im the one he was most content with cold scheming wendall the power broker the master of control but once outside of our life he was at sea vulnerable thats why he killed himself of course for love what do you mean taylor heard herself ask her heart pounding fast he killed himself for love the widow repeated thats the one thing wendall didnt understand and couldnt control love oh how he wanted it and as with so many beautiful powerful people it was denied him he was an alcoholic of love hed go off on his benders with his chippies his little sluts and there were plenty of them women would flock to him a few of the men too i should tell you how they all would want him hed spirit them away on carriage rides buy them roses have a breakfast tray put together at le pengord and sent to their apartments wendall goes acourting they were all disasters of course the girls never quite lived up to what he wanted the older ones they turned out to be every bit as superficial and material and cold she laughed again dropping a worm of ash in the ashtray as cold as i was or hed pick a young puppy some ingénue whod cling to him desperately rearrange her life around him then hed feel the arms around his neck dragging him down someone relying on him my lord we couldnt have that could we then hed dump them and back hed come to me to nurse his wounds taylor jumped in to steer the conversation back on course what do you mean about his suicide killing himself for love its the only thing that makes sense he mustve fallen madly in love with somebody and he was sure she was the one when she told him no it mustve devastated him but the note he left said he was under pressure at work stress oh he wrote that for my benefit if hed mentioned a girlfriend well it would have embarrassed me she laughed the idea of wendall killing himself because of pressure why he lived for pressure he wasnt happy unless he had ten projects going at once ive never seen him happier than over the past few months working on the merger doing deals for his clients and then planning the other firm what other firm she looked at taylor cautiously then pushed out her cigarette i suppose it doesnt matter anymore in case the merger didnt go through he was going to leave hubbard white willis take his boys and a couple of dozen partners and open his own firm it was his alternative plan i think he almost preferred that to the merger because hed be a named partner he always wanted to have his name on the letterhead clayton jones smith or whatever another firm taylor wondered the widow resumed her examination of central park flora then smiled that note he could have said in the note how unhappy he was with me as a wife with our life together but he didnt i was very touched rising mrs clayton looked at her watch id like to talk to you longer she picked up her dunhill cigarette case but i have bridge club in ten minutes aristocratize taylor lockwood was sitting at wendall claytons desk it was late afternoon and a yellowgray illumination lit the room from the pale sun over new york harbor the office lights were out and the door closed she looked at the jotting on a faded piece of foolscap aristocratize was that a word taylor glanced at the brass the carpets the vases the tile painting the wall of deal binders the stacks of papers like the one that had held the note and tape recordings of her conversations with mitchell reece the huge chair creaked as she moved men of most renowned virtue spinning around once more to face the window she decided that whether it was real or not aristocratize certainly described the essence of wendall clayton there was no reason for her to be in the firm technically she was still on vacation courtesy of donald burdick she could leave at any moment smile at ms strickland and walk out of the front door with impunity she was in fact due at mitchell recces loft right about now it turned out that he could cook after all and was planning to make them a tortellini salad for dinner he was currently baking the bread himself she wanted to lie in his huge bathtub a wonderful bathtub that had claw feet to luxuriate in the water holding a thinstemmed glass of wine and smell him cooking whatever went into a tortellini salad instead taylor slouched down in claytons chair and spun slowly in a circle degrees once twice three times alice spinning as she fell down the rabbit hole alice buffeted on the ocean of tears alice arguing with the queen of hearts off with their heads off with their heads taylor stopped spinning she began what shed come here for a detailed examination of the contents of wendall claytons desk and filing cabinets a half hour later taylor lockwood walked slowly downstairs to the paralegal pen she made certain that no one was in the cubicles surrounding hers then looked through her address book and found the number of her favorite private eye john silbert hemming he stopped suddenly jolted as he watched her slip out of wendall claytons office looking around carefully as if she didnt want to be seen sean lillick ducked into a darkened conference room where taylor lockwood couldnt see him it had scared the hell out of him as he was walking toward claytons office to see the sudden shadow appearing in the doorway for a split second all his chic retropunk east village cynical sensibilities had vanished and hed thought fuck me its a ghost what the hell had she been doing in there he now wondered lillick waited until she was gone and the corridor was empty then he too ducked into the dead partners office and locked the door behind him it was excellent tortellini salad filled with all sorts of good things only about half of which she recognized the bread was lopsided but reece had propped it up in a cute way whatever us shape it tasted wonderful he opened a cold pouillyfuisse they ate for ten minutes taylor nodding as he told her about the impending settlement conference in boston during which hanover stiver would transfer the bulk of the principal of the loan back to new amsterdam he told anecdotes about some of lloyd hanovers shady business dealings normally she liked it when he talked about his job because although she didnt always understand the nuances the animation and enthusiasm that lit up his face were infectious tonight though she was distracted he finally caught on that something was wrong and his voice faded he looked concerned but before he could question her taylor set her fork down with a tap mitchell he refilled their glasses and cocked an eyebrow at her theres something i have to tell you yes he asked cautiously perhaps suspecting some personal confession ive been looking into a few things about wendall clayton reece sipped his wine nodded he didnt kill himself taylor picked a lopsided bit of bread crust off the table and dropped it on her plate he was murdered chapter thirtytwo mitchell reece smiled as if waiting for a punch then why do you think that i went to see his widow taylor said then she added quickly oh i wasnt going to tell her what happened about the note and everything but she paused well you know im not sure why i went it was something i just had to do he said i hear shes a bitch taylor shrugged she was civil enough to me but you know what she told me that if wendall couldnt get the merger through he was going to start his own firm what reece frowned nodding she said he had it all planned out i went through his desk at the firm i found business plans bank loan applications he even had the firm name selected clayton stone samuels he had a sample letterhead printed up and hed been talking to a broker about space in the equitable building reece too had put down his utensils but if he was ready to start his own firm it makes no sense for him to risk his career to push the merger through exactly stealing the note hed be disbarred if he got caught and hed probably be prosecuted taylor held up a finger another thing think about the gun the gun he used right i called my detective my private eye and he talked to some buddies of his at the police department the gun he used was a smith wesson knockoff made in italy no serial number its one of the most popular street guns there is its like your mcdonalds of firearms is what john said but if youre going to kill yourself why buy an untraceable gun you go to a sporting goods store show a drivers license and buy a twelvegauge shotgun or reece said sitting forward why even shoot yourself its messy unpleasant for your loved ones id think youd park your car in the garage with the engine running she nodded her agreement what i think is that somebody else stole the note and planted it in claytons office then when we found it he murdered clayton to make it look like suicide whos the he reece asked at first i wondered if his widow mightve done it i mean here she was hosting a bridge party right after he died she knew about the affairs hed had so she certainly had a motive and she must have inherited some bucks from him true but then i got to thinking and it seems that the killerd need to know about the firm and have access to it claytons widow isnt like vera burdick whos there all the time besides mrs clayton didnt seem that upset with all his affairs well reece suggested what about one of them a lover somebody clayton dumped sure thats a possibility or the husband or wife of somebody hed had an affair with but taylor added smiling what about some of the people we thought were suspects ralph dudley clayton had found out about junie and was blackmailing him and thom sebastian clayton was the main reason he didnt make partner he occurred to me too and one other possibility reece frowned shaking his head taylor pointed upward go to the top donald burdick reece laughed look i know the motives there but donald i cant believe it whoever stole the note risked not only my career but risked losing a client as well if we lost the case theres no way donald wouldve put new amsterdam at risk taylor countered but there was no risk at the very worst if we hadnt found the note donald wouldve sent his thief to get the note back from claytons office and it wouldve shown up on the file room floor or someplace in time for you to introduce it at trial reece nodded considering this and look how well burdick covered everything up the medical examiner the prosecutor the press nobody knows about the promissory note theft and everything else the evidence we found in claytons office the real suicide note im sure burdicks shredded it by now but then reece shook his head lets think about this if it is burdick remember that hes real tight with city hall and albany we cant trust the police well go to the u s attorneys office ive still got friends there ill call them but didnt donald call somebody in the justice department she asked after they found the body reece paused i dont remember yeah i think he did taylor said youre going to boston tomorrow for the settlement closing do you know anybody in justice up there yeah i do i havent talked to him for a while lets see if hes still there he walked to his desk and found his addressbook and picked up the phone but he looked at it wanly bugs taylor asked lets not take any chances well go downstairs on the street they found a pay phone and reece made a credit card call sam latham please hey sam mitchell reece the men apparently knew each other well and taylor deduced from the conversation that theyd both been prosecutors in new york some years ago after a few whateverhappenedtos reece told him their suspicions about claytons death they made plans to meet at the u s attorneys office in boston the next day after the hanover settlement closing he hung up hes getting his boss and an fbi agent to meet with me taylor felt a huge weight lifted from her at last the authorities were involved this was the way the system was supposed to work they returned upstairs reece closed the front door and latched it then walked up behind her enfolded her in his arms she leaned her head back and slowly turned so that they were facetoface he glanced at the table where the meal sat unfinished the exceptionally good tortellini salad the cold wine the sagging bread she smiled and with her fingertips turned his head back to face her she kissed him hard without a word they walked to recces bed so far not so good thom sebastian sat back in his office chair pushing aside the documents hed been working on all morning a revolving credit agreement for new amsterdam bank he should have been comfortable should have been content but he was troubled wendall clayton the man whod destroyed his chances for partnership at hubbard white was gone as dead as a shot pheasant in one of the hunting prints hanging in the partners office good but his life didnt really feel good he had a brooding sense that his entire world was about to be torn apart and this terrified him three times he reached for the phone hesitated put his hands flat on his thick thighs and remained where he was he peeked under his blotter and saw the notes hed gathered on taylor lockwood over the past ten days or so taylor lockwood the sole reason that things werent so good come on mr fucking negotiator make a decision but ultimately he knew there was no decision at all because there was only one thing to do the problem was finding the courage to do it the next morning reece called taylor from boston she was at her apartment shed decided it was safest to stay away from the firm he called to report that the settlement had gone well the money from the hanover settlement had been safely wired into a new amsterdam account and hed endured lloyd hanovers relentless glare and potshots at lawyers throughout the closing reece was on his way to meet with his friend in the us attorneys office i miss you he said hurry home she told him lets get this behind us and go back and ski for real or he joked go back and shop and eat dinner at the inns ill get you on black diamond slopes sooner or later what the hell ive still got one thumb and eight fingers left after some christmas shopping taylor stopped at a coffee shop on sixth avenue around the corner from her apartment for some lunch sitting at the counter she wondered what to get reece for christmas he had all the clothes he needed wine was too impersonal then she recalled his collection of lead soldiers shed find one that was perfect for him just one a special one antique expensive but where well this was new york the city that boasted neighborhoods devoted to special interests the garment district the flower district even the sewing machine district there was probably a cluster of stores somewhere in midtown selling antique toys a man sat down next to her a large workman in gray coveralls wearing a baseball cap there was something vaguely familiar about him and she wondered if he worked in her apartment building the structure was old and there were always people renovating and repairing he pulled out a book and began reading taylors chicken soup came and as she was sprinkling tabasco on it the man next to her took a sip of coffee when he replaced the cup his elbow knocked his book to the floor it dropped at her feet oh sorry he said blushing no problem she said and bent down to retrieve the book when she handed it to him he smiled his thanks and said i like this place you come here a lot a trace of some accent from one of the outer boroughs some with your boyfriend he asked smiling ruefully she nodded and let the small lie do double duty let him know she wasnt interested and save his ego from a flatout rejection ah well he sighed and returned to his book when she left he was working on a double cheeseburger he waved to her and called merry christmas you too she said back at home she pulled the phone book out from under her bed and looked up toy stores well lets start at the beginning as she stood to get the phone she realized she felt achy as if a cold were coming on her head was hurting a bit too she went into the bathroom to get some aspirin swallowed them down and returned to the bedroom to start calling the stores in search of recces christmas present feeling tired she reclined on the bed and picked up the cordless phone shed dialed the first digit when she gasped and sat up fast a churning pain struck somewhere deep within her abdomen her face burst out in sweat oh man she whispered not the flu not now recalling that she often got sick around christmas when she was young a therapist shed seen for a while had wondered if it wasnt her dread of a holiday presided over by a domineering father oh she moaned again pressing the skin above the pang hard with both her hands it ceased for a moment then exploded in another eruption of agony taylor stood up adding nausea to the sensation the room began to spin and she tried to control her fall to the parquet floor her head hit the dressing table and she blacked out when she opened her eyes she saw claws the jabberwocks claws disemboweling her tearing her stomach throat the back of her mouth shredding her flesh she squinted no no they were just the claws on the legs of her bed she the pain stunned her again and she moaned a low animal sound sweat filled her eyes and ran down her nose she wrapped her arms around herself and drew her legs up trying to stop the pain every muscle hard as rubber she tried to will the pain away but this had no effect then the nausea overwhelmed her and taylor crawled to the toilet opened the seat and held herself up on one arm while she vomited and retched for what seemed like hours her hands shook her skin was inflamed she stared at the tiny hexagonal tiles in front of her until she fainted again consciousness returned and she struggled for the phone but her muscles gave out and she dropped again to the floor from a distant dimension she heard a thunk the sound of her head hitting the tiles she understood now that shed been poisoned the man at the restaurant the workman in the coveralls and baseball cap he was the one whod stolen the note the one whod run them off the road the one whod killed wendall clayton that was why hed seemed familiar because she mustve seen him in the firm or following her and reece earlier maybe hed overheard her conversation with john silbert hemming maybe hed put a tap on her phone at the office or even in her apartment she then the poison began to churn again and she started to retch in earnest unable to breathe trying to scream for help slamming her hand on the dresser so that somebody might hear and come to her aid perfume bottles fell makeup an alice in wonderland snowball crashed to the floor and broke the water and sparkles spattering her she began to pummel the floor until she realized she had no feeling in her hand it was completely numb taylor lockwood began to cry she crawled to the phone dialed police and fire emergency she couldnt speak her tongue had turned to wood the air was becoming thinner and thinner sucked from the room the voice said is anyone there hello hello taylors hands stopped working she dropped the phone she closed her eyes chapter thirtythree what happened carrie mason asked the doctor was a woman in her midthirties she had straight blond hair and wore no makeup except for bright blue eye shadow the medicos badge said dr v sarravich the woman said botulism botulism food poisoning im afraid she ate some severely tainted food is she going to be okay botulisms much more serious than other types of food poisoning shes unconscious in shock severely dehydrated the prognosis isnt good we should get in touch with her family if she has any she lived alone and apparently the police couldnt find her address book or any nextofkin information we found your name and number on a card in her purse i dont know where her parents live ill give you the name of someone who can get in touch with them can i see her shes in the critical care unit you cant visit now dr sarravich said medical people were all so serious the girl thought carrie asked is it really bad she hesitated a concession to delicacy and said im afraid it may be fatal and even if it isnt there could be some permanent damage what kind of damage neuromuscular to her hands carrie asked possibly but shes a musician the paralegal said alarmed a pianist its too early to tell anything at this point a pen and paper appeared and the doctor asked now whom should i contact carrie wrote a name and phone number the doctor looked at the pad donald burdick who is he the head of the firm she works at he can tell you everything you want to know taylors eyes opened slowly her skin stung from the sandblasting of fever her vision was blurred her head was in a vise of fiery pressure her legs and arms were useless like blocks of wood grafted to her torso the nausea and cramps were still rampaging through her abdomen and her throat was dry as paper there was a young woman in a pale blue uniform making the bed next to hers taylor had never been in such pain every breath brought pain every twitch was a throb of pain she assumed that the nerves in her hands and legs had shortcircuited she couldnt move her limbs taylor whispered no reaction from the young woman she screamed the attendant cocked her head she screamed again no reaction taylor closed her eyes and rested after the agonizing effort several minutes later the bed was made as the attendant walked toward the door she glanced at taylor taylor screamed poison the aide leaned down did you say something honey taylor smelled fruity gum on her breath and felt like gagging poison she managed to say i was poisoned yes food poisoning the girl said and started to leave taylor screamed i want mitchell the girl held up the watch on her pudgy wrist its not midnight its about six i want mitchell please taylor tried fiercely to hold on to consciousness but it spilled away like a handful of sugar she had an impression of struggling to leap out of bed and calling mitchell in boston but then she realized that her legs and arms had started to spasm then a nurse was standing over her staring in alarm and reaching for the call button pushing it fiercely over and over and then the room went black at pm the telephone in donald burdicks coop rang he was in the living room he heard vera answer it then mentally followed her footsteps as they completed a circuit that ended in the arched entrance near him her calm face appeared phone don vera said its the doctor the wall street journal crumpled in his hand he rose and together they walked to the den yes he asked mr burdick a womans matteroffact voice asked this is dr vivian sarravich again from manhattan general hospital im calling about ms lockwood yes im afraid i have bad news sir miss taylor has gone into a coma our neurologists opinion is that she wont be coming out of it in the near future if at all and if she does shes certain to have permanent brain and neuromuscular damage burdick shook his head to vera he held the phone out a ways so that she too could hear its that bad this is the most severe case of botulism ive ever seen the infection was much greater than usual shes had two respiratory failures we had to put her on a ventilator and a feeding tube of course her family weve told them her parents are on their way here yes well thank you doctor youll keep me posted of course i am sorry we did everything we could im sure you did burdick hung up and said to his wife she probably wont make it vera gave a neutral nod and then glanced at the maid whod silently appeared beside them theyre here mrs burdick show them into the den nita donald burdick poured port into waterford glasses his hands left fingerprints in a slight coating of dust on the bottle which he noticed had been put up in the year that a democratic president had been killed the year he made his first million dollars the year that happened to be a very good one for vintage port he carried the glasses to the guests bill stanley lamar fredericks woody crenshaw all old fogies his granddaughter might say if kids still used that word which of course they didnt and three other members of the executive committee three young partners to whom burdick was making a point of being kind and deferential three partners who were in absolute terror at the moment because they had been picked and polished by wendall clayton and then leveraged by him onto the executive committee the men were in burdicks study outside wet snow slapped on the leaded glass windows to hubbard white willis burdick said glasses were raised but not rung together the reconstruction had began swiftly only one of claytons lackeys had been fired outright tall young randy simms iii a fairtomiddlin lawyer but one hell of a scheming nazi sycophant vera burdick had observed it had been her delightful task to transmit through her own social network rumors of various types of illegal scams the young partner was guilty of by the time she was through hed been thoroughly blackballed and was a pariah in the world of new york law and upper east side society as for the other pretty young men and women associates on claytons side they werent asked to leave the theory being theyd work even harder to rid themselves of the contamination these secessionists and collaborators were given the shavedhead treatment then kicked onto the summer outing and hiring committees these three nameless were the last order of business in the purge one of them said your wife donald is a charming lady burdick smiled they had of course met vera before this evening though she had never served them dinner never entertained them never told them stories of her travels and anecdotes about her famous political friends never in short grilled them like an expert interrogator he set the assassinationyear bottle in the middle of the tea table he said bill knows this but for the rest of you i have some news im meeting tomorrow with john perelli we have a problem of course perellis position is that wendalls discussions with him suggest an implicit agreement to go forward with the merger even though the whole firms never approved it one of the nameless nodded impressed that the man returned his gaze burdick continued his thinking is that we agreed to negotiate in good faith the firm has now decided that we do not want to go forward simply because we do not want to go forward that is not good faith we have an implied contract problem look at texaco and pennzoil another nameless i know the law don this was a little brash as the youngster understood immediately he continued more contritely i agree theyd have an argument but i think we hedged well enough so that with wendall gone the basic deal has changed vera asked bluntly was claytons presence a condition precedent to going forward two of the nameless blinked hearing the charming woman nail the legal situation perfectly with one simple question no her husband smiling shrugged then i submit we still have our problem the first nameless said but what would they want as a remedy specific performance burdick decided the man was an idiot and made a mental note to give him only scut work for the rest of his time at hubbard white of course not the courts cant make us merge bill stanley said they want money and what do we want when no one answered he answered himself silence burdick said no more publicity under any circumstances a senior partner kills himself bad enough and were going to lose clients because of that my friend then a suit from perelli no i want to preempt them lamar fredericks round bald and roasted from two weeks of golf on antigua said preempt you mean bribe cut the crap and tell us what its going to cost burdick looked at stanley who said to the group wed pay perelli twenty million up to that is well start lower of course full release and agreement not to say anything to the press if they do liquidated damages of a double refund crenshaw snorted what does that do to our partnership shares burdick snapped itll be a cut out of operating profits take a calculator and figure it out yourself will they buy into it burdick said ill be as persuasive as i can the reason youre all here is that it would be an expenditure out of the ordinary course i dont want to present it to the firm so to authorize it we need a threequarters vote of the executive committee none of them had assumed that this was solely a social dinner of course but it was not until this moment that they understood the total implications of the invitation they were the swing votes and were being tested burdick had to know where they stood so burdick said cheerfully are we all in agreement this was the final exorcism of wendall clayton in these three trim handsome lawyers resided what was left of his ambitious spirit was his legacy burdick wondered as powerful as the man gazes met no one swallowed or shuffled when burdick called for the vote they each said an enthusiastic in favor burdick smiled and when he poured more port gripped one of them on the shoulder welcome to the club he was the foolish partner the one whose professional life would be a living hell from that day on then burdick sat down in his glossy leather wingback chair and reflected on how much he despised them for not having the mettle to take claytons fallen standard and shove it up his burdicks ass he then grew somber oh just so you know we have another problem im afraid what do you mean stanleys voice was a harsh whine one of the paralegals is in the hospital vera burdick explained its quite serious i have a feeling she wont survive who a nameless dared to ask taylor lockwood taylor oh no not her shes one of the best assistants i ever had on a closing what happened food poisoning nobody knows exactly how she got it should we one of the nameless began to ask but vera burdick interrupted im on top of it dont worry bill stanley shook his head god i only hope it wasnt anything we catered could you pass that port donald chapter thirtyfour mitchell reece closed his litigation bag and slid it under the seat of the shuttle from boston as they approached la guardia early the next morning still no call from taylor lockwood and he hadnt been able to reach her at the firm hed gotten only her voice mail he wondered what was going on but as he stared at the brown and gray expanse of the bronx beneath him his thoughts returned to wendall claytons funeral held in an episcopalian church on park avenue the ministers words came clearly to mind irecall one time when i happened to meet wendall it was a saturday evening late we happened to be strolling up madison avenue together he returning from the firm i from some function at my congregation the minister had forsaken the pulpit and like a talk show host walked down into his audience and we passed a few moments in idle conversation though we were in very different places in our lives i saw that there were striking similarities between his profession and mine he voiced some concern for a young man or woman a lawyer at his firm who was suffering from doubts wendall wanted to inspire this protégé to be the best lawyer they might be hundreds of people most of the partners from hubbard white willis many associates many friends had attended just as i in my own way deal with spiritual doubt in our young people quite a church reece recalled huge pointy gothic solid all the joists and beams met in perfect unison high in the air it was a fitting place for an aristocratic man to be eulogized then he thought back to another death at the firm linda davidoffs her funeral reece decided had been much better the church was tamer the minister more upset it seemed to reece preferable to get more tears and fewer words from men of the cloth at times of mourning claytons upper east side minister had been correct about one thing though he and clayton had indeed been cut from the same bolt noblemen and medieval clergy in tarot cards pentacles would be their suit choose this sign for dark men of power and money aggressive men the minister was seizing an opportunity to preach just as clayton had seized a chance of his own and had died as a consequence of his reach the sudden grind and windy slam of the planes wheels coming down interrupted reeces thoughts and as he glanced out the window reece decided it was ironic that he saw below him the huge cluster of dense graveyards in queens a whole city of a graveyard he watched until it vanished under the wing and they landed as he walked down the ramp toward the terminal reece saw his last name on a card being held up by a limo driver is that for mitchell reece he asked yes sir you have luggage just this the man took his bags reece gave him the address of the firm were supposed to stop someplace else sir what do you mean im afraid theres some kind of problem reece climbed into the back of the lincoln what kind of problem an emergency of some kind forty minutes later the driver pulled up in front of yellowpainted doors at an annex to manhattan general hospital it was deserted except for some big blue biohazard containers and a bloody gurney sitting by itself it seemed as if a body had just been pulled from it and hauled off to a paupers grave inside reece stopped at a reception desk and was directed down a long dim corridor he found the basement room he sought and pushed open the door grayfaced and redeyed taylor lockwood blinked in surprise at his entrance and shut off the soap opera she was watching she smiled mitchell its you kiss me its not contagious then see if you can scarf up some food im starving to death suck on ice reece said when he returned a few minutes later taylor frowned i asked them what you could have to eat they said you should suck on ice she nodded at the iv glucose its pure carbohydrates im dying for a hamburger reece gave her a life saver you look well awful awful is a compliment considering how i did look the nurse tells me ive recovered incredibly well what happened taylor nodded i was stupid im sure my phone was bugged too either at my apartment or cubicle i shouldve thought about that anyway we got busted somebody overhead us and then at lunch yesterday this guy sits down next to me he drops a book i mean pretends to drop a book and when i bent down to pick it up for him i think he squirted botulism culture into my soup jesus botulism the most dangerous food poisoning there is she nodded i think he got it from genneco labs our client yep i was talking to a pathologist here he told me genneco does a lot of research into antitoxins you know like antidotes so whoever killed clayton stole some culture or told the killer about genneco and he stole it she nodded i was feeling a lot better last night but i called donald and told him i was almost dead in a coma you what i wanted word to get around the firm that i was almost dead i was afraid the killer would try again i called and pretended i was my doctor she gave a faint laugh i called my parents and told them that whatever they heard i was fine although i have to say i was inclined to let my father stew a bit more carrie masons the only one who knows im okay reece stroked her cheek botulism that couldve killed you the doctor told me that luckily i ingested too much of the culture i got sick immediately and well the word they used was quote evacuated most of the bacteria man it was unpleasant im talking mount saint helens he hugged her hard were not going to have to worry about anything like this happening again i talked to sam my friend at the u s attorneys office yesterday afternoon hes coming down tomorrow with a special prosecutor from washington were going to meet with him at the federal building at three if you feel up to it ill feel up to it whoevers behind this were going to stop them her voice faded whats wrong mitchell wrong his eyes were hollow and troubled you almost got killed im so sorry if id known she leaned forward and kissed him hey i lost those five pounds i gained at thanksgiving and then some call it an early christmas present now go on get out of here next time you see me i promise i wont look like marleys ghost chapter thirtyfive the girl walked sheepishly into the hospital room hiding behind a bouquet of exotic flowers that shed probably handselected from an upper east side florist whoa taylor told carrie mason laughing at the massive arrangement anything left in the rain forest the chubby girl set the vase on the bedside table and sat in the functional gray chair near taylors bed studying her carefully youre looking a thousand times better taylor carrie said everybodys like ohmagod shes dying i wanted to tell them but i didnt not a soul like you said taylor gave her a rundown on her condition and thanked the girl for staying with her just after shed been admitted its like no problem taylor you looked you were pretty sick attempted murder does that to you well ill be getting out soon may not eat for a week or so but itll be good to get vertical again the girl avoided taylors eyes she stood and arranged the flowers and it was this compulsive activity that told taylor that she was troubled by something what is it carrie the girl paused her back to taylor then sat down again tears were running down her cheeks she wiped her face with the back of her fleshy hand i go ahead tell me whats the matter i think i know why mr clayton killed himself i think it was my fault your fault taylor said what do you mean well okay you know sean one of the firms busier spies taylor nodded well what it was see last week sean asked me out i went over to his place and i thought he wanted to go out with me and i was really really excited about it cause ive had this crush on him for like a while but it turned out i mean the thing was he just wanted to go through my purse why to get my logon pass code for the firm computers one of the operators told me he went on the system with my user name taylor remembered the gumsnapping computer operator and the blank screen that should have had information about taxis and computer tune and phone records this was interesting she nodded for the girl to continue and listened carefully when i found out what he did i got totally mad i asked him how could he do that i mean he way used me anyway he got all freaked out and apologized but i was so mad well i wanted to get even with him and she again attended to the stalks of weird flowers and when i was in connecticut with mr clayton and you well afterward he came on to me mr clayton you know and well we sort of slept together taylor nodded recalling that shed overheard the tryst from claytons den the poor girl suckered in by the vortex of the partners eyes and charm so sean found out and he had this big fight with clayton it was really vicious i think sean threatened to go to the executive committee about what happened and clayton was afraid hed get fired and he killed himself taylor was frowning so he and lillick had had a fight it had never occurred to her that lillick might have killed clayton then she focused on the distraught carrie once more she couldnt of course say anything about claytons death but she could reassure the girl no carrie that had nothing to do with it a womantowoman smile wendall clayton slept with half the firm and he couldnt care less if anybody knew about it besides i talked to donald i know why clayton killed himself i cant tell you but it had nothing to do with you or sean really promise despite what happened i really kind of like him sean i mean hes weird but underneath hes not as weird as he seems to be we kind of patched things up i think he likes me im glad to hear that taylor decided it was time to get out of the hospital she feigned a yawn listen carrie im going to get some sleep now oh sure feel better carrie hugged her then she asked oh one thing do you know where the united charities of new york general correspondence file is no idea i never worked for them the girl frowned you didnt no why i was down in the pen this morning and i saw donald burdicks wife in your cubicle vera yeah she was looking through your desk and i asked what she needed and she said she was doing a fundraiser for the ucny and needed the file she thought you had it but we couldnt find it ive never checked out any of their files must be a mistake carrie glanced at the tv and her face lit up hey look its the bold and the beautiful thats my favorite i used to love summer vacations so i could watch all the soaps cant do that anymore things sure change when you start working well thats the truth taylors eyes strayed absently to the screen watching the actors lost in their own intrigues and desires when she turned to the doorway to say goodbye to carrie the paralegal had already left taylor felt uneasy lillick dudley sebastian burdick or somebody else had tried to poison her they might find out that she was no longer in a coma and try again she summoned the floor nurse who in turn managed to track down a resident the young doctor seeing the urgency in her eyes reluctantly agreed to discharge her as soon as the paperwork was finished after hed left she lay back in bed and looked through her purse for her insurance card she found a folded sheet of paper stuck in the back of the address book it was the poem that danny stuart had given her linda davidoffs poem her suicide note she realized that shed never read it which she now did when i leave by linda davidoff when i leave ill travel light and rise above the panorama of my solitude ill sail to you fast and high weightlessas the touch of night when i leave ill become a light that shows our love in a dear essential way after all what is a soul but love after all is reconciled and the darkness pitched away ill travel light transported home to you in the buoyancy of pure and peaceful flight taylor lockwood thought of linda the beautiful quiet gypsy poet she read the lines again very slowly then she read them once more a moment later a huge orderly appeared in the door ms lockwood good news the warden called he grinned she frowned not understanding then the man delivered the rest of what would be his stock joke its a full pardon youre free to go and he maneuvered the wheelchair into the room taylor lockwood had learned early who the real power centers were at hubbard white one of the most powerful was a short roundfaced woman of sixty mrs bendix had used her miraculous skills at memory and association to save the butts of almost every attorney and paralegal in the firm on more than one occasion by finding obscure file folders buried among the millions of documents residing on the gray metal shelves she was the doyen of the firms massive file room taylor now stood over mrs bendixs frothy blue hair as the woman flipped through the threebyfive cards that were her computer taylor silently waited for her to finish mrs bendix even more so than a senior partner was a person one did not interrupt when she was through she looked up and blinked i was told you were in the hospital we contributed for the flowers they were lovely mrs bendix i recovered more quickly than expected they said you were almost dead modern medicine mrs bendix was eyeing taylors jeans and sweatshirt critically this firm has a dress code youre outfitted for sick leave not work this is a bit irregular mrs bendix but i have a problem and youre just about the only person who can help me probably am no need to stroke i need a case which one youve got about nine hundred current ones to chose from an old case in that event the possibilities are limitless lets narrow things down genneco labs maybe a patent hubbard white does not do patent work we never have and im sure we never will well how about a contract for the development of bacterial or viral cultures or antitoxins nope taylor looked at the rows and rows of file cabinets a thought fluttered past then settled she asked insurance issues the storage of products toxins food poisoning and so on sorry not a bell is rung though in we did have a cruise line as a client i got a discount and took a trip to bermuda i ate pasta that disagreed with me very badly but i digress in frustration taylor puffed air into her cheeks mrs bendix said tantalizingly since you said toxins food poisoning and so on i assume you meant toxins food poisonings and so on taylor knew that when people like mrs bendix bait you you swallow the worm and the hook in their entirety she said maybe i was premature when i qualified myself well the woman said my mind harkens back to she closed her eyes creasing her gunmetal eye shadow then opened them dramatically biosecurity systems inc a contract negotiation with genneco for the purchase and installation of gennecos new security system in teterboro new jersey two years ago i understand the negotiations were a nightmare security taylor said i didnt think about that mrs bendix said apparently not can you tell me if anyone checked out the files on that deal in the past few months this was beyond her brain the woman pulled the logbook out and thumbed through it quickly then held it open for taylor to look at taylor nodded id like to check it out too if you dont mind surely then a frown crossed taylors face i wonder if we could just consider one more file this might be trickier i live for challenges mrs bendix replied chapter thirtysix the new york state department of social services worked fast after one anonymous phone call to the police the west side club became the frontpage feature in the evening edition of every tabloid in the new york area though gentlemen did not read such newspapers ralph dudley made an exception this once since the times wouldnt have the story until tomorrow morning he now sat at his desk lit only by a single battered brass lamp and the paltry december dusk light bleeding into his office and stared at the same article hed already read four times a halfdozen people were under arrest and two underage prostitutes were being placed in foster homes in upstate new york goodbye junie dudley thought hed made one last trip to see her just before hed made the call to which closed up the west side art and photography club forever here hed said handing her a bluebacked legal document shed stared at it uncomprehending like what is it its a court order the marshal seized your mothers and stepfathers bank accounts and house and theyve put the money into a special trust fund for you i like i dont get it the money your father left you the court took it away from your mother and theyre giving it back to you i won my petition whoa like radical how much is it a hundred and ninetytwo thousand awesome can i you cant touch it for three years until youre eighteen or whatever shed added and you only get it if you go to school what thats fucking bogus it was also untrue there were no strings on the money once she turned eighteen as the trust officer would undoubtedly tell her but shed have a few years to think about it and might just try a class or two junie might just succeed at school she was hed concluded more savvy than half the lawyers at hubbard white willis shed hugged him and then looked at him in that coy way that before this wouldve melted him but hed said he had to be going he had an important meeting with a pay phone hed looked at her for a long moment then kissed her on the cheek and left he wondered if junie would say anything about him she was of course in a position not only to destroy the delicate balance of his career such as it was but also to send him to prison for the rest of his life these possibilities he considered with remarkable serenity sipping coffee from a porcelain cup he weighed the odds and decided that she would say nothing although shed been badly used by life and had the dangerous edge of those who learn survival skills before maturity junie was nonetheless motivated by a kind of justice she saw essential good and essential evil assigned her loyalty accordingly and stuck by her choice there were few adults with that perception or that courage also dudley chose to believe that the girl loved him at least by her wary definition of that word goodbye junie he now set the paper down and rocked back in his chair reflecting that for once in his forty years as a lawyer hed given up charming people and trying to win clients rather hed mastered a tiny bit of the law in this small area of expertise he was now the best in the city restitution of parentally converted intestate distributions though he himself preferred to think of the subniche as saving teenage hookers bacon and he was proud of what hed learned and done still there was one more potential problem taylor lockwood knew his secret he picked up the phone and dialed a number hed been calling so often over the past two days that he had it memorized the main operator at manhattan general hospital answered he asked to speak to the floor nurse about the paralegals condition theyd been reluctant to talk about details but it was clear from the tone as well as from the gossip around the firm that the girl was near death maybe shed died that would take care of all the problems but then an orderly came on the phone the man listened to dudleys question and replied in a cheerful voice dont you worry sir your niece ms lockwood was discharged today shes doing fine an electric charge shot through him at this news he hung up with clayton dead she was the one person who could destroy his fragile life here at the firm she was the one risk to his budding life as a real lawyer so much of the law deals with risk dudley reflected some acceptable some not on which side did taylor lockwood fall he rocked back looking out the window at the tiny sliver of new york harbor that was visible between the two brick walls outside his office as she left the firm by the infamous back door no longer taped open she noticed taylor lockwood was aware of someones presence near her she stepped onto the sidewalk of church street which at one time had been the shoreline of lower manhattan now a half mile of landfill had extended the island well into the hudson and the harbor pausing she looked behind her this was a quiet street with a few bad restaurants a girlie bar ironically next to the rear entrance to trinity church and the dingy service entrances to a number of office buildings the street was now largely deserted she noticed a few businesspeople hurrying to or from one of the gyms near here and some construction workers a number of vans were parked on the narrow street half on the sidewalk she had to walk around a drapery cleaning van to step into the street and hail a taxi of course there were none then in the bulbous disk of a wideangle rearview mirror on one of the vans she noticed a man looking her way she gasped there was nothing ambiguous about the recognition this time it was the man in the baseball cap the one whod sat next to her in the coffee shop the killer the thief okay he doesnt know you saw him you can get out of this shaking her head casually as if discouraged that there were no cabs taylor turned slowly back to the sidewalk then instantly reversed herself and sprinting as fast as her stillweak legs could carry her made straight for population she glanced back once and saw that the man had given up any pretense he was running after her he reached into his coveralls and pulled out a long dark object at first she thought it was a gun but then she realized that it was a knife or ice pick still dehydrated and in severe pain from the poisoning her muscles began to slow judging distances taylor realized that she wasnt going to make it to broadway or one of the other heavily traveled streets before the killer reached her she stopped suddenly in the middle of the street and jogged down the concrete stairs to the rector street subway stop this was better than the street anyway not only would there be people on the platform but the token seller in the booth would have a hot line to the transit police the killer wouldnt follow her here he but he was following grim determination to kill her on his face a glance back showed that hed picked up the speed as if he could sense her fatigue and was moving in for the coup de grace help me she screamed to the startled young woman in the token booth three or four people scattered or ducked as taylor vaulted the turnstile and fell hard onto the platform one man started to help her but she raged get away no get away there were more screams behind her as the killer reached the bottom of the stairs and looked for her a businessman hovering nearby saw the ice pick in the hand of the killer and backed up rising to her feet she ran as fast as she could along the platform to the far exit of the subway she heard the staticky voice of the token seller call out pay your fare as the killer jumped onto the platform and started after her sprinting as best she could she came to the end of the platform and turned to run up the stairs at the exit door but it was chained oh jesus she cried no taylor returned to the platform and saw the killer his face emotionless walking slowly now studying her carefully from thirty feet away anticipating her escape routes she jumped off the platform and dropped four feet into the muck between the rails turning away from the killer she began to run through the tunnel stumbling over the slippery ties he was right behind her saying nothing not threatening her or urging her to stop not negotiating there was only one thing he needed to do kill her taylor got only about twenty feet when exhausted she slipped on a slick piece of tie and nearly fell by the time she regained her balance the killer had made a leaping grab and seized her by the ankle she went down hard against the solid piece of wood catching her breath she lashed out with her other foot and caught him in the mouth or cheek with her sole a solid blow and he grunted and lost his grip fuck you he muttered spitting blood no fuck you she screamed and kicked again he dodged away from her and swung with the pick taylor rolled away and he missed but she couldnt climb to her feet he was coming forward too fast swinging the steel keeping her off balance finally she managed to stand but just as she was about to start running he grabbed her overcoat and pulled her legs out from under her she tumbled again to the ground her head bouncing hard on a tie she rose exhausted to her hands and knees no she said please the killer was up ready to pounce but taylor remained motionless on her hands and knees stunned what do you want she gasped breathless spent still no answer but why should he respond it was clear what he wanted she was the tiny bird that her father had hunted she was the victim of the queen of hearts off with her head off with her head the weapon drawing back its needlesharp point aiming at her face she lifted her head and gazed at him piteous dont please but he leaned forward and lunged with the pick aiming toward her neck which is when she dropped to her belly and scrabbled backward shed been feigning remaining on all fours like an exhausted soldier when in fact she had somewhere a tiny bit of strength left ah ah ah ah taylor squinted at him still in the position of attack right arm extended clutching that terrible weapon ah ah ah ah the terrible moan from his throat in his haste to stab taylor hed ignored what was just beyond her body what shed been trying to sucker him into hitting the electrified third rail of the subway which held more amperage than an electric chair ah ah ah ah there were no sparks no crackles but every muscle in his body was vibrating then blood appeared in his eyes and his sandy hair caught fire ah ah ah finally the muscles spammed once and he collapsed onto the tracks flames dancing from his collar and cuffs and head taylor heard voices and the electronic sound of walkietalkies from the rector street platform she supposed it would be the transit cops or the regular nypd it didnt matter she didnt want to see them or talk to them she knew now that there was only one thing to do that might save her taylor lockwood turned and vanished into the darkness of the tunnel chapter thirtyseven do you mind my saying i mean will you take it personally if i say you dont look very good john silbert hemming asked taylor lockwood said to the huge private eye i lost eight pounds in two days quite a diet you should maybe write a book im told you can make a lot of money doing that we couldnt market it the secret ingredient aint so appetizing im feeling better now they were at miracles pub she was probing at a bowl of greek chicken soup flavored with lemon it wasnt on the menu dimitris wife had made it herself she had some trouble with the spoon she had to keep her fingers curled her rings tended to fall off if she didnt maybe he joked cautiously you shouldve taken my offer to have dinner probably wouldve been better than where you ended up eating you know john i wish i had then she said i need a favor hemming who was eating a hamburger said if its not illegal and not dangerous and if you agree to go to the opera with me a week from saturday at eight oclock sharp id be happy to oblige she considered she said one out of three which one id like to go to the opera oh dear still it makes me very pleased though nervous considering youre balking on the other two now whats the favor he nodded toward his plate this is a very good hamburger can i offer you some she shook her head ah he resumed eating favor he repeated after a moment she asked why do people murder temper insanity love and occasionally for money the spoon in her hand hovered over the surface of the soup then made a soft landing on the table she pushed the bowl away the favor is i want you to get me something what a gun that kind i was telling you about the kind without any serial numbers it would be near quitting tune at the firm the end of another day at hubbard white willis files being stacked away dress shoes being replaced with adidas and reeboks places in law books being marked for the night edits being dropped in the in box for the night word processing staff four miles away taylor lockwood was hiding out in mitchell reeces loft she was concerned that the person behind claytons death might figure out that shed been responsible for the death of one hired gun and had called in a second one who was staking out her apartment right now she picked up the scarred gray revolver that john silbert hemming had gotten her she smelled it sweet oil and wood and metal warmed by her hand she hefted the small pistol much heavier than shed thought it would be then she put the gun in her purse and walked unsteadily to mitchell recces kitchen where she found a pen and one of his pads of yellow foolscap she wrote the note quickly he was due home at any moment and she didnt want him here to deter her from what she had to do in her scrawled handwriting taylor promised that shed explain everything to him later if she wasnt killed or arrested but she begged him to please please stay away from the firm tonight after all the deceit and horrors of the past two weeks shed learned who wendall claytons killer was shed gotten a gun and finally she was going to make sure that justice would be done chapter thirtyeight taylor lockwood had never liked this room the big conference room in the firm for one thing it was always dim a pastel room so underlit that the colors became muddy and unreal for another she associated it with the large meetings in which the paralegal administrator would gather her flock and give them all a rahrah pep talk which amounted to a plea not to quit just because the raises this year were going to be only percent mindless proletariat babble nonetheless at eight oclock in the evening here was taylor lockwood sitting in a large swivel chair at the base of the u the chair donald burdick reserved for himself suddenly the huge teak doors to the room opened and mitchell reece ran inside he stopped gasping when he saw the gun in her hand she looked at him with surprise mitchell what are you doing here your note i read the note you left where did you think id be i told you not to come why didnt you listen to me whatre you going to do with the gun she smiled absently its pretty obvious isnt it ive got to save us the us attorneys coming tomorrow dont do this to yourself the cops the u s attorney she laughed skeptically and what would they do we dont have any evidence you and i are never going to be safe we got run off the road i was poisoned i was almost stabbed to death what she didnt tell him about the latest assault just yet she muttered its just a matter of time until were dead if i dont stop things right here now you cant just shoot somebody in cold blood ill claim selfdefense insanity the insanity defense doesnt work taylor not in cases like this she rubbed her eyes the man who stole the notes dead what the janitor or whatever he was the one who put the poison in my food him he tried again he chased me into the subway but he got electrocuted jesus what did the police say no she shook her head i didnt go to them it wouldnt do any good mitchell theyd just hire somebody else well who is it he asked whos behind all this she didnt answer she glanced up over recces shoulder and said turn around and find out she hid the gun behind her back and called were over here come on in reece spun around a figure emerged from the dull light of the hallway into the deeper shadow of the end of the conference room donald burdick his posture perfect like a ballroom dancers stepped past the doors which swung closed with a heavy snap the partner called from across the room his voice ringing dully like a bell through fog taylor it is you he nodded at reece surprised to see im still alive your call it didnt make any sense whats all this about wendalls death he walked to within ten feet of them and stopped he remained standing we thought you were sick you mean you hoped i was dead she slowly lifted the gun his mouth opened he blinked taylor what are you doing with that she started to speak her voice choked and then she cleared her throat i had a speech rehearsed donald i forgot it but what i do know is that you hired that man to steal the note and set up claytons suicide then you had him run us off the road and try to kill me twice the dapper partner gave a harsh bark of a laugh are you crazy he looked at mitchell for help whats she saying reece shook his head gazing at taylor with concern i went through the file room logs donald you checked out a file for genneco last week i saw your signature maybe i did i dont remember gennecos my client but thered be no reason to check this file out it wasnt active as part of a contract negotiation their insurer analyzed their pathogen storage facility in new jersey it was basically a blueprint about how to break into the place you checked the file out and gave the information to your hit man he broke in stole some botulism culture and poisoned me no i swear i didnt and when that didnt work you sent him to stab me well hes dead donald how do you like that i dont know what youre talking about he started to turn and walk away no taylor cried dont move she thrust the gun toward him the partner stumbled backward lifting his hands helplessly taylor reece shouted no she screamed and cocked the gun burdick backed against the wall his eyes huge disks of terror reece froze they stood in those positions for a long minute taylor stared at the gun as if willing it to fire by itself i cant she whispered finally i cant do it the gun drooped reece stepped forward slowly and took the pistol from her he put his arm around her shoulders its all right he whispered i wanted to be strong she said i wanted to kill him but i cant do it burdick said to them both i swear i had nothing to do she pulled away from recces arm and faced burdick in her fury you may think you have the police and the mayor and everyone else in your pocket but its not going to stop me from making sure you spend the rest of your life in jail taylor grabbed a telephone off the table the partner shook his head taylor whatever you think its not true she had just started dialing when a hand reached over lifted the receiver away from her and replaced it in the cradle no taylor mitchell reece said he sighed and lifted the gun the muzzle pointing at her like a single black pearl no he repeated softly chapter thirtynine she gave a faint laugh of surprise much the same sound that mitchell reece himself had uttered when she told him a few days ago that clayton had been murdered then her smile faded and with bottomless horror in her voice she said what are you doing his face was stone his eyes expressionless but the answer was clear you mitchell she whispered donald burdick said one of you tell me whats going on here reece ignored him still holding the gun on both of them he walked to the door looked outside made sure the corridor was empty and returned he said to her angrily why the hell didnt you stop when you should have taylor why it was all planned out so carefully you ruined it burdick horrified said mitchell it was you you killed wendall clayton taylors eyes closed for a brief moment she shook her head reece told her wendall clayton killed the woman i loved taylor frowned then said linda linda davidof reece nodded slowly oh my god after a moment reece said it was all about a man and a woman as simple as that his eyebrows rose a man whod never had time for relationships a woman who was beautiful and creative and brilliant two people whod never been in love before not real love it wasnt a good combination an ambitious tough lawyer best in law school best at the firm the woman was a poet shy sensitive dont ask me how they became close opposites attract maybe a secret romance in a wall street law firm they worked together and started going out they fell in love she got pregnant and they were going to get married a moment passed and reece seemed to be hefting the words to select among them finally he continued wendall was working on a case one weekend and he needed a paralegal lindad cut way back on her hours thats when shed stopped working for me and sean lillick took over but she still worked occasionally she did a few assignments for wendall clayton and he got obsessed with her one weekend in september he found out she was at her parents summer house in connecticut not far from his place he went to see her tried to seduce her she called me crying but before i could get up there or she could get away there was a struggle and she fell into the ravine she died clayton left her poem to make it look like a suicide this whole thing taylor whispered it was fake you lied about everything your mother in the hospital you werent going to see her at all you were going to scarsdale to take flowers to lindas grave reece nodded the nail of taylors index finger touched the marble oh mitchell its so fucking clear now she looked at burdick dont you see what hes done she turned to face reece who leaned against the dark driedbloodred conference table looking gaunt and pale you got one of your criminal clients from the pro bono program what a hit man a killer a mercenary soldier you got him to break into your own file cabinet steal the hanover note and hide it in wendalls office then you had him bug your own office so youd look as innocent as possible you recorded some conversations then planted the tapes with the note you had me track him down she thought for a moment then at claytons party i found the receipt from the security service upstairs where you sent me to search after you planted it there finally i found the note in claytons office she laughed bitterly and after the hanover trial your hit man killed him right away because he couldnt very well be accused of something he hadnt done the lawyer made no effort to deny any of this she continued and his suicide note it was fake wasnt it who forged it another criminal client the associate lifted his eyebrow conceding the accuracy of her deduction she laughed bitterly glancing at the partner men of most renowned virtue reece was gazing at her impassive as a statue eyes still on reece locked on his taylor said and donald was a big help wasnt he she turned to the partner nothing personal donald but you laid a pretty damn good smoke screen her hands were shaking now the tears started and as for me well you were keeping pretty close tabs on your pawn all you had to do was look across the pillow a bit of emotion blossomed in his face at this like the first cracks in spring ice reece took a kleenex from his pocket and began rubbing the trigger guard and grip and frame of the gun he nodded you wont believe me if i tell you that what happened between us wasnt part of the plan bullshit you tried to kill me his eyes grew wide i didnt want to hurt you you should have stopped when you were supposed to burdick said but mitchell how could you risk it you love the law youd risk everything for this for revenge he smiled with a look as bleak as a hunting field in december but there was no risk donald dont you know me by now i knew id get away with it every nuance was planned every action and reaction every move anticipated and guarded against i planned this exactly the same way i plan my trials there was no way it wouldnt work he sighed and shook his head except for you of course taylor you were the flaw why didnt you just let it go i killed an evil man i did the firm hell i did the world a favor you used me donald burdick sat heavily in a chair his head dipping oh mitchell all you had to do was go to the police clayton wouldve been arrested for the girls death the young lawyer gave a harsh laugh you think so and what wouldve happened donald nothing any halfassed criminal lawyer couldve gotten him off there was no witness no physical evidence besides you of all people ought to know how many favors clayton couldve called in the case wouldntve even gotten to the grand jury his attention dipped for a moment to the gun he flipped it open expertly and saw six cartridges in the cylinder then from his pocket he took the note that taylor lockwood had written to him the note about going to confront a killer he folded it into a tight square stepped forward and stuffed it into her breast pocket she whispered nodding at it i wrote my own suicide note didnt i i kill donald and then myself oh my god its your fault he muttered you shouldve just moved on taylor you shouldve let clayton stay in hell and let the rest of us get on with our business my fault she leaned forward what the hell happened to you has it all caught up finally pushing pushing pushing years and years of it win the case win the goddamn case thats all you see all you care about you dont know what justice is anymore youve turned it inside out dont lecture me he said wearily dont talk to me about things you cant understand i live with the law ive made it a part of me burdick said theres no way you can justify it mitchell you killed a man reece rubbed his eyes after a moment he said you get asked a lot why you go to law school did you go because you wanted to help society to make money to further justice thats what people always want to know justice theres so little of it in the world so little justice in our lives maybe on the whole it balances out maybe god looks down from someplace and says yeah pretty good ill let it go at that but you know the law as well as i do both of you innocent people serve time and guilty ones get off wendall clayton killed linda davidoff and he was going to go free i wasnt going to let that happen taylor said the suicide note claytons men of most renowned virtue how does it go reece said have sometimes by transgressing most truly kept the law you meant it about you then not clayton reece nodded solemnly its about me mitchell burdick whispered just put the gun down well go to the police if you talk to them but reece walked slowly over to taylor he stood two feet away she didnt move no burdick shouted dont worry about the police we can forget what happened theres no need for this to go beyond this room theres no need reece glanced at the partner briefly but didnt speak his whole attention was on taylor he touched her hair then her cheek he nestled the muzzle of the gun against her breast i wish he cocked the gun i wish taylor wiped the thick tears but its me mitchell me think about what youre going to do please mitchell burdick said money do you want money a fresh start somewhere but it was taylor who raised her hand to silence the partner no hes come too far theres nothing more to say at last there were tears on reeces face the gun wavered and rose for a moment it seemed to be levitating maybe he intended to touch the chill muzzle to his own temple and pull the trigger but his deeper will won and he lowered the black weapon to her once more alice in this dreadful world on the other side of the looking glass remained completely still there was no place to go all she could do was close her eyes which is what she now did mitchell reece practical as ever held his left hand to his face to protect himself from the blast and her spattered blood and then he pulled the trigger chapter forty in the hushed conference room the metallic click was as loud as the gunshot would have been reeces eyes flickered for a moment he pulled the trigger three more times three more clicks echoed throughout the room his hand lowered fake he whispered with the tone of someone observing an impossible occurrence its fake taylor wiped the streaming tears from her face oh mitchell burdick stepped forward and firmly lifted the gun away from him taylor said the guns real mitchell but the bulletsre just props she shook her head all i had was speculation i needed proof that you did it reece leaned against the wall oh my god he was staring at taylor how he whispered shed never seen such shock in anyones eyes pure uncomprehending astonishment a lot of clues i finally put together today she said what got me wondering was the poem lindas poem poem the one that wendall left as her suicide note i read it in the hospital and you know everybody thought it was a suicide note but nobody really understood what it was about it was a love poem it wasnt about killing herself it was about leaving solitude and loneliness and starting a new life with somebody she loved anybody who was going to kill herself wouldnt leave that as a suicide note danny stuart her roommate said she wrote it just a few days before she died he was shaking his head impossible you couldnt make that kind of deduction not from the suicide note back to me no of course not its just what put the idea in my head that maybe she didnt kill herself but then i started to think about everything thatd happened since youd asked me to help you find the note everything id learned i thought about you nudging me away from the other suspects and toward clayton i thought about what kind of strategist you were about claytons womanizing about how it would be easy for you to get a gun from one of your clients in the criminal pro bono program your trips to lindas grave i had my privateeye friend check out your mother yes she was a paranoid schizophrenic but she died four years ago oh mitchell you looked me right in the eye and lied i felt like crying when you told me about your mother still he held her eye not a flicker of remorse in his then she continued i called the boston us attorneys office your friend sam hasnt worked for them for four years you faked that call to him from the street in front of your loft didnt you her anger broke through youre a pretty fucking good actor mitchell then calming she continued hard evidence you yourself helped me there that first day i met you when you mentioned that the records in law firms reveal all kinds of information about where peopleve been and how they spend their time i went through the time sheets going back a year and figured out exactly what happened its all right there you and linda working together taking time off together logging travel time to clients on the same date joint meal vouchers then lindas time drops and she takes sick leave and files insurance claims because shes pregnant and not long after that she dies then i found the genneco security system contract negotiation files and yeah it was checked out to donald but if hed used them to get access to the botulism he sure as hell wouldnt use his own name then i asked mrs bendix to find any other files donald had supposedly checked out recently there was one an insurance claim where a car went off the road and looked like it was going to sink in the reservoir in westchester but ended up on a ledge of rock that kept it from sinking in exactly the same place we drove into the reservoir that night you needed to make it look like clayton was desperate enough to kill us so hed be desperate enough to kill himself right am i right reluctantly he nodded oh sure a lot of people had motives to kill clayton thom sebastian and dudley and sean lillick and donald here even donalds wife and probably a dozen other people but i decided you were wrong when you told me that motive is the most important thing in finding a killer no the most important thing is finding the person who has the will to murder remember your herald mitchell preparation and will well of all the people in this firm you were the only one i believed could actually murder someone the way you destroyed that doctor on crossexamination you had a killers heart i could see that but even then i wasnt absolutely sure so i called donald earlier tonight and we arranged this little play of our own to find out for sure you dont understand reece whispered desperately clayton was pure evil there was no way to bring him to justice otherwise he taylors hand flew up toward him palm out justice she raged justice she sighed and lowered her head speaking into the microphone hidden under her collar john could you come in please the door opened and john silbert hemming entered reece stared up at the huge man as he gripped reeces arm tightly and stepped protectively between the lawyer and taylor the man said to her softly you could have stopped earlier before he tried to use that nodding at the gun we had enough on tape for a conviction she was looking into reeces evasive eyes as she said in a whisper i had to know the handcuffs went on quickly with a crisp ratchety sound you cant do this reece muttered bitterly you have no legal authority its illegal detention and kidnapping and that fucking tape is illegal youll be subject shhhh john silbert hemming said to civil liability and criminal charges which ill pursue on the federal and state levels you dont know the kind of trouble shhhh the big man repeated looking down at reece ominously the lawyer fell silent seeing reece standing in front of her oddly defiant even angry at what theyd done to him she wondered if she was going to scream or slap him or even reach for his throat with her hands which seemed to have the strength more than enough to strangle him to death reece said taylor i can make you understand if youll just i dont want to hear anything more but she was speaking only to john silbert hemming who nodded solemnly and escorted the lawyer out into the firms lobby to await the police she spent an hour giving several lengthy statements to two humorless detectives from police plaza she refused a ride home from gallant john silbert hemming but promised that shed call him about their opera date a word that she pointedly used looking forward to it he said ducking his head to step into the elevator car taylor walked slowly back to her cubicle she was almost there when she heard the sound of a photocopier and noticed sean lillick copying sheets of music on the xerox machine near the paralegal pen he looked up and blurted taylor youre out of the hospital we heard you were totally sick back from the dead she said glancing at the music the copying of which he was probably charging to a client youre all right if you only knew ill live he nodded toward the manuscript paper take a look my latest opus its about wendall clayton i found all of these pictures and papers and things in his office the other day and im writing this opera about him im going to project pictures on the screen and get some shakespearean text and she leaned close and shut him up with an exasperated look sean can i give you some advice he looked at the music oh thesere just the rough lead sheets im going to arrange them later i dont mean that she whispered ominously listen up if donald burdick doesnt know you were claytons spy yet he will in about a day or two he gazed at her uneasily whatre you talking about im talking about this pack up your stuff and get out of here id recommend leaving town who the hellre you to you think clayton was vindictive you aint seen nothing yet donaldll sue your ass for every penny of the money clayton paid you to be his weasel fuck you what money that youve got hidden under your stinky mattress he blinked in shock he started to ask how she knew this but he gave up i was just and one more thing leave carrie mason alone shes too good for you the kid tried to look angry but mostly he was scared he grabbed his papers and scurned off down the corridor taylor returned to her cubicle shed just sat down and begun to check phone messages when she heard someone coming up behind her she spun around fast alarmed thom sebastian stood in the doorway hands stuffed in his pockets hey he said only me mr party animal didnt mean to spook you thom i was megafreaked when i heard you were sick they wouldnt let me in to see you did you get my flowers i might have i was pretty out of it i couldnt read half the cards well i was worried im glad youre okay you lost weight she nodded and said nothing a dense awkward moment his voice quavered as he said so so he said anyway i just wanted to let you know looks like im leaving the firm he nodded what i was telling you about that new firm im starting with bosk its going to happen tomorrows my last day here ive got ten associates from hubbard white coming with me and a bunch of clients too weve already got fifteen retainer agreements st agnes mcmillan new amsterdam rfc a bunch of others taylor laughed youre kidding these were hubbard whites biggest clients they represented close to one third of the firms revenues thom said were going to do the same work hubbard white did but charge them about half they were ready to leave anyway most of the presidents and ceos i talked to said everybody here was paying too much attention to the merger and firm politics and not enough to the legal work they said the other associates and i were the only ones who gave a shit about them thats probably true the funny thing is if id made partner id be under a non competition agreement so i couldntve taken any clients with me but since im just an associate the firm cant stop me congratulations thom she started to turn back to her desk but he stepped forward nervously and touched her arm the thing is taylor he swallowed uneasily the thing is i have to say something he looked around his eyes dark and troubled ive spent a lot of time he swallowed ive spent a lot of time thinking about you and checking you out what you found in my office my notes about you i shouldntve done that i know but i just couldnt get you out of my head taylor stood up glanced at her arm he removed his hand from it and stepped back whatre you saying she asked im saying i learned some things about you thatre a problem for me she looked at him steadily yes ive learned that youre the sort of person i dont think ill ever meet again who i think i could spend the rest of my life with he looked away i guess im saying that i think i love you she was too surprised even to laugh he held up a pudgy hand i know you think im goofy and crude but i dont have to be that way i cant be that way at my new firm im giving up the drugs thats what i was meeting with magaly about the night she was killed the night you got me out of jail i wasnt going to score anything i was going to tell her i wasnt going to buy from her anymore i was doing that for you then that night at the blue devil i was going to ask if you maybe wanted to go out with me kind of i guess steady he shook his head at the oldfashioned word i had it all planned out what i was going to say but then magaly got shot and you had to bail me out the whole night went to hell and i couldnt even look you in face let alone tell you how i felt about you she began to speak but he took a deep breath no no no dont say anything yet please taylor just think about what i said will you do that ill have the firm ill have money i can give you whatever you want if you want to go to law school fine you want to play music fine you want to have a dozen babies fine thom please he begged dont say yes and dont say no just think about it he took a deep breath and seemed on the verge of tears jesus im the worlds greatest fucking negotiator and here i am breaking all my rules look everythings in there he handed her a large white envelope what is it she asked i did kind of a deal memo now she couldnt help but laugh deal memo he grinned for us about how we might work things out dont panic we dont get to marriage until phase four phase four well take it nice and easy please just read it and let the idea sit for a while ill read it she said then unable to resist he threw his arms around her and hugged her hard he retreated before she could say anything more dont get too interested in her sebastians comment to bosk it was a warning from a jealous lover not a potential killer taylor lowered her face to her hands and laughed softly thinking i guess its safe to say what a night her desk was a mess vera burdicks ransacking hadnt left it in very good shape when shed called burdick about reece earlier in the evening shed asked him bluntly why his wife was searching through her things vera doesnt trust anybody burdick had said laughing samuel lockwoods daughter she thought for sure you were working with clayton helping him push the merger through or after he died sabotaging me you should consider it a compliment the way a fly should feel complimented that hes a spiders first choice for dinner taylor noticed a blinking red light on her phone she lifted the receiver and pressed the play button hey counselor hello dad listen hope youre feeling better cause ive made some plans for us tomorrow i get into la guardia in the morning how bout you come pick me up ive made lunch reservations at the four seasons theres somebody from skadden i want you to meet a senior partner he said theyre looking for people like my little overachiever now get a pen my plane gets in at click taylor lockwood hit a button a womans electronic voice reported your message has been deleted she hung up the receiver taylor pulled on her raincoat and walked through the halflit corridors the slavic cleaning women in their blue uniforms moved from office to office with their wheeled carts taylor could hear the whine of vacuums coming from different directions she imagined she could smell sour gunpowder as if reece had in fact fired real bullets from the heavy pistol but she realized as she passed a conference room littered with a thousand papers that the smell was only the residue of cigar smoke earlier in the evening a deal had perhaps closed here or maybe itd fallen apart or maybe negotiations had been postponed till tomorrow or the next day in any case the participants had abandoned the room for the time being leaving behind only the pungent aroma of tobacco as the evidence of that success or failure or uncertainty the police had gone burdick had gone the partner would need some rest hed have plenty to do in the morning more favors would have to be called in taylor suspected though that donald burdick and his wife would have a sizable inventory remaining she continued through the firm pressed a door latch button and stepped into the lobby the door swung closed behind her and when the elevator arrived she stepped in wearily outside wall street was nearly as quiet as the halls of hubbard white willis this neighborhood was a daytime place it worked hard and curled up to sleep early most of the offices were dark the bartenders had stopped pouring drinks cabs and cars were few occasionally someone in a somber overcoat would appear from a revolving door then vanish into a limo or cab or down a subway stairwell where she wondered were they going to one of sebastians clubs to pursue some private lust like ralph dudley to plot a coup like wendall clayton or maybe just to retreat to their apartments or houses for a few hours sleep before the grind began again tomorrow what a place this was the topsyturvy land at the bottom of the rabbit hole but taylor considered was this her land alice s trips to wonderland and the lookingglass world had after all been dreams and the girl had eventually wakened from them she couldnt for the moment say taylor flagged down a cab got in and gave the driver the address of her apartment building as the dirty vehicle squealed away from the curb she slouched down in the seat staring at the greasy plexiglas divider thank you for not smoking cent surcharge after pm the cab was a block away from her apartment when she leaned forward and told the driver shed changed her mind taylor lockwood sat in the spotlight dimitri twisted his curly hair and leaned over the microphone his habitual suspicion left when she told him ill play for free you keep the receipts all of them but the tipsre mine and dimitri no satin touch not tonight okay ladies and gentlemen she whispered ominously dimitri it is my pleasure to present miss taylor lockwood at the piano he hit the switch controlling the faux spotlight she smiled at the crowd and touched the keys cold and smooth as glass enjoying their yielding resilience as she began to play after half an hour taylor looked out into the cockeyed lights brilliant starbursts beaming at her so bright she couldnt seethe patrons maybe the wobbly tables were completely occupied or maybe the place was empty in any event if anyone was in the audience they were listening in absolute silence she smiled not to them but only for herself and swayed slowly as she played a medley of gershwin that she herself had arranged all revolving around rhapsody in blue tonight she improvised frequently playing jazzy harmonies and clever riffs allowing the music to carry itself the notes soaring and regrouping then flying to risky altitudes but taylor lockwood never let go completely and was careful to alight at regular intervals on the theme she knew how much people love the melody jeffery deaver
