peter robinson cold is the grave book in the inspector banks series for sheila the wind it doth blow hard and the cold rain down doth rain and cold cold is the grave wherein my love is lain traditional folk ballad mummy mummy come here rosalind carried on stuffing the wild mushroom olive oil garlic and parsley mixture between the skin and the flesh of the chicken the way she had learned in her recent course on the art of french cuisine mummy cant come right now she shouted back shes busy but mummy youve got to come its our lass where on earth did he learn such common language rosalind wondered every term they forked out a fortune in fees to send him to the best school yorkshire had to offer and still he ended up sounding like some vulgar tyke perhaps if they lived down south again the situation would improve benjamin she called back i told you mummys busy daddy has an important dinner tonight and mummy has to prepare rosalind didnt mind cooking in fact she had taken several courses and quite enjoyed them but just for a moment as she spoke she wished she had been able to say that cook was preparing the meal and that she was busy deciding what to wear but they had no cook only a cleaning lady who came in once a week it wasnt that they couldnt afford it but simply that her husband drew the line at such extravagance honestly rosalind sometimes thought anyone would imagine he was a born yorkshireman himself instead of just living here but it is her benjamin persisted its our lass shes got no clothes on rosalind frowned and put aside her knife what on earth could he be talking about benjamin was only eight and she knew from experience that he had a very active imagination she even worried that it might hold him back in life overimaginative types she had found tend toward idleness and daydreaming they dont get on with more profitable activities mummy hurry up rosalind felt just the slightest tingle of apprehension as if something were about to change forever in her universe shaking off the feeling she wiped her hands of the oily stuffing took a quick sip of gin and tonic then walked toward the study where benjamin had been playing on the computer as she did so she heard the front door open and her husband call out that he was home early she frowned was he checking up on her ignoring him for the moment she went to see what on earth benjamin was talking about look the boy said as she walked into the room it is our lass he pointed at the computer screen dont talk like that rosalind said ive told you before its common then she looked at first she was simply shocked to see the screen filled with the image of a naked woman how had benjamin stumbled onto such a site he wasnt even old enough to understand what he had found then as she leaned over his shoulder and peered more closely at the screen she gasped he was right she was looking at a picture of her daughter emily naked as the day she was born but with considerably more curves a tattoo and a wispy patch of blond pubic hair between her legs that it was her emily there was no mistake the teardropshaped birthmark on the inside of her left thigh proved it rosalind ran her hand through her hair what was this all about what was happening she glanced briefly at the url on top of the screen she had a photographic memory so she knew she wouldnt forget it see said benjamin it is our lass isnt it whats she doing without any clothes on mummy then rosalind panicked my god he mustnt see this emilys father he mustnt be allowed to see it it would destroy him quickly she reached toward the mouse but before her fingers could click on it a deep voice behind her told her it was too late what on earths going on he asked mildly putting a fatherly hand on his sons shoulder then after the briefest of silences rosalind heard the sharp intake of breath and knew that he had the answer his hand tightened and benjamin flinched daddy youre hurting me but chief constable jeremiah riddle was oblivious to his sons pain my god he gasped pointing at the screen is that who i think it is detective chief inspector alan banks paused over his holdall wondering whether he should take the leather jacket or the windcheater there wasnt room for both he wasnt sure how cold it would be probably no different from yorkshire he guessed at most perhaps a couple of degrees warmer still you never could tell with november in the end he decided he could take both he folded the windcheater and put it on top of the shirts he had already packed then he pressed down hard on the contents before dragging the reluctant zip shut it seemed a lot for just one weekend away from home but it all fitted into one nottooheavy bag he would wear his leather jacket on the journey all he had to do now was choose a book and a few tapes he probably wouldnt need them but he didnt like to travel anywhere without something to read and something to listen to in case of delays or emergencies it was a lesson he had learned the hard way having once spent four hours in the casualty department of a large london hospital on a saturday night waiting to have six stitches sewn beside his right eye all that time he had held the gauze pad to stanch the bleeding and watched the endless supply of drug overdoses attempted suicides heartattack victims and road accidents going in before him that their wounds were far more serious and merited more urgent treatment than his minor cut banks never had a moments doubt but he wished to hell there had been something to read in the dingy waiting area other than a copy of the previous days daily mirror the person who had read it before him had even filled in the crossword in ink but tomorrow he was going to paris with his daughter tracy for a long weekend of art galleries museums and walks of sumptuous dinners in small left bank restaurants and idle beers at zinctopped counters in montmartre looking out on the crowds passing by they were going to take the eurostar which banks had managed to book practically for free through a special newspaper offer after all it was november and most people preferred lanzarote to a wet weekend in paris he probably wouldnt need much in the way of music or books except when he was alone in his room before bed but he decided to err on the side of caution banks carried the holdall downstairs and dug out a couple of extra batteries from the sideboard drawer he slipped them in the side pouch along with the walkman itself then picked out tapes he had made of his cassandra wilson dawn upshaw and lucinda williams cds three more different womens voices and styles you probably couldnt find anywhere on earth but he liked them all and between them they covered a wide range of moods he cast an eye over the low bookshelf and picked out simenons maigret and the hundred gibbets he didnt usually read crime novels but the title had caught his eye and someone had once told him that he had a lot in common with maigret besides he assumed that it was set in paris when banks had finished packing he poured himself a couple of fingers of laphroaig and put on bill evanss waltz for debby cd then he sat in his armchair beside the shaded reading lamp balanced the whiskey on the arm and put his feet up as my foolish heart made its hesitant progress a few lumps of peat burned in the fireplace its smell harmonizing with the smoky bite of the islay malt on his tongue but too much smoke seemed to be drifting from the fireplace into the room banks wondered if he needed a chimney sweep as a fire probably hadnt been lit in that grate for a long time he had no idea how to find a sweep nor did he even know if such an exotic creature still existed he remembered being fascinated as a child when the chimney sweep came and his mother covered everything in the room with old sheets banks was allowed to watch the strange sootfaced man fit the extensions on his long thick brush as he pushed it up the tall chimney but he had to leave the room before the real work began later when he read about the victorian practice of sending young boys naked up the chimneys he always wondered about that chimney sweep if he had ever done anything like that in the end he realized the man couldnt have been old enough to have been alive so long ago no matter how ancient he had seemed to the awestruck young boy he decided that the chimney was fine and it was probably just the wind blowing some smoke back down he could hear it howling around the thick walls rattling the loose window in the spare bedroom upstairs spattering the panes with rain since there had been so much rain lately banks could also hear the rushing of gratly falls outside his cottage they were nothing grand only a series of shallow terraces none more than four or five feet high that ran diagonally through the village where the beck ran down the daleside to join the river swain in helmthorpe but the music changed constantly and proved a great delight to banks especially when he was lying in bed having trouble getting to sleep glad he didnt have to go out again that evening banks sat and sipped his single malt listening to the familiar lyrical opening of waltz for debby his mind drifted to the problem that had been looming larger and larger ever since his last case which had been a oneoff job designed to make him fail and look like a fool he hadnt failed and consequently chief constable riddle who had hated banks from the start was even more pissed off at him than ever now banks found himself back in the career doldrums chained to his desk and with no prospect of action in the foreseeable future it was getting to be a bore and he could see only one way out loath as banks was to leave yorkshire especially after so recently buying the cottage he was fast coming to admit that his days there seemed numbered last week after thinking long and hard he had put in his application to the national crime squad which had been designed to target organized crime as a dci banks would hardly be involved in undercover work but he would be in a position to run operations and enjoy the adrenaline high when a big catch finally landed the job would also involve travel tracking british criminals who operated from headquarters in holland the dordogne and spain banks knew he didnt have a good enough educational background for the job lacking a degree but he did have the experience and he thought that might still count for something despite riddle he knew he could do the hard sums the language number and management tests necessary for the job and he thought he could count on excellent references from everyone else he had worked with in yorkshire including his immediate commanding officer detective superintendent gristhorpe and the director of human resources millicent cummings he only hoped that the negative report he was bound to get from riddle would seem suspicious by its difference there was another reason for the change too banks had thought a lot about his estranged wife sandra over the past couple of months and he had come to believe that their separation might be only temporary a major change in his circumstances such as a posting to the ncs would certainly be of benefit it would mean moving somewhere else maybe back to london and sandra loved london he felt there was a real chance to put things right now put the silliness of the past year behind them banks had had his brief romance with annie cabbot and sandra hers with sean that sandra was still living with sean didnt weigh unduly on his mind people often drifted along in relationships lacking the courage or the initiative to go it alone he was certain that she would come to see things differently when he presented her with his plan for the future when the telephone rang at nine oclock startling him out of bill evanss deft keyboard meanderings he thought at first that it might be tracy he hoped she hadnt changed her mind about the weekend he needed to talk to her about the future to enlist her help in getting sandra back it wasnt tracy it was chief constable jeremiah jimmy riddle the very reason banks had gone so far as to contemplate selling his cottage and leaving the county banks banks gritted his teeth sir riddle paused id like to ask you a favor bankss jaw dropped a favor yes do you think i mean would you mind dropping by the house its very important i wouldnt ask otherwise not on such a wretched night as this bankss mind reeled riddle had never spoken to him in such a polite manner before with such a fragile edge to his voice what on earth was going on another trick its late sir banks said im tired and im supposed to be look im asking you for a favor man my wife and i have had to cancel a very important dinner party at the last minute because of this cant you just for once put aside your bloodymindedness and oblige me that sounded more like the jimmy riddle of old banks was on the verge of telling him to fuck off when the ccs tone changed once again and threw him off balance please banks riddle said theres something i need to talk to you about something urgent dont worry this isnt a trick im not out to put one over on you i give you my word i honestly need your help surely even riddle wouldnt stoop to pulling a stunt like this solely to humiliate him now banks was curious and he knew he would go if he were the kind of man who could ignore a call so full of mystery he had no business being a copper in the first place he didnt want to go out into the foul night didnt want to leave his laphroaig bill evans and the crackling peat fire but he knew he had to he put his glass aside glad that he had drunk only the one small whiskey all day all right he said reaching for the pencil and paper beside the telephone but youd better tell me where you live and give me directions i dont believe ive ever been invited to your home before riddle lived about halfway between eastvale and northallerton which meant an hours drive for banks in good weather but well over that tonight the rain was coming down in buckets his windscreen wipers worked overtime the whole way and there were times when he could hardly see more than a few yards ahead it was only two days before bonfire night and the piles of wood and discarded furniture were getting soaked on the village greens the riddle house was a listed building called the old mill because it had been built originally as a mill by cistercian monks from the nearby abbey made of limestone with a flagstone roof it stood beside the millrace which came rushing down through the garden the old stone barn on the other side of the house had been converted into a garage as banks drove up the short gravel drive and pulled up he noticed that there were lights showing in two of the downstairs windows while the rest of the place was in darkness almost before he could knock the door jerked open and he found himself ushered inside a dim hallway where riddle took his coat without ceremony and led him through to a living room bigger than bankss entire cottage it was all exposed beams and whitewashed walls decked with polished hunting horns and the inevitable horse brasses a giltframed mirror hung above the adam fireplace where a fire roared and a baby grand piano stood by the mullioned bay window it was very much the kind of house banks would associate with someone pulling in a hundred grand a year or more but for all its rusticity and for all the heat the fire threw out it was a curiously cold bleak and impersonal kind of room there were no magazines or newspapers scattered on the low glasstopped table and no messy piles of sheet music by the piano the woodwork gleamed as if it had been waxed just moments ago and everything was neat clean and orderly which come to think of it was exactly what banks would have expected from riddle this effect was heightened by the silence broken only by the occasional howling of the wind outside and the rain spattering against the windows a woman walked into the room my wife rosalind said riddle banks shook rosalinds hand it was soft but her grip was firm if this was shaping up to be a night of surprises rosalind riddle was the second banks had never met the chief constables wife before all he knew about her was that she worked with a firm of eastvale solicitors specializing in property conveyancing and if he had ever given a passing thought to her he might have imagined a stout sturdy and rather characterless figure why he didnt know but that was the image that came to mind the woman who stood before him however was elegant and tall with a models slim figure and long shapely legs she was casually dressed in a gray skirt and a white silk blouse and the two buttons open at the top revealed a v of skin as pale as her complexion she had short blond hair the expensive shaggy kind of short and the highlit sort of blond a high forehead prominent cheekbones and dark blue eyes her lips were fuller than one would expect in the kind of face she had and the lipstick made them seem even more so giving the impression of a pout her expression revealed nothing but banks could tell from her brusque body language that she was distraught she set her drink on the table and sat on the velvetupholstered sofa crossing her legs and leaning forward one hand clasping the other in her lap she reminded banks of the kind of elegant remote blondes that alfred hitchcock had cast in so many of his films riddle asked banks to sit down he was still in uniform a tall man running to bulk but still fit he sat opposite in an armchair pulling at the sharp crease of his trouser leg and leaned back he was bald and dark beetle brows arched over his hard serious brown eyes banks got the feeling that neither of them quite knew what to say now that he was there you could cut the tension with a knife something bad had happened something delicate and painful banks needed a cigarette badly but there was no way he knew riddle hated smoke and the room had a sort of sweet lavender smell that he could tell had never been sullied by cigarettes the silence stretched on he was beginning to feel like philip marlowe at the beginning of a case maybe he should tell them his rates and break the ice he thought but before he could say anything flippant riddle spoke banks i er i know weve had our differences in the past and im sure this request will come as much of a surprise to you as it comes to me to be making it but i need your help differences in the past there was an understatement if ever there was one go on he said im listening riddle shifted in his chair and plucked at his creases his wife reached forward and picked up her drink the ring of moisture it left on the glass surface was the only thing that marred the rooms sterile perfection its a personal matter riddle went on very personal and unofficial before we go any further banks i want your absolute assurance that what i have to say wont be repeated outside these four walls can you give me that banks nodded im sorry rosalind said standing up you must think me a terrible hostess youve come all this way and i havent even offered you a drink will you have something mr banks a small whiskey perhaps the mans driving said riddle surely just the one banks held his hand up no thank you he said what he really wanted was a cup of tea but more than that he wanted to get this all over with and go home if he could do without a cigarette for a while he could do without a drink too he wished one of them would get to the point its about our daughter rosalind riddle began hands wriggling on her lap she left home when she was sixteen she ran away ros said riddle his voice tight with anger lets not fool ourselves about what happened how long ago was that banks asked riddle answered him six months im sorry to hear it said banks but im not sure what our son benjamin was playing on the computer earlier this evening rosalind chipped in by accident he stumbled across some pictures on one of those sex sites banks knew that inadvertently accessing a porno site was easily enough done look for spice girls on some of those search engines and you might end up at spicy girls some of the pictures rosalind went on well they were of emily our daughter benjamins only eight he doesnt really know what any of it means we put him to bed and told him not to say anything are you certain it was your daughter banks asked some of those photos can be doctored you know heads and bodies rearranged it was her rosalind answered believe me theres a distinctive birthmark im sure this is all very upsetting banks said and you have my sympathies but what do you want me to do i want you to find her riddle said why havent you tried yourself riddle looked at his wife the gaze that passed between them spoke volumes of discord and recrimination i have said riddle but i had nothing to go on i couldnt go through official channels i mean it wasnt even as if there was a crime she was perfectly within her legal rights and the fewer people who knew about what happened the better youre worried about your reputation riddles voice rose i know what you think banks but these things are important if only you realized that you might have made something better of yourself more important than your daughters wellbeing valuing reputation doesnt mean that either my husband or i care any the less about our daughter mr banks said rosalind as her mother i resent that implication then i apologize riddle spoke again look what im saying banks is that before tonight i didnt think i had any real cause to worry about her emilys an intelligent and resourceful girl if a bit too headstrong and rebellious but now i think i do have something tangible to be concerned about and this isnt all about ambition and reputation no matter what you think so why dont you try to find her yourself be realistic banks for a start i cant be seen going off on some sort of private chase and i can youre not in the public eye as much as i am people might recognize me i can cover for you up here if thats what youre worried about i am chief constable after all and ill also cover all reasonable expenses i dont expect you to be out of pocket over this but youll be on your own you cant use police resources or anything like that i want to keep this private a family matter you mean your careers important and mines expendable you might try looking at it in a slightly different light its not that theres nothing in it for you oh look at it this way if you succeed youll have earned my gratitude whatever you think of me im a man of honor a man of my word and i promise you that whatever happens your career in eastvale can only benefit if you do as i ask and the other reason riddle sighed im afraid that if she found out it was me looking for her then shed give me the slip she blames me for all her problems she made that clear in the months before she left i want you to go about this discreetly banks try to get to her before she knows anyones looking im not asking you to kidnap her or anything like that just find her talk to her make sure shes all right tell her wed be happy to see her again and talk things over and persuade her to stop posing on internet sex sites riddle paled if you can have you any idea where she went has she been in touch we had a postcard a couple of weeks after shed left rosalind answered she said she was doing fine and that we werent to worry about her or bother looking for her where was it postmarked london thats all apart from a card for benjamin on his birthday yes did she say anything else on the postcard just that she had a job rosalind went on so we wouldnt have to worry about her living on the streets or anything like that not that emily would live on the streets she was always a very highmaintenance girl ros well its true and you was there any specific reason she left banks cut in anything that sparked her leaving a row or something nothing specific riddle said it was cumulative she just didnt come home from school school rosalind answered a couple of years ago we sent her to a very expensive and highly reputable allgirls boarding school outside warwick at the end of last term the beginning of summer instead of returning home she ran off to london by herself as far as we know did she usually come home for the holidays yes what stopped her this time were you having any problems with her riddle picked up the thread again when she was last home for the spring holidays there were the usual arguments over staying out late drinking in pubs hanging around with the wrong crowd that sort of thing but nothing out of the ordinary shes a very bright girl she was doing well at school academically but it bored her it all seemed too easy especially languages she has a way with words of course we wanted her to stay on and do her alevels go to university but she didnt want to she wanted to get out on her own we gave her everything banks she had her own horse piano lessons trips to america with the school skiing holidays in austria a good education we were very proud of emily we gave her everything she ever wanted except perhaps what she needed most thought banks you to reach the dizzying heights of chief constable especially by the age of fortyfive as riddle had done you needed to be driven ruthless and ambitious you also needed to be able to move around a lot which can have a devastating effect on young children who sometimes find it hard to make friends add to that the hours spent on the job and on special courses and riddle had probably hardly set foot in the family home from one day to the next banks was hardly one to take the moral high ground in raising children he had to admit to himself even to reach the rank of dci he had been an absent father far more often than was good for brian and tracy as it happened both of them had turned out fine on the whole but he knew that was more a matter of good luck than good parenting on his part much of the task had fallen to sandra and she hadnt always burdened him with the childrens problems perhaps banks hadnt sacrificed his family to ambition the way he suspected riddle had but he had certainly sacrificed a lot for the sake of being a good detective are there any friends from around here she might have confided in he asked anyone who might have stayed in touch with her rosalind shook her head i dont think so she said emily is very selfsufficient she had plenty of friends but none that close i dont think it came of moving around a lot when she moves on she burns her bridges and she hadnt actually spent much time in this area you mentioned the wrong crowd was there a boyfriend nobody serious his name could still be a help rosalind glanced at her husband who said banks ive told you i dont want this to be official if you start looking up emilys old boyfriends and asking questions around these parts how long do you think the affairs going to remain under wraps i told you shes run off to london thats where youll find her banks sighed it looked as if this was going to be an investigation carried out with his hands tied does she know anyone in london then he asked anyone she might go to for help riddle shook his head its been years since i was on the met she was only a little girl when we left i know this might be difficult for you banks said but do you think i might have a look at this web site ros rosalind riddle scowled at her husband and said follow me banks followed her under a beam so low that he had to duck into a booklined study a tangerine imac sat on a desk by the window wind rattled the glass beyond the heavy curtains and every once in a while it sounded as if someone sloshed a bucket of water over the windows rosalind sat down and flexed her fingers but before she hit any keys or clicked the mouse she turned in her chair and looked up at banks he couldnt read the expression on her face you dont approve of us do you she said us our kind people who have oh wealth success ambition i cant say i pay you much mind really ah but you do thats just where youre wrong her eyes narrowed youre envious youve got a chip on your shoulder the size of that sideboard over there you think youre better than us purer somehow dont you mrs riddle said banks with a sigh i dont need this kind of crap ive driven all the way out here on a miserable night when id far rather be at home listening to music and reading a good book so if were going to do this lets just get on with it shall we or shall i just go home and go to bed she studied him coolly hit a nerve did i mrs riddle what do you want from me hes thinking of going into politics you know so ive heard any hint of a family scandal would ruin everything weve worked so hard for all these years i imagine it probably would its best to get into office first then have the scandal thats cynical but true read the papers he says you have a tendency to make waves i like to get at the truth of things sometimes that means rocking a few boats the more expensive the boat the more noise it seems to make when it rocks rosalind smiled i wish we could all afford to be so highminded this job will require the utmost discretion ill bear that in mind if i decide to take it on banks held her stare until she blinked and swiveled her chair back to face the screen i just thought wed get that clear before you get to look at nude pictures of my daughter she said without looking at him he watched over her shoulder as she started to work at the keyboard and mouse finally a black screen with a series of thumbnail photographs appeared rosalind clicked on one of them and another screen with about five more thumbnail images began to load at the top of the screen the script announced that the models name was louisa gamine and that she was an eighteenyearold biology student looking at the pictures banks could believe it why louisa gamine he asked ive no idea louisas her middle name louise actually emily louise riddle i suppose she thinks louisa sounds more exotic maybe when she left she decided she needed a new identity banks understood that when he was younger he had always regretted that his parents hadnt given him a middle name so much so that he made one up for himself davy after davy crockett one of his heroes at the time that lasted a couple of months then he finally accepted his own name alan rosalind clicked on one of the images and it began to fill the screen loading from top to bottom banks was looking at an amateur photograph taken in a bedroom with poor lighting which showed a pretty young girl sitting naked and crosslegged on a pale blue duvet the smile on her face looked a little forced and her eyes didnt seem quite focused the resemblance between louisa and her mother was astonishing they both had the same longlegged grace the same pale almost translucent complexion the same generous mouth the only real difference apart from their ages was that louisas blond hair hung over her shoulders otherwise banks felt he could easily have been looking at a photograph of rosalind taken maybe twentyfive years ago and that embarrassed him he noticed a discoloration the shape of a teardrop on the inside of louisas left thigh the birthmark she also had a small ring of some sort in her navel and below it what looked like a black tattoo of a spider banks thought of annie cabbots rose tattoo above her left breast how long ago it was since he had last seen it and how he would probably never see it again especially if he managed to reconcile with sandra the other photos were much the same all taken in the same location with the same poor lighting only the poses were different her new surname was certainly apt banks thought as there was definitely something of the gamine about her a young girl with mischievous charm there was something else that nagged him about the surname she had chosen too but he couldnt think what it was at the moment if he put it to the back of his mind it would probably come eventually those things usually did banks examined the pictures more closely aware of rosalinds subtle perfume as he leaned over her shoulder he could make out a few details of the room the corner of a popstar poster a row of books but they were all too blurred to be of any use seen enough asked rosalind tilting her head toward him and hinting that perhaps he was lingering too long enjoying himself too much she looks as if she knows what shes doing said banks rosalind paused then said emilys been sexually active since she was fourteen at least as far as we know she was thirteen when she started becoming wayward so it might have been earlier thats partly why we sent her away to school in the first place thats not unusual said banks thinking with alarm of tracy he was sure she hadnt been active quite that young but it was hardly something he could ask her about he didnt even know whether she was active now come to think of it and he didnt think he wanted to know tracy was nineteen so she had a few years on emily but she was still bankss little girl do you think the school helped he asked obviously not she didnt come back did she have you spoken with the principal or with any of her classmates no jerrys too worried about indiscretion of course print that one banks pointed to a photograph where louisa sat on the edge of the bed staring expressionlessly into the camera wearing a red tshirt and nothing else head and shoulders will do we can trim off the bottom part rosalind looked over her shoulder at him and he thought he could sense a little gratitude in her expression at least she didnt seem so openly hostile as she had been earlier youll do it she asked youll try to find emily ill try you dont need to make her come home she wont want to come i can guarantee you that you dont sound as if you want her to rosalind frowned then said perhaps youre right i did suggest to jerry that we simply let her go her own way shes old enough and certainly shes smart enough to take care of herself and shes a troublemaker i know shes my daughter and i dont mean to sound uncaring but well you can see for yourself whats happened after only six months cant you that tattoo those pictures she never considers anyone elses feelings i can just imagine what chaos life would be like here if we had all her problems to deal with as well as well nothing it doesnt matter is there anything else you think i should know i dont know what you mean anything youre not telling me no why should there be but there was banks sensed by the way rosalind glanced away from him as she spoke there may have been family problems that neither she nor her husband wanted to discuss and maybe they were right not to perhaps he should hold his curiosity in check for once and not rip open cans of worms the way he usually did just find the girl he told himself make sure she isnt in any danger and leave the rest well alone lord knows the last thing he wanted to do was get caught up in the riddle family dysfunctions he scribbled down as much information as he could get from the web site which was run by an organization called glamourpuss ltd based in soho it shouldnt be too difficult to track them down he thought and they should be able to point him toward emily or louisa as she now preferred to be called he just hoped she wasnt on the game as so many teenagers who appeared on porno web sites were she didnt sound like the type who would turn to prostitution for gain but it sounded as if she might try anything for kicks he would have to cross that bridge when and if he got to it rosalind printed the photo took some scissors from the desk drawer and trimmed it from the navel ring down before she handed it to him banks followed her back into the living room where riddle sat staring into space all done he said banks nodded he didnt bother sitting tell me something he said why me you know damn well how things stand between us riddle seemed to flinch slightly and banks was surprised at the venom in his own voice then riddle paused and looked him in the eye two reasons he said first because youre the best detective in the county im not saying i approve of your methods or your attitude but you get results and in an unorthodox business like this well lets just say that some of your maverick qualities might actually be of real value for a change even being damned with faint praise by jimmy riddle was a new experience for banks and second he asked youve got a teenage daughter yourself havent you tracys her name am i right yes riddle spread his hands palms out then you know what im getting at i think you can imagine something of how i feel and to his surprise banks could i cant start till next week he said riddle leaned forward youve nothing pressing on right now i was planning a weekend away with tracy in paris please start now tomorrow in the morning i need to know there was a sense of desperation in riddles voice that banks had never heard from him before why so urgent riddle stared into the huge fireplace as if addressing his words to the flames im afraid for her banks shes so young and vulnerable i want her back at the very least i need to know how she is what shes doing imagine how youd feel if it happened to you imagine what youd do if it was your daughter in trouble damn it thought banks seeing his weekend in paris with tracy start to slip beyond his grasp daughters whod have them nothing but trouble but riddle had touched a nerve all right now there was no getting away from it no declining banks knew he had to head off to london to find emily louise riddle oh dad you cant mean it you woke me up in the middle of the night to tell me we cant go to paris after all im sorry love well just have to postpone it for a while i dont believe this ive been looking forward to this weekend for ages me too sweetheart what can i say and you wont even tell me why i cant i promised you promised me a weekend in paris it was easy enough to break that one touché i know im sorry dont you trust me to keep my mouth shut of course i do its not that what then i just cant tell you yet thats all maybe next week if things work out oh dont bother tracy fell into one of her sulky silences for a while the way her mother did then said its not dangerous is it of course not its a private matter im helping out a banks almost said friend but managed to stop himself in time im helping someone out someone in trouble believe me love if you knew the details youd see its the right thing to do look when its over ill make it up to you i promise heard that before been there got the tshirt give me a little leeway here tracy this isnt easy for me you know its not just you whos upset i was looking forward to paris too okay i know im sorry but what about the tickets the hotel the hotels easily canceled ill see if i can get the tickets changed youll be lucky she paused again wait a minute ive just had an idea what well i know you cant go but theres no reason i shouldnt go is there not that i know of except would you really want to be in paris all by yourself and its not safe especially for a young woman alone tracy laughed i can take care of myself dad im a big girl now yes banks thought all of nineteen im sure you can he said but id be worried youre always worried its what fathers do best for their daughters worry about them besides i wasnt necessarily thinking of going by myself what do you mean ill bet damon would like to go he doesnt have any lectures tomorrow either i could ask him wait a minute said banks damon who on earth is damon my boyfriend i bet hed jump at the chance of a weekend in paris with me ill bet he would banks thought with that sinking feeling this wasnt going at all the way he had expected it to he had expected recriminations yes anger yes but this im not so sure thats a good idea he said weakly of course it is you know it is wed save money too how well youll only have to cancel one of the hotel rooms for a start tracy she laughed oh dad parents are so silly you know if kids want to sleep together it doesnt have to be in a foreign city at night they can do it in the student residence in the daytime you know banks swallowed now he had an answer to a question he had avoided asking in for a penny in for a pound are you and damon i mean dont worry im a very careful girl now the only problem is getting the tickets to us before tomorrow morning i dont suppose youd like to drive over tonight would you no i wouldnt said banks then he weakened after all she was right there was no reason to spoil her weekend just because his own was spoiled damon notwithstanding but as a matter of fact i have to go down to london tomorrow anyway so i can go that far on the train with you and check damon out too while im at it he thought ill give you the tickets then thats great banks felt depressed tracy sounded far more thrilled at going off with damon than with him but she would she was young ill see you in the morning he said at the station same time as we arranged cool dad thanks a lot when he hung up the telephone banks fell back into his armchair and reached for his cigarettes he had to go to london of that there was no doubt in the first place he had promised and in the second there was something riddle didnt know tracy herself had almost run away from home once around her thirteenth birthday and the thought of what might have happened if she had gone through with it haunted him it had happened just before they left london for eastvale tracy had been upset for days about leaving her friends behind and one night when banks actually happened to be home he heard a noise downstairs going to investigate he found tracy at the door with a suitcase in her hand in the end he managed to persuade her to stay without forcing her but it had been touch and go one part of their bargain was that he had agreed not to tell her mother and he never had sandra had slept through the whole thing remembering that night he could imagine something of how the riddles must feel even so was this what he got for doing his enemy a favor he got to go hunting for a runaway teen while his own daughter got a dirty weekend in paris with her boyfriend where was the justice in that he asked all the answer he got was the howling of the wind and the relentless music of the water flowing over gratly falls on friday afternoon banks was walking along old compton street in the chilly november sunshine having traveled down to london with tracy and damon that morning after a grunted hi damon had hardly spoken a word the train was almost full and the three of them couldnt sit together which seemed a relief to tracy and damon banks had to sit half the carriage away next to a freshfaced young businessman wearing too much aftershave and playing freecell on his laptop computer most of the journey he spent listening to lucinda williamss car wheels on a gravel road and reading the big sleep which he had substituted for maigret and the hundred gibbets when he realized he wasnt going to paris he had seen the bogart film version a few weeks ago and enjoyed it so much it had made him want to read the book besides raymond chandler seemed more suitable reading for the kind of job he was doing banks pi shortly before kings cross his thoughts had returned to tracys boyfriend banks wasnt at all certain what to think of damon the grunt was no more than he would have expected from any of his daughters friends and he didnt read anything into it except perhaps that the lad was a bit embarrassed at coming facetoface with the father of the girl he was sleeping with even the thought of that made bankss chest tighten though he told himself not to get upset not to interfere the last thing he wanted to do was alienate his daughter especially as he was hoping to get back together with her mother it wouldnt do any good anyway tracy had her own life to lead now and she was no fool he hoped he had left the young lovers at kings cross and first gone to check in at the small bloomsbury hotel he had telephoned the previous evening called simply hotel fiftyfive after the street number it was the place he favored whenever he visited london quiet discreet welllocated and relatively inexpensive riddle might have said he would pay any expenses but banks wouldnt want to see the ccs face if he got a bill from the dorchester the mornings rain had dispersed during the journey and the day had turned out windy and cool under the kind of piercingly clear blue sky you only get in november maybe the bonfires would dry out in time for guy fawkes night after all banks thought as he zipped his leather jacket a bit higher he tapped his briefcase against his thigh to the rhythm of some hiphop music that drifted out of a sex shop banks had strong feelings and memories associated with soho ever since he used to walk the beat or drive the panda cars there out of vine street station after it had been reopened in the early seventies certainly the area had been cleaned up since then but soho could never be really clean cleanliness wasnt in its nature he loved the whiff of villainy he got whenever he walked old compton street or dean street where a fiddle had been simply a hairs breadth away from a legitimate business deal he remembered the cold dawns at berwick street market a cigarette and mug of hot sweet tea in his hands chatting with sam whose old brown collie fetchit used to sit under the stall all day and watch the world go by with sad eyes as the other stallholders set up their displays fruit crockery knives and forks knickers and socks watches egg slicers you name it sam used to give banks a running commentary on what was hot and what wasnt probably dead now along with fetchit theyd been old enough back then when banks was new to the job not that soho was ever without its dark side banks had found his first murder victim there in an alley off frith street a seventeenyearold prostitute who had been stabbed and mutilated her breasts cut off and several of her inner organs removed homage to jack the ripper as the newspaper headlines had screamed banks had been sick on the spot and he still had nightmares about the long minutes he spent alone with the disemboweled body just before dawn in a garbagestrewn soho alley as with all the dead in his life he had put a name to her dawn wadley being junior at the time banks was given the job of telling her parents he would never forget the choking smell of urine rotten meat and unwashed nappies in the cramped flat on the tenth floor of an east end tower block or dawns washedout junkie mother apparently unconcerned about the fate of the daughter she gave up on years ago to her dawns murder was just another in the endless succession of lifes cruel blows as if it had happened solely in order to do her down banks turned into wardour street soho had changed like the rest of the city the old bookshops and video booths were still around as was the raymond revue bar but cheap sex was definitely on the wane in its place came a younger crowd many of them gay who chatted on their mobiles while sipping cappuccinos at chic outdoor cafés young men with shaved heads and earrings flirted on street corners with cleancut boys from palmers green or sudbury hill gay bars had sprung up all over the place and the party never stopped banks checked the address for glamourpuss ltd he had got from the first place he tried the phone book sometimes things really are that easy from the outside it looked like any number of other businesses operating in soho the building was rundown paint flaking from the doors the lino on the creaky corridors cracked and worn but inside through the second set of doors it was all hightech glam and potted plants and he could still smell the fresh paint on the walls can i help you sir to bankss surprise there was a female receptionist sitting behind a chesthigh semicircle of black plexiglas written on it in florid pink script scattered with some sort of glitter at about waist height was the logo glamourpuss ltd erotica and more banks had the idea somehow that women rightthinking women anyway didnt want anything to do with the porn business that they wanted in fact to outlaw it if they could maybe this was a wrongthinking woman or was she the respectable face of porn if so it was about nineteen with short henna hair a ghostly complexion and a stud through its left nostril a little badge over her flat chest read tamara client interface officer bankss mind boggled can we interface tamara id like to see the person in charge he said do you have an appointment sir no what is the purpose of your visit she was starting to sound like an immigration official banks thought getting irritated in the old days he would probably have just tweaked her nosestud and walked right on in even these days he might do the same under normal circumstances but he had to remember he was acting privately he wasnt here officially as a policeman lets call it a business proposition he said i see please take a seat for a moment sir ill see if mr aitcheson is free she gestured to the orange plastic chairs behind him an array of magazines lay spread out on the coffee table in front of them banks lifted a couple up computer stuff mostly not a playboy or a penthouse in sight he looked up at tamara who had been carrying on a hushed conversation by telephone she smiled hell be with you in a moment sir did she think he was looking for a job or something as what banks was beginning to feel more as if he were in a dentists waiting room than a porn emporium and that thought didnt give him any comfort clearly things had changed a lot since he had walked the soho beat enough to make him feel like an old fogy when he was only in his midforties in the old days at least you knew where you were people like glamourpuss ltd as befit their name and business used to operate out of seedy offices in seedy basements they didnt run internet web sites they didnt have clientinterface officers and they certainly didnt come out from under their stones to meet strangers offering vague business propositions the way this young man was doing right now smiling hand outstretched wearing a suit no less aitcheson he said terry aitcheson and you are banks alan banks pleased to meet you mr banks follow me well go to the office far more private in there banks followed him past tamara who gave a little wave and a nose twitch that looked painful they crossed an openspace area filled with stateoftheart computer equipment and went into a small office which looked out over wardour street there was nothing either on the desk or the walls to indicate that glamourpuss ltd dealt in pornography aitcheson sat down and clasped his hands behind the back of his neck still smiling up close he looked older than banks had first guessed maybe late thirties balding with yellowing front teeth that were rather long and lupine a few specks of dandruff speckled the shoulders of his suit it was hardly fair banks thought that even when youre going bald you still get dandruff okay mr banks said aitcheson what can i do for you you mentioned a business proposition banks felt a little more at home now smarmy smile and suit aside he had dealt with pillocks like aitcheson before even if their offices werent as pretty and they didnt bother to offer up a smug facade of decency he took the truncated picture of emily riddle from his briefcase and put it on the desk turning it so that aitcheson could see the image the right way up id like you to tell me where i can find this girl he said aitcheson studied the photo his smile faltered a moment then returned full force as he pushed the photograph back toward banks im afraid we dont give out that sort of information about our models sir for their own protection you understand we get some well some rather strange people in this business as im sure you can understand so she is one of your models i was speaking generally sir even if she were i couldnt give you the information you want do you recognize her no what if i told you this came from a web site run by your company we operate several web sites sir they act as a major part of our interface with the public he smiled you have to be on the web these days if you want to stay in business interface that word again it seemed to be a sort of buzzword around glamourpuss ltd are escort services part of your business we have an escort agency as one of our subsidiary companies yes but you cant just bring in a girls picture from one of our web sites and place an order for her that would be tantamount to pimping on our part and you dont do that we do not what exactly is your business i should have thought that was obvious erotica in all its forms sex aids videos magazines erotic encasement equipment and services website design and hosting cdroms travel arrangements erotic encasement equipment and services aitcheson smiled its a variation on bondage mummifications the most popular some people liken it to an erotic meditative state a sort of sexual nirvana but there are those who simply prefer to be wrapped in cling film with rose thorns pressed against their flesh its all a matter of taste i suppose it is said banks who was still trying to get his head around mummification and travel arrangements what travel arrangements aitcheson graced banks with a condescending smile lets say youre gay and you want a cruise down the nile with likeminded people we can arrange it or a weekend in amsterdam a sextour of bangkok discount vouchers for brothels fifty pee off your next dildo that sort of thing aitcheson moved to stand up his smile gone i think thats about all the time i can spare you at the moment sir banks stood up leaned over the desk and pushed him back down into his chair it wheeled back a couple of inches and hit the wall taking out a small chunk of plaster just a minute aitcheson said banks shook his head you dont understand that picture came from your web site even if you dont remember putting it up there yourself you can find out who did and where it came from whats this got to do with you anyway wait a minute are you a copper banks paused and glanced down at the photo again the younger version of rosalind riddles features pale skin pouting lips high cheekbones blue eyes looked up at him from under her fringe with a sort of mocking comehither sexuality its my daughter he said im trying to find her well im sorry but we dont run a location service for missing kids there are organizations pity that banks cut in her being so young and all what do you mean banks tapped the photo she cant have been more than fifteen when this was taken look im not responsible for i think youll discover that the law says otherwise believe me ive read up on it banks leaned forward and rested his hands on the desk mr aitcheson he said heres my business proposition there are two parts to it actually in case one of them alone doesnt appeal i must admit im not always certain justice is done when you bring in the police and the lawyers are you i mean you could probably beat the charges of distribution and publication of indecent photographs of minors probably but it could be an expensive business and i dont think youd like the sort of interface it would create with your public do you follow child pornography is such an emotive term isnt it aitchesons smile had vanished completely now you sure youre not a copper he whispered or a lawyer me im just a simple working man two parts you said two parts ah yes said banks as i said im a simple working man and i wouldnt want to get tangled up with the law myself besides it would be bad for young louisa wouldnt it all that limelight giving evidence in court and all that embarrassing now i work on a building site up north and my fellow workers tend to be a conservative even rather prudish lot when it comes to this sort of thing its not that they mind looking at a pair of tits on a playboy centerfold or anything like that mind you but believe me ive heard them talking about child pornography and i wouldnt want to be on the receiving end of some of the actions they propose to deal with the people who spread it if you know what i mean is this a threat why not yes lets call it that a threat suits me now you tell me what i want to know and i wont tell the lads at the building site about glamourpuss exploiting young louisa some of them have known her since she was a little baby you know theyre very protective as a matter of fact most of them will be down here next week to see leeds play arsenal im sure theyd be happy to find the time to drop by your offices maybe do a bit of remodeling does that sound like a good deal to you aitcheson swallowed and started at banks who held his gaze finally he brought out his smile again a bit weaker now it really is a threat isnt it i thought id already made that clear do we have a deal aitcheson waved his arm all right all right ill see what i can do can you come back on monday were shut over the weekend id rather we got it over with now it might take a while i can wait banks waited it took all of twenty minutes then aitcheson came back into the office looking worried im sorry he said but we just dont have the information you require come again we dont have it the models address shes not on our books not part of our i mean it was an amateur shoot i seem to remember she was the photographers girlfriend he used to do some work for us now and then and apparently he took those photos as a bit of a lark im sure he didnt know the models true age she looks much older shes always looked older than her years banks said its got a lot of boys into trouble well im relieved to hear shes not on your books but i dont think were a lot further forward than when i first arrived do you is there anything you can do to make amends aitcheson paused then said i shouldnt but i can give you the photographers name and address craig newton as i said he used to do a spot of work for us now and then and weve still got him on file we just got a changeofaddress notice from him a short while ago as a matter of fact banks nodded itll have to do aitcheson scribbled down an address for him it was in stony stratford commuter country banks stood up to leave one more thing he said yes those photos of louisa on your web site get rid of them aitcheson allowed himself a selfsatisfied smile actually he said ive done that already while you were waiting banks smiled back and tapped the side of his nose with his forefinger good lad he said youre learning back at his hotel banks picked up the telephone and did what he had been putting off doing ever since he discovered he was bound for london the previous day not because it was something he didnt want to do but because he was nervous and uncertain of the outcome and there was so much at stake she answered on the fourth ring bankss heart pounded sandra yes who is this alan yes what do you want im in a bit of a hurry right now i was just on my way out off somewhere with sean theres no need to make it sound like that and as a matter of fact no im not seans away photographing flood damage in wales lets hope the flood water carries him away with it banks thought but bit his tongue im in town he said in london i was wondering if maybe tomorrow night you might be free for a meal or we could just have a drink lunch even what are you doing down here working in a manner of speaking are you free he could almost hear sandra thinking across the wires finally she said yes actually yes i am sean wont be back until sunday so will you have dinner with me tomorrow night yes all right thats a good idea theres a few things we have to talk about she named a restaurant on camden high street not far from where she lived seventhirty can you make it eight just to be on the safe side eight then fine see you there see you sandra hung up and banks was left with the dead line buzzing in his ear maybe she hadnt exactly welcomed him with open arms but she hadnt cut him off either more importantly she had agreed to see him tomorrow and dinner was far more intimate than lunch or a quick drink in the afternoon it was a good sign it was already dark by late afternoon when banks took the train out of euston the virgin intercity sped through hemel hempstead so fast he could hardly read the station nameplate then it slowed down near berkhamsted for no reason banks was aware of except that trains did that every now and then something to do with leaves on the tracks or a cow in a tunnel berkhamsted was where graham greene came from banks remembered from a sort of life which he had read a year or two ago greene had been one of his favorite writers ever since he first saw the third man on television back in the old met days after that in his usual obsessive fashion he collected and read everything he could get his hands on from the entertainments to the serious novels films on video essays and short stories he was particularly taken by the story of the nineteenor twentyyearold greene going out to ashbridge park in berkhamsted with a loaded revolver to play russian roulette it was eerie now to imagine the awkward gangly young man destined to become one of the centurys most famous writers clicking on an empty chamber that autumn over seventyfive years ago not far from where the train had just stopped banks had also been impressed by greenes writings on childhood about how we are all emigrants from a country we remember too little of how important to us are the fragments we do remember clearly and how we spend our time trying to reconstruct ourselves from these for most of his life banks hadnt dwelled much on his past but since sandra had left him a year ago he had found himself returning over and over again to certain incidents the heightened moments of joy and fear and guilt along with the objects sights sounds and smells that brought them back like prousts madelaines as if he were looking for clues to his future he remembered reading that greene as a child had had a number of confrontations with death and these had helped shape his life banks had experienced the same thing and he thought that in some obscure symbolic way they partly explained why he had become a policeman he remembered for example the hot summer day when phil simpkins wrapped his rope around the high tree in the churchyard and spiraled down yelling like tarzan right onto the spiked railings banks knew he would never forget the squishy thud that the body made as it hit there had been no adults around banks and two others had pulled their writhing screaming friend off the railings and stood there wondering what to do while he bled to death soaking them in the blood that gushed from a pierced artery in his thigh someone later said they should have tied a tourniquet and sent for help but they had panicked frozen would phil have lived if they hadnt banks thought not but it was a possibility and a mistake he had lived with all his life then there was jem a neighbor in his notting hill days who had died of a heroin overdose and graham marshall a shy quiet classmate who had gone missing and never been found in his own way banks felt he was responsible for them too so many deaths for one so young sometimes banks felt as if he had blood on his hands that he had let so many people down the train stopped in milton keynes banks got off walked up the stairs and along the overpass to the station exit he had never been to milton keynes before though he had heard plenty of jokes about the place one of the new towns built in the late sixties it was constructed on a grid system with planned social centers hidden pedestrian paths rather than pavements and hundreds of roundabouts it sounded like the sort of design that would go down well in america but the british sneered at it still at not much over half an hour by train from london and a much cheaper place to live it was ideal commuting territory as it was it was too dark to see much of the place the taxi seemed to circle roundabout after roundabout all of them with numbers like v and h banks didnt see any pavements or people out walking he hadnt a clue where he was finally when the taxi turned into stony stratford he found himself on a typical old village high street with ancient pubs and shop facades for a moment he wondered if it was all fake just a faux finish to give the illusion of a real english village in the midst of all that concreteandglass modernity it seemed real enough though and when the taxi pulled into a street of tall narrow prewar terrace houses he guessed that it probably was real the youth who answered the door looked to be in his mid to late twenties he wore black jeans and a gray sweatshirt advertising an american football team he was about bankss height around five feet eight or nine with curly dark hair and finely chiseled features his nose had a little bump at the bridge as if it had been broken and not properly set and he was holding something that looked like a squat vacuum flask which he kept tipping gently from side to side banks recognized it as a developing tank craig newton if that indeed was who it was looked both puzzled and annoyed to find a stranger on his doorstep early on a friday evening banks didnt look like an insurance salesman besides how many salesmen still called at houses in these days of direct mail and electronic advertising he also didnt look like a religious type or a copper what are you collecting for newton asked im busy mr newton craig newton yes what do you want mind if i come in for a moment yes i do tell me what you want its about louisa craig newton stepped back a couple of inches clearly startled louisa what about her you do know her then of course i do if its the same person were talking about louisa louisa gamine he pronounced it in italian fashion with a stress on the final e whats wrong has something happened to louisa can i come in he stood back and gave banks enough room to enter yes im sorry please banks followed him down a narrow hallway into the front room these old terrace houses werent very wide but they made up for it in length with both kitchen and bathroom tacked on at the back like afterthoughts comfortably messy the first thing the room told banks was that newton probably lived alone a number of magazines mostly to do with photography or movies littered the coffee table along with a few empty lager cans a tv set stood at the far end the simpsons was showing there was also a faint whiff of marijuana in the air though newton didnt appear stoned at all has something happened to louisa he asked again is that why youre here are you a policeman nothings happened to her as far as i know said banks and no im not a policeman im looking for her he frowned looking for louisa why i dont follow im her father the lies were starting to come rather more easily now after just a little practice and banks wasnt sure how he felt about that something to do with the end justifying the means crossed his mind and made him feel even more uneasy still it wasnt as if he hadnt told plenty of lies in the course of his work so why worry about it now he was doing the same thing as a private citizen all in a good cause if it could help a teenage runaway get herself sorted and get jimmy riddle off his back for good craig raised his eyebrows her father then he seemed suddenly to notice the developing tank he was shaking shit look ive got to finish this off properly or its a weeks work down the tubes come up if you like banks followed him upstairs where craig had turned his spare room into a makeshift darkroom he didnt need complete darkness for this stage of the process so a dim light glowed on the wall with expert economic gestures craig emptied the tank of developer poured in the stop bath and shook the tank again for a while after that he emptied it out again and poured in the fixer banks noticed a number of photographs of emily riddle tacked to a corkboard not nude shots but professionallooking folio stuff in some she wore a strapless black evening gown and had her hair pinned up in another she was wearing a vest and baggy jeans showing her bare midriff with its spider tattoo trying to look like kate moss or amber valletta these are good he said to craig craig glanced over at them she could be a model he said sadly shes a natural the harsh chemical smells transported banks back not to his life with sandra who was a keen amateur photographer but to his childhood when he used to go up to the attic darkroom with his uncle ted and watch him processing and printing he liked the printing best when the blank piece of paper went in the developing tray and you could watch the image slowly forming it seemed like magic every time they went over he pestered his uncle ted to take him up there was a safe light on the wall too he remembered just enough to see by and it gave an eerie glow in the small room but mostly it was the sharp chemical smells he remembered and the way constant exposure to the chemicals made his uncle teds fingernails brown the same way nicotine stained bankss fingers when he started smoking he used to scrub it off with pumice stone so his mother wouldnt notice then the visits to uncle teds stopped abruptly and nobody ever said why it was years before banks thought about those days again and managed to work it out for himself he remembered his uncles hand on the small of his back perhaps rubbing just a little or the arm draped casually across his shoulders in an avuncular way nothing more never anything more but there was some kind of scandal not involving banks but someone else uncle ted suddenly broke off his connection with the local youth club and no longer acted as a boys brigade leader nothing was said no police were involved but he was suddenly a pariah in the community that was how things like that were dealt with back then in that sort of close workingclass community no doubt one or two of the local fathers lay in wait one night and gave him a beating too but banks heard nothing about that uncle ted was simply never mentioned again and if banks ever asked to go visit or mentioned the name his mothers mouth formed into a tight white line a definite warning sign to shut up or else eventually he stopped mentioning it and moved on to discovering girls okay said craig emptying out the fixer and inserting a hose attached to the cold water tap were all right for half an hour now banks followed him downstairs still halflost in memories of uncle ted slowly moving to memories of sandra and how they made love in the red glow of her darkroom once back in the living room the simpsons had given way to a documentary on hollywood narrated in a plummy superior accent craig turned the tv off and they sat down opposite one another in the narrow room banks reached for his cigarettes hed been a long time without mind if i smoke no not at all craig passed him a small ashtray from the mantelpiece i dont indulge myself but it doesnt bother me not cigarettes anyway craig blushed well a bit of weed never did anyone any harm did it i suppose not he continued to study banks his look wary and suspicious so youre louisas father he said funny you dont look italian she said her father was italian met her mother in tuscany or somewhere like that on holiday what did she say about me not much just that you were a boring tightarsed old fart well banks thought if you will go around assuming other peoples identities you have to be prepared for the occasional unflattering remark especially if that identity is jimmy riddles on that score emily riddle probably wasnt far wrong do you know where louisa is he asked havent seen her for a couple of months said craig not since i moved out here banks showed him the photo this is the person were talking about isnt it craig looked at the photo and gasped youve seen them then yes is it the same girl were talking about yeah thats her louisa my daughter what happened the photos on the web site look im sorry it was just a lark really it was her as much as me more really though i dont expect you to believe me you took the photos yes we were living together at the time three months ago here no i was still in london then had a little flat in dulwich emily riddle was a fast worker banks thought only away from home three months and she was living with someone how did they get onto the glamourpuss web site craig looked away into the empty fireplace im not proud of it he said i used to do some work for them i went to school with one of the blokes who run the site and i met him in a pub when i was a bit down on my luck just after college id studied photography got my diploma but it was hard to get started in the business anyway he offered me a bit of paying work every now and then models it didnt seem that much different from life studies in college it probably didnt really banks thought sandra was a photographer too and banks had seen plenty of life studies she had taken at the camera club male and female he pointed to the cropped photo of louisa you got paid for this no good lord no this wasnt paid work like i said it was a lark a bit of fun we were well wed been smoking a bit of weed if you must know after id taken them louisa said i should put them on the web with some of the other stuff id done the professional stuff she said it would be really cool rick said he liked them so we put them up in the amateurs gallery but thats all i mean louisa doesnt have any connection with the rest of the glamourpuss business just what aitcheson had said at the office maybe it was true im glad to hear that are you sure certain she never did the photos were just a oneoff a joke i was trying out a new digital camera and well one thing led to another okay said banks waving his hand lets put that behind us id really like to find louisa just to talk to her im sure you understand can you tell me where she is i wasnt lying i dont know where she is i havent seen her in two months what happened she met another bloke and left you like a shot who is he i dont know his name i craig turned away again craig is something wrong no maybe i dont know talk to me craig craig stood up how about a drink if itll help loosen your tongue lager okay lagers fine craig brought a couple of cans from the fridge and offered one to banks he took it and popped the tab watching the foam well up and subside he took a sip and leaned back in the chair im waiting you sure youre not a copper i told you im louisas father why i dont know just something never mind besides you dont really look old enough to be her father not like i imagined anyway i wouldve expected some bald wrinkly in a suit to be honest with a funny accent waving his arms around a lot im flattered said banks but how old did you think she was louisa nineteen when i met her that is how long ago was that about three or four months why because shed just turned sixteen thats why craig spluttered on his beer she never i mean for crying out loud i wouldntve touched youve seen the photos youre her father for christs sake calm down said banks louisa always did look older than her age even if she didnt always act it she had that i dont know she seemed young but mature worldly and innocent at the same time that was one of the attractive things about her to me anyway she was a walking mass of contradictions i swear if you were me and she told you she was nineteen twentyone even youd believe her how old are you twentyseven look im sorry i really am about everything but she told me she was nineteen and i believed her what can i say yes i was attracted to her but im no cradle snatcher that wasnt it at all most of my girlfriends have been older than me as a matter of fact she just had this aura like she knew what it was all about but when it got right down to it she was vulnerable too and you felt like you wanted to protect her its hard to explain banks felt sad and angry as if this really were his own daughter he was discussing stupid what happened you say you dont know where she is that she found another boyfriend who i told you i dont know his name id tell you if i did i dont know who he is all i know is the last time i saw her she was with him they were coming out of a pub in soho not far from the glamourpuss offices id been there having a pint with that old schoolfriend rick and trying to shake a bit more business out of him id been taking a few candids out in the street i was upset about her leaving me without a word so i went up to her and tried to talk to her what happened a couple of goons attacked me he pointed to his nose thats how i got this then he pointed to his head and i had to have seen stitches where my head hit the pavement two goons thats what they looked like bodyguards minders nobody said a word it all happened so quickly when did this happen about a month ago what was louisa doing at the time she was hanging on this blokes arm not doing anything really she looked high i mean really high not just like a couple of drinks and a spliff high i heard her giggling when i went down and the man she was with what did he look like stonefaced all sharp angles like it was carved from granite hard eyes too didnt blink didnt smile not a word when i was on the ground one of the goons kicked me then they all just disappeared someone came out of the pub and helped me up and that was that i was lucky they didnt break my camera it was a minolta an expensive one banks thought for a moment he didnt like what he was hearing at all can you tell me anything more about this man craig shrugged dont know really i didnt get a really good look at him tall maybe about six two or three looked older than who more your age than mine banks felt his stomach rumbling and realized he hadnt eaten all day except for a slice of toast with his morning coffee he hadnt finished with newton yet though there were still things he needed to know is there anywhere decent to eat around here he asked couple of good indian places down the high street if thats your sort of thing fancy a meal on me craig looked surprised sure why not just let me hang up the negs to dry wont be a minute he left the room banks stayed where he was finishing his lager and thought a bit more about darkrooms uncle ted and sandra naked in the infrared light dinner tomorrow they walked down to the narrow high street the wind had dropped but it was a chilly evening and there werent many people out banks was glad of his warm leather jacket they passed a sign on the wall of one of the buildings that made some reference to richard iii historical too then stony stratford its supposed to be where he picked up the princes in the tower said craig before they were in the tower like you know the ones he killed craig picked a relatively inexpensive indian restaurant it was comfortably warm inside and the exotic smells made bankss mouth water the minute they got in the door when they had ordered beers and were nibbling on poppadams in anticipation of their main courses banks picked up the subject of louisa again did she ever mention this boyfriend to you before no one day everything seemed fine the next she packed her stuff what little she had and she was gone before i got home i had a wedding to shoot that day my first and it was a big deal when i got home all i found was a note i remember it word for word he closed his eyes sorry craig its just not working out youre sweet lad maybe see you around hugs and kisses louisa that was it you had no idea at all what was going on that shed met someone else not at the time no but the blokes often the last to find out isnt he had you been arguing yeah but that was par for the course with louisa you argued a lot a fair bit what about oh the usual stuff she was bored our life lacked glamour and excitement she wanted to go places more she said i wasnt paying enough attention to her that i was taking her for granted was it true maybe some of it i was working a lot getting paying jobs like that wedding i suppose i was probably spending more time in the darkroom than i was with her and i didnt know where she was half the time i mean wed only been living together a month or so it wasnt as if we were an old married couple or something she went out alone a lot she said she was out with her mates sometimes she didnt come back till two or three in the morning said shed been clubbing well you dont hold on to a girl like louisa by clipping her wings so there wasnt a lot i could do about it it got me down a bit though did you know any of her friends only ruth she introduced us ruth yeah ruth walker how did she know louisa dunno but ruths always taking in strays heart of gold shes got do anything for you louisa was staying with her when we met ive known ruth since i was at college she was doing a computer course at the university and she helped me out with some digital photography software we got to be friends id go see her once in a while you know take her down to the pub or out to see a movie or a band or something shes really into the livemusic scene and one time i went there was louisa sitting on her sofa i wont say it was love at first sight but it was definitely something lust no doubt thought banks were you and ruth lovers ruth and me nah nothing like that we were just friends the food came balti prawns for craig and lamb korma for banks along with pullao rice mango chutney and naans and they paused as they shared out the dishes the ubiquitous sitar music droned in the background okay said banks after a few bites to stay the rumbling of his stomach what happened next well ruth had got louisa a job at the same company she worked for out canary wharf way nothing much just fetching and carrying really louisa didnt have any great job skills but it brought in a quid or two helped get her on her feet did louisa talk much about her past only to put it down sounds as if you gave her a pretty rough time sorry but you asked i suppose i did banks tasted the lamb it was a bit too greasy but it would do he soaked up some sauce with his naan anyway craig went on she didnt last long there didnt seem to take to office work at all as a matter of fact or any work for that matter why was that i think it was mostly her attitude louisa thinks other people are there to work for her not the other way around and shes got attitude with a capital a how did she survive after that she had a few quid of her own in the bank she never said how much but she never seemed to go short sometimes she borrowed off ruth or me she could go through money like nobodys business could louisa and the new boyfriend craig nodded if hes the sort of bloke who can afford minders then hes probably not short of a few quid is he gone up in the world she had young louisa thats right banks thought and if hes the sort of bloke who needs minders then the odds are that he makes his money in a dodgy way a way that could make him enemies who want to do him physical harm a way that could also put emily in jeopardy the more banks heard the more worried about her he became are you sure youve got no idea who he is where i can find them sorry if i knew id tell you believe me do you think ruth walker might know its possible she wouldnt tell me when i asked her but i think louisa must have told her i was obsessed with her stalking her or something were you course not then what makes you think that just the way she looked at me we havent been quite the same since that whole thing with louisa ruth and me but she might tell you banks shrugged its worth a try craig gave him the address of ruths flat in kennington you know i really liked louisa he mused maybe i loved her i dont know she was pretty wild and her mood swings well all i can say is she could make one of those divas look stable but i liked her still maybe im better off without her at least i can concentrate on my work now and i need to do that lord knows she ran me ragged but for a while there when shed first gone there was a big hole in my life i know it sounds corny but id no energy no real will to go on the world didnt look the same not as bright not as interesting gray welcome to reality thought banks he had come prepared to be hard on craig newton after all craig had taken the nude photographs of emily that had ended up on the glamourpuss web site for every pervert to drool over but the lad was actually turning out to be quite likable if craig was to be believed he had genuinely thought that emily was nineteen and who wouldnt going by the evidence banks had seen and heard so far and the web photos had simply been a foolish lark craig also seemed to care about emily he hadnt only been with her for the sex or whatever else a sixteenyearold girl had to offer a twentysevenyearold man and that went a long way in banks estimation on the other hand this new boyfriend sounded like trouble and emily louise riddle herself sounded like a royal pain in the arse why did you move out here banks asked because of louisa partly it was around that time its funny but id mentioned getting out of london a couple of times and louisa went all cold on me the way she did when she wasnt getting her own way or heard something she didnt like anyway i got the chance of a partnership in a small studio here with a bloke i went to college with a straightup legit business this time portraits and weddings mostly no porn i was fed up of london by then anyway not just the thing with louisa but other things too expensive too hard to make a living too much competition the hours i was putting in youve really got to hustle hard there and i was discovering im not much of a hustler at heart i began to think id be better off as a bigger fish in a smaller pond and he looked up from his prawns and smiled it seems to be working out then he paused this is weird though i never thought id be sitting down having a curry with louisas dad chatting in a civilized manner ive got to say youre not at all what i imagined so you said a boring old fart yeah well thats what she said wouldnt let her do anything go anywhere kept her a virtual prisoner in the house lock up your daughters yeah did you you know what shes like what do you think i should have done with louisa i used to think i knew what she was like now im not so sure from what you say she told me a pack of lies right from the start how can i believe anything about her what do you do with someone like her indeed thought banks feeling just a little guilty over his deception what do you do the thing was that the more he found himself pretending to be louisas father the more he found himself slipping into the role so much so that on the slow train back to euston later that evening after craig had kindly given him a lift to the station when he thought about what his own daughter might be up to in paris with damon he wasnt sure whether he was angry at tracy or at emily riddle and the more he thought about the situation the more he realized that it had never been finding emily riddle that concerned him it was what he was going to do after hed found her that really bothered him saturday morning dawned cool and overcast but the wind was quickly tearing a few holes in the ragged clouds enough blue sky to make baby a new bonnet as bankss mother would say banks lingered over coffee and a toasted tea cake in a café on tottenham court road not far from his hotel reading the morning papers and watching people checking out the electronics shops across the road he had slept well surprisingly so since the hotel was the same one that he and detective sergeant annie cabbot had stayed in during his last case not the same room thank god but the same floor memories of her skin warm and moist against his kept him awake longer than he would have liked and made him feel vaguely guilty but in the end he drifted into a deep and dreamless sleep from which he awoke feeling unusually refreshed according to his a to z ruth walker lived quite close to the cramped flat off clapham road that banks and sandra had lived in for a few years in the early eighties when the kids were little not exactly the good old days but happy for the most part before the job started taking too much of a toll on him simpler maybe sandra worked parttime as a dental receptionist on kennington park road he remembered and banks was usually too busy out playing cops and robbers to take his wife to the theater or help the kids with their homework it wasnt much more than a couple of miles from the west end as the crow flies and he decided the walk would do him good he had always loved walking in cities and london was a great place for it he had been cheated out of paris so he would have to make the best of where he was if he set off now he realized he would probably arrive around lunchtime if he got louisas address from ruth he would go there in the early evening between six or seven which he had always found was a good time to catch people in that should also leave him plenty of time to meet sandra at eight in camden town a cool wind skipped off the murky river and whistled around his ears as he crossed lambeth bridge he glanced back shafts of light lanced through the clouds and lit on the houses of parliament it was odd banks thought but when you visit a place you used to live in for a long time you see it differently you become more like a tourist in your own land he would probably never have even noticed big ben or the houses of parliament in the days when he had lived there even now his coppers eye was more tuned to the two shiftylooking skinheads across the road who seemed to be following a couple of japanese tourists than it was to the beauty of the london architecture it was pushing twelvethirty when banks got to ruths street just off kennington road the brick terrace houses were four stories high and so narrow they seemed pressed together like a mouthful of bad teeth here and there someone had added a lick of bright paint to a window frame or put out a few potted plants in the bay window the name r a walker appeared by the thirdfloor bell a dead giveaway that the occupant was a woman banks pressed and heard it ring way up in the distance he waited but nobody came then he tried again still nothing after standing on the doorstep for a few minutes he gave up he hadnt wanted to phone ahead and tip her off that he was coming finding that surprise often worked best in situations like this so he had been prepared to wait banks decided to have his lunch and call back in an hour or so if she wasnt in then hed think of a new plan he found a serviceable pub on the main street and enjoyed a pint as he finished reading the newspaper a few regulars stood at the bar and a younger crowd was gathered around the video machines one man wearing a tartan cap kept nipping around the corner to the betting shop and coming back to tell everyone in a loud voice how much hed lost and how the horse hed backed belonged in the glue factory everyone laughed indulgently nobody paid banks any mind which was just the way he liked it he glanced over the menu and settled finally on a chicken pot pie it would have suited annie cabbot just fine banks thought as he searched in vain among peas and carrots for the meat annie was a vegetarian a short while later he stood on ruth walkers doorstep again and gave her bell a long push this time he was rewarded by a wary voice over the intercom who is it ive come about louisa banks said louisa gamine louisa what about her shes not here i need to talk to you there was a long pause so long that banks thought ruth had hung up the intercom on him then the voice said come up top floor a buzzer went off and banks pushed the front door open the stairs were carpeted though the fabric had worn thin in places and the pattern was hard to make out a variety of cooking smells assailed banks as he climbed the narrow staircase a hint of curry garlic tomato sauce when he got to the top there was only one door it opened almost immediately when he knocked and a young woman looked at him through narrowed eyes after she had studied him for a while she opened the door and let him in the best banks could say of ruth walker was that she was plain it was a cruel and unfair description he knew but it was true ruth was the kind of girl who in his adolescence always went around with an attractive friend the one you really wanted the ruths of this world you usually tried to palm off on your friend there was nothing distinguishing about her except perhaps the intelligence perceptible in her disconcerting and restless gray eyes already she seemed to have a permanent frown etched in her forehead she was dressed simply in baggy jeans and a tshirt commemorating an old oasis tour her hair dyed black gelled and cut spiky didnt suit her round face at all nor did the collection of rings and studs through the crescent edges of her ears her complexion looked dry as parchment and she still suffered the ravages of acne the flat was spacious with a high ceiling and one of those chinesestyle globe lampshades over the bulb bookshelves stood propped on bricks against one wall not much on them apart from tattered paperbacks and a few software manuals and a computer stood on the desk under the window a sheepskin rug covered part of the hardwood floor and various quilts and patterned coverlets hung over the secondhand threepiece suite it was a comfortable room ruth walker banks had to admit had made a nice home for herself i dont usually let strangers in she said a good policy but you mentioned louisa youre not one of her new friends are you no im not you dont like them i can take them or leave them ruth sniffed and reached for a packet of embassy regal resting on the coffee table bad habit i picked up in university want a cup of tea please it would set them at ease banks thought create the right atmosphere for the sort of informal chat he wanted ruth put the cigarettes down without lighting one and walked into the kitchen she had a slight limp not enough to slow her down but noticeable if you looked closely enough banks looked at the book titles maeve binchy rosamunde pilcher catherine cookson a few cds lay scattered beside the stereo but banks hadnt heard of most of the groups except for the manic street preachers sheryl crow beth orton radiohead and pj harvey still ruth probably hadnt heard of arnold bax or gerald finzi either when ruth came back with the tea and sat opposite him she still seemed to be checking him out probing him with those suspicious gray eyes of hers louisa she said when she had finally lit her cigarette what about her im looking for her do you know where she is why does it matter it might you could be out to do her harm im not what do you want with her then banks paused might as well do it again after all hed got this far on a lie and it was beginning to fit so well he almost believed it himself even though he had never met emily riddle im her father he said i just want to talk to her ruth just stared at him a moment her eyes narrowing i dont think so she shook her head you dont think what that youre louisas father why not he wouldnt come looking for her for a start i love my daughter banks said which at least was true no you dont understand i saw a photo a family photo she had with the rest of her things theres no point lying i know it wasnt you banks paused stunned as much by emilys taking a family photo as by ruths immediate uncovering of his little deception time for a change of tack okay he said im not her father but he asked me to look for her to try to find her and ask her if shed talk to him why didnt he come himself hes afraid that if she knows hes looking for her shell make herself even more scarce hes got that one right said ruth look why should i tell you anything louisa left home of her own free will and she was of legal age she came down here to live her own life away from her parents why should i mess things up for her im not here to force her to do anything she doesnt want said banks she can stay down here if she likes all her father wants is to know what shes doing where she lives if shes all right and if shell talk to him great if not why should i trust you youve already lied to me is she in any trouble ruth banks asked does she need help help louisa you must be joking shes the kind who always lands on her feet no matter what after shes landed on her back first that is i thought she was a friend of yours she was is ruth made an impatient gesture she just annoys me sometimes thats all most people do dont your friends piss you off from time to time but is there any real reason for concern im sure i dont know banks sipped some tea it tasted bitter where did you meet her down near kings cross she came up to me in the street and asked me the way to the nearest youth hostel we got talking i could tell shed just arrived and she wasnt quite sure what to do or where to go ruth shrugged i know how lonely and friendless london can be especially when youre new to it all so you took her in i felt sorry for her and she lived with you here ruths cheeks reddened look im not a lezzy if thats what youre thinking i offered her my spare room till she got on her feet thats all cant a person do someone a good turn anymore without it being turned into some sort of sex thing i didnt mean to suggest that said banks im sorry if it upset you yeah well just be careful what you go around saying to people thats all you and louisa are friends though you said yeah she stayed here for a while i helped get her a job but it didnt take then she met craig a bloke i knew from college and she went off to live with him ruth spoke in a curiously dispassionate way but banks got the impression there was a lot beneath the surface she wasnt saying he also got the sense that she was constantly assessing evaluating calculating and that being found out in his little lie had put him somehow in thrall to her ive talked to craig newton he said and he told me she left him for a new boyfriend sounds like a nasty piece of work know who he is just some bloke she met at a party were you there did you meet him yes have you seen them since they came round here once i think louisa was showing him off he certainly didnt seem impressed by what he saw do you know his name barry clough do you know the address ruth fumbled for another cigarette and when she had lit it and breathed out her first lungful of smoke she nodded yeah they live in one of those fancy villastyle places out little venice way louisa had me over to a dinner party there once catered of course i think she was trying to impress me that time did it work it takes more than a big house and a couple of hasbeen rock stars and maybe a backbencher and a bent copper or two banks smiled what does he do for a living some sort of businessman hes got connections with the music business if you ask me hes a drug dealer what makes you say that fancy house always lots of coke around rock stars stands to reason doesnt it does louisa take drugs is the pope polish how long ago did they meet bit over two months have you seen much of her since that time not much youre beginning to sound like a copper you know banks didnt like the way she was looking at him as if she knew im just worried thats all he said why shes not your daughter banks didnt want to explain about his own daughter at this moment no doubt walking around paris hand in hand with damon or perhaps not even bothering with the sights deciding instead to spend the weekend in bed her fathers a good mate of mine he said instead the words almost sticking in his throat as he uttered them id hate to see any harm come to her bit late for that isnt it i mean it was nearly six months ago when she first came down here he should have put a bit more effort into finding her back then if you ask me she paused narrowed her eyes again then said im not sure about you theres something youre not telling me you werent screwing her were you i wouldnt put it past her she was no innocent from the provinces even when she first came here she knew what was what shes a bit young for me banks said ruth gave a harsh laugh at your age i should think its often a matter of the younger the better why do you think they have prostitutes as young as thirteen fourteen cos the girls like it banks felt the sting of her remark but he couldnt think of an appropriate response were getting off track here not if you want me to give you louisas address were not ive got to satisfy myself youre not a pervert not some creep havent i and dont come the age bit she could coax a ninetyyearold bishop out of his cassock could louisa all i can do is repeat what ive already told you there was nothing like that ive got a daughter her age myself you do yes whats her name surprised banks answered tracy ruth evaluated him some more you dont look old enough want to see my birth certificate no thats not necessary besides i dont suppose you actually carry it around with you do you it was a never mind said banks feeling he had had just about as much of ruth walker and her sharp edges as he could take no wonder emily had run off with craig newton at the first opportunity ruth got up and walked to the window would you believe that sad pillock over there she said a few moments later almost muttering to herself he works security on the night shift hasnt a clue the bloke from number fiftythree is shagging the arse off his wife every night dirty bastard maybe i should tell him before banks could make any comment ruth turned sharply arms folded a smug smile on her face all right she said ill tell you where they live but youre wasting your time shes had it with the lot of you she wont listen to a word youve got to say its worth a try at least ill find out whether shes all right what shes up to ruth gave him a pitying look maybe you will she said and maybe you wont shortly after six oclock that evening banks got off the tube at warwick avenue and walked toward the address ruth had given him had it been a lovely summer evening he might have walked down the steps to the canal and admired the brightly colored houseboats but it had turned dark by late afternoon as usual and it was a chilly evening with the smell of rain in the wind the address turned out to be a villastyle building square and detached within a high enclosing wall in the wall stood an iron gate a locked gate banks could have kicked himself for not expecting something like this if louisas boyfriend was the type to go around with minders he was also the type to live in a bloody fortress getting to see emily riddle wouldnt be quite so easy as knocking on the door or ringing the bell at the front two of the downstairs windows and one upstairs were lit behind dark curtains and a light shone over the front door banks tried to think of the best approach he could simply call through on the intercom and announce himself see if that gained him admission alternatively he could climb the gate and go knock on the door then what rescue the damsel in distress climb to the upstairs window on her hair flee with her over his shoulder as far as he knew though emily riddle wasnt in distress nor was she held captive in a tower in fact she might well be having the time of her life he stood in front of the gate and stared through the bars cheeks so close he could feel the cold from the iron there was nothing else for it really he would have to use the intercom and just hope he could gain admittance he obviously couldnt pass himself off as emilys father this time but if he said he came with an important message from her family that ought to get him inside it might just work before he could press the buzzer he felt a strong hand grasp the back of his neck and push his face toward the bars so the cold iron chafed against his cheeks what the fuck are you doing here the voice asked him bankss first impulse was to kick back hard at the mans shins with his heel or tread down sharply on his instep then slip free swivel around and lash out but he had to hold himself in check remember why he was here who he was supposed to be if he beat up his assailant where would that get him nowhere most likely on the other hand maybe this was his best way in im looking for louisa he said the grip loosened banks turned and found himself facing a man in a tightfitting suit who looked as if he might have been one of mike tysons sparring partners probably just as well he hadnt tried to fight back he thought louisa what do you want with louisa the man said i want to talk to her thats all he said her father sent me fuck a duck said the minder i was going to ring the bell banks went on i was just looking to see if there were any lights on if there was anyone home you were yes i think youd better come with me mate the minder said which was exactly what banks had hoped for well see what mr clough has to say about that the minder slipped a creditcard style key into the mechanism at the side of the intercom punched in a sevendigit number which banks was amazed he had the brains to remember and the gate slid open on oiled hinges the minder was holding banks by the arm now but only hard enough to break a few small bones as he led him down the short path to the front door which he opened with a simple yale key sometimes security like beauty is only skindeep they stood in a bright corridor which ran all the way through to a gleaming modern kitchen at the back of the house several doors led off the corridor all closed and immediately to their right a thickly carpeted staircase led to the upper levels it was a hell of a lot fancier than ruths flat banks thought and grander than anything craig newton could afford too always landed on her feet the riddles said they had given emily all the advantages that money could afford the horse piano lessons holidays expensive schooling and they had certainly raised a highmaintenance daughter by the looks of this place muffled music came from one of the rooms a pop song banks didnt recognize as soon as the front door shut behind them the minder called out boss one of the doors opened and a tall man walked out he wasnt fat or even overly muscular like the minder but he certainly looked as if he lifted a few weights at the gym once or twice a week as craig newton had pointed out his face was all angles as if it had been carved from stone and he was handsome if you liked that sort of thing rather like a younger nick nolte he was wearing a cream armani suit over a red tshirt had a deep suntan and a gray ponytail about six inches long hanging over his back collar around his neck he wore a thick gold chain which matched the one on his wrist and the chunky signet ring over the hairy knuckle on his right hand banks pegged him at early to midforties which wasnt much younger than jimmy riddle or banks himself for that matter the hard glint in his eyes and the cocky confidence with which he moved showed that he was someone to watch out for banks had seen that look before in the eyes of hardened criminals people to whom the world and its contents are there for the taking and for whom any impediments are simply to be brushed aside as easily as dandruff off the collar whats this he asked eyes on banks found him lurking by the gate boss just standing there says he wants to see louisa barry clough raised an eyebrow but the hardness in his eyes didnt ease a jot did he now what might you be wanting with louisa little man her father asked me to look for her banks said he wants me to deliver a message private investigator just a friend of the family clough studied banks closely for what seemed like minutes then a glint of humor flashed into his eyes the way a shark flashes through the water no problem he said ushering banks into the room a girl should stay in touch with her family i always say though i cant say as shes ever offered to take me home to meet mummy and daddy yet i dont even know where they live banks said nothing the minder shifted from foot to foot youre lucky to find us in said clough louisa and i just got back from florida a couple of days ago cant stand the bloody weather here in winter we take off as often as we can ill call her down for you in the meantime take a load off drink no thanks i wont take long clough looked at his watch an expensive one youve got twenty minutes he said then weve got a bonfire night party to go to sure you wont have that drink no thanks banks sat down as clough left the room he heard muffled footsteps on the staircase the minder had disappeared into the kitchen the room banks found himself in had that oldfashioned wainscoted look he wouldnt have expected judging by what he had seen of the bright hall and the modern kitchen at the back paintings hung on the walls mostly english landscapes a couple of them looked old and genuine not constables or anything but they probably cost a bob or two on one wall stood a locked barred glass case full of guns deactivated collectors models banks guessed nobody would be stupid enough to put real guns on display like that logs crackled and spit out sparks from the large stone hearth the music was coming from an expensive stereo set up at the far end of the room now he was closer to the source banks realized he did recognize it it was an old joy division album heart and soul was playing he heard voices upstairs but he couldnt make out what they were saying at one point a womans voice raised almost to the point where he could hear the defiance in her tone then at a barked order from the man it stopped a few seconds later the door opened and in she walked he hadnt heard her come down the stairs and nor did he hear her float across the turkish carpet craig newton was right talk about a mix of innocence and experience she could have been sixteen which she was but she could have been twentysix just as easily and in some ways she reminded banks even more of her mother in the flesh than in the photographs he had seen blue eyes cherry lips what he hadnt been able to tell from those photos though was that she had a smattering of freckles across her small nose and high cheekbones and that her eyes were a much paler blue than rosalinds the florida sun didnt seem to have done much for her skin which was as pale as her mothers perhaps she had stayed indoors or walked around under a parasol like a southern belle rosalind was a little shorter and fullerfigured than her daughter and of course her hairstyle was different emily had a ragged fringe and her fine naturalblond hair fell straight to her shoulders and brushed against them as she moved tall and longlegged she also had that anorexic thoroughbred look of a professional model heroinchic she was wearing denim capris that came halfway up her calves and a loose cableknit sweater she walked barefoot he noticed showing off her shapely ankles and slim feet the toenails painted crimson for some reason coleridges line from christabel flashed through bankss mind her blueveined feet unsandalled were it had always seemed an improbably erotic image to him ever since he first came across the poem at school and now he knew why though emily walked with style and selfpossession there was a list to her progress and when he looked closely banks noticed a few tiny grains of white powder in the soft indentation between her nose and her upper lip even as he looked her pointed pink tongue slipped out of her mouth and swept it away she smiled at him her eyes were slightly unfocused and the pupils dilated little random chips of light dancing in them like feldspar catching the sun i dont believe ive had the pleasure she said stretching out her hand to him it came at the end of an impossibly long arm banks stood up and shook her cool soft fingers grasped his loosely for a second then disengaged he introduced himself emily sat in an armchair by the fire legs curled under her and toyed with a loose thread at the end of one sleeve so youre banks she said ive heard of you detective chief inspector banks am i right youre right all good i hope she smiled intriguing at least then her expression turned to one of boredom what does daddy want after all this time oh christ what is this dreadfully dull music sometimes barry plays the most depressing things joy division said banks he committed suicide the lead singer im not bloody surprised id commit suicide if i sounded like him she got up shut off the cd and replaced it with alanis morissettes jagged little pill alanis sang about all she really wanted she didnt sound a lot more cheerful than joy division banks thought but the music was more upbeat more modern hes still an old punk at heart is barry did you know he used to be a roadie for a punk band what does he do now banks asked casually hes a businessman bit of this bit of that you know the sort of thing she laughed it sounded like a crystal glass shattering come to think of it i dont really know what he does hes away a lot he doesnt talk about it much she put a finger to her lips its all terribly hushhush ill bet it is thought banks as she had been speaking he found himself trying to place her accent he couldnt riddle had probably moved counties more times than hed had hot dinners to make chief constable by his midforties so emily had ended up with a kind of characterless nowhere accent not especially posh but certainly without any of the rough edges a regional bias gives banks knew that his own accent was hard to place too as he had grown up in peterborough lived in london for over twenty years and in north yorkshire for about seven as emily talked now she walked around the room touching objects occasionally picking up an ornament such as a heavy glass paperweight with a rose design trapped inside and putting it back or moving it somewhere else she ended up standing by the fireplace elbow leaning on the mantelpiece fist to her cheek one hip cocked did you tell me what youd come for she asked i dont remember you havent given me a chance yet she put her hand to her mouth and stifled a giggle ooh im sorry thats me that is talk talk talk banks saw an ashtray on the table with a couple of butts crushed out in it he reached for his cigarettes offered emily one which she took and lit one for himself then he leaned forward a little in his armchair and said i was talking to your father a couple of days ago emily hes worried about you he wants you to get in touch with him my names louisa and im not going home nobody said you were but it wouldnt do you any harm to get in touch with him and let him know how youre doing where you are would it hed only get angry she pouted then moved away from the fireplace how did you find me i didnt tell anyone where im from i didnt even use my real name i know said banks but really louisa gamine youre a clever girl youve had an expensive education it took me a little while to work it out but i got there in the end gamine means a girl with mischievous charm but gamine is an anagram of enigma which means puzzle or in this case riddle your father said you were very good with language she clapped her hands together clever man you got it what a brilliant detective but that still doesnt answer my question your little brother saw your photo on the internet emilys jaw dropped and she fell back onto the chair it was hard to tell but banks thought her reaction was genuine ben ben saw that banks nodded oh shit she flicked her halfsmoked cigarette into the fire that wasnt supposed to happen i dont imagine it was and he told mum thats right shed never have told dad not in a million years she knows what hes like as well as i do i dont know how he found out said banks but he did emily laughed id love to have seen his face no you wouldnt and he sent you to look for me thats about it why why did he send me well im damn sure he wouldnt bother coming himself but why you he doesnt even like you but he knows im good at my job let me guess hes promised you hell leave you alone if you do as he asks dont trust him i cant honestly say as i do but ive got what never mind it doesnt matter tell me what you were going to say no banks didnt want to tell her about tracy that in an odd sort of way he was doing this for her making up for his own absences and shortcomings as a father emily sulked for a few moments then she stood up again and paced in front of him counting off imaginary points on her fingers let me see the pictures took you to glamourpuss right that took you to craig but he doesnt know where i am i told ah ruth ruth told you banks said nothing well she would shes a jealous cow shed just love to cause trouble for me the ugly bitch just because ive met someone like barry and shes still stuck in her poky little flat in kennington do you know what nothing never mind what were you going to say emily smiled no now its my turn to tease im not telling you before banks could frame a response she stopped pacing and knelt in front of him looking up into his face with her sparkling blue eyes so you saw them too did you the photos banks swallowed yes did you like them did they excite you not particularly liar she jumped up again a smile of triumph on her face besides they were just a joke a laugh daddys got nothing to worry about from them its not as if ive taken up a career in the porno business or anything im glad to hear it said banks hes just worried about me ruining his spotless reputation isnt he thats part of it banks didnt feel he necessarily had to paint an idealized picture of riddle especially to his run away daughter she probably knew him better than anyone but he did also seem genuinely concerned about you im sure he did emily had sat down again now and seemed thoughtful chief constable jeremiah riddle champion of family values quality time the caring concerned copper my daughter the slut wouldnt fit at all with that image would it it wouldnt do any harm if you just gave him a call and reassured him everythings okay would it banks said and what about your mother shes worried sick too her eyes flashed you dont know anything what do you know about it she fingered the collar of her sweater and seemed to draw in on herself it was like being in prison up there you cant go here you cant do that you cant see him you cant talk to her dont forget your piano lessons have you done your homework be in before eight oclock id no room to breathe it was stifling me i couldnt be free couldnt be myself are you now of course i am she stood up again red patches glowed on her cheeks tell daddy to fuck off tell the old man to just fuck off let him wonder let him worry im not going to set his mind at rest because you know what what because he was never fucking there anyway he used to make all these rules and you know what he was never even there to enforce them mummy had to do that and she didnt even care enough he was never even there to enforce his own stupid rules isnt that a laugh she went to lean against the fireplace again alanis morissette was singing about seeing right through someone and banks knew what she meant still hed done his job done as hed been asked he could give jimmy riddle emilys london address tell him about barry clough if riddle wanted to send in the locals to check out cloughs gun collection set the forensic accountants on his business interests and put in a call to the drugs squad that was his business bankss job was over it was up to riddle to take it from there he tore a page from his notebook and wrote on it if you change your mind or if theres anything else you want to tell me any message you want me to deliver this is where im staying you can phone and leave a message if im not there for a moment he thought she wasnt going to take it but she did then she glanced at it once crumpled it up and threw it in the fire the door opened and barry clough strode in smile on his face he tapped his wristwatch better get ready love he said to emily were due at rods place in half an hour he looked at banks the smile gone and your times up mate he said jerking his thumb toward the front door on your bike banks was running about five minutes late for his dinner with sandra when he got off the tube at camden town the drizzle had turned into a steady downpour now and puddles in the gutter were smeared with the gaudy reflections of shop signs and traffic lights luckily the restaurant wasnt far from the underground banks turned up his jacket collar but he was still soaked by the time he dashed into the restaurant at first he didnt recognize the woman who smiled and waved him over to her table by the window though he had seen sandra briefly just a couple of months ago she had changed her appearance completely since then for a start she had had her blond hair cut short and layered if anything the style emphasized her dark eyebrows more than ever and banks had always found sandras eyebrows one of her sexiest features she was also wearing a pair of round goldrimmed glasses not much bigger than the granny glasses that were so popular in the sixties he had never seen her in glasses before hadnt known she needed them from what he could make out her clothes looked artsy all different layers a black shawl a red silk scarf a redandblackpatterned jumper banks edged into the chair opposite her he was starving it seemed ages since that dismal chicken pot pie in kennington sorry im a bit late he said drying off his hair with a serviette id forgotten what a pain the bloody tube can be sandra smiled its all right remember im used to your being late banks let that one go by he looked around the restaurant was busy bustling with waiters and parties coming and going it was one of those places that banks thought trendy in its lack of trendiness all scratched wood tables and partitions pork chops steaks and mashed potatoes but the mashed potatoes had garlic and sundried tomatoes in them and cost about three quid a side order ive already ordered some wine sandra said a halfliter of the house claret i know you prefer red okay with you fine banks had turned down a drink at cloughs house because he hadnt wanted to be beholden to the bastard in any way but he wanted one now youre looking good he said youve changed i dont mean that you didnt always look good you know what i mean sandra laughed blushed a little and turned away thank you she said whats with the glasses they come with age she said anytime after you fortieth birthday then im really living on borrowed time a waiter brought the wine and left it for them to pour themselves pretentious in its unpretentiousness sandra paused as banks filled their glasses then lifted hers for a toast how are you alan she asked fine said banks just fine couldnt be better working arent i always i thought jimmy riddle had shuffled you off to the hinterlands even riddle needs my particular skills every now and then banks sipped some wine perfectly quaffable he looked around and saw it was okay to light a cigarette may i cadge one sandra asked of course still cant give them up completely not completely oh sean doesnt like it he keeps going on at me to stop but i dont think one or two a month is really bad for your health good sign that banks thought sean the nag probably not he said i keep waiting for them to announce they were wrong all along and cigarettes are really good for you and its all the raw vegetables and fruit that do the damage sandra laughed youll have a long wait she clinked glasses cheers cheers i was out where we used to live this lunchtime kennington really why a sentimental journey work it was a pretty cramped flat as i remember much too small with the kids and that dentist i worked for was a groper you never told me that theres lots of things i never told you you usually seemed to have enough on your plate as it was they studied the menu for a couple of minutes banks saw that he was right about the mashed potatoes and the garlic and sundried tomatoes and the price he ordered venison sausage with braised red cabbage and garlic mashed potatoes no sundried tomatoes it seemed the perfect comfort meal for a night like this sandra went for steak and frites their orders given to the waiter they smoked and drank in silence awhile longer now he was here with her banks didnt know how to approach what he wanted to say he felt curiously tonguetied like a teenager on his first date if sandra would put this silliness with sean aside and come back he wanted to tell her it was still possible that they could rebuild their relationship and move on true they had sold the eastvale semi and bankss cottage would be a bit small for two but they could manage there for a while at least if banks went through with his transfer to the national crime squad if they offered him it then who knew where they might end up living and with riddle owing him now he would be all right for a glowing recommendation i saw brian last week sandra said he told me when i phoned him the other evening i wanted to drop by and see him while i was here but he said they were off to play some gigs in scotland sandra nodded thats right aberdeen hes really excited about their prospects you know theyve already almost finished their first cd i know their son brian played in a rock band they had just cut their first record with an indie label and were on the verge of getting a deal with a major record company banks had heard the band play the last time he was in london and had been knocked out by his sons singing playing and songwriting talent had come to see him in a whole new light a person unto himself not just an extension of the family he had almost written brian off as an idler and a layabout after he nearly failed his degree but brian was his own person in bankss mind now independent talented free the same feeling had happened with tracy when he had seen her with her new friends in a pub shortly after she started university he knew hed lost her then at least lost the daughter of his imagination but in her place he had found a young woman he liked and admired even if she was off in paris with the monosyllabic damon letting go can be painful banks had learned over the years but sometimes it hurts more if you try to hold on i thought you were taking tracy to paris this weekend she told you of course why shouldnt she i am her mother after all banks sipped some wine something came up he said shes gone with a friend sandra raised an eyebrow male or female male bloke called damon seems all right tracy can take care of herself i know that alan its just just difficult thats all what is trying to bring up two kids this way apart you know what i mean even if we were still together it would be like this were not bringing them up anymore theyre grown up now sandra they live away from home the sooner you accept that the better do you think i dont know that im just saying its hard thats all they both seem so distant now they are but as i said it would be like that anyway maybe their food arrived and they both tucked in the sausage was good more meat than fat for a change and so were the garlic mashed potatoes sandra pronounced her positive verdict on the steak a few minutes into the meal she said remember when i dropped by to see you up at gratly how could i forget i want to apologize im sorry i shouldnt have done that not unannounced it was unfair of me never mind how is she who you know who i mean your pretty young girlfriend what was her name annie annie cabbot detective sergeant annie cabbot thats right sandra smiled i cant believe you tried to con me into thinking the two of you were working her barefoot in those tight shorts it was plain as the nose on your face anyway how is she i havent seen much of her lately dont tell me i scared her off sort of well she cant have much staying power if she let a little thing like that scare her away i suppose not im sorry alan really i am i dont want to spoil anything for you i want you to find someone i want you to be happy banks ate more food and washed it down with wine soon the carafe was empty another he suggested fine said sandra ill probably only have one glass though if you think you can manage the rest by yourself im not driving banks ordered more wine and filled their glasses when it came was there anything i mean was there any particular reason you wanted to see me sandra asked do i need a reason to have dinner with my own wife sandra flinched i didnt mean you needed one i just for crying out loud alan weve been separated for a year now weve hardly spoken so much as a few words to one another in that time and that mostly over the telephone you cant expect me not to wonder if youve got some sort of hidden agenda i just thought it was time we buried the hatchet thats all sandra studied him sure yes im sure all right then consider it buried they clinked glasses again hows jenny fuller jenny was a mutual acquaintance she was also a clinical psychologist and banks had sought her help on a number of cases i havent seen a lot of her shes pretty busy now shes back teaching at york you know sandra said toying with her few remaining frites and looking at him sideways there was a time when i thought you and jenny i mean shes a very attractive woman it just never worked out that way said banks who had often wondered why it hadnt even when it seemed that both of them wanted it to fate he supposed shes got poor taste in men he said then laughed that wasnt meant to sound that way i didnt mean to imply that id be a particularly good choice for her just that she seems destined to end up with men who treat her badly as if shes constantly reliving some sort of relationship trying to get it right and failing every time she cant break the cycle i know what you mean said sandra she told me once that despite everything shes done she doesnt have a lot of confidence in herself much selfesteem i dont know they finished their meals put their plates aside and banks lit another cigarette sandra declined his offer of one while she was at the ladies he poured himself more wine and debated how to broach the subject that was on his mind as she walked back across the restaurant he noticed she was wearing jeans under her various flowing layers of clothing and her figure still looked good his heart gave a little lurch and another part of him stirred unbidden sandra looked at her watch after she sat down i cant stay very much longer she said i promised to meet some friends at half ten party mmm something like that you never did that up in eastvale things have changed since then besides eastvale closes down at nine oclock this is london maybe we never should have left banks said it seemed like a good idea at the time i mean lets be honest i was getting pretty burned out i thought a quieter life might bring us closer together shows how much i know it was nothing to do with that alan it wouldnt have mattered where we were even when you were there you were always somewhere else what do you mean think about it most of the time you were out working the rest of the time you were thinking about work you just werent at home the damnedest thing is you never even realized it you thought everything was just hunkydory it was wasnt it until you met sean sean has nothing to do with this leave him out of it nothing would suit me better they fell silent sandra seemed restless as if she wanted to get something off her chest before she left stay for a coffee at least banks said and well leave sean out of it she managed a thin smile all right ill have a cappuccino and please dont tell me i didnt drink that in eastvale either you cant get a bloody cappuccino in eastvale you can now that new fancy coffee place opposite the community center it wasnt open when you left sells latte too so the norths getting sophisticated after all is it oh yes people come from miles around to sell their sheep i remember yorkshire never really suited you did it sandra shook her head i tried alan honestly i did for your sake for mine for brian and tracys i tried but in the end i suppose youre right im a bigcity girl take it or leave it banks filled his wineglass as sandras cappuccino arrived ive applied for another job he told her finally she paused with the frothing cup halfway to her lips youre not leaving the force no not that banks laughed i suppose the force will always be with me sandra groaned but ill most likely be leaving yorkshire in fact theres a good chance i could be based down here ive applied for the national crime squad sandra frowned and sipped some coffee i read about that in the papers a while ago sort of an english fbi they said what brought all this about i thought at least you were happy up to your knees in sheep droppings was it jimmy riddle banks scraped his cigarette around the rim of the ashtray a lot of reasons he said and jimmy riddle was a big one im not so sure about that now but maybe ive run my natural course up there too im just a bit behind you thats all i dont know i think i need something new a challenge and maybe im a bigcity boy at heart too sandra laughed well good luck i hope you get what you want it could mean travel too europe hunting down dangerous criminals in the dordogne good for you banks paused to stub out his cigarette and take another sip of wine here goes nothing he thought weve been apart about a year now right sandra frowned thats right its not that long is it when you think about it people give up things for a while then go back to them like smoking what on earth are you talking about maybe that wasnt a good analogy i was never much good at this sort of thing what im saying is that people sometimes separate for a year or more do other things live in other places then you know they get back together once theyve got it out of their system people can be an addiction like cigarettes but better for you you find you cant give them up back together yes not like before of course it never could be like before weve both changed too much for that but better it could be better it might mean you coming up to yorkshire for a little while just until things get sorted but i promise and i mean this that even if the ncs doesnt work out ill get a transfer ive still got contacts at the met theres bound to be something for a copper with my experience wait a minute alan let me get this straight youre suggesting that i come up and live with you in that tiny cottage until you can get a job down here yes of course if you dont want to if youd rather just wait until i get something whatever then i can understand that i know its too small for two really i mean you could come for the occasional weekend we could see each other have dates like when we were first together sandra shook her head slowly what you dont like my idea alan you havent heard a word ive said have you i know things got bad i know you had to leave i dont blame you for that now what im saying is that we can make a go of it again it could be different this time no what do you mean no means no okay banks emptied his glass and poured some more there wasnt much left in the second carafe by now i suppose it must have been a shock coming out of the blue like that why dont you at least take some time to think about it about us i apologize for springing it on you like this you take the opportunities where and when you find them cant you hear what im saying alan n o no were not moving back in together neither up in yorkshire nor down here in london when i first moved out ill admit i didnt know what would become of us how i would feel in a years time and you know now yes so what is it im sorry alan jesus you have to go and make this so bloody difficult dont you she took her glasses off and wiped her eyes with the backs of her hands i dont understand alan were not getting back together not now not next month not ever what i want to tell you is that i want a divorce sean and i want to get married banks looked in the large tilted mirror and saw short black hair still wet with beads of rain which also glistened on the shoulders of his black leather jacket beyond the array of whiskey bottles he saw a face that was perhaps too lean and sharply angled to be called handsome and two bright slightly outoffocus blue eyes looking into themselves he saw the kind of bloke you gave a wide berth unless you were looking for trouble around him life went on the couple beside him argued in low tense voices a drunk rambled on to himself about manchester united noisy kids fed the machines with money and the machines beeped and honked with gratitude the air was dense with cigarette smoke and tinged with the smell of hops and barley barmen dashed about filling shouted orders standing impatiently as the optics dispensed their miserly measures of rum or vodka one of them shaking drops of roses lime juice from a nozzled bottle into a pint of lager muttered jesus christ hurry up i could piss faster than this banks took a long swig of beer and lit another cigarette marveling for the umpteenth time in the last hour or so at how calm he felt he hadnt felt this calm in ages certainly not in his last few months with sandra after she had dropped her bombshell earlier in the evening she had dashed out of the restaurant in tears leaving banks alone with his wine and the bill the whole place had seemed to fall silent as the pressure mounted in his ears and he felt pins and needles prickle over his entire body divorce marry sean had she really said that she had he realized after he had paid up and wobbled down the rainlashed streets of camden town into the first pub he saw and now here he was at the bar on his second pint wondering where were the anger the pain the rage he was supposed to feel he was stunned gobsmacked knocked for six as anyone would be after hearing such news but he didnt feel as if the bottom had fallen out of his world why the answer when it came was so simple he could have kicked himself it was because sandra was right they werent going to get back together hed been deluding himself for long enough and reality had finally broken through he had simply been going through the motions he thought he was supposed to go through when it really came down to it neither of them really wanted to get back together it was over and this was one sure way of bringing about closure divorce marriage to sean sure banks knew you cant write off twenty years of marriage completely and there would always be a residue of affection even of love and perhaps of pain but and this was the important thing it was finally over there would be no more ambiguity no more vain hope no more childish illusions that some external change a new place to live a new job would make everything all right again now they could both walk away from the dead thing that was their marriage and get on with their lives there would be sadness yes theyd have regrets perhaps a few as the song went they would also always be tied together by brian and tracy but he realized as he looked in the pub mirror at his own reflection that if he was to be really honest with himself right now and this was the moment for it then he should be celebrating rather than drowning his sorrows tomorrow he would phone sandra and tell her to go ahead with the divorce to marry sean that it was fine but tonight he would celebrate freedom what he really felt was relief the scales had fallen from his eyes because there was no hope there was hope and so he raised the rest of his pint in celebration and drew one or two curious looks when he toasted the face in the mirror rain had smudged the neon and car lights all over the road like a finger painting as banks walked a little unsteadily looking for the next pub he could hear the sound of distant fireworks and see rockets flash across the sky he didnt want to go back to the lonely hotel room just yet didnt feel tired enough despite what felt like a long day the next pub he found was less crowded and he managed to find a seat in the corner next to a table of pensioners well into their cups he knew he was a bit drunk but he also knew he was well within the limits of reason in his thoughts and so he found himself thinking about what had transpired that day how uneasy he felt about it all especially about his meeting with emily riddle at barry cloughs villa the more he thought about that the more out of kilter everything seemed emily had been high that much was obvious whether she was on coke or heroin he couldnt be certain but the white powder on her upper lip certainly indicated one or the other coke he would guess given her jerkiness and her mood swings she had probably been smoking marijuana too craig newton had also said she was really high when he saw her in the street the time cloughs minders beat him up so was she a junkie or an occasional user sometimes the one shaded right into the other then there was barry clough himself the expensive villa the gold the furnishings the armani suit the guns that he was a businessman was all anyone would say about him and that was a term that covered a multitude of sins what did he really have to do with the music business what sort of party had he met emily at that he was a crook of some kind banks had no doubt but as to what kind of criminal activity or activities were his bent he didnt know how did he make his money drugs perhaps porn possibly either way he was bad news for emily no matter how much of a ball she thought she was having now and he was even worse news for jimmy riddles career prospects banks hadnt felt good about walking away from cloughs house like that just as he hadnt felt good about not taking on the minder at the gate under normal circumstances he would have gone in there with authority with teeth but he was acting as a private citizen so he had to take whatever they dished out he was also committed to acting discreetly and who knew what damaging revelations might come out into the light of day if he upset clough part of him perhaps due to the overstimulation of alcohol wanted to go back there and ruffle cloughs feathers antagonize him into making some sort of move but he knew enough not to give in to the desire not tonight at any rate instead he called upon the gods of common sense finished his pint and hurried out into the street to find a taxi a good nights sleep was what he needed now and tomorrow would bring what it would tomorrow came too early it was am by the digital clock on bankss bedside table when the telephone rang groaning and rubbing the sleep from his eyes he groped for it in the dark and finally grasped the handset banks he grunted im sorry to bother you at this hour sir said the desk clerk but theres a young lady in the lobby she seems very distraught she says shes your daughter and she insists on seeing you in bankss halfasleep alcoholsodden consciousness the only thought that came clear out of all that was that tracy was there and she was in trouble perhaps she had been talking to sandra and was upset about the impending divorce send her up he said then he got out of bed turned on the table lamp and pulled on his clothes his head ached and his mouth was dry figuring it would take tracy a minute or so to get up to his thirdfloor room he nipped into the bathroom and swallowed a few paracetamols from his traveling medicine kit along with a couple of glasses of water when he had done that he filled and plugged in the little kettle and put a teabag in the pot by the time the soft knock came at his door banks was beginning to realize there was something wrong with the picture he had envisaged tracy knew where he would be of course he had given her the name of the hotel before she left for paris with damon but it was still only saturday night or sunday morning so shouldnt they both still be in paris when he opened the door emily riddle stood there can i come in she said banks stepped aside and locked the door behind her emily was wearing a black evening gown loosefitting cut low over her small breasts and slit up one side to her thigh her bare arms were covered with goose pimples her blond hair was messily piled on her head the remains of the sophisticated style disarrayed by the wind and rain she looked like a naughty debutante a twentyfiveyearold naughty debutante at that but more remarkable than all that were the tear down the right shoulder of her dress and the question mark of dried blood at the corner of her mouth there was also a weal on her cheek that looked as if it might turn into a bruise her eyes looked heavy halfclosed im so tired she said then she tossed her handbag on the bed and flopped into the armchair the kettle came to a boil and banks made some tea emily took the hot cup from him and held it to herself as if she needed the heat her eyes opened a little more suddenly it seemed like a very small room banks perched on the edge of the bed what is it he asked what happened emily who did this to you emily started crying banks found her a tissue from the bathroom and she wiped her eyes with it they were bloodshot and pink around the rims i must look a sight she said have you got a cigarette please banks gave her one and took one himself after she had taken a few drags and sipped some tea she seemed to compose herself a bit more what happened banks asked again did clough do this i want to go home will you take me home please in the morning tell me what happened to you her eyes started to close and she leaned back in the chair with her legs stretched out and ankles crossed banks worried that she would slide right onto the floor but she managed to stay put she looked at banks through narrowed eyes and blew some smoke out of her nose it made her cough which spoiled the sophisticated effect she had probably been aiming for tell me what happened he asked her again i dont want to talk about it i ran in the rain found a taxi and came here but you threw the address away i can remember things like that i only have to look once like my mother she finished her cigarette and seemed to doze off for a moment did clough do this to you was it him she pretended to sleep emily uhhuh she said without opening her eyes was it clough i dont want to go back there i cant go back there will you take me home tomorrow ill take you home tomorrow can i stay here tonight yes banks stood up i can get a room for you i dont think theyre full no her eyes opened wide and she jerked forward so quickly she spilled tea over the front of her dress if it burned her she didnt seem to feel it no she said again i dont want to be by myself im scared let me stay here with you please christ almighty thought banks if anyone found out about this his career wouldnt be worth twopence but what else could he do she was upset and she was scared something bad had happened to her he couldnt simply abandon her okay he said take the bed and ill sleep in the chair come on he leaned forward to help her up she seemed listless when she finally got out of the chair she stumbled forward against his chest and put her arms around his neck have you got anything to smoke she said im coming down i need something to soften the edges i think somebody put something in my drink he could feel her warm body touching his under the thin material of the dress and he remembered the images he had seen of her naked he felt ashamed of his erection and hoped she didnt notice but as he disentangled her arms and moved away she gave him a cockeyed mischievous smile and said i told you before you were a liar she did something with the straps of her dress and it slipped off her shoulders over her waist to the floor she was wearing white bikini panties and nothing more her nipples stood out dark and hard on her small white breasts the black spider tattoo between her navel ring and the elastic of her panties seemed to be moving as if it were spinning a web for crying out loud said banks picking up the bedspread and swathing it around her she giggled and fell on the bed of course you dont have anything to smoke she said youre a copper detective chief inspector bonks no he doesnt yes he does no he doesnt she giggled again then turned on her side and put her thumb in her mouth drawing up her legs in the fetal position hold me she said taking her thumb out for a moment please come and hold me banks shook his head and whispered no there was no way he was getting in that bed with her no matter how much she said she was in need of comfort if he thought about it he should probably throw her out and tear up the sheets but he couldnt do that instead he managed to pull some more blankets over her and she offered no resistance for a while she seemed to be muttering and murmuring as best she could with her thumb back in her mouth then he heard her start snoring softly banks knew there would be no more sleep for him tonight in the morning he would go to oxford street when the shops opened and buy her some clothes then they would take the first train back to eastvale he would drive her to her fathers house and there he would leave her leave them all to sort it out his job would be over but as he sat in the chair and smoked another cigarette listening to the wind and rain rattling the window and to emilys ragged snoring he couldnt help but mull the situation over it was all wrong he was a copper a serious offense had been committed the law had been broken he should be doing something not sitting in the armchair smoking as his chief constables sixteenyearold daughter slept in his bed practically starkers with her thumb in her mouth to all intents and purposes nothing but a child in a womans body three fiftytwo a long wait until dawn he glanced through the curtains and saw a flash of white moon through the gray wisps of cloud emily stirred turned over farted once and started snoring again banks reached for his walkman on the table beside him and put in the dawn upshaw tape songs about sleep come sleep and with thy sweet deceiving lock me in delight awhile not much hope of that banks thought not after the day he had just been through the charlie courage murder occurred in early december about a month after banks had delivered emily riddle to her fathers house a little battered and shopsoiled but not too much the worse for wear judging by her silence on the train journey back to yorkshire he imagined she might lie low for a while before taking on the world again in the meantime banks had been preoccupied with major changes at eastvale divisional headquarters the county force had been reorganized from seven divisions into just three and eastvale was the new headquarters of the large western division which took in just about the entire county west of the a to the lancashire border and from the durham border in the north to the border with west yorkshire in the south there were vast areas of wilderness and moorland including most of the yorkshire dales national park and the main occupations were the service industry tourism agriculture and a smattering of light industry there were no major urban areas but a number of big towns such as harrogate ripon richmond skipton and eastvale itself there was of course plenty of crime and in keeping with its new status the eastvale station had been extended into the adjoining building where vic mansons fingerprints unit scenesofcrime computers and photography departments had all set up shop renovations were still going on and the place was filled with noise and dust while the section stations would continue to police their areas as before indeed they were to be given even more autonomy eastvale was now to be responsible for most of the criminal investigation within the new western division nobody was sure yet how many cid officers or crime management personnel as some now liked to call them they would end up with or where they would all be put but staffing increases had already begun one of the first moves that the director of human resources millicent cummings had made was to transfer detective sergeant annie cabbot to the new team millie told banks that she thought annie had worked well with him on their previous case no matter what chief constable riddle thought of its messy outcome and that as annie was going for her inspectors boards as soon as she could the experience would be good for her millie of course along with riddle and everyone else didnt know about bankss affair with annie and banks could hardly say anything now this was a good opportunity for her to get back in the swing of things and he certainly wasnt going to stand in her way annie was a good detective and if she could handle working with banks he could at least try to accommodate her the county also had a new assistant chief constable crime in the shape of ron mclaughlin known jokingly as red ron because he leaned more to the left than most senior policemen acc mclaughlin was known to be a hard but fair man one who believed in using his officers abilities to the fullest and he was also rumored to enjoy a wee dram of malt every now and then it was a misty drizzling day what the locals called mizzling when riddle got the chance to make good on his promise to banks over the last year or so all serious crimes in the division that couldnt be handled by detective superintendent gristhorpe detective sergeant hatchley and whichever dcs happened to be assigned to eastvale divisional headquarters at the time had been passed on to other divisions or to the regional crime squad leaving banks free to devote all his duty hours to paperwork and administration since he had done riddle the big favor of bringing emily back home since the big changes around the station and since things had finally come to an end with sandra the thought of moving from his gratly cottage and starting a new job with the ncs had begun to lose its appeal and banks had withdrawn his application eastvale was starting to seem like a good bet again and it was where he wanted to be despite the drizzle and the filthy gray sky banks felt in a buoyant optimistic mood he was reading a report on the sudden increase of car theft in rural areas and in need of a break he went to stand by the window to smoke a proscribed cigarette and look down on the market square in the late afternoon the renovators were mercifully silent no doubt planning their next major assault and bankss radio played quietly in the background prokofievs piano concerto no the eastvale christmas lights turned on in the middle of november by some thirdrate television personality banks had never heard of made a pretty sight outside his window hanging across market street and over the square like a bright lattice of jewels soon theyd be putting up the huge christmas tree by the market cross and the church choir would be out singing carols at lunchtime and early evening collecting for charity brian thought he would be busy with the band over the holidays but tracy had phoned the previous day and promised to spend christmas with her father before heading down to london to see her mother on boxing day banks had never been much of a fan of christmas far too many holiday seasons spent working and witnessing the gaudy excess of suicides and domestic murders that peaked around that time of year had taken care of that but this called for celebration this year he would make an effort buy a small tree presents put up some decorations cook christmas dinner last year had been a complete washout he had turned down all offers of meals drinks and parties from friends and colleagues and spent the entire holiday alone in the eastvale semi he had once shared with sandra wallowing in his own misery and keeping up his maintenance buzz with liberal tots of whisky brian and tracy had both phoned of course and he had managed to bluff his way past any worries they might have had about him but there was no denying it had been a grim time this year would be different delia smith had a book about cooking for christmas he remembered perhaps he would go to waterstones and buy it before going home the telephone brought him back to his desk banks here chief inspector banks my names collaton detective inspector mike collaton im calling from market harborough leicestershire constabulary i just called your county headquarters and they put me on to you what can i do for you earlier today a motorist stopped by the roadside near here and nipped down a lane into the woods for a piss he found a body go on said banks tapping his pen on the desk still wondering what the connection was its one of yours thought you might be interested one of my what local villains bloke by the name of charles courage same as the brewery lived at number seventeen cutpurse lane eastvale he laughed sounds like it could hardly be a more appropriate address going by his record jesus christ charlie courage dutch as his cronies jokingly called him on account of that was about the only courage he ever exhibited charlie courage had been a thorn in the side of eastvale division for years in truth he was a petty villain a minor player but around eastvale he was still a big fish in a small pond charlie courage had done a little bit of everything except anything that involved violence or sex from handling stolen goods to sheepstealing when it was worth stealing them you had to give charlie his due he was a character two or three years ago he used to have a stall in eastvale market banks remembered right in front of the police station where he blithely sold videos and cds that in all likelihood had fallen off the back of a lorry while questioning him about a local breakin once banks had even bought the academy of ancient musics cd of mozarts c minor mass for a bargain at twice the price he didnt ask where it had come from to his credit charlie had also acted as police informer on a number of occasions rumor had it that he had been going straight lately youve heard of him di collaton went on ive heard of him what happened shot looks like the weapon used was a shotgun made a real mess anyway any chance it was accidental or selfinflicted not unless he shot himself in the chest then got up after he was dead and hid the weapon we cant find any sign of it are you sure its charlie what on earth was he doing all the way down there its not like charlie to leave his parish im afraid we cant shine any light on that just yet either but its definitely him i got the id from fingerprints seems he did two years once for something involving sheep ive heard about you lot up there and your sheep some sort of unspeakable deed was it banks laughed stealing them actually they used to be worth a bit you might remember as for the other i cant say ive any idea what charlie got up to in his spare time far as i know he was single so he could please himself anything more you can tell me not much ive checked around and it seems he doesnt have any living relatives sounds like charlie i dont think he ever did anyway i thought id ask you to have a look around his house if you would see if theres anything there save my lads some legwork were a bit shortstaffed down here arent we all sure ill have a look what about his car no sign of any car maybe youd like to come down here tomorrow morning see the scene toss a few ideas around that sort of thing ive a feeling that if there are any answers to be found theyre probably at your end the postmortems tomorrow afternoon by the way okay said banks in the meantime ill go have a quick poke around charlies place right now and see about organizing a thorough search later if hes dead i wont have to worry about a warrant ill drive down tomorrow morning banks took collatons directions to the fairfield road police station in market harborough then hung up and went into the main cid office since the reorganization began they had been assigned three new dcs and were promised three more dc gavin rickerd was a spotty nondescript sort of lad given to anoraks and parkas banks couldnt help feeling he must have been a trainspotter in a previous lifetime if not in this one kevin templeton was more flash a bit of a jackthelad but he got things done and he was surprisingly good with people especially kids the third addition was dc winsome jackman who hailed from a village in the cockpit mountains high above montego bay jamaica why she had wanted to leave there for the unpredictable summers and miserable winters of north yorkshire was beyond bankss ken at least superficially when it came right down to it though he imagined that a village in the jamaican mountains was probably no place for a bright and beautiful woman like winsome to forge ahead in a career why she hadnt become a model instead of joining the police was also beyond banks she had the figure for it and her face showed traces of her maroon heritage in the high cheekbones and dark ebony coloring she could certainly give naomi campbell a run for her money and from what banks had read about the supermodel in the papers winsome was a far nicer person some of the lads called her losesome because of the time back in uniform when she had chased and caught a mugger in a shopping center only to have him then slip out of her grasp and escape she took it goodnaturedly and gave as good as she got you had to when you were the only black woman in the division as it turned out everyone was out of the office except kevin templeton and annie who looked up from her computer monitor as banks entered afternoon she said flashing him a quick smile annie had a hell of a smile though not much more than a twitch of the right corner of her mouth near the small mole accompanied by a quick blaze of light from her almond eyes it was dazzling banks felt his heart lurch just a little god he hoped this working together wasnt going to be too difficult see what you can dig up on a local villain called charlie courage he said then more or less on impulse he added fancy a ride down to market harborough tomorrow he found himself holding his breath after the words were out almost wishing he could take them back why not she said after a short pause itll make a nice break much on nothing the lads cant handle on their own kevin templeton grunted from his corner okay ill pick you up here around nine back in his office banks found himself hoping that things worked out with annie on the job he liked working with female detectives and he still missed his old dc susan gay with all her uncertainties and sharp edges when he had worked with annie before he had come to value her neartelepathic communication skills and the way she could mix logic and intuition in her unique style of thinking he had also cherished her touch and her laughter but that was another matter one he couldnt let himself dwell on anymore or could he he left the office in a good mood for the moment riddle had proved true to his word and banks finally had a case he might be able to get his teeth into it was di collatons call of course but collaton had asked for help right off the bat which led banks to think that he probably didnt want to spend too long away from hearth and home tracking the roots of the crime up in dreary yorkshire especially with christmas being so close well good for him banks thought cooperation between the forces and all that his loss was bankss gain it was after five when banks pulled up behind a blue metro in front of charlie courages oneuponedown cutpurse lane was a cramped ragbag of terraced cottages behind the community center dating from the eighteenth century for the most part the mean little hovels had privies out back and no front gardens during the yuppie craze for bijou a few years ago a number of young couples had bought cottages on cutpurse lane and installed bathrooms and dormer windows as far as banks knew charlie courage had lived there for years whatever charlie had done with his illgotten gains he certainly hadnt invested them in improving his living conditions it was a syndrome banks had seen before in even more successful petty crooks than charlie he had even known one bigtime criminal who must have brought in seven figures a year easily yet still lived hardly a notch above squalor in the east end he wondered what on earth they used the money they stole for except in some cases to support mammoth drug habits did they give it to charity use it to buy their parents that dream house they had always yearned for people had odd priorities charlie courage though had not been a drug addict was not known for his charity and he didnt have any living relatives a mystery then first banks knocked on the neighbors door which was opened by a short stocky man in a wrinkled faun vnecked pullover who looked unnervingly like hitler even down to the little mustache and the mad gleam in his eyes he stood in the doorway the sound of the television coming from the room behind him banks showed his identification knightley the man said kenneth knightley please come in out of the rain banks accepted his invitation the drizzle was the kind that immediately seemed to get right through your raincoat and your skin all the way to your bones banks followed him into a small neat living room with rosepatterned wallpaper and a couple of framed local landscapes hanging above the tile mantelpiece banks recognized gratly falls just outside his own cottage and a romantic watercolor of the ruins of devraulx abbey up lyndgarth way a fire blazed in the hearth making the room a bit too hot and stuffy for bankss liking he could already smell the steam rising from his raincoat its about your neighbor charles courage he said when did you last see him i dont have much to do with him said knightley except to say hello to like he always keeps to himself and ive not been the most sociable of fellows since edie died if truth be told he smiled edie didnt like him though thought he was a wrong un why whats happened im afraid mr courage is dead it looks as if hes been murdered knightley paled murdered where i mean not no not next door some distance away actually down leicester way leicester but he never went anywhere one time i did talk to him i remember him telling me youd never catch him going to torremolinos or alicante for his holidays yorkshire was good enough for him charlie didnt like foreign places or foreigners and they began at ripon as far as he was concerned banks smiled ive met a few people like that myself but one way or another he did end up in leicestershire dead thats probably what killed him then finding himself in leicestershire knightley paused and ran his hand across his brow sorry i shouldnt be so flippant a mans dead after all i dont see how i can help you though you said you saw him last a couple of days ago can you be more precise let me think it was early sunday afternoon it must have been then because i was just coming back from the oak i always go there on a sunday lunchtime for a game of dominoes about what time would this be just after two i cant be doing with all these new hours allday opening and whatnot i stick to the old times how did he seem same as usual a bit shifty said hello and that was that shifty he always looked shifty as if hed just that minute done something illegal and wasnt quite sure hed got away with it yet i know what you mean said banks charlie courage usually had just done something illegal so there was nothing odd or different about his behavior at all nothing was he alone far as i could tell coming or going come again was he just arriving home or leaving oh i see he was going out car aye hes got a blue metro its usually just a minute knightley stood up and went to the curtain which he pulled back a few inches aye there it is he said pointing parked right outside banks saw the car in front of his and made a mental note to have it searched did you see or hear anyone with him in the house over the last few days no im sorry i cant be much help like i said there was nothing unusual at all he went off to work then he came home quiet as a mouse work charlie oh aye didnt you know hed got a job as a night watchman at that new business park down ripon road daleview i think its called i know the one business park another to add to bankss long list of oxymorons along with military intelligence that was an interesting piece of news anyway charlie courage with a job a night watchman no less banks wondered if his employers knew of his past it was worth looking into is there anything else you can help me with mr knightley i dont think there is and its no use asking mrs ford on the other side shes deaf as a post i dont suppose you have a key to mr courages house do you he asked key no like i said we didnt do much more than pass the time of day together out of politenesss sake banks stood up im going to have to have a good look around the place if theres no key ill have to break in somehow so dont be alarmed if you hear a few strange noises next door knightley nodded right right you are charlie courage murdered bloody hell whod credit it banks walked around the back of the terrace block to see if he could find an easy way into charlies place a narrow cobbled alley ran past charlies backyard each house had a high wall and a tall wooden gate some of the walls were topped with broken glass and some of the gates swung loose on their hinges banks lifted the catch and pushed at charlies gate it had scratched and faded green paint and one of the rusty hinges had broken making it grate against the flagstone path as he opened it it wasnt much of a backyard and most of it was taken up by a murky puddle that immediately found its way through his shoes first out of habit banks tried the doorknob the door opened perhaps charlie hadnt had time to lock up properly before being abducted banks thought as he made his way inside the dark house he found a light switch on the wall to his right and clicked it on he was in the kitchen nothing much there except for a pile of dirty dishes waiting to be washed they never would be now he walked through to the living room which was tidy and showed no signs of a struggle noting the newlooking television and dvd setup not what you could afford on a night watchmans salary banks got some idea of what charlie had done with his money he went upstairs there were two small bedrooms a bathroom with a stained tub and a tiny wc with a tenyearold playboy magazine on the floor and a copy of harold robbinss the carpetbaggers resting on the roll of toilet paper one bedroom was empty except for a few cardboard boxes filled with magazines mostly soft porn and secondhand paperbacks and the other charlies revealed only an unmade bed and a few clothes downstairs in one of the sideboard drawers banks found the only items of interest the title deed to the house charlies driving license a checkbook and a bankbook that indicated charlie had made five cash deposits of each over the past month in addition to what seemed to be his regular paycheck a thousand quid interesting banks thought that would at least account for the new tv and dvd setup what had the crooked little devil been up to and had it got him killed wednesday morning dawned every bit as dismal as tuesday it was still dark when banks drove into eastvale sipping hot black coffee from a specially designed carrying mug on the way the other cid officers were already in the office when he got there and ds hatchley in particular looked downhearted that he had missed the opportunity of a day trip to leicestershire or perhaps he was jealous that banks had annies company he gave banks the kind of bitter defeated look that said rank pulled the birds every time and what was a poor sergeant to do if only he knew youll be driving i suppose annie said when they got out back to the car park that was another thing banks appreciated about annie she was a quick learner with a good memory it was unusual for a dci to drive his own car having a driver was one of the perks of his position but banks liked to drive even in this weather he liked to be in control every time he let someone else drive him no matter how good they were he felt restless and irritated by any minor mistakes they made constantly wanting to get his own foot on the clutch or the brake it seemed much simpler to do the driving himself so that was what he did annie understood that and didnt question his idiosyncrasy banks slipped a tape of mozart wind quintets in the cavaliers sound system as he turned out of the car park mmm thats nice said annie i like a bit of mozart then she settled back into the seat and lapsed into silence it was another thing banks liked about her he remembered the way she seemed so centered and selfcontained the way she could appear comfortable and relaxed in the most awkward positions at ease with silence it had also taken him a while to get used to her complete lack of deference to senior ranks especially his as well as to her rather free and easy style of dress learned from growing up in an artists commune surrounded by bearded artistic types such as her painter father ray cabbot today she was wearing red winklepicker boots that came up just above her ankles black jeans and a fair isle sweater under her loose suede jacket rather conservative for annie how are you liking it at eastvale banks asked as they joined the stream of traffic on the a hard to say yet ive hardly got my feet under the desk what about the traveling takes me about threequarters of an hour each way thats not bad she glanced sideways at him its about the same for you as i remember true have you thought of selling the harkside house ive thought of it but i dont think i will not just yet wait and see what happens banks remembered annies tiny cramped cottage at the center of a labyrinth of narrow winding streets in the village of harkside he remembered his first visit there when she had asked him on impulse for dinner and cooked a vegetarian pasta dish as they drank wine and listened to emmylou harris remembered standing in the backyard for an afterdinner smoke putting his arm around her shoulders and feeling the thin bra strap despite all the warning signs he also remembered kissing the little rose tattoo just above her breast their bodies sweaty and tired the unfamiliar street sounds the following morning he negotiated his way from the a to the m lorries churned up oily rain that coated his windscreen before the wipers could get through it there were more long delays at roadwork signs where nobody was working a maniac in a red bmw flashed his lights about a foot from bankss rear end and then when banks changed lanes to accommodate him zoomed off at well over a ton what did you find out about charlie he asked annie when he had got into the rhythm of motorway driving annies eyes were closed she didnt open them not much probably not more than you know already tell me anyway he was born charles douglas courage in february you dont have to go that far back i find it helps it makes him one of the generation born immediately after the war when the men came home randy and ready to get on with their lives hed have been ten in too young for elvis perhaps but twenty in and probably just raring for all the sex drugs and rock and roll you lot enjoyed in your youth maybe that was where he got his start in crime banks risked a glance away from the road at her she still had her eyes closed but there was a little smile on her face charlie wasnt into dealing drugs he said maybe it was the rock and roll then he was first arrested for distribution of stolen goods in august to wit longplaying records sergeant peppers lonely hearts club band to be exact stolen directly from a factory just outside manchester a music lover our charlie he said carry on after that comes a string of minor offenses shoplifting theft of a car stereo then in he was arrested for theft of livestock to be exact seventeen sheep from a farm out relton way did eighteen months conclusion hes a thief hell steal anything even if it walks on four legs and since then he appears to have gone straight helped eastvale police out on a number of occasions mostly minor stuff he found out about through his old contacts got a list dc templetons working on it okay said banks what next a number of odd jobs most recently working as a night watchman at the daleview business park been there since september hmm they must be a trusting lot at daleview said banks i think one of us might pay them a visit tomorrow anything else thats about it single never married mother and father deceased no brothers or sisters funny isnt it what is annie stirred in the car seat to face him a smalltime villain like charlie courage getting murdered so far from home we dont know where he was murdered yet an inspired guess you dont shoot someone in the chest with a shotgun and then drive him around bleeding in a car for three hours do you not without making a mess you dont you know it strikes me that charlie might have been taken on the long ride the long ride banks glanced at her she looked puzzled never heard of the long ride annie shook her head cant say as i have just a minute a slowmoving local delivery van in front of them was sending up so much spray that the windscreen wipers couldnt keep up with it carefully banks changed lanes and overtook it the long ride he said once he could see again lets say youve upset someone nasty youve had your fingers in the till or youve been telling tales out of school and hes decided he has to do away with you right okay hes got a number of options all with their own pros and cons and this is one of them what he does or rather what his hired hands do is they pick you up and take you for a ride a long ride its got two main functions the first is that it confuses the local police by taking the crime away from the patch that gave rise to it follow and the second let me guess go on to scare the shit out of him right lets say youre driven from eastvale to market harborough you know exactly whats going to happen at the end of the journey they make sure you have no doubt about that whatsoever that theres going to be no reprieve no commuting of the death sentence so youve got three hours or thereabouts to contemplate your life and its imminent and inevitable end an end you can also expect to be painful and brutal cruel bastards its a cruel world said banks anyway from their perspective it acts as a deterrent to other wouldbe thieves or snitches and remember its not as if were dealing with lilywhites here the victim is usually a smalltime villain whos done something to upset a more powerful villain charlie courage smalltime villain fits him to a tee exactly except that he was supposed to be going straight and there arent any major crime bosses in eastvale maybe he wasnt going as straight as we thought maybe he was just avoiding drawing our attention and they dont have to be that big im not talking about the mafia or the triads here there are plenty of minor villains who think life is pretty cheap maybe charlie fell afoul of one of them think about it charlie worked as a night watchman he put a thousand quid in the bank above and beyond his wages over the past month what does that tell you annie that he was either selling information blackmailing someone or he was being paid off to look the other way right and he must have been playing way out of his league maybe well get a better idea when we talk to the manager up there tomorrow nearly there now banks negotiated his way around leicester toward market harborough about thirteen miles south when they got to the high street there it was almost noon and it took banks another ten minutes to find the police station before they got out of the car banks turned to annie are we going to be okay he asked what do you mean you know what i mean this working together she flashed him a smile well we seem to be doing all right so far dont we she said and slipped out of the car di collaton turned out to be a big bear of a man with thinning gray hair a red face and a slow country manner a year or so away from retirement banks guessed no wonder he didnt want to get involved in a murder inquiry he looked at his watch and said have you two eaten at all they shook their heads he grabbed his raincoat from the stand in the corner of his office i know a place they followed him to a small pub about two streets away judging by the smiles and hellos exchanged collaton was wellknown there he led them to a corner table which gave a little privacy then offered the first round of drinks annie asked for a tomato juice though banks knew she enjoyed beer he ordered a pint of the local best bitter a fire burned in the hearth and christmas decorations festooned the walls and ceiling apart from the buzz of conversation around the bar the place was quiet which was the way banks liked his pubs and all too rare these days as was annies habit in pubs she seemed to mold herself to the hard chair and stretch her legs out crossing them at the ankles di collaton raised his eyebrows at her red winklepickers but said nothing after banks had ordered game pie on collatons recommendation and annie being a vegetarian went for the ploughmans lunch he lit what he realized with some surprise was his first cigarette of the day we dont get a lot of murders down here said collaton after his first sip that didnt surprise banks from what he had seen he supposed market harborough to be a bit smaller than eastvale maybe seventeen or eighteen thousand people and charlie courage was eastvales first murder victim of the entire year so far in december no less any idea why they might have chosen your patch he asked collaton shook his head not really its handy for the m he said but a bit off the beaten track if they were taking him somewhere and he got troublesome any witnesses nobody saw or heard a thing its out husbands bosworth way toward the motorway and at this time of year theres nobody around more in summer tourist season like banks nodded same as eastvale any physical evidence tire tracks thats about all anything interesting or unusual on his person just the usual except his wallet was missing i doubt robbery was the motive banks mused maybe a london mugger might blow away someone with a shotgun but not in some leafy midlands lane my thoughts exactly said collaton i thought maybe theyd taken it to help keep his identity unknown a bit longer maybe they didnt know hed got form and wed find out that way possibly had he been up to anything lately we dont know yet said banks rumor has it hes been going straight had a job as a night watchman we know he made five cash deposits of two hundred quid each over the past month though and i doubt that he came by the money honestly their food arrived collaton was right about the game pie annie nibbled at her cheese and pickled onion collaton kept looking at her out of the corner of his eye when he thought no one noticed at first banks thought he was simply puzzled by her as people often were then he realized the dirty old bugger fancied her and him old enough to be her father suddenly banks felt himself struck almost as physically as by a blow by the memory of emily riddle in his hotel room not so much by her white and slender nakedness the spider tattoo or the feel of her body pressing against his as by her torn dress her fear the little question mark of blood and barry clough why on earth hadnt he followed up on that the next morning he had simply gone out to oxford street as soon as the shops opened and not being skilled at shopping for womens clothing bought her a tracksuit because it seemed easiest though he had questioned her about the previous night she had given away nothing maintaining a surly silence all the way home did she even remember how she got to his hotel room and her awkward attempt at seducing him when he had driven her home from the station and left her with her parents she had given him a look he found hard to interpret sad yes partly and perhaps also a little letdown defeated a little hurt but not completely without affection a sort of complicit recognition that they had shared something together been through an adventure banks had decided on the way that he had no reason to tell riddle what happened down there if emily wanted to do so that was fine but his part of the bargain was over she was riddles problem now still it had gnawed at him over the past few weeks clough especially perhaps if he had time over the next couple of days he could make a few discreet inquiries of old friends on the met see if clough had form find out what his particular line of work was dirty dick burgess ought to know he had been working with one of the toplevel criminal intelligence departments for a while now but riddle had asked banks to be discreet and sometimes when you set things in motion you couldnt always stop them as easily as you wanted to and you didnt know in which direction they would spin that was bankss problem as riddle had told him more than once he had never learned when to leave well enough alone sir banks snapped back from a long distance when he felt annies elbow in his ribs sorry miles away di collaton asked if we wanted to have a look at the scene after lunch banks looked at collaton who showed concern in his eyes whether for bankss health or the lapse in attention wasnt clear yes he said pushing his empty plate aside yes by all means lets go have a look at poor old charlies final resting place after viewing the spot where charlie courages body had been discovered just off a muddy track in some woods near husbands bosworth they attended the postmortem in market harborough hospital courages body had already been photographed fingerprinted weighed measured and xrayed the previous day now the home office pathologist dr lindsey and his assistants worked methodically and patiently through a routine they must have carried out many times lindsey began with a close external examination paying special attention to the gunshot pattern definitely a shotgun wound he said twelvebore by the looks of it range about two or three yards he pointed out the central entrance opening over the heart and the numerous single small holes around it from the scattered shot any closer and it would have been practically circular much farther away and the shot would have spread out more into smaller groups theres still some wadding embedded in the wounds too look he held up a piece depends whether they used a sawnoff of course as the shot patterns dont hold as far even so it was pretty close range and judging by the angle of the main wounds it looks as if either his killer was very tall or the victim was on his knees at the time banks guessed that if he was right in assuming charlie had been taken for the long ride then his killer would have used a sawnoff shotgun the legal length for shotgun barrels was twentyfour inches not including the stock and no villain is going to walk or drive around with something that big then theres this bruising dr lindsey went on pointing out the discoloration around courages stomach and kidneys it looks as if he was beaten either with fists or some hard object before he was killed enough to make him piss blood for a week at least perhaps somebody wanted him to tell them something collaton said from what i knew of charlie hed give up his grandmother if you so much as waved your fist in his face they might have wanted him to tell them something but my bet is that he did and then they carried on beating him up just for the fun of it next dr lindsey began his dissection with the yincision he took blood samples then removed and inspected the inner organs working from the trachea esophagus and what was left of the heart down to the bladder and spleen as all this was going on banks kept a close eye on annie he didnt know how good she was at postmortems on fairly fresh corpses as the last one they had been to was of a skeleton disinterred after fifty years though she paled a little when dr lindsey opened up the body cavity and swallowed rather loudly as he squished out the various organs as if he were shucking oysters she stood her ground until that is the power saw started ripping into the front quadrant of the skull at that annie swayed put her hand to her mouth and making a gurgling sound dashed out of the room dr lindsey rolled his eyes and collaton glanced at banks who just shrugged dr lindsey pulled out the brain looked it over tossed it from hand to hand as if it were a grapefruit then put it aside for weighing and sectioning well he said until we get the tests back on the blood and tissue samples we wont know whether he was poisoned before he was shot i doubt it myself judging by the blood id say the gunshot wound was the cause of death it blew his heart open and going by the lividity id also say he was killed at the same spot he was found did you determine time of death banks asked though he knew it was the question all pathologists hated the most dr lindsey frowned and searched through a pile of notes on the lab bench i made some rough calculations at the scene only rough of course ive got them somewhere now where ah here it is rigor temperature allowing for the chilly weather and the rain he was found on tuesday thats yesterday at about four pm and i surmised hed been dead at least twentyfour hours perhaps longer charlie had been seen by his neighbor on sunday afternoon at around two oclock and if he had been killed sometime monday afternoon that left over twentyfour hours the last twentyfour hours of his life unaccounted for when they got back to eastvale banks would have to initiate some housetohouse inquiries in the neighborhood find out if anyone had seen charlie later than sunday lunchtime and if anyone had seen him with anyone he hadnt got to the lane near husbands bosworth in his own car and he certainly hadnt walked there the fresh tire tracks that collatons men had found most likely belonged to the car that had taken him there as the lane was an outoftheway place depending on how good the impressions were it might be possible to match them up with a particular car if of course they found the car and if the tires hadnt been changed they had learned just about all they could from dr lindsey for the moment and banks thanked him for his prompt postmortem and left with collaton looking out for annie as he walked along the corridors they found her standing out in the misty gray afternoon taking deep breaths when she saw them she looked away and ran her hand over her chestnut hair christ im sorry i feel such an idiot its all right said banks dont worry about it its not that i havent been to one before she pulled a face i was okay honest i was until it was the smell the saw burning the bone and the noise it made i couldnt im sorry i feel like such a fool it was the first time banks had seen any real break in annies onthejob composure i told you he said dont worry about it are you up to going home she nodded he imagined it would be a quiet journey annie was clearly pissed off at herself for showing signs of weakness banks looked at collaton the indulgent expression on his face indicated he would probably have forgiven annie anything it was late when banks finally got home after calling in at the station to issue some actions for the following morning the traffic on the m was murder especially around sheffield and patches of dense fog on the a meant they had to move at a crawl keeping in view the rear lights of the lorry in front of them banks was reminded of the time when he was lost in the fog heading for a friends house and had blindly followed the car in front right into a private drive he had been damned embarrassed when the irate driver came to ask him what the hell he thought he was doing annie recovered from her little spell of embarrassment a lot quicker than banks expected he had to remind himself that this wasnt susan gay and that annie didnt worry so much about appearing weak or incompetent she simply got on with her work and her life the fog in the dale slowed him down most on the last leg of his journey wraiths of gray mist nuzzled up the daleside and swirled on the road before him the road ran several feet up the hillside from the valley bottom where the river swain meandered through the leas and most of the fog had settled low banks knew the road well enough not to take too many foolish risks back at the cottage he found two messages waiting the first was from tracy asking him for ideas about what she should buy her mother for christmas a wedding dress perhaps banks thought but he wouldnt say that to tracy the next caller didnt identify herself but he knew immediately who she was hello its me look im sorry i havent been in touch it was probably very rude of me i mean i never really thanked you and all did i you know for what you did for me i suppose i was pretty fucked up there she broke off and banks could hear her suck on a cigarette and blow out the smoke he thought he could hear background noise too anyway you must let me buy you lunch at least hey look ill be over in eastvale tomorrow so why dont you meet me at the black bull on york road over from castle hill say about one oclock is that all right there was a silence on the line as if she were actually expecting an answer then she sighed okay then hope to see you tomorrow and im sorry really i am ciao banks remembered the last time he had seen emily at the door of the old mill house in the pink tracksuit he had bought for her on oxford street an outfit she obviously loathed giving him that enigmatic look as he delivered her to her parents he remembered jimmy riddles clipped thanks and rosalinds cool silence it was all unspoken but he had sensed riddles awkward hidden love for his daughter and rosalinds distance so emily riddle wanted to thank him should he go yes he thought reaching for the bottle of laphroaig hell yes he would go the black bull was a young peoples pub at night with live music and a steady supply of illegal drugs mostly ecstasy and crystal meth it had been targeted by the eastvale polices operation pubwatch on more than one occasion never without a few arrests being made at lunchtime though it had a totally different character and most of the customers worked in the various offices and shops along york road the only music issued quietly from the jukebox and the only drugs being consumed were nicotine and alcohol with perhaps a little caffeine for those who preferred tea or coffee with their pie and chips when banks arrived spot on one oclock emily was nowhere in sight he bought himself a pint and found a table near the window the road outside was busy and the traffic splashed up dirty water from the roadside puddles as he was studying the blackboard and trying to decide between bar bq chicken and thai red curry emily breezed in out of breath the way jenny fuller always seemed to do as if it had been a great effort getting there only fifteen minutes late she plonked her bulging handbag on the chair beside banks gave him an impish grin and made for the bar when she came back she was carrying one of those strange cocktails that young drinkers especially female seem to think are really interesting in this case kahlua and coke she must have charmed the landlord into believing she was old enough to drink banks thought though in all honesty she did look well over eighteen she had a cigarette in her mouth almost before she sat down a maneuver banks was surprised she could make given that her slightly flared blue jeans looked painted on still it was a testament to emilys natural style that she didnt look in the least bit tarty and she had chosen to wear no makeup at all not that she needed any once she had lit her cigarette and had taken a sip of her drink she shucked her midlength jacket to reveal a black silk blouse after she had tidied her hair she seemed ready to talk but she kept on fidgeting there were moments when banks looked at her and saw a sophisticated young woman looking back wise enough in the ways of the world to exploit them for her own ends other times he saw the gauche nervous teenager unable to look an adult in the eye she was still too close to her childhood to recognize its value when you were emilys age banks remembered all you wanted to do was enter that magical world of privilege and freedom you saw all around you adulthood hence the smoking the drinking the sex you didnt realize until much much later too late some might say that the privileges and freedoms you coveted came with a very high price tag indeed have you decided yet she asked decided what what youre having for lunch its my treat i told you on the phone you dont have to do that i know daddy probably paid you well already for bringing me home but i want to ill have the thai red curry then banks didnt usually go for more exotic food in pubs but the bull had a good lunchtime reputation and he didnt pay me anything she raised a neatly plucked eyebrow just so you know emily paused then said all right she gestured for the woman delivering food at the next table to come over and started to give her order the woman frowned told her to go and order it herself at the bar then stalked off get her said emily pulling a face kid again banks scraped his chair against the stone floor ill go he didnt want her to have to go through the agony of getting up and sitting down again wearing those jeans she might rupture her spleen or her bladder no she jumped to her feet with surprising agility i told you id get it banks watched her walk to the bar taller than ever in her platform heels and noticed all the mens eyes were on her body there wasnt one of them who wouldnt do anything for her or to her the women however turned up their noses in distaste and cast disapproving frowns in bankss direction what the hell banks asked himself was he doing sitting in a pub with the chief constables daughter who was definitely breaking one law by drinking under age even if you could hardly call kahlua and coke a real drink and god knows how many other laws simply by the way she looked it was fortunate that none of the men could be arrested for their fantasies not yet done emily sat again and plucked her cigarette out of the ashtray at least theyll bring it to the bloody table you dont have to get up and fetch it yourself honestly the service industry in this country banks wondered how many other countries she had experienced and realized it was probably more than his own daughter had chief constables were always getting junkets to america belgium south africa or peru he wondered if the service in peru was better than that in yorkshire probably what are you having he asked me nothing i dont eat lunch nor dinner either by the looks of you now now remember you didnt disapprove of the looks of me too much in that hotel room so she did remember banks felt himself blush and it got all the worse when he saw emily was laughing at him look he said but she waved him down dont worry i havent told daddy she pouted and wiggled her shoulders besides its the waiflike look most older men like it dont you what about boys your own age she snorted theyre so immature oh theyre all right for dancing and buying you drinks and stuff but thats about all all most of them can talk about is football and sex she licked her cherry lips i prefer older men banks swallowed he could see where that came from a father who was never there someone she desperately wanted to love and be loved by like barry clough he said a shadow crossed her fine porcelain features thats one of the things i wanted to talk to you about she said then her face brightened into a smile but first i really do want to thank you i mean it i know i wasnt very nice at the time but i appreciate what you did taking care of me like that i was really fucked up bigtime do you remember much about it in the hotel room yes until i fell asleep you were the perfect gentleman and the next morning you went and bought me a tracksuit a pink one it was ugly but that was sweet of you im sorry i wasnt very friendly on the way home but i was really down thai curry the woman held out a dish of steaming curry banks admitted to ownership and she set it down narrowly avoiding spilling it on the table gave emily a hard glare and walked off what is her problem emily said i mean really the stupid cow she doesnt like you said banks she doesnt like the way you treated her and id guess she doesnt like your looks much either what the fuck do i care if she likes my looks you asked im simply telling you anyway whats she supposed to be here for if not to serve people food its not as if shes not getting paid or anything look said banks im not going to argue its not her job to take orders and youve got a pretty snotty attitude when it comes right down to it banks dipped into his curry it was good and hot emily glared at him for a few seconds sulking then started fidgeting with the large ring on her right index finger stupid old bitch she muttered banks ignored her and tucked in easing the heat with an occasional swig of beer he finished the pint quicker than he had intended to and before he could stop her emily had jumped to her feet and bought him another one it was the barmaid who served her this time not the landlord and banks noticed them talking emily taking something out of her handbag and showing it to her what was all that about he asked when she came back nothing she said putting her drink down christ this place is in the fucking dark ages what do you mean i only asked for a tvr didnt i and do you think the sad bitch behind the bar had any idea what i was talking about i cant say i have any idea what youre talking about either emily looked at him as if he came from another planet well i had to explain it to her too its tequila vodka and red bull great stuff gives you a real alcohol high without all that slurring and stumbling me and well you know who we used to drink it in the cicada dust in clerkenwell and she pulled a face what do you think they didnt have it of course they didnt so what did you settle for a snowball banks had heard of that one advocaat and lemonade he had thought it long out of fashion he remembered that his mother sometimes used to drink a snowball at christmas when he was a kid just the one usually as she was never much of a drinker mmm its good emily held out the glass want a sip no thanks have you been in touch with any of the crowd down there craig ruth emily shook her head not much craig said barrys minders beat him up outside a pub in soho while you looked on laughing the lying bastard it didnt happen oh it happened but not the way he told it you tell me then it was in clerkenwell outside barrys club craig found out about the place and he started hanging around there pretending to be taking photographs he was obsessed he just wouldnt let go i told him to stay away but he wouldnt listen he even started coming in but barry had him barred when he came up to me it was the last straw i wouldnt have let them hit him like that if i could have stopped them but it all happened so quickly it was his own fault really he said he didnt know where you lived he didnt i told ruth to make sure she didnt tell him he knew about the club from before though from the party which party the one where i met barry at some promoters house ruth took us she knows people in the music scene and all that craig was there too yes thats how he knew barry owned a club in clerkenwell i started seeing barry after that night and a week or so later i left craig he was just getting to be too much i see and were you laughing when they beat him up i wasnt laughing i was crying the fool why would he lie to me the truth would hardly make him look good would it craig might seem so nice and wellbalanced on the surface but hes got a mean streak too you know did he ever hit you no he knew i wouldnt stand for that it was just oh you know if i came home late or something hed always be waiting up and go on at me calling me a slut and a whore and stuff it was mean nasty then he was all pathetic the next morning telling me he loved me and buying me presents and all that when all he really wanted was to get into my knickers i still dont understand why he would lie to me he believed i was your father surely he must know id find out the truth when i found you emily laughed silly its the last thing id tell my father think about it banks did she was right but youre telling me thats different youre not my father youre not like him at all youre im what well youre more like a friend cute too im flattered emily but youd better not tell your father that she giggled and put her hand to her mouth as if embarrassed to catch herself out in a juvenile act youre right about that have you heard from craig at all since youve been back in yorkshire no ive not seen or heard from him since that night outside the club what about ruth ive talked to her a couple of times on the phone but i didnt give her much cause to like me did i i think she fancied craig and i took him away from her it was as much his choice besides shell get over it yeah well ruths got enough problems without me adding to them what do you mean nothing shes just a bit fucked up couldnt you tell she did seem strange not much stranger than emily herself though banks thought he pushed his empty plate aside and lit a cigarette it wasnt as if there was anything to be gained by trying to act as a positive nonsmoking role model to emily are you going to tell me what happened in london that night he asked before you arrived at the hotel emily licked at the rim of her glass ive been thinking about it and she looked around then leaned forward conspiratorially ive decided i will banks could smell the advocaat on her breath he leaned back im all ears annie had not been completely honest with banks she admitted to herself the next afternoon as she drove out to the daleview business park to meet charlie courages boss at secutec ian bennett as usual when she found it difficult to talk about something she had been flip all style and no substance working out of eastvale with banks bothered her more than she had been able to tell him it wasnt that she couldnt separate her job from her personal life she felt she could do the job perfectly well no matter with whom she worked but so much proximity to banks might weaken her resolve to end their relationship after all she had given him up not because she didnt feel anything for him but because she found herself feeling too much too soon and because he brought too many complications from his previous relationship with him a marriage of over twenty years working with him again she had to admit to herself that she still fancied him to hell with it she told herself sneaking a quick glance at the map on the car seat beside her almost there she would just do her bloody job and let the rest take care of itself one thing her brief romance with banks had done was renew her faith in the job make her think about why she had become a policewoman in the first place now she had a better sense of herself more confidence and she was damn well going for inspector not that the job was everything mind you she wasnt going to make that mistake and end up a driedup old spinster with no life other than work but she was willing to commit herself as much as it took and because her work life was going to be hard she wanted to keep her personal life simple with banks in her bed it wouldnt be the black wroughtiron railings to her left bore a large painted sign saying daleview business park along with a list of businesses located there annie turned through the gates which were probably intended more for decoration than security she thought and looked for the secutec office the business park consisted of a large onestory red brick building built in the shape of a pentagon and divided into a number of different units each with its own logo and some with showcase windows and parking spots for two or three cars out front though it wasnt a shopping precinct as such the pottery shop and the needlecraft center had outlets there along with a stairlift company a furniture workshop and an aga center the other units were taken up by offices a company that rented holiday cottages for example and a mailorder exercisevideo distribution company annie noticed she wondered if that was some sort of euphemism for what they really sold if it was a front for a porn operation then it might be connected with charlie courages murder ian bennett opened the office door for her before she even reached it ds cabbot she said fishing for her warrant card its all right said bennett smiling i believe you come on in she followed him into the small office so this is what the welldressed young policewoman is wearing these days he said looking her up and down under her navyblue raincoat which hung open she was wearing boots black tights a short denim skirt and a white sweater none of which she felt was particularly weird what did he expect a uniform a twinset and pearls bennett was younger than she had expected from the voice on the telephone probably about her age early thirties with thick curly dark hair and more of a tan than you can get hanging around yorkshire in winter he looked as if he played sports to keep in shape something that involved a lot of running around such as tennis or squash and while his salary probably didnt stretch as far as armani he was wearing highend designer casuals that must have set him back a bob or two a mobile phone bulged ostentatiously from the pocket of his zipup suede jacket annie guessed that the bmw she had parked next to was probably his so this is what the welldressed young yuppieonthego is wearing to impress the girls these days she countered aware as soon as she had done so that it wasnt the best way to start an interview big problem annie youve never been able to suffer fools gladly which gives you at least one thing in common with alan banks stop thinking about him secutec had only a small office at daleview where charlie courage had spent his nights on guard duty annie glanced around and saw that hed had a small television for company along with facilities for making tea and a microwave oven for heating up his midnight snack the office was too small for the two of them and it smelled of warm plastic annie sat on what would have been charlies desk and ian bennett leaned against the opposite wall by a company calendar like so many of those things it showed a buxom skinnywaisted smiling blonde in a bikini she was holding a spanner bennett flushed at her insult i suppose i deserved that he said running his hand over his hair i always say something silly when i meet an attractive woman sorry can we start again annie gave him a lowwattage smile the kind she reserved for the masses best all round she said bennett cleared his throat im afraid i cant tell you very much he began i didnt know mr courage well when did he last work sunday night he was on the fourtomidnight shift are you certain did you see him no but he logged in i mean he has to log in with us so we know someones there how does he do this bennett pointed at the desk beside her computer could someone else have done it pretended to be him i suppose its possible but theyd have to know his user name and his password i see was this the shift he always worked no other days he worked from midnight till eight in the morning was he the only night watchman no it works like this every day the units are open we have the other security guard colin finch work four to midnight and mr courage work midnight till eight when the units start opening in the morning then when we get to sunday they alternate colin does four to midnight saturday charlie does midnight to eight then colin does eight to four and so on i see said annie who remembered the horrors of shift work very well indeed most of the time she hadnt known whether she was coming or going so colin finch would have seen mr courage when they changed shifts at four on sunday yes i should think so can you give me his address of course bennett fiddled with the computer and gave annie a ripon address hell be in at four today though if youre still around annie looked at her watch it was half past two did you know that mr courage had a criminal record the question seemed to embarrass bennett he had er actually no we didnt know surely a security firm like yours runs checks on potential employees normally we do yes of course but this one well it seems he slipped between the cracks slipped between the cracks yes i see annie made a note in her brandnew notebook what she actually wrote was dont forget to pick up something for dinner at marks amp sparks but bennett wasnt to know that have there been any incidents at the park over the past few months since mr courage started working here no nothing at all as far as secutec is concerned mr courage seemed to be doing his job well nothing gone missing nothing the other tenants are they all satisfied yes as i said weve had no problems no complaints at all i dont suppose its something you police ever consider but have you thought at all that mr courage might indeed have gone straight as they say i mean just because a man makes a couple of mistakes it doesnt mean hes marked forever does it annie sighed this wasnt going to work she could tell mr bennett she said why dont you leave the recidivismversusrehabiliation argument to people who know what theyre talking about and just answer my questions he smiled i thought thats what i was doing i mean ive told you there were no problems i was only suggesting that it might indicate mr courage had changed his ways you do believe that criminals can change their ways dont you detective constable cabbot its detective sergeant annie corrected him adding a silent pillock under her breath and im merely suggesting that well get you back in your beemer and on your way to your next meeting much faster if you simply answer my questions bennett fiddled with his mobile as if hoping it would ring carry on he said with a drawnout longsuffering sigh annie smiled to herself he would no doubt tell his guests at tonights dinner party or whatever about his brush with police brutality what exactly were his duties she asked he was supposed to walk around the park check doors and everything once an hour to be honest though it wasnt much of a job there wasnt a lot for him to do i shouldnt think so with all these modern security gizmos why bother hiring a night watchman at all then it was a matter of appearances really the tenants like it believe it or not no matter how many sophisticated alarm systems you put in place people always feel a bit more confident if theres human being around thats comforting said annie i dont suppose i need to worry about robocop much anymore sorry a joke never mind carry on oh i see a copper with a sense of humor anyway having someone on the premises discourages vandals too what about a dog they can be effective but you cant just leave them alone besides theres the whole problem of lawsuits if they actually bite anyone how did mr courage get the job he applied through normal channels i must say he seemed credible enough the mark of a master criminal youre joking again bennett smiled annie didnt smile back mr courage was paid by check am i correct actually no his wages were paid directly into his bank account were there ever any cash bonuses bennett frowned cash bonuses i dont know what you mean cash in hand certainly not thats not secutecs policy and no money has ever been reported missing by any of the businesses operating out of this park during the period of mr courages employment as night watchman no annie closed her notebook very well mr bennett she said you can go now we might need to get in touch again later fine feel free to do whatever you need here but please remember to lock up when you leave bennett practically ran out of the office annie stood in the doorway and watched him reverse the bmw then take off in what would have been a cloud of dust had the ground not been so wet as it was one of the puddles he hit sent a sheet of water over a woman just walking into the needleworkcenter shop a few units down she looked down at her soaked raincoat and tights and glared after the car shaking her fist she shouldnt have been quite so sharp with bennett annie thought as she watched him clear the gates and turn right onto the main road he was a smug pillock true enough but shed had to deal with plenty of those in her time and she hadnt usually resorted to bullying he looked like the kind whod put in a complaint too would that have any effect on her attempt to make inspector she doubted it but she also made a mental note to watch herself and be a lot more compassionate toward fools and pillocks now she thought it was simply a matter of deciding whether to go right or left and spend an hour or so talking to the people who operated the businesses at daleview they would probably know a lot more about its daytoday operations than mr ian bloody bennett after that with any luck colin finch would have reported for duty barry was very angry after you left emily said toying with rather than smoking another cigarette ive never seen him so angry when he gets angry he goes all cold he doesnt go red in the face and shout or anything like dad he just gets this fixed sort of smile and does everything in a very slow careful sort of way like straightening the cushions on the settee or lighting a cigarette and he talks very quietly its frightening do you know why he was angry because you came asking questions he doesnt like anyone asking questions especially strangers what did he do to you barry he didnt do anything im telling you he was angry in that cold way he had he just told me to get ready for the party then we did another couple of lines of coke and off we went what kind of party was it the usual sort musicbusiness people a few minor bands groupies along with a few young entrepreneurs other club owners the kind of people barry collects there was a bonfire and fireworks outside but mostly we stayed indoors drugs she laughed oh yes of course always drugs does barry deal no he just buys go on emily paused for all her bravado banks could tell she had difficulty talking about it barry was weird all evening i tried to just you know stay away from him until his mood had passed keep my distance talk to some of the guys in the bands and stuff but he kept appearing smiling in that cold way of his putting his arm around me touching me sometimes even squeezing hurting me she drank some of her snowball grimaced and said i dont think i like this after all would you get me a lager and lime or something like that im thirsty im not buying you an alcoholic drink emily youre under age dont be a spoilsport im already drinking one arent i youre right i probably shouldnt even be sitting with you but i am if you want me to get you a drink youll get a lemonade or a coke i wont tell you the rest of my story doesnt matter bastard and i thought you were supposed to be my friend banks said nothing emily sashayed to the bar drawing all the male eyes again banks sipped some beer and lit his second cigarette he was definitely going to make some inquiries into mr barry clough and his business activities over the next few days emily came back with a pint of lager and lime and spilled some as she set it triumphantly on the table for a while she didnt say anything then she took a long swig paused and said it was pretty late i dont know two or three in the morning everyone was really wasted i was feeling weird like someone had put something in my drink it might have been one of those daterape drugs ive read about but id had so much other stuff i didnt fall asleep i just felt strange floating anyway barry took me aside and said there was something he wanted me to do for him as she spoke she looked into her drink and the fingers of her right hand rubbed at the tables surface banks noticed the chewed nails he took me upstairs toward one of the bedrooms i thought he wanted a blow job or something he sometimes did i didnt really want to i was feeling so spaced out but if it would get him off my back for a while anyway it wasnt that he opened the bedroom door and there was andy inside anyway he was stark naked and he i mean wed all been taking v amp e so he was you know it was v and e she looked at him as if he were an idiot viagra and ecstasy anyway like i said he was like he had a lamppost between his legs barry just gave me a push forward and told me to be nice to him then i heard the door shut anyway when barry pushed me i fell on the bed and andy started pulling at my clothes rubbing against me it was gross i might have been stoned and ill admit ive not always been a good girl but this was seriously out of line i mean it ought to be my choice who i have sex with not someone elses oughtnt it and it wasnt even him so much i mean he was a pathetic creep but the thought that barry had given me to him as a sort of punishment for you coming and asking questions i dont know it just made me sick thats all she paused to drink some lager and lime banks felt his anger rise along with the guilt it was his arrival that had caused the problems for emily he told himself that no matter what with someone like clough she would have got to that point eventually anyway but it didnt help right then he also remembered the night not so long ago in a london bistro when annie cabbot had told him about her sexual humiliation at the hands of some cid colleagues who was this andy did you know him like i said id seen him around hes one of barrys gofers at least ive heard barry telling him off and ordering him to do stuff sometimes takes the piss out of him something terrible too andy has a stutter see i mean that was one of the most humiliating things about it like barry had given me to one of his employees to someone he thought was a bit of a joke it made me feel worthless like shit what was his full name andrew handley but everyone calls him andy pandy anyway you know the rest or most of it how did you get away we struggled he wasnt really expecting any resistance so i just kneed him in the balls and he hit me and let go the door wasnt locked i ran out downstairs and out of the house without looking back i was only worried that barry might be lurking around at the bottom of the stairs or something and that hed stop me but i didnt see him i was lucky we were near victoria station so i ran to the taxi rank and the only place i could think of to go was your hotel and thats it the sad story of barry and emily or barry and louisa did he ever mistreat you before that no but i never gave him cause to what do you mean emily thought for a moment then said with craig it was easy he was jealous maybe a bit too much and it made him a bit crazy with barry its different hes possessive not jealous he expects loyalty you know that there are certain lines youre not supposed to cross im not a fool i might not know exactly what hes into but i know its probably illegal and i know he hurts people i saw him hurt craig was that part of the appeal what that he hurts people that hes a criminal whereas your fathers a policeman after all theyre about the same age emily snorted that sounds just like something my father would say do you all take the same course in pop psychology there is a kind of logic in it its not that at all barrys appeal is that hes exciting to be with he gives great parties has great drugs and people respect him fear him you mean whatever if fears the only way you can get respect whats wrong with that nobody disses barry why arent you still with him then she started rubbing at the table again i told you a confused kid banks had to stop himself from leaning forward and putting his hand over hers it would have simply been a paternal gesture on his part though he was aware that neither emily nor the others in the pub would view it that way he also noted that in her entire list of barry cloughs attributes emily had not mentioned sex that he was great in bed sex was probably a matter of power for clough banks didnt doubt for a moment that clough used emily sexually she had already said as much but to her he guessed it was more a matter of the price to be paid for the high life than a joy to be shared and the fact that she priced herself so low was a matter for concern are you afraid of him emily course not its just what she frowned hes very possessive like i said barry doesnt like to lose his prized possessions an hour later annie was wet and miserable and none the wiser she had walked between each of the units on the estate talked to managers and workers and discovered absolutely nothing if anything dodgy had been going on at the daleview business park it had been kept a very close secret it was with a great sense of relief then that she approached the last but one listed business banks had called for a lateafternoon meeting to pool their findings and after that annie had visions of a long hot bath some microwavable marks and sparks concoction and an evening alone to do as much or as little as she wished the needlework center was warm and dry smelling of scented candles predominantly rose and lemon it was the kind of place that seemed made of nooks and crannies all filled with such essentials as pin boxes thread etuis stitchlayers needle threaders working frames stitchcount converters and a thousand other more esoteric items finished tapestries hung on the walls more of a showroom than a shop it had no counter but there was a comfortablelooking threepiece suite where clients could sit and discuss their requirements a young woman came out of an office at the back the same woman bennett had splashed in his hasty getaway annie introduced herself and said that she had been visiting all the units clockwise from the secutec office the woman held out her hand my names natalie she said welcome to my empire for what its worth i cant tell you anything but ive just put the kettle on if you want to stay out of the rain for a few moments please said annie i could murder a cuppa right now if accepting free cups of tea counted as corruption there wouldnt be a copper in the whole of england not up on charges wont be a minute natalie walked back into the office annie was examining the needlecraft kits and wondered if they would be relaxing or frustrating to do she had a sudden memory of her mother sitting crosslegged on the floor her long hair all over the place wearing one of her flowing velvety creations covered in beadwork and embroidery she was working on a sampler of a local village scene it was an odd image as annie had never thought of her mother doing needlecraft before though she knew she made her own clothes and they were always beautifully embroidered she would have to phone and ask ray her father maybe some of the samplers were down at the commune near st ives and she could take one as a memento her mother had died when she was only five as annie watched in her imagination her mother looked up and smiled at her annie felt suddenly sad when natalie returned with the tea it must have shown what is it natalie asked you look as if youve seen a ghost love oh nothing memories thats all natalie looked around her showroom as if trying to search for the offending object annie decided it was time to get on track thanks for the tea she said taking a sip i know you said you couldnt tell me anything but i suppose youve heard what happened to mr courage oh yes word gets around here pretty quickly after all most of us have been here since the place opened so were used to each other shall we sit down she gestured to the threepiece suite and annie sat in the armchair she felt so weary she wondered whether she would ever be able to get out of it again did you know him at all she asked no but i know he hadnt been here very long since september was it if you say so anyway mr bennett brought him around and introduced him to everyone just before he started so wed recognize him know who to call if there were any problems but other than that i never even saw him again you see im usually gone by five oclock most days except thursday and friday when i stay open till seven at least i will until after christmas then theres not much point until the weather starts getting better youd be surprised how many tourists we get just dropping by in spring and summer but most of my trade comes from regular customers this is a very specialized business they know what they want and they know i have it for them they usually telephone first of course oh listen to me rattling on but i did warn you i didnt know anything annie smiled and sipped some more tea its all right she said gives me a chance to warm up and drink my tea so far everyone ive spoken to says there have been no incidents at the park not even petty theft is that right well i cant speak for everyone but ive had a bit of shoplifting here once in a while nothing serious you understand but irritating petty stuff thread packets of needles that sort of thing kids i doubt it we dont get a lot of kids here needlecrafts hardly the in thing with the younger generation these days i doubt that it ever was still its a living anyway i suppose shopliftings the kind of thing you have to expect in a place like this but as i said its nothing serious there are some pretty organized gangs of shoplifters keep your eyes open if it gets serious let us know natalie nodded annie shifted in her chair much as id love to im afraid i cant sit here all day she said with a quick glance through the window it was still pouring down outside she looked at the list ian bennett had given her and got to her feet one more to go natalie frowned not if you went clockwise from the secutec office there isnt anyone else annie glanced at the list what do you mean ive got something called pkf computer systems listed here right next door to you the computer people theyre gone when did they move out over the weekend i dont suppose mr bennett got around to updating the list yet how many people worked there only two regulars as far as i could tell its one of the smaller units do you know their names sorry i hardly saw them they werent the most sociable types what about people coming and going just delivery vans the usual stuff okay thank you very much for your time natalie and for the tea my pleasure it livens up a dull afternoon annie left the needlecraft center and walked to the next unit if there had been a sign over the door none hung there now instead of a plateglass window as on some of the showrooms the old pkf unit had three smaller windows at the front annie peeped through one of them and as far as she could make out the inside was empty completely cleared out that was all it took to trigger the little alarm bell in her coppers mind charlie courage last seen alive by a neighbor on sunday afternoon apparently worked the fourtomidnight shift that evening and was found dead tuesday nearly two hundred miles away he had received five cash payments of two hundred quid each over the past month and now this computer company had done a bunk over the weekend it certainly ought to be worth a quick look around their deserted premises and by the time she had finished annie thought colin finch would probably be in the secutec office she should just have time to talk to him before heading back to the station for the meeting dont think i want you acting like some sort of avenging angel emily said youve already done your knightinshiningarmor bit thank you very much why are you telling me all this then because you asked and because i owe you an explanation thats all you admitted youre frightened of clough that was silly of me she gave a slight shudder it was just you know talking about it remembering how he was that night and i what its nothing go on oh just that i thought i saw jamie in the swainsdale centre she laughed put her forefinger to her head and twisted it back and forth me being crazy again paranoid emily thats what theyll be calling me her nail was chewed almost to the quick banks noticed jamie who jamie gilbert hes one of barrys closest employees barry talks and jamie jumps i dont like him hes goodlooking but hes mean he gives me the creeps when was this a couple of days ago monday i think but it cant have been him i must have been seeing things barry doesnt even know who i really am or where i live does he remember louisa gamine how could i forget banks wasnt certain that a man like barry clough lacked the resources to find out what he wanted about anyone be careful though if you think you see him or clough around here again make sure you tell me okay i can take care of myself emily promise youll tell me if you think you see either of them again emily waved her hand all right all right dont get your underpants in a twist about it you never did tell me what business cloughs in thats because i dont know are you certain hes not a drug dealer no i mean i dont think so like i said hes always got drugs around he knows people does people favors and things maybe gets them some stuff but hes not a dealer im sure of that how does he make his money i told you i dont know he never talked about it to me as far as barry is concerned women are purely for recreation not business theres the club i suppose for a start that takes up a fair bit of his time and i think maybe he manages some bands and does some concert promotion hes got business interests all over the country he was always off here and there leeds dover manchester bristol sometimes he took me with him but to be honest it was pretty boring waiting for him in some hotel room or walking the streets of some dingy little dump in the rain once he even asked me if i wanted to come here with him here the black bull eastvale silly can you imagine it me and barry walking around eastvale i mean my mother works here she slapped the table and made the glasses wobble i dont want to talk about him anymore its over barry will move on to his next little girl and ill get on with my life how are things at home she pulled a face just what youd expect whats that boring they just want me to keep quiet and stay out of the way mother pretty much ignores me dad has his political cronies over most of the time you should see the way some of them look at me but he doesnt notice hes too busy planning his future and what about you what do you want to do emily brightened and took a long swig of her lager and lime ive been thinking i might like to go to university after all dont you have to do your alevels first of course but i can do that at a sixthform college i could even do them at home if i want to its not as if theyre hard or anything ah said banks who had found even his olevels hard and where would you go to university oxford or cambridge of course of course her eyes narrowed are you taking the piss farthest thing from my mind right yeah well anyway i also thought i wouldnt mind going to university in america harvard or stanford or somewhere like that not bryn mawr it sounds like that nasty little welsh town we lived in for a while when i was a kid and not that one in poughkeepsie either that sounds like somewhere you keep pigs what would you study im not sure yet maybe languages or acting i was always good in school plays but theres plenty of time to think about all that yes there is banks paused and fiddled for another cigarette emily lit it for him with a gold lighter i dont want to sound like your father he went on but this drugs thing i can take them or leave them you sure sure i never did much anyway just a bit of coke crystal meth v amp e viagra and ecstasy you remember you took that sure but viagras i mean what does it do for a woman she came up with a wicked grin and tapped his arm well it doesnt exactly give me a hardon but it does make fucking really good mostly it gives you a real rush sort of like speed i see and youve had no problems giving up all this stuff im not an addict if thats what youre getting at i can stop anytime i want im not suggesting that youre an addict just that it can be difficult without outside help im not going on one of those stupid programs with all those losers if thats what you mean no way she pouted and looked away banks held his hands up fine fine all im saying is that if you find you need any help well i know you can hardly go to your father thats all emily stared at him for a while as if digesting and translating what he had said thanks she said finally not meeting his eyes and managed a small smile you know why my dad hates you startled banks almost choked on his drink when he had regained some of his composure he suggested personality clash because he envies you thats why envies me its true i can tell ive heard him going on to mother do you know he thinks youve been having it off with some pakistani tart in leeds shes not pakistani shes from bangladesh shes not a tart and weve never had it off whatever and the music that drives him crazy but why dont you know i wouldnt be asking if i did its because youve got a life you have a woman on the side you listen to opera or whatever and you get the job done you get results you also do it the way you want dads by the book always has been but hes one of the youngest chief constables weve ever had why on earth should he be jealous of my achievements you still dont get it do you obviously not hes envious youre everything hed like to be but he cant hes locked himself on a course he couldnt change even if he wanted to hes sacrificed everything to get where hes got believe me i should know im one of the things hes sacrificed all hes got is his ambition he doesnt have time to listen to music be with his family have another woman read a book its like hes made a pact with the devil and hes handed over all his time in exchange for earthly power and position and theres something else he can handle the politics pass exams and courses by the cartload manage administrate better than just about anyone else on the force but theres one thing he could never do worth a damn whats that he couldnt detect his way out of a paper bag why should that matter because thats why he joined up in the first place how do you know i dont im only guessing but ive seen his old books once when we were staying at my grandparents house in worthing theyre all like sixties paperback editions and stuff with his name written inside them all very neatly a lot of those penguins with the green covers detective stories sherlock holmes agatha christie ngaio marsh all that boring old crap and i looked in some of them do you know what hes done hes made his own notes in the margins about who he thinks did it what the clues mean i even read one of them while we were there he couldnt have been more wrong banks felt queasy there was something obscene about this intimate look into riddles childhood dreams that made him uncomfortable where did you learn the pop psychology he said trying to brush the whole thing off emily smiled there is a kind of logic to it think about it look its been great seeing you but i really have to be going i have to meet someone at three then im off clubbing tonight she gathered her handbag more the size of a small rucksack really patted her hair and stood up maybe we can do this again id like that banks said but its on my terms next time or not at all your terms no booze she stuck her tongue out at him spoilsport bye then she picked up her jacket turned with a flourish and strutted out of the pub the men all watched her go with hangdog expressions some of them brought crudely back to reality by harsh remarks from their wives sitting next to them one woman gave banks a particularly malevolent look the kind she probably reserved for child molesters after emily had gone banks spent a few moments thinking over what she had said selfanalysis had not been a habit of his and it was something he had only really indulged in since the split with sandra since his move to the cottage even there he had spent many a late evening watching the sunset over the flagstone roofs of helmthorpe as shadows gathered on the distant valley sides and probing himself his motives what made him the man he was why he had made the mistakes he had made there he was a man in his forties taking stock of his life and finding out it wasnt at all what he thought it had been so riddle hated him because he was a natural detective and because he appeared to have a life including this illusory mistress some of riddles envy then if that was what it was was based on error what could be more pathetic than envying a man the life you only imagine he has it was just a precocious teenagers analysis of course but perhaps it wasnt too far from the mark after all it wasnt as if riddle had ever given banks a chance right from the start still he thought knocking back the last of his pint that wasnt his problem anymore with riddle in his corner things were bound to change for the better as he pulled up his collar and left the pub he was aware of the womens eyes burning holes in the back of his raincoat ds jim hatchley was the last to arrive at the scheduled meeting that thursday afternoon rolling in a little after quarter past five smelling of ale and tobacco and looking as if hed been dragged through a hedge backwards banks annie cabbot and dcs rickerd jackman and templeton were already gathered in the boardroom so called because of its panels wainscoting and oil portraits of dead mill owners a thin patina of dust from the renovations had even reached as far as the long banquet table usually so highly polished you could see your reflection in it sorry sir muttered hatchley taking his seat banks turned to annie cabbot who had just started an account of her afternoon at the daleview business park go on ds cabbot he said now that were all here well sir theres not a great deal to add charlie turned up for work on sunday afternoon as usual logged in and he went home at midnight his replacement for the midnighttoeight shift colin finch says he actually saw him at four and midnight so we know he was still alive when he left the park did this finch have anything more to tell us banks asked said he hardly knew charlie they were ships that passed in the night his words not mine and hed no sense of anything dodgy going on at daleview nobody else i spoke to there admits to knowing charlie either not surprising when you consider he was usually at work when the rest had gone home and there had been no incidents reported at the park so he didnt even have very much to do could his death be unrelated to his work then banks asked its possible annie said glancing at hatchley after all he did have form mixed with some pretty rough company in his time but there was one odd thing yes she took an envelope out of her briefcase and set it on the table one of the companies operating out of daleview pkf computer systems cleared out lock stock and barrel on sunday evening moonlight flit no sir all aboveboard according to colin finch just very short notice they were gone by midnight when he started his shift couldnt pay their bills they werent owing when they left but i should imagine a cashflow problem might be at the back of it all likely said banks but they did nothing wrong no interesting timing though wouldnt you say i would pkf had cleared off during charlie courages final evening shift banks didnt like coincidences any more than any other copper worth his salt go on anyway ian bennett had given me carte blanche and the keys were all there in mr courages old office so i had a quick shufti around the pkf unit find anything clean as a whistle theyd obviously taken care to make sure they left nothing behind except this i found it lodged behind the radiator it must have fallen there she held the envelope and tipped it a cracked plastic case about fivebyfiveandahalf inches fell onto the polished tables surface a cd case said banks i suppose youd expect to find something like that if they were in the computer business software and all that yes said annie it probably means nothing in fact the whole pkf things probably nothing but i handled it carefully just in case we might want to check with fingerprints you think theres something dodgy about pkf annie leaned back in her chair she even looked comfortable in the notoriously hard and bumunfriendly boardroom chair thought banks i dont know sir its just the timing them leaving the same weekend courage disappeared it might be worth looking into the company see who they are what they do it might help explain charlies sudden riches banks nodded right you are you can get stuck into that tomorrow and it wouldnt do any harm to get in touch with vic manson about those prints either if someone working at pkf turns up in our records as well as charlie he glanced over at the three dcs at the far end of the table they had been on a housetohouse to find out if anyone had seen charlie courage after sunday lunchtime anything on the victims movements winsome jackman spoke first a neighbor saw him going to work late sunday afternoon sir and the man across the street saw him taking his milk in at about eight oclock on monday morning anyone else winsome shook her head kevin templeton said the woman at number fortytwo mrs finlay noticed something she says she thought she saw charlie get in a car with a couple of men later on monday morning description nothing very useful sir templeton doodled in the dust on the table as he spoke one was medium height the other was a bit taller they wore jeans and leather jackets brown or black the taller one he was going bald the other had short fair hair she said she didnt get a good look and wasnt really paying attention i asked her if she thought mr courage was being forced in the car in any way and she told me she didnt get that impression but she could have been wrong banks sighed it was typical of most witness statements of course if you didnt know you were witnessing anything momentous such as a mans final journey you didnt pay that much attention most people dont see much on the peripheries theyre more concerned about where theyre going what theyre doing and thinking what about the car lightcolored maybe white that was the best she could say nothing fancy but newlooking with a nice shiny finish okay said banks time did we fare any better there a little bit sir said templeton she said it must not have been long after ten oclock because she had just started listening to womans hour and that starts at ten oclock interesting maybe the trip was prearranged annie suggested it could have been something he was looking forward to maybe he thought he was going somewhere nice getting some more money could be banks turned to hatchley what did your afternoon in the fleshpots of eastvale turn up jim hatchley scratched the side of his bulbous nose charlie was up to something dodgy i can tell you that much go on hatchley got his notebook out workmen started hammering somewhere in the extension hatchley raised his voice according to len jackson one of his old colleagues charlie was on to a nice little earner and it wasnt his job at daleview either was it connected with that charlie didnt say he was pretty vague about it all what he did say though was that he was already bringing in a bit of extra and pretty soon hed be in for a much larger slice of the pie what he was getting now was peanuts to what hed have soon interesting but he didnt say what pie no sir charlie was pretty cagey about it apparently he wanted his old mates to know he was doing well but not how he was doing it scared of the competition i suppose okay said banks well at least that tells us were on the right track all we need to know now is what he was into and who was running it makes it sound easy doesnt it he shook his head charlie charlie you shouldve stayed on the straight and narrow this time he never was bigtime wasnt charlie added hatchley he must have got in way over his head not known who he was dealing with banks nodded okay thats it for now he said back in his office with his door tightly shut to keep the noise out banks phoned di collaton down in market harborough to give him an update more out of professional courtesy than anything else as there wasnt much to report after that he decided to call it a day he tidied his desk and locked up then headed for the door annie cabbot was a flight ahead of him on her way down the stairs she turned at the sound of his footsteps oh its you off home unless youd like to go for a quick drink or something i dont think so she said that bloody rains soaked right into my bones all i want is to pick up something for dinner then a long hot bath and a good book to curl up with some other time she smiled and pushed open the door yes some other time maybe she should have accepted bankss offer of a drink annie thought as she crossed the market square it wouldnt have done any harm just a quick drink and a chat she didnt want to seem to be always giving him the brushoff and it wasnt as if the men were exactly queuing up to take her out but things were still a little sensitive and her inner voice told her to back off so she did not that she always did what her inner voice told her to if she had done that she would never have got in trouble in her life and what a boring old time that would have been but this time she listened at least for now though she could still smell it in the air the rain had stopped and the evening had turned quite mild colored lights hung across market street and around the cross and the shoppers were out in force she was lucky that most of the shops were staying open late until christmas or shed have nothing but a couple of moldy old carrots and potatoes for dinner there was the indian shop on gallows view that was always open but they didnt have much selection besides that was too far away in the wrong direction what she wanted was something easy something she could boil in the bag or stick in the oven for half an hour no fuss in the end it was a tossup between vegetarian lasagna and indonesian curry the lasagna won mostly because she had a bottle of sainsburys chianti at home that would complement it nicely she also needed eggs milk cereal and bread for breakfast as she wandered the busy aisles casting her eyes over the myriad varieties of meals specially prepared for those who dined alone she remembered a book she had read many years ago something her father had given her that explained the underhand strategies supermarkets use to make you buy things you dont want the lighting for a start and the soft hypnotic music at this time of year of course it was all christmas music played in a cheery sugary sort of style annie sometimes thought that if she heard one more falalalala she would scream the manufacturers also used certain colors in packaging their products and there was something about bright things being placed at eye level that just made you reach out and grab them she couldnt remember all the details but the book had made an impression on her and she always felt manipulated when she left a supermarket with more than she had intended to buy which she always did it was the chocolate ice cream this time it had hardly been at eye level nor was the package of a color that made you reach for it but even stuck away in the freezer it had seemed to be screaming buy me buy me and now it nestled in her basket as she waited in the queue to pay maybe if she had been at eastvale a couple of months she thought then she might have taken banks up on his offer it was just too soon too soon after their affair and too soon after her transfer if truth be told she still didnt trust herself with him either a couple of drinks might loosen her inhibitions a bit too much as they almost had the last time shed been out with him then where would she be it had been all right sleeping with banks when she worked out of harkside and he worked out of eastvale but if they were both in the same station it could be awkward suddenly as she was queuing up to pay annie saw someone she knew someone she had never expected to see again not here not anywhere and someone she had never wanted to set eyes on again he was walking into the wines and spirits section as far as she could tell he hadnt seen her what the hell was he doing here annie felt her skin turn clammy and her heart start to pound thatll be five pounds seventytwo pee please love said the plump smiling woman at the checkout desk annie fiddled around in her purse and found a fivepound note and four twentypee pieces which she promptly dropped from her shaking hands all over the floor she picked them up and handed them to the woman whats up love you look as if youve seen a ghost something like that annie muttered hurriedly putting away her purse and heading out with her groceries she risked one quick glance over her shoulder he was standing by the bargain reds section scanning the labels and prices she was still certain that he hadnt seen her she burst out onto york road and took a gulp of fresh air her heart was still beating fast and she felt herself shaking inside it was wayne dalton she was sure of it detective inspector wayne dalton one of the two men who had held her down while a third had raped her over two years ago banks knew he shouldnt have asked annie out like that on impulse and he hoped he hadnt put her off for good he didnt want to appear to be pestering her especially as they worked together and he was technically her boss not that annie would ever accuse him of sexual harassment but as it happened his evening turned out to be just what he needed he made a cheeseandonion sandwich for tea and ate it while he read the paper in the kitchen his son brian phoned at about nine oclock excited about the cd on a whim banks asked if he had ever heard of barry clough he hadnt but said hed ask around among his colleagues in the business he also reminded banks that punk had been a long time ago as if banks needed reminding of that after lunch with emily riddle banks also felt the need to talk to tracy it would help balance his sanity after listening to emily for over an hour he had come away with a very warped idea about teenage girls he needed to know they werent all like her especially his own daughter amidst all the craziness though and after all shed been through emily still seemed to have a cool head on her shoulders if her talk about getting her alevels and going to university was to believed like banks tracy had had to work hard to get where she was she was a bright girl but not one of those who dont have to apply themselves the harder she worked the higher her marks emily seemed to think her progress in the world was simply a matter of choice of deciding what to do and then having it fall into her lap perhaps it was for her now that he had got a little beyond first impressions banks couldnt help but like emily but she was the kind of girl he fretted about and the kind who constantly exasperated him he almost felt sorry for jimmy riddle tracy didnt answer out with damon no doubt he left her a message nothing urgent just to call if she didnt get in too late for a change from peat banks lit a log fire in the hearth though it wasnt a particularly cold evening and sat down in the old armchair he had picked up at a local estate auction the blue walls that he had worried might feel cold in winter had turned out just fine he thought as he watched the shadows cast by the flames flicker over them knotty wood spat and crackled in the fireplace taking banks back to his childhood when the coal they used sometimes hissed and spat there was no other source of heat in the house so it was his fathers job in winter to get up while it was still dark and light the fire usually when banks came down for his jam and bread before school there was a good blaze going and it had taken most of the chill off the cool damp night air the years in between in various london flats and the eastvale semi he hadnt had a coal or log fire only gas or electric so it was a luxury he was availing himself of a lot this winter he put the first cd of miles daviss carnegie hall concert on the one with gil evans and his orchestra picked up the latest kate atkinson novel which lay facedown on the chair arm about half read and lit a cigarette though he had intended an early night he found himself enjoying both the music and the book so much that he put another log on the fire and slipped in the second cd it was a quarter past eleven and he had set the book aside for a few moments to listen to the live version of the adagio from rodrigos concierto de aranjuez when the telephone rang thinking it might be tracy he turned down the stereo and snatched up the phone the first thing that assaulted his ears was loud music in the background he couldnt make out exactly what it was but it sounded like some sort of postravetechnodance mix the next thing to assail him was the squeaky voice of dc rickerd shouting over the music sir yes sighed banks what is it sorry to bother you sir but im on duty tonight i know that what is it will you get to the point and do you have to shout so loud well im at the bar none sir its pretty noisy here the bar none was one of eastvales most popular nightclubs for the young crowd situated under the shops across the market square from the police station it usually opened up an hour or so before pub closing time and attracted those kids who were too pissed to drive to leeds or manchester where there were far better clubs look said banks if theres been a fight or something i dont want to know no sir its nothing like that well banks lost rickerds next words to a surge in the background noise can you get them to turn the music down he yelled its a suspicious death rickerd said how suspicious well shes dead sir im pretty sure of that inspector jessup agrees with me sir and the blokes from the ambulance it looks as if somebody beat her up pretty badly if chris jessup inspector in the uniformed branch thought it was serious enough to call banks in then it probably was who is the victim he asked youd better get down here sir here he became inaudible again cant handle myself how many of you are there inspector jessup and me and three pcs sir that should be enough im sure inspector jessup knows exactly what to do help him make sure no one leaves and secure the scene we dont want anyone else tramping about near the body until i get there including the ambulance crew understand yes sir better put a call through to dr burns too itll take him a while to get there banks was about to ask rickerd to send for the soco unit but decided to wait until he could assess the scene himself no sense spending the taxpayers money until he knew exactly what he was dealing with have you got the victims name yes sir she had a driving license and one of those proofofage cards some of the clubs give out to kids its got her photo on it good work whats her name rickerd its walker sir ruth walker shit said banks ill be right there could it be the same ruth walker banks had talked to in london if so what the hell was she doing in an eastvale nightclub unless she had come up from london to go clubbing with emily riddle and if ruth was dead then banks wouldnt be at all surprised if emily was in trouble too banks picked up his cigarettes and grabbed his leather jacket off the hook at the back of the door before he left he went back to the phone it was a snap decision between jim hatchley who lived in eastvale and annie cabbot who had as long a drive as banks annie won hands down he would have been a liar if he had denied any personal preference for annies charms over jim hatchleys ugly mug but he didnt do it from entirely selfish motives annie was new to eastvale and she needed all the experience she could get she was ambitious whereas hatchley was content to remain a ds for the rest of his days annie would welcome the opportunity whereas hatchley would grumble at being dragged out of bed in the middle of the night hatchley had his wife and baby to consider while annie lived alone there you go rationalizing banks thought as he dialed her number he could justify calling her until the cows came home if he had to but what it came down to was that he still fancied her and he thought with sandra announcing she wanted to divorce and remarry that he might be able to get over the stumbling blocks that had derailed him and annie in the first place and rekindle what they once had but even that desire took second place to his concern about ruth walker and emily riddle annie drove home like a bat out of hell and when she got to her tiny terrace cottage she locked bolted and chained the door then checked the back and all the windows only when she was certain that everything was as secure as it could be did she pour herself a large glass of wine and sit down her hand was still shaking she noticed as she took a gulp and shed thought shed got over her experience the counseling had helped at first but when the counselor said she could do no more it had been annies own inner strength that pulled her through through meditation yoga and diet she had slowly healed herself the country seclusion had helped too leaving a big city force for a peaceful backwater like harkside she still had dreams in which she experienced the fear claustrophobia and powerlessness she had felt during the assault and woke up sweating and screaming and she still had dark moods in which she felt worthless and tainted but not so often and she could handle them now she knew where they came from and could almost stand outside looking down on them separating herself from the bad feelings isolating them as you would a tumor she had even got so far after two years as allowing herself that romantic and sexual involvement with banks which had been extremely satisfying not least because it pleased her to find she was still capable of it what had ended that was nothing at all to do with her rape experience it was plain oldfashioned fear of involvement of emotional entanglement something that had always been a part of her what the hell was wayne dalton doing in eastvale that was what she wanted to know was he on a case had he been reassigned to western divisional headquarters she didnt think she could handle working with him not after what happened the last she had heard he had transferred to the met surely he couldnt be seeking her out coming to torment her true she had complained to their chief super the following morning but there was no evidence it was simply her word against the three of them the chief super knew that something had gone on and he also knew it was something he didnt want aired in his station thank you very much so annie got shipped out sharpish and the three men after being rapped on the knuckles were encouraged to transfer at their leisure later in her bath annie remembered wayne daltons flushed and sweating face as he held her the little ginger hairs up his nose as he stood over her waiting his turn a turn that never came she remembered walking the streets for hours after her escape languishing in her bath just like now listening to the radio the sounds of normal life and scrubbing their filth from her body something she shouldnt have done something she in her turn had advised rape victims not to do but it was far easier to say do as i say not as i do at the time she hadnt thought had only wanted an escape a way of undoing what had been done of going back in time to a day when it had never happened foolish perhaps but perfectly reasonable she thought and she was still in her bath on her third glass of wine when close to twenty past eleven her telephone rang it was five to twelve when banks who had driven well over the speed limit the whole way parked in the market square next to the ambulance and headed for the club door dc rickerd had got a uniformed constable to guard the entrance banks was pleased to see and had even put blueandwhite police tape across the doorway as he headed down the stone steps he was also pleased to hear that the music had been silenced and the only sounds drifting up were the murmured conversations of detained clubbers grumbling at the tables over here sir the only lights on were the colored disco lights that whirled over the dance floor eerie without the accompaniment of music and gyrating bodies banks could make out rickerd and jessup standing by the door to the ladies toilet with the ambulance crew a couple of uniformed officers and a young man before he could get there someone tugged at his sleeve excuse me are you in authority looks that way said banks the speaker wearing jeans and a white shirt was probably in his early twenties skinny with bright eyes and dilated pupils it wasnt particularly hot in the bar none but a sheen of sweat covered his face why are you keeping us here its been nearly an hour now you cant just keep us here its my understanding that theres been a serious crime sir said banks until we get things sorted im afraid none of you is going anywhere he noticed the boy was still holding his sleeve and plucked it away but this is outrageous i want to go home banks leaned forward close enough to smell the beer and fish and chips on his breath look sonny he whispered go sit down with your mates and be quiet one more word out of you and ill have the drugs squad down on you like a ton of bricks understand the boy looked as if he was going to protest further but thought better of it and swayed over to the table where his friends sat banks continued on his way to meet rickerd and jessup one of the ambulance crew looked at him and shook his head slowly annie cabbot hadnt arrived yet she had sounded edgy when hed called and he had wondered if he had woken her she said not in here sir said a wheyfaced rickerd pointing into the ladies its not very pretty someone had placed more tape at the entrance effectively creating an inner crime scene that was often useful as you could afford to let some people in the first scene and lead them to think they were privileged but you kept the real crime scene uncontaminated whos he banks gestured toward the young man beside rickerd he found her sir okay keep an eye on him ill talk to him later did you call dr burns yes sir he said hed get here as soon as he could banks turned to inspector jessup what happened chris call came it at six minutes past eleven that lad you just noticed names darren hirst it seems he was with the victim she went to the toilet and didnt come out he got worried went in for a butchers and called us banks slipped on his latex gloves and stepped under the tape the ladies toilet was small given the size of the club white tile three stalls two sinks under a long mirror the ubiquitous condom machine hung on the wall the kind that sells all sorts of flavors and colors lager amp lime rhubarb amp custard curry amp chips the stalls had flimsy wooden doors cindy sucks black cock was scrawled in lipstick across the front of one of them its this one sir said rickerd pointing to the end stall was it locked yes sir how did you open it rickerd took off his glasses and wiped them with a white handkerchief it was a habit banks had noticed in him before from the next stall sir i stood on the toilet seat leaned over with a stick and slipped the bolt it was easy enough were bloody lucky the door opens outwards a lockedtoilet mystery then banks muttered thinking rickerd had shown more initiative than he would have expected i didnt disturb anything any more than necessary sir just to establish who she was and that she was dead inspector jessup supervised and the others made sure no one left thats all right you did well he pulled the door slowly toward him with his fingertips anxious not to mess up an already messy scene you wont believe this sir rickerd said ive never seen anything like it neither had banks the girls body was wedged crabwise from wall to wall her back arched about two feet over the toilet knees jammed against one wall and her shoulders pushed up hard against the other her neck bent at an awkward angle a trickle of blood had run from her nose and there were contusions on her face and head broken mirror glass and white powder lay scattered on the floor amid the spilled contents of her handbag banks knew that the eyes of the dead have no expression but hers seemed full of terror and agony as if she had looked the grim reaper right in the eye her face was dark suffused with blood and the corners of her mouth were turned up in a parody of a grin but the worst thing about it all the thing that caused bankss blood to scream in his ears and his knees to turn watery and bring him so close to falling down that he had to grab on to the doorjamb to stay on his feet was that the body wasnt ruth walkers at all it was emily riddles alan the voice seemed to reach bankss ears from a great distance alan so now youre hanging around ladies toilets eh banks felt someone touch his sleeve and he turned to see annie cabbot standing in the doorway never had he seen a more welcome sight he wanted to fall forward into her arms have her stroke his head and kiss his face and tell him everything was all right hed just had a bad dream thats all and it would all be gone in the morning alan youre pale as ashes are you all right banks moved away from the doorway to let annie have a look ive got a daughter not much older than her he said annie frowned and edged forward banks watched her and noticed the way her eyeballs flicked around taking in all the details the bodys unusual position the broken mirror the white powder the spilled cosmetics the contusions some of the buttons on emilys black silk blouse had popped and the dark spider tattoo was visible against the pale skin below her navel ring annie touched nothing but seemed to absorb everything and when she had finished even she was pale i see what you mean she said when they had both gone to stand outside the toilet again poor cow what do you think happened it looks as if someone got in there with her and beat the living shit out of her but that doesnt make sense no said annie theres hardly enough room for one let alone space to swing a few punches and the stall was locked banks added i suppose she could have been beaten elsewhere then crawled inside and locked it herself before she died maybe in a vain attempt to keep her attacker out he shrugged it seemed a pretty thin thesis even if she had locked herself in there to escape a beating how had she ended up arched crabwise over the toilet it was the most unusual body position banks had ever seen and though he had a glimmer of an idea about what might have caused it he needed the expert knowledge of a doctor well have to wait for the doc ah speak of the devil dr burns walked across the dance floor and greeted them where is she he asked banks pointed toward the ladies try not to disturb things too much we havent got photographs yet ill do my best burns passed under the tape call the socos and the photographer banks said to annie he gestured toward rickerd and lowered his voice dc rickerd phoned me and i wanted to be certain we really had a crime on our hands before making a hue and cry what about the people in the club nobody leaves including the bar staff chris jessups lads have instructions to keep them all where they are theres no telling how many left between the boyfriends phone call and jessups arrival though its still early for this kind of place said annie people would be more likely to be arriving than leaving unless theyd just killed someone ask one of the uniforms to take everyones name and address annie turned to go banks called after her and annie yes be prepared for one of the biggest shitstorms thats ever come your way as a copper why because the victims emily riddle the chief constables daughter jesus christ said annie exactly annie went off to attend to her duties while banks collared darren hirst the boy who had found the body he seemed still in shock trembling tears in his eyes banks could understand that having seen emilys body himself he had seen many forms of death in his years as a policeman and though he never quite got inured to it he certainly had an advantage over the boy leaving a uniformed constable guarding the entrance to the toilet banks led darren to an empty table the clubs manager hovered nearby clearly wanting to know what was going on but not daring to ask banks waved him over what time did you open tonight he asked ten oclock it starts slow we dont usually get much of a crowd until after eleven has this place got surveillance cameras on order great bar still open the other policeman said i shouldnt serve any more drinks he said quite right too said banks but this lads had a bit of a shock and i cant say ive had a pleasant surprise either so bring us a couple of double brandies will you i thought you werent supposed to drink on duty just bring the drinks all right mate no need to get shirty the bartender strode off when he came back he plonked the drinks down on the table the measures looked small but banks paid him anyway when can i go home the man asked only if were not serving drinks were not making any money see and theres not a lot of point staying open youre not open said banks and if i get much more of that crap out of you you wont be opening again in the foreseeable future theres a dead girl in your toilets in case you hadnt heard fucking drug addicts the bartender muttered as he stalked away all right darren said banks when the bartender was out of earshot like to tell me what happened he lit a cigarette darren refused his offer of one the brandy was poor quality but its bite put a bit of warmth back in bankss veins she said she wasnt feeling well darren began after a sip of brandy a little color crept back into his cheeks back up a bit said banks how well did you know her was she your girlfriend no nothing like that i mean i know her like in the group we were just friends thats all we all hang out together shes a bit weird and wild is emily but she can be a lot of fun we started in the cross keys down castle hill i know it after that we just walked around town a bit and dropped in for a quick drink at the queens arms then we came here he pointed to a group of shellshocked kids at a table across the room the others are over there what time did you meet in the cross keys about half past six seven oclock do you remember what time emily got there she was the last to arrive mustve been about seven maybe a few minutes later so that left emily four hours unaccounted for between the threeoclock appointment she had mentioned to banks and meeting her friends in the cross keys how did she seem fine normal for emily and what time did you come here about half ten it was pretty quiet like the barman says it doesnt usually get going till half past eleven or so but they serve drinks and theres music so you can dance how many people would you say were here not a lot they kept coming in like but it wasnt that busy more than now darren looked around no about this many what happened next we got some drinks in then emily went to the toilet we were dancing after that i remember then she said she wasnt feeling very well what did she say was wrong with her darren shook his head just that she didnt feel well she said she was getting a stiff neck he rubbed his own neck and looked at banks was it drugs it was drugs wasnt it why do you ask that just the way she was behaving you know like she was flying up there in her own world like i said shes pretty wild how well did you know emily darren i told you hardly at all when she was home from school for the holidays shed hang out with me and rick and jackie and tina over there thats all i was never her boyfriend or anything she wasnt interested in me like that we just danced sometimes went out with the gang had fun he ran his hand over his greasy dark hair did you ever supply her with drugs darren me never i dont touch them there was something in his tone that made banks believe him for the moment okay so she felt poorly what happened next she said she thought she might need some more medicine what did she mean by that more drugs i assumed whatever she was taking go on so she went back to the toilet how long after her first visit dunno fifteen twenty minutes maybe banks looked up and saw peter darby the photographer come in with his battered pentax hanging around his neck banks pointed toward the toilets where the uniformed policeman still stood on guard and darby nodded as he headed toward the tape annie dropped by the table and told him the socos were on their way banks asked her to take statements from darren and emilys friends across the room he drank down the rest of his brandy and asked what happened next she was a long time i started to get worried especially with her saying she wasnt feeling well when you say a long time just how long do you mean i dont know ten minutes quarter of an hour maybe longer you dont expect someone to stay in the toilet that long if theyre all right i thought maybe she was being sick shed been drinking steadily most of the evening a really weird mix of stuff and she didnt eat anything in the cross keys or at lunchtime in the black bull banks remembered where she had also been drinking some odd concoctions were many people going in and out of the ladies toilet during that time i never really looked but the place wasnt that busy so maybe not you didnt ask anyone to check on her jackie or tina tina went in after about five minutes and came right back out she said emily was making funny sounds as if she was being sick or something and she wouldnt open the door of the stall wouldnt or couldnt darren shrugged what did you do then i thought about it for a bit then i decided to go in and see what was up when was this mustve been about five or ten minutes later when she still hadnt come out had others been in and out in the meantime like i said i didnt keep an eye on the place all the time but i saw a couple of girls come and go are they still here darren pointed out two of the girls at separate tables okay said banks well talk to them later they didnt say if anything was wrong though no just tina thought she was being sick so you went in the ladies yourself eventually yes i was worried i mean id been dancing with her i felt she was sort of your responsibility in a way yes even though she wasnt your girlfriend she was still a friend what did you find in there darren looked away and turned pale again you know youve seen it god it was horrible its like she wasnt even human im sorry to put you through it darren but it could be important describe to me what you found was anyone else in there at the time no was the stall door locked yes so how did you know there was something wrong first i called her name and she didnt answer then i just like listened at the door and i couldnt hear anything no sounds of her being sick or even breathing i got really scared then so what did you do i went into the next stall and climbed on the toilet the walls dont come right up to the ceiling so you can lean over and look down thats when i saw her she was looking up at me all bruised and twisted and her eyes he put his head in his hands and started to sob banks touched his shoulder its all right darren go ahead and cry darren let his tears run their course then wiped his eyes with his sleeve and looked up who could do something like that we dont know we dont know how either apart from the two girls you mentioned did you see anyone else go in the toilet while emily was in there sick no but i told you i wasnt looking all the time you must have been looking quite often though if you were worried you must have been keeping an eye on the door to see if emily came out again i suppose so but i didnt notice anyone else no see any men go in no did anyone come in and out while you were there checking on her no look i didnt do this youre not nobodys suggesting that darren im just trying to get everything clear thats all when you saw her did you know that she was dead i couldnt know i mean i didnt take her pulse or anything i didnt touch her but her eyes were open staring and her neck was in a weird position as if someone had broken it or something and i couldnt see any signs of life what did you do i went to the manager and he phoned the police did anyone else enter the toilet before inspector jessup and dc rickerd arrived i dont think so the manager had a quick look i was with him the whole time then he phoned the police and the ambulance he stayed by the door until the policemen arrived and he wouldnt let anyone in the ladies he made a couple of girls use the mens toilet they complained i remember that but the police were quick they didnt have far to come did anyone leave the club a couple of people might have left but mostly people were arriving it was still early and i wasnt really paying attention i was just worried about emily and afterwards i was sort of in shock the music kept going for quite a long time after after i found her people were still dancing even after the police came they didnt really know anything serious had happened okay darren nearly finished youre doing really well did anything at all odd happen during the evening either here or when you were at the cross keys or the queens arms that gave you cause for concern about emily no nothing i can think of she seemed in good spirits yeah she didnt get into an argument with anyone no did she make any telephone calls not that i remember everything was fine did she mention drugs at all no did you get the impression she was on drugs before you got here she might have been a bit high when she arrived at the cross keys at seven yes i mean she wasnt out of it or anything just a bit giddy but it wore off that was probably when she got the drugs banks thought between leaving him in the black bull and arriving at the cross keys four hours later shed been smoking grass or snorting coke with someone in the meantime christ why hadnt he asked her where she was going would she have told him anyway did you see her talking to anyone in here before she went to the toilet he asked only us i mean we got a table together we didnt know anyone else here i went to get the drinks in could she have bought the drugs from someone here i suppose she couldnve done but i didnt see her inside the toilets maybe its possible what about the cross keys the cross keys wasnt exactly the mecca of drugs in the way the black bull was but it wasnt an innocent either did you see her talking to any strangers there no i dont think so did she disappear for any length of time no okay darren youll have to give a formal statement later but its nothing to worry about can i go now im afraid not can i sit with my friends of course is it okay if i use my mobile id like to call my mum and dad tell them you know i might be late sorry darren said banks not yet if you really need to let them know just tell one of the uniformed officers and hell see to it for you go sit with your friends now darren slouched off to the table and banks got up and turned to see dr burns coming out of the toilet peter darbys camera flashed in the open door behind him so what is it banks asked dr burns when they found a table at which they couldnt be overheard he had his own suspicions though he had never seen an actual case before but he wanted dr burns to get there first it was partly a matter of not wanting to look like an idiot not jumping to conclusions after all she could have been beaten to death im not certain yet said burns shaking his head but your immediate impression ill bet youve got a pretty good idea burns grimaced we doctors dont like giving our immediate impressions was she beaten up i very much doubt it the bruising at a guess id say that happened from her head banging into the walls during the convulsions hang on a minute are you all right im fine banks fumbled for another cigarette to take the taste of bile out of his mouth what do you mean convulsions as i said i dont think anyone attacked her she was alone in there you noticed the white powder and the broken mirror banks nodded cocaine most likely are you saying she died of a cocaine overdose hold on a minute i never said that but its possible burns paused hmm possible a cocaine overdose can cause spasms and convulsions in extreme cases but it would have to be extremely pure as i said its possible but its not the most likely explanation what is then how long has she been dead they called the police at six minutes after eleven so it must have happened a bit before then i got here at ten to twelve burns looked at his watch and its twenty past now that means she cant have been dead much more than say an hour and a half yet rigors complete thats highly unusual i assume you also noticed the stiffness yes so what do you think killed her at a guess and its just a guess until we get toxicology results id say it was strychnine poisoning it crossed my mind too though im far from being an expert ive never actually seen a case before ive only read about it in textbooks me too its really quite rare these days but that would cause the convulsions shed have been thrashing herself about the tiny stall quite enough to cause the bruises and contusions you saw on her body her back was also arched in a way indicative of final strychnine spasms its called opisthotonos and you must have noticed the way the facial muscles were twisted in a sort of extreme grimace or grin risus sardonicus and the darkness of the face the wild staring eyes the images were impossible to forget and banks knew he would have nightmares about them for years the way he still had about the disemboweled soho prostitute dawn wadley im hesitant to commit myself without a full tox check but that wont take long its one of the easiest poisonous substances to test for ive never investigated a death by strychnine before but thats what it looks like to me only my immediate impressions mind you i also touched a little of the powder to my tongue along with the numbness caused by the cocaine theres a bitter taste associated with strychnine what killed her heart shed have died of asphyxiation most likely or maybe just sheer exhaustion from the convulsions her neck may be broken too but youll have to wait for the postmortem to confirm that not pretty whichever way you look at it no deliberate though oh i would think so wouldnt you and id pretty much rule out suicide for a start even if she did want to kill herself strychnine is hardly the drug of choice ive never heard of a case besides from what i can tell it was mixed with cocaine that means she was looking for a good time not for death any chance it could just be a bad batch theres always a chance of that dealers use all kinds of weird substances to step on the drugs they sell including strychnine but not usually enough to kill a person how much would that be it varies doses as low as five milligrams can kill especially if theyre absorbed directly into the bloodstream and bypass the digestive system well soon find out if it was a bad batch anyway you mean well have a whole spate of them its possible good forbid said banks it depends on a number of factors as i said a fatal dose can vary widely what killed this girl might not kill just anyone she was pretty thin and it doesnt look as if she ate much somebody with more body weight someone more solid more robust who can say but well hear about it if it happens banks remembered how emily hadnt eaten lunch darren said she hadnt eaten dinner either but if she inhaled it the stomach contents wouldnt matter not as much as if shed ingested it no but general health and stomach contents are all factors we have to take into account and if its not a bad batch then someone had it in for her specifically that just about sums it up either way you look at it somebody killed her but thats your realm isnt it ah here come the cosmonauts banks looked up and saw the socos entering in their white protective overalls ill arrange for the mortuary wagon said dr burns id better tell them theyll probably need a crowbar to prize her out of there and ill get in touch with dr glendenning first thing in the morning knowing him hell have her opened up by lunchtime he stood but paused a moment before leaving did you know her alan you seem to be taking this very much to heart i knew her slightly said banks i might as well tell you now youll find out soon enough shes the chief constables daughter dr burnss reaction was exactly the same as annies and doc yes lets keep this under our hats for the time being shall we the strychnine my lips are sealed dr burns turned and left for a moment banks stood alone watching the spinning disco lights and listening to mumbled conversations around him peter darby came out of the toilet and said hed got what he wanted the socos were in there taking the place apart collecting samples for analysis banks didnt envy them the task of working in a toilet you never knew what you might catch vic manson would soon be dusting for prints of which hed probably find as many as the socos would public hairs and before long the mortuary wagon would come and whisk emily riddles body off to the basement of eastvale infirmary all so bloody predictable routines banks had been part of time and time again but this time he wanted to cry cry and get ratarsed he couldnt help but remember emilys excited talk about her future that lunchtime about how she didnt fancy poughkeepsie or bryn mawr because of the sound of their names he remembered the time she turned up at the hotel in london passing herself off as his daughter how her dress slid to the ground and he saw her white and naked remembered her stoned adolescent attempt at seducing him god if only she knew how close shed come then the way she curled up in the fetal position like a little child on the bed her thumb in her mouth the blanket covering her while he sat in the armchair smoking and listening to dawn upshaw sing about sleep and the windows rattled and the winter sun rose and tried to claw its way through the gray greasy clouds dead and perhaps because of him because he had respected his vow of discretion and done nothing despite all his misgivings annie came over from the table where she had been talking to emilys friends banks told her what dr burns had said about strychnine annie whistled learn anything over there he asked not a lot they say she seemed a bit high when she arrived at the cross keys and theyre certain she took something here the first time she went to the toilet same as darren says cant have been the same batch though can it i suppose not do you believe them for the most part maybe well lean on them a bit harder tomorrow what it looks like is that the first time she snorted made her feel ill shortly afterwards so she went back for more and the convulsions hit so what now we can start by searching everyone on the premises theyre all suspects at the moment including the bar staff can you get that organized of course i very much doubt wed have any problems arguing reasonable suspicion do you i doubt it pace rules stated that you had to have reasonable suspicion before searching people and if you searched them somewhere other than at the police station without first arresting them you had to have reasonable grounds for assuming they might be a danger to themselves or others with the chief constables daughter lying dead of possible strychnine poisoning only a few yards away banks didnt think theyd have much trouble arguing their case take it easy though if anyone kicks up a fuss take him over to the station and have the custody officer deal with him i want this done by the book youd better let detective superintendent gristhorpe know too will do i also want all the known coke dealers in the area brought in for questioning and well need to activate the incident room over at the station he looked at his watch we might not be able to get everything in order until morning especially as far as the civilian staff are concerned but in the meantime well need an office manager dc rickerd banks looked at rickerd who was taking a statement at the other side of the club good idea he said let him show his mettle while rickerd demonstrated only minimal detective skills he had an almost obsessive interest in details and the minutiae of organization exactly what a good office manager needed as it was his job to supervise the recording and tracking of all information retrieved both from a crime scene and during an investigation if truth be told you needed more than a skill for organization but rickerd would do maybe he would find his true métier banks knew that having a trainspotter in the department would come in useful one day rickerd was just the kind to carry around that little book full of printed train numbers and draw a neat line with pen and ruler through each one he actually saw he was too young for the steam trains though when banks was a kid there were still a few of them in service many with exotic names like the flying scotsman sleek streamlined beauties many of bankss friends had been trainspotters but standing on a windy station platform all day and noting down numbers to cross off later in a little book had never appealed to him these days with all the diesels looking like clones of one another there didnt seem to be much point in trainspotting anymore banks called rickerd over and explained what he wanted him to do rickerd went off looking pleased with himself to be given such responsibility then banks lit a cigarette and leaned against a pillar id better go tell her parents he sighed one of the uniforms can do that annie put her hand on his arm in a curiously intimate gesture to be quite honest alan you look all in maybe you should let me take you home wouldnt that be nice banks thought home annie maybe even bed the adagio from concierto de aranjuez drifting up from downstairs the clock put back so that none of this had ever happened no he said ive got to tell them myself i owe them that much annie frowned i dont understand what do you owe them banks smiled ill tell you all about it later then he walked up the stairs to the deserted market square banks felt sick and heavy with dread as he approached riddles house close to onethirty that morning the old mill stood in almost complete darkness behind the privet hedge but a glimmer of light showed through the curtains of one of the groundfloor rooms and banks wondered if it had been left on as a means of discouraging burglars he knew it hadnt when he saw the curtain twitch at the sound of his car on the gravel drive he should have known jimmy riddle would be up working well after midnight hard work and long hours were what had got him where he was in the first place when he turned the engine off he could hear the old millrace running down the garden it reminded him of gratly falls outside his own modest cottage he hardly had time to knock before a hall light came on and the door opened riddle stood there in an oxford shirt and gray chinos it was the first time banks had seen him in casual dress banks i thought that was your car what on earth but his voice trailed off as recognition that something was seriously wrong crept into his features whether hed been a good one or not riddle had been a copper for long enough to know that the call in the middle of the night was hardly a social one he knew enough to read the expression on bankss face maybe we could sit down have a drink banks said as riddle stood aside to let him in tell me first said riddle leaning back on the door after he closed it banks couldnt look him in the eye im sorry sir he said the honorific sounded odd even as he spoke the word he had never called riddle sir before except in a sarcastic tone its emily isnt it banks nodded my god sir banks took riddles elbow and guided him into the living room riddle collapsed into an armchair and banks found the cocktail cabinet he poured them both a stiff whiskey he was beyond worrying about drink driving at that point riddle held the glass but didnt drink from it right away shes dead isnt she he said im afraid so what happened how were not sure yet sir was there an accident a car crash no it was nothing like that out with it man this is my daughter were talking about i know that sir thats why im trying to tread softly too late for that banks what was it drugs partly what do you mean partly either it was or it wasnt tell me what happened to her banks paused it was a terrible thing to tell a dead girls father how painfully she had died but he reminded himself that riddle was also chief constable a professional and he would find out soon enough anyway best he find out now were keeping this strictly confidential for the time being but dr burns thinks it might have been cocaine spiked with strychnine riddle jerked forward and spilled some whiskey on his trousers he didnt even bother to wipe it off strychnine my god how i dont understand she was taking cocaine at a nightclub in eastvale banks said the bar none you might have heard of it riddle shook his head anyway if the doctor is right somebody must have put strychnine in her cocaine christ banks do you realize what youre saying i do sir im saying that in all likelihood your daughter was murdered is this some sort of sick joke believe me i wish it were riddle ran his hand over his shiny bald skull a gesture banks had often thought ridiculous in the past now it reeked of despair he drank some of his whiskey before asking the hopeless question everyone asks in his situation youre sure theres no mistake no mistake sir i saw her myself i know its no consolation but it must have been very fast banks lied she cant have suffered very much rubbish im not an idiot banks ive studied the textbook i know what strychnine does shed have gone into convulsions bent her spine shed have dont banks said theres no sense torturing yourself who riddle asked who would want to do something like that to emily have you noticed anything strange while shes been here no what about today the last few days any changes in her behavior no look you went to london banks you found her what about the people she was hanging around with down there this clough character do you think he could have had something to do with it banks paused barry clough had been the first to come to his mind when dr burns had told him about the poisoned cocaine he also remembered how emily had told him that clough hated to lose his prize possessions thats a distinct possibility he said riddle plucked at the creases of his trousers then he let out a long sigh youll do what you have to do banks i know that wherever it leads you yes sir is there what anything you want to tell me riddle paused he seemed to think hard for a few moments then he shook his head im sorry i cant help you its out of my hands now he knocked back the rest of the whiskey ill go to the mortuary and identify her itll wait till morning riddle got up and started pacing the room but i must do something i cant just i mean christ man youve just told me my daughters been murdered poisoned what do you expect me to do sit down and cry take a bloody sleeping pill im a policeman banks i have to do something everything possible is being done said banks i think youd be best off spending the time with your wife and son dont softsoap me banks my god just wait till the press gets hold of this here we go again thought banks his bloody reputation it was only out of respect for riddles bereavement that banks said mildly they hadnt got a whiff when i left the scene but i dont suppose itll take them long the place will be swarming with them come morning we want to try and keep the strychnine aspect quiet riddle seemed to collapse in on himself all his energy gone he looked tired ill wake up ros and tell her i appreciate your coming banks i mean personally you know not sending someone else the best thing you can do is get back to the scene and stay on top of things ill be depending on you and for once i dont care how many bloody corners you cut or whose feet you tread on yes sir riddle was right probably the best thing banks could do right now was throw himself into the investigation besides people need to be alone with their grief ill need to talk to you both at some point he said tomorrow of course they heard a sound from the doorway and turned benjamin riddle stood there in his pajamas clutching a battered teddy bear he rubbed his eyes i heard voices daddy i was scared what is it is something wrong it was still dark when banks drove to eastvale the following morning and a thin mist nuzzled in the dips and hollows of the road and clung to the buildings the cobbles and the ancient cross in the market square it was that time of morning when lights were coming on in the small offices above the shops some of which were already open and the mist diffused their light like thin gauze the air was mild and clammy across the square the bar none was still taped off and a uniformed officer stood on guard after leaving riddles house the previous night banks had returned to the club to find the socos still at work and annie taking statements detective superintendent gristhorpe had also driven in all the way from lyndgarth banks had hung around for a while talking the scene over with gristhorpe but there was nothing more he could do there when the media people started pestering him for comments he drove home and spent a couple of sleepless hours on the sofa thinking about emily riddles terrible death before heading right back to the station he tried to keep at bay the feelings of guilt that were crowding at the edge of his mind like circling sharks he succeeded only partially and that was because he had a job to do something to focus on and exclude the rest the problem was that the bad feelings would continue to accumulate even when he wasnt looking and the day would come when there were so many of them he could no longer ignore them by then he knew from experience it was usually too late to end up feeling good about himself for the time being though he couldnt afford the selfindulgence of guilt the renovators hadnt turned up yet so things were quiet in the extension banks went to his office read his copies of last nights reports and made some notes on his own impressions he did this as most good coppers did for himself not for the files they were very personal impressions and sometimes they could lead somewhere often not whatever else they were they were no substitute for facts or evidence he included in his notes for example his sense that darren hirst was telling the truth and a gut feeling that emily had got the drugs somewhere other than the cross keys or the bar none already he noted from the reports a couple of very sleepy local dealers were cooling their heels in the detention cells in the basement of the station more would soon follow by the time the sun was sniffing its nose at the cloudy horizon the station was humming with activity the incident room was quickly taking on form and function and dc rickerd had been up all night getting it organized computer links had been set up phone lines activated and civilian staff were drifting in for datainput logging and recording duties by the time banks felt the need for his breakfast coffee acc mclaughlin had arrived from county headquarters at newby wiske outside northallerton he set up camp in the boardroom and fifteen or twenty minutes later banks was summoned in mclaughlin annie cabbot and detective superintendent gristhorpe were waiting for him banks greeted them and sat down annie looked tired and he imagined she had got as little sleep as he had she also seemed nervous which was unusual for her red ron mclaughlin was about fifty tall and slim with short thinning gray hair combed forward and a small gray mustache he wore silverrimmed glasses which balanced on the tip of his nose and he had a habit of peering over them at whomever he was speaking to his eyes were the same shade of gray as his hair ah dci banks he said then he shuffled some papers and looked over his glasses right ill get straight down to brass tacks i met with chief constable riddle this morning in fact he came to see me and he was most emphatic that he wanted you to head the investigation into his daughters death what do you think of that i had hoped for the case said banks but in all honesty i never expected to be given it why not because i knew the deceased sir only vaguely but i knew her and her family i assumed wed have to bring in someone from outside that would be normal procedure mclaughlin scratched his earlobe the chief constable did explain your involvement he went on apparently he asked you to go to london and find his daughter which you did is that correct yes sir and you then accompanied her back home yes sir banks felt annie staring at him but didnt turn to meet her look i hardly think that disqualifies you from acting as senior investigating officer do you banks thought for a moment he would have to tell red ron about the lunch someone was bound to come forward about that and it wouldnt take long now that emilys murder had featured on the breakfast news enough people in the black bull had noticed them and probably at least one or two of them knew who banks was on the other hand if he told mclaughlin everything hed be off the case for certain no matter what riddle wanted it was a delicate balancing act there was also a risk that someone from the hotel fiftyfive in london would see emilys photo in the papers and come forward although banks thought that had been long enough ago and emily had looked sufficiently different that night dressed up for the party her hair piled on top of her head that it was probably very unlikely still if banks accepted the post as sio he would be in the best position possible to head off any trouble at the pass he also knew far more about emilys life in london than anyone else up there which gave him an advantage when it came to tracking down possible leads it was bloody unethical he knew that probably more unethical than anything hed done before after all one of riddles bugbears had been that banks too often acted as a maverick but banks guessed that was why riddle had asked him to go to london and that was why he now wanted him to head the investigation riddle had said as much last night no sir banks answered finally id like to take the case he was aware as he spoke the words that he might well be digging his own grave the last thing he needed to do was give the new acc a reason for hating his guts right off the bat but it couldnt be helped emily came first here he owed her that much at least he had said he only knew her vaguely it wasnt a lie but like many unsatisfactory truths it left too much out how could banks describe the bond he had felt with emily it wasnt entirely paternal but it wasnt simple friendship either as you all know im new to this job and this region mclaughlin explained ive done my homework studied the turf but i cant hope to be up to scratch this soon according to mr riddle youre the best man for the job detective superintendent gristhorpe here agrees and nothing ive seen in your file contradicts that that was a surprise to banks he thought riddle had weighed his file down with negative reports but mclaughlin frowned and continued im not saying there arent a few black marks against you banks youve made some mistakes id like you to avoid making under my command but your case results speak for themselves theres going to be a lot of changes around here with the new organization and im hoping you can play a big part in them is that clear yes sir thats settled then said mclaughlin youll act as sio on the emily riddle case i take it youll have no objection to acting as deputy investigating officer ds cabbot no sir said annie thank you mclaughlin turned to gristhorpe and youll liaise with me at regional headquarters superintendent okay gristhorpe nodded what about holmes mclaughlin asked holmes acronym of the home office large major enquiry system was a computer database system developed since the yorkshire ripper investigation everything would be entered there from witness statements to soco reports it would all be indexed and crossindexed so that nothing got lost in the mass of disparate paperwork the way the rippers identification had i think we should activate it now said banks given the seriousness of the case ill put dc jackman on it shes a trained operator very well mclaughlin looked from banks to annie by the way dr glendenning has offered to conduct the postmortem early this afternoon so dont eat a heavy lunch i think you should both be there ill also get some more dcs assigned as soon as possible mclaughlin went on therell probably be a lot of legwork on this i understand you already have a murder investigation on the go can you handle this one too i think so sir banks remembered often having several serious cases on the go when he worked for the met officially the charlie courage murder is still di collatons case leicestershire constabulary ds cabbot did some of the preliminary interviews but i can put ds hatchley on it mclaughlin paused and made a steeple of his hands and looked over his glasses we dont want to appear as if were playing favorites ladies and gentlemen he said but theres no denying were giving this case a very high priority indeed have you any thoughts so far dci banks its too early to say sir id like to have another talk with the family maybe later today chief constable riddle said something about her hanging around with some unsavory types in london anything in that its possible said banks there was one in particular name of barry clough ill be having a very close look at him any other developments ds cabbot we searched the people in the club last night sir annie said but we didnt find anything except a few tabs of ecstasy a bit of marijuana and the odd amphetamine pill or two all according to pace i hope yes sir two people resisted and i had them taken over to the station they were cautioned by the custody officer before being stripsearched they were both carrying drugs in sufficient quantities for resale one had crystal meth the other what appears to be cocaine any connection with ms riddles death as far as we could tell sir it wasnt cut with strychnine but were holding him while it goes to the lab for tox testing mclaughlin jotted something on his pad what about cctv he asked was the club covered unfortunately said banks the bar none hasnt had any cameras installed yet but we might get something from ours the installation of closedcircuit television cameras in the market square had been a thorny issue around the division that summer when eastvale had experienced a publicorder problem caused by drunken louts gathering around the market cross after closing time fights broke out between rival gangs often in town from villages in the dale or between locals and squaddies from the nearby army base in one case an elderly female tourist was hit by flying glass and had to have sixteen stitches in her face knaresborough ripon harrogate and leeds had installed cctv in their city centers and upped their arrest rates considerably but at first the town council had poohpoohed the idea of doing the same in eastvale arguing that it would take them overbudget and that it wasnt necessary because the police station itself was located on one side of the market square and all any officer had to do was look out of the window after considerable debate and mostly because they were impressed by the rise in ripons arrest rate the council had relented and four cameras were installed on an experimental basis they fed directly into a small communications room set up on the ground floor of eastvale divisional headquarters where the tapes were routinely scanned for the faces of familiar troublemakers and any signs of criminal activity banks thought it all smacked a bit too much of big brother but was willing to admit that in a case like this the tapes might be of some value theyll at least tell us if anyone left after emily and her friends arrived at the club he went on darren hirst was too upset and confused to be certain last night good idea mclaughlin said any point staging a reconstruction banks took a deep breath now was the time i dont think so sir i had a brief lunch with emily yesterday she wanted to thank me for persuading her to return home and she also expressed some concern about this clough character go on said mclaughlin without expression banks felt annies eyes boring into the side of his head again even gristhorpe was frowning she left the black bull to meet someone or so she said at three oclock we dont know where she was between then and when she met her friends in the cross keys around seven darren said he thought she was a little high when she arrived at the cross keys so i would guess that shed been taking drugs with someone perhaps the person who gave her the poisoned cocaine after that they were together as a group all evening i think wed have more to gain from a concentrated media campaign posters television newspapers im concerned about this lunch you had with the victim said mclaughlin there was nothing to it sir we were in public view the entire time and i remained there after emily left i think she was genuinely worried about clough she didnt feel she could talk to her father but she wanted me to know why you because id met him when i was searching for her she knew id understand what she was talking about nasty piece of work then very sir did she give you any idea of where she was going or who she was meeting no sir i wish she had banks wished he had even asked her what did she talk about as i said she was grateful to me for persuading her to go home she talked about her future she wanted to take her alevels and go to university in america and she expressed concern about clough yes sir did she say hed been in touch with her threatened her or anything like that she said he hadnt contacted her but she seemed worried she said he didnt like to lose his prize possessions and she thought she saw one of his employees in the swainsdale centre do you think she knew something was going to happen to her that she was in fear for her life i wouldnt push it that far sir even so said mclaughlin she was a member of the public expressing concern over a dangerous situation she had got herself into and asking for police help wasnt she yes sir said banks relieved that mclaughlin had seen fit to throw him a life belt banks didnt see any point in telling him that emily had been drinking underage in his presence or that they had spent half a night alone together in a london hotel room good ill leave you to fill out the appropriate paperwork to that effect then so we can put it on file in case of any problems i should imagine you were busy at the time and simply postponed the paperwork yes sir perfectly understandable and you dont need me to tell you that quick positive results on this would be beneficial all around no sir with that acc ron mclaughlin left the boardroom you may leave too ds cabbot said gristhorpe alan id like a word annie left flashing banks a tight pissedoff look banks and gristhorpe looked at one another terrible business said gristhorpe no matter what you thought of jimmy riddle it is sir this lunch alan it only happened the once just the way you say it did yes sir gristhorpe grunted he was looking old banks thought his unruly hair if anything grayer lately dark bags under his eyes his normally ruddy pockmarked complexion paler than usual he also seemed to have lost weight his tweed jacket looked baggy on him still banks reminded himself gristhorpe had been up pretty much all night and he wasnt getting any younger she was a good lass banks said then he shook his head no what am i saying thats not true she was what youd call a wild child she was exasperating a pain in the arse and she no doubt ran jimmy riddle ragged but you liked her couldnt help but she was confused a bit crazy maybe rebellious a bit like you when you were a lad said gristhorpe with a smile perish the thought no she was exactly the sort of girl i hoped tracy wouldnt turn into and thank the lord she didnt maybe it was easy to admire the spirit in her because i wasnt her father and she wasnt really my problem but she was more confused than bad and i think shed have turned out all right given the chance she was just too advanced for her years i want the bastard who did this to her sir maybe more than ive ever wanted any bastard before in my career be careful alan gristhorpe leaned forward and rested his arms on the table you know as well as i do that you wouldnt be anywhere near this case if it werent for jimmy riddle but if you screw up just once because its too personal for you ill be down on you like the proverbial ton of bricks which is probably nothing to what acc mclaughlin will do got it got it said banks dont worry ill play it by the book gristhorpe leaned back and smiled at him nay alan he said you wouldnt want to do that whatd be the point of having you on the case then all im saying is dont let anger and a desire for revenge cloud you judgment look clearly at the evidence the facts before you make any moves dont go off halfcocked the way youve done in the past ill try not to said banks you do that someone knocked at the door and gristhorpe called out for him to come in it was one of the uniformed officers from downstairs a di wayne dalton northumbria cid to see dci banks sir banks raised his eyebrows and looked at gristhorpe okay he said glancing at his watch give him a cup of coffee and sit him in my office i can spare him a few minutes banks wasnt the only one who had spent a restless night annie cabbot had also lain awake during the hour or two she had spent in bed shortly before dawn her nerve ends jumping at every little sound she had tried to tell herself not to be so weak after all she had prevented dalton and his crony from raping her two years ago so why should she be worried about him now her martial arts training might be a bit rusty but she could defend herself well enough if it came to that the problem was that reason has no foothold at four or five in the morning at those hours reason sleeps and the mind breeds monsters monsters of fear of paranoia and so she had tossed and turned her minds eye flashing on images of daltons sweatglossed face and hatefilled eyes and of emily riddle dead her skinny frame wedged in a toilet cubicle at the bar none nightclub her eyes wide open in terror and facial muscles contorted into a grimace now however as she came out of the meeting and headed for her office in what little light of day there was she realized that she wasnt physically afraid of dalton she had always known he was the type who could only act violently as part of a gang his appearance had shaken her that was all stirred up memories of that night she would rather forget the only problem was that she didnt know quite what to do if anything about him she thought of telling banks but dismissed the idea quickly if truth be told she was pissed off at him why hadnt he told her about his relationship with the victim last night there had been plenty of time it would have made her feel more like a dio and less like a bloody idiot this morning when the acc brought the matter up in a way she regretted now that she had even told banks about the rape in the first place but such intimacy as they had had breeds foolish confessions she had certainly never told anyone else not even her father and now that she was actually working with banks even though she still fancied him she was going to try to keep things on a professional footing her career was moving in the right direction again and she didnt want to mess things up acc mclaughlin had given her a great chance for kudos in making her dio the last thing she wanted to do was go crying to the boss no dalton was her problem and she would deal with him one way or another banks found di dalton standing in his office facing the wall styrofoam cup of coffee in his hand looking at the dalesman calendar december showed a snow and icecovered goredale scar near malham dalton turned as banks entered he was about six feet tall and skinny as a rake with pale watery blue eyes and a long thin face with a rather hangdog expression under his head of sparse ginger hair banks put his age at around forty he was wearing a lightweight brown suit white shirt and tie a little blood from a shaving cut had dried near the cleft of his chin he stuck his hand out di wayne dalton i seem to have come in the middle of a flap havent you heard heard what the chief constables daughter was killed last night dalton rolled his eyes and whistled id hate to be the bastard who did that when you catch him we will sit down what brings you this far south its probably a waste of time said dalton sitting opposite banks but it looks like one of our cases stretches down to your turf wouldnt be the first time weve quickly become a very small island indeed you can say that again anyway late sunday night actually early monday morning about twelvethirty to be as precise as we can be at this point a white van was hijacked on the b between the a and the village of chatton the contents were stolen and the drivers still in a coma whats his name jonathan fearn banks tapped his pencil on his desk never heard of him no reason you should have he lived here though dalton consulted his notebook twentysix darlington road i know it said banks making a note well look into him any form no whats interesting though is that it turns out this white van was leased by a company called pkf computer systems and hang on a minute did you say pkf thats right starting to make sense not much but go on anyway we ran a check on pkf and to cut a long story it doesnt exist what do you mean exactly what i say pkf computer systems is not registered as an operating business that means someone made up the name printed some letterhead paper got a phone line installed opened a bank account exactly a dummy company any idea who thats where i was hoping you might be able to help we traced pkf to the daleview business park just outside eastvale and we confirmed that the van must have been on its way to a new trading estate near wooler at least pkf had rented premises there starting that monday morning let me get this straight said banks pkf which doesnt exist moves lock stock and barrel from the daleview business park where they havent been operating more than two or three months on sunday night and heads up the a toward another business park near tyneside where theyve also rented premises a few miles short of their destination the vans hijacked and its contents removed right so far on tuesday banks continued the night watchman of the daleview business park was found dead in some woods near market harborough leicestershire shotgun wound execution looks that way we think he was killed monday afternoon connection id say so wouldnt you especially when it turns out our night watchman had been putting away another two hundred quid a week over and above his wages and pkf is a phony exactly any idea what that van might have been carrying dalton asked the only thing my ds found when she checked out the pkf unit at daleview was an empty jewel case for a compact disc compact discs first time ive ever heard of a cd hijack we dont know that thats the reason all im saying is that we found a jewel case at pkf which fits with their working in the computer business maybe it was computer equipment the thieves were after could be that stuff can be valuable any leads at all dalton shook his head weve been keeping an eye on the unit they rented near wooler but no ones shown up yet given whats happened we dont expect them to now it was late on a quiet road so there were no witnesses they left the van in a layby as i said the drivers still in a coma and fingerprints will be working to sort out their findings till kingdom come you and i both know that anyone doing a professional job like this would be wearing gloves anyway this was the only lead we got pkf and the daleview business park okay said banks standing well keep in touch on this one mind if i stick around a day or two have a look at the business park poke about be my guest banks pulled his pad toward him the way things are right now we can use all the help we can get you could also get in touch with di collaton at market harborough it looks as if this is all connected where are you staying fox and hounds on north market street got in yesterday evening nice little en suite i know the place said banks let us know if you find anything will do dalton touched the tips of his fingers in a friendly salute then left the office banks walked over to the window and looked out on the cobbled market square the gold hands against the blue front of the church clock stood at quarter past ten the morning mist had disappeared and it was as light now as it was likely to be all day he saw di dalton walk across the square pause and linger a moment at the tapedoff guarded entrance of the bar none then turn left on york road toward the bus station and the swainsdale centre it was difficult for banks to drum up much enthusiasm for the charlie courage investigation since emilys murder but he knew he had to keep on top of it he also knew that they should have checked into pkf the way dalton had any further signs that he was dragging his feet and red ron would quite rightly have him on the carpet emily was a priority yes but that didnt mean poor charlie counted for nothing maybe dalton would come up with something useful banks would put him in touch with hatchley and with annie so she could share what shed discovered at daleview looking at the weak gray light that seemed to cling to everything bleeding the townscape of all color banks wished he could escape to somewhere warm and sunny for a couple of weeks find a nice spot on the beach and read novels and biographies and listen to the waves all day normally he didnt like that kind of holiday preferring to explore a foreign city on foot but there was something about the long dark yorkshire winters that made him yearn for the canaries or the azores or montego bay if he could afford it though he thought he would like to go to mexico for a while see some mayan ruins but that was out of the question especially with the mortgage on the cottage and tracy at university besides banks thought opening the window a few inches and lighting a cigarette he couldnt desert emily now he was responsible for what happened to her at least in part there was no escaping that if he hadnt gone down to london and stirred things up with clough then it was unlikely that she would have come back home and ended up dead in a crummy eastvale nightclub she had gone the way of graham marshall of jem and of phil simpkins and he couldnt wouldnt just let it go he had to do something let it roll ned said banks he was in the cctv viewing room downstairs along with dcs winsome jackman and kevin templeton annie cabbot and their civilian video technician ned parker the screen showed the market square from the police station including the edge of the queens arms to the right the church front to the left and all the shops pubs and offices directly opposite including the entrance to the bar none the picture was a grainy black and white with a slight fisheye effect and the glare of the christmas lights caused one or two problems with the contrast but it was still possible to make out figures coming and going whether they would be able to identify someone coming out of the bar none from this tape alone banks was doubtful the time appeared in an onscreen display at the bottom righthand side and starting at parker advanced it quickly so that the people crossing the market square looked like extras in a keystone cops chase somewhere around twentyfive past banks noticed a group of people enter the screen from the right the exit of the queens arms and told parker to slow down to normal speed he then watched emily walk across the market square she seemed a little unsteady on the cobbles as she crossed the square which didnt surprise him considering the platform heels she was wearing and the amount she had had to drink that day when she got to the market cross she turned to face the police station and did a little dance and when she finished she bowed with a flourish to the camera but before walking away she gave it the finger just one in the american style then she turned and swung her hips exaggeratedly as she walked on to the nightclub the others laughed banks himself smiled as he watched her almost forgetting for a moment that this was a little cheeky gesture that would never be repeated banks watched them enter the club and asked parker to keep it running at normal speed as he watched others follow as far as he could make out there was no suspicious activity in the market square no little packages of white powder exchanging hands as he watched he realized how much he wanted to be watching what was happening inside the club but there were no cameras there at two people walked out of the club and headed down york road banks couldnt make out their features but it looked like a boy in jeans and a short leather jacket and a girl in a long overcoat and a floppy hat he asked parker to freeze the frame but it didnt help much after that another three couples went in but no one came out when dc rickerd and inspector jessup entered the frame banks told parker to turn the machine off it was beginning to look very much as if emily had scored her coke long before she went to the bar none as banks had guessed and that would make it all the more difficult to find out who had supplied her with the lethal concoction okay banks said standing up and stretching thats all your entertainment for today winsome bring in darren hirst would you maybe he can help us with the two who left friendly sir friendly hes not a suspect just helping us with our inquiries winsome smiled at the hackneyed phrase will do sir kevin id like you to work with ned here and see if you can pull a decent image of those two who left something we can show around okay guv and kevin guv please dont call me guv it makes me feel as if im on television templeton grinned right you are sir then banks looked at his watch and turned to annie wed better go he said weve got an appointment with dr glendenning in a few minutes banks drove out to the old mill after emily riddles postmortem faurés requiem playing on the stereo he still felt angry and nauseated at what he had just seen it wasnt the first young girl he had watched dr glendenning open up on the slab but it was the first whose vitality he had known whose fears and dreams had been shared with him and watching dr glendenning calmly bisecting the black spider tattoo with his scalpel as he made his y incision had almost sent banks the way annie went down in market harborough annie had been fine this time though quiet and tense but fine even when the saw ripped into the bone of emilys skull dr glendenning had confirmed dr burnss original determination that strychnine mixed in a high ratio with pharmaceutical cocaine had caused emilys death glendenning had performed the simple toxicology test for strychnine himself dissolving some of the suspect crystals in sulfuric acid and touching the edge of the solution with a crystal of potassium chromate it turned purple then crimson then all color faded proof positive further tox tests would be done at wetherby but for now this was enough so far all the media knew was that she had died of a suspected drug overdose but it wouldnt be long before some bright spark of a reporter sniffed out the truth sometimes the press seemed even more resourceful than the police as it turned out emilys neck wasnt broken she had died of asphyxiation other than the fact that she was dead glendenning had also told banks she was in extremely good health the drugs and drink and cigarettes clearly hadnt had time to take their toll on her the old mill stood at the end of a culdesac like bankss more humble abode so the uniformed officers on guard could stand well over a hundred yards away where it turned off from the main road and keep reporters away without even being seen by the riddles banks showed his warrant card and the officer on duty waved him through rosalind answered the door and led him through to the same room where he had given riddle the news she was dressed in black and her eyes looked dark with lack of sleep banks guessed that riddle must have awoken her as soon as he had left last night they wouldnt have had any sleep since then banks riddle got slowly to his feet when banks entered the room he was dressed in the same clothes he had been wearing last night a little more the worse for wear he looked haggard and there was a listlessness and a defeated air about his movements that banks had never seen him exhibit before he had always been energetic and abrupt perhaps he had taken a tranquilizer or perhaps this was the toll that recent events had taken on his system whichever it was the man looked as if he could use a doctor as well as a good nights sleep any news he asked without much hope in his voice nothing yet im afraid banks didnt want to mention the postmortem though he knew riddle would be aware that it had been conducted he only hoped the cc had enough common sense not to bring something like that up in front of his wife confirmed cause of death he asked its what we thought rosalind put her hand to her throat strychnine ive read about that banks glanced at riddle youve told her ros understands shes to talk to no one about the cause of death i dont suppose itll be a secret for long though i doubt it said banks not now the postmortems over glendennings sound as a bell but theres always someone there who lets the cat out of the bag mrs riddle he said perching at the edge of his armchair i need to ask you some questions ill try to make it as painless for you as possible i understand jerry explained it to me good emily had been back from london about a month during that time had she given you any cause for concern no said rosalind in fact shed been extremely wellbehaved for emily meaning meaning chief inspector that if she wanted to stay out all night at a rave she would emily always was a willful child as im sure youre aware difficult to control but i saw no evidence of drug use and she was generally polite and goodnatured in her dealings with me i gather that wasnt always the case it was not had she been out a lot since her return not much last night was only the second or third time when was the last time the night before wednesday she went to the pictures with some friends that new cinema complex in eastvale and a week or so ago she went to a friends birthday party in richmond she was home shortly after midnight both times what did she do with her time believe it or not she stayed in and read a lot watched videos she also made inquiries about getting into a sixthform college i think she was finally deciding to take life a bit more seriously did she ever confide in you about any problems she might be having boys or anything like that that wasnt emilys way said rosalind she was always secretive even when she was little she liked a sense of mystery what about boyfriends i dont think there was anyone special she hung around with a group of people it must have been difficult for her to make friends locally with being off at school down south so much of the time it was and you probably know yourself the locals arent always that welcoming of southerners even these days but when she was home for the holidays shed meet people i dont know she didnt seem to have any real trouble making friends she was outgoing enough and of course she still knew people from when she was at saint marys school here that was only two years ago what about darren hirst did she ever mention him yes in fact it was his birthday party she went to last week but he wasnt her boyfriend he was just part of the group she hung out with the lad with the car they came to the house to pick her up on wednesday darren and a girl nina or tina or something and they certainly seemed pleasant enough although i didnt approve of her hanging around with people who were for the most part three or four years older than she was i knew she went to pubs and could get served easily enough and i didnt like it i told her often enough but she just accused me of going on at her and in the end i gave up did she ever mention someone called andrew handley no andy pandy is this some sort of joke whos he its not a joke thats his nickname hes a colleague of the man emily was living with in london never heard of him said rosalind she reached forward grabbed a tissue from the box on the table and sniffled into it im sorry she mumbled please excuse me riddle moved over to her and touched her shoulder hesitantly without much warmth it seemed in response rosalinds body stiffened and she turned away banks thought he glimpsed something in her eyes as she turned fear or confusion perhaps did she suspect her husband of being involved in emilys death or was he protecting her whatever it was there was something desperately out of kilter with the riddle family did emily speak to you of her plans for the future mrs riddle banks asked switching the direction of the interview to something he thought might be a little easier for her to deal with only that she wanted to do her alevels and go to university said rosalind still dabbing her eyes with the tissue preferably in america i think she wanted to get as far away from here and from us as she could out of sight out of mind thought banks and less likely to damage riddles fledgling political career if that wasnt already damaged beyond repair he remembered on his first visit when the riddles asked him to go to london and find emily how he had got the impression that rosalind hadnt particularly wanted her to come back home he got the same impression now and you approved of course i did its better than her running off to london and living with some i dont know some drug dealer we dont know that he was a drug dealer said banks in fact emily swore he wasnt and im inclined to believe her well emily always could twist men around her little finger not clough she met her match there do you really think he could be responsible asked riddle oh yes the impression i got is that hes a dangerous man and he doesnt like to be crossed but why would he want to harm her he had no real motive i dont know said banks all i can say is that ive met him and im convinced hes into something perhaps he did it out of sheer maliciousness because he didnt like to be crossed or perhaps he thought she knew too much about his business interests did she ever talk about him to you no what are you doing about him riddle asked im going to london first thing tomorrow before that i just want to find out if there are any more leads i should be following up here banks paused look i had lunch with emily the day she died and you did what she phoned and asked me to lunch said shed be in eastvale she wanted to thank me she never told us said riddle looking at rosalind who frowned well your wife did say she was secretive and given that my next question is probably a waste of time but when she left she said she was going to meet someone else did she say anything to either of you about meeting someone in eastvale that afternoon they both shook their heads what did she say to you rosalind asked did she tell you anything about what i dont know anything that might help explain what happened only that she thought shed seen one of cloughs men in eastvale i gather she didnt mention that to you no said rosalind when did you last see her yesterday we didnt riddle answered both ros and i had gone to work long before she got up that morning and when we got back she was out so the last time you saw her was wednesday yes did she phone anyone or get any phone calls not that i know of said riddle ros rosalind shook her head did she spend much time on the telephone while she was up here not a lot no do i have your permission to ask british telecom for a record of your telephone calls since emily came home of course said riddle ill see to it myself thats all right sir ill put dc templeton on it did she have any visitors from london make any trips back down there not that we know of no said riddle are you both sure theres no one else you can think of who i should be looking closely at for this no said riddle after a moments pause for thought not up here as ros said she hung around with a group they were probably with her at the club you can talk to them and ascertain whether you think any of them had anything to do with it weve already talked to them but well follow up on that i must say on first impressions i dont think any of them are responsible do you know where she got her drugs it was rosalind who answered i told you that i dont think she was taking drugs since she came back are you certain not completely but i she glanced at her husband and blushed before she went on i searched her room once and once or twice i looked in her handbag i found nothing well she was definitely taking cocaine the night she died said banks maybe it was her first time since london when you searched her handbag mrs riddle did you come across a driving license and an ageverification card rosalind looked puzzled a driving license good lord no emily was too young to drive besides i didnt look in her purse im not saying she did actually drive a car but when she was found the officer at the scene found a driving license in her handbag and thought it was hers he also found one of those cards the clubs issue as proof of age though theyre nothing of the kind thats why there was some confusion over the identity at first it doesnt mean anything to me said rosalind i dont understand what about the name ruth walker banks saw a strange look flash in across rosalinds eyes perhaps the surprise of recognition but it was gone so fast that he didnt trust his own judgment she pressed her lips tight together no she was another friend of emilys in london apparently this ruth met her in the street and took her in when she first arrived you didnt know about that no what about craig newton ring any bells who was he her first boyfriend in london there was a bit of trouble between him and clough he seemed a decent enough lad when i talked to him but he might have been jealous and he might have held a grudge against emily for ditching him she told me hed been following her around and pestering her banks stood up clearly im going to find more answers down there for the moment though are you certain neither of you can think of anyone who would want to harm emily they both shook their heads banks looked at riddle youre a policeman sir he said can you think of anyone who might have a grudge against you oh come on banks you know ive hardly been fighting in the trenches for years thats not a chief constables job even so no i cant think of anyone offhand would you check through your previous arrests no matter how old just for forms sake of course riddle saw banks to the door youll keep in touch wont you he said grasping bankss arm tightly ive been advised to stay away from the office for the time being so im taking a leave of absence but im sure i could be more effective there anyway the moment you know i want to know understand the moment banks nodded and riddle released his grip back at the incident room banks discovered that darren hirst had been and gone dc jackman had interviewed him and said he had been unable to shed any light on the couple who had left the bar none at ten fortyseven he hadnt even remembered seeing them in the first place now it was a matter of getting the rather blurred and grainy image that ned parker had pulled from the cctv video copied up and shown around it was possible that someone might have remembered seeing them in the pubs around the market square it would probably come to nothing but then most police work did he also found out that three people who had been in the black bull yesterday at lunchtime had phoned in and said they had seen the victim with an older man one person had positively identified the man as that detective who was on telly about that there reservoir business in tsummer just as well hed told the acc and the riddles banks walked into the detectives office down the corridor it sounded as if someone was going at the floor with a pneumatic drill he shut the door behind him and leaned against the wall hatchley and annie cabbot were at their desks annie gave him a dirty look and hatchley said he had been out investigating an alien abduction banks smiled come again since when have you been working on the x files jim its true said hatchley honest to god he chuckled it sounded as if he was coughing up a big one toy shop down on elmet street he went on they put out an inflatable little green man to advertise a new line of toys and somebody nicked it some kid probably still its an alien abduction banks laughed theres one for the books ever hear of a fellow called jonathan fearn he asked rings a bell hatchley scratched his ear if im thinking of the right one hes an unemployed yobbo not above a bit dodgy dealing every now and then weve had our eyes on him as driver on a couple of warehouse robberies over the years but hes got no form hatchley shrugged just lucky some are it wont last his lucks already run out hes in hospital in newcastle in a coma hatchley whistled bloody hell what happened banks told him as much as he knew do you know of any connection between this fearn character and charlie courage could be hatchley said i mean they hung out in the same pubs and neither of them was beyond a bit of thievery every now and then sound like two peas from the same pod to me thanks jim said banks poke around a bit will you see if you can find a connection hatchley always happy to be sent off to do his work in pubs beamed my pleasure theres a di dalton around the place somewhere down from northumbria staying at the fox and hounds he might be able to help liaise with him on this one will do annie followed banks out of the office and caught up with him in the corridor a word of course said banks not here though this noise is driving me crazy queens arms fine with me banks and annie walked across market street to the queens arms i want to know just what the hell you think youve been playing at annie said when they had got drinks and sat down in a quiet corner she spoke softly but there was anger in her voice and she sat stiffly in the chair what do you mean you know damn well what i mean what went on between you and the victim emily riddle who else banks sighed im sorry it happened the way it did annie sorry if i embarrassed you in any way i would have told you honestly i just hadnt found the right time you could have told me last night at the scene no i couldnt there was too much else going on too much to do too much to organize and i was bloody upset by what i saw all right no its not all right you made me feel like a complete idiot this morning ive been working on the case as long as you had and here are you coming up with a suspect ive never even heard of not to mention having lunch with the victim on the day she died look ive said im sorry what else can i say annie shook her head its not on alan if im supposed to be your dio im not supposed to be the last bloody person on earth who hears about important developments it wasnt an important development it had already happened stop splitting hairs you named a suspect you had a prior relationship with the victim you should have told me it could have a bearing on the investigation it does have a bearing on the investigation and i will tell you if youll let me better late than never banks told her about london about glamourpuss clough ruth walker and craig newton everything except the night in the hotel room and about what he and emily had discussed over lunch the previous day when he had finished annie seemed to relax in her chair the way she normally did i wasnt keeping it from you annie he said it was just bad timing thats all honestly and thats all there is to it thats all scouts honor annie managed a smile next time anything like that happens tell me up front okay okay forgive me im working on it what next im going down to london tomorrow to do a bit of checking up and me i want you to take care of things at this end ill only be gone for the weekend most likely but theres a lot to do get posters made up contact the local tv news people and see if you can get an appeal for information on anyone who saw her between the time she left the black bull just before three and the time she met her friends in the cross keys at seven and stress the fact that even though she was technically only sixteen she looked older men will certainly remember if they saw her check local buses and taxis get dc templeton to organize a housetohouse of the area around the black bull maybe well even get reinforcements who knows we might get lucky maybe someone saw clough handing over a gram of coke to her sure and theres another thing whats that i had a visit from a di dalton this morning northumbria cid its about the charlie courage business seems theres some connection with a hijacked van up north seeing as you did the preliminary interviews at daleview id like you to have a quick chat with him before you hand over the file to ds hatchley he might be able to help us hes staying at the fox and hounds you never know maybe if youre lucky hell even buy you a pint that evening at home banks tossed a few clothes into his overnight bag followed by evelyn waughs the ordeal of gilbert pinfold and his renee fleming and captain beefheart tapes he would have to buy a portable cd player he decided it was becoming too timeconsuming and expensive to tape everything and cd timings were getting more difficult to match with the basic ninety or onehundredminute tape format when he had finished packing he phoned brian who answered on the third ring hi dad hows it going fine look im going to be down your way again this weekend any chance of your being around ill be pretty busy but im sure we can fit in a lunch or something sorry said brian weve got some gigs in southampton ah well you cant blame a father for trying one of these days maybe take care and i hope youre a big success thanks oh dad yes you remember that bloke you were asking about a while back the exroadie barry clough thats him what about him nothing really but i was talking to one of the producers at the recording studio name of terry king old geezer like you been around a long time since punk you know the sex pistols the clash that sort of thing surely you must remember those days brian said banks smiling to himself i even remember elvis now cut the ageism and get to the point its nothing really just that he remembered clough called himself something else then one of those silly punk names like sid vicious terry couldnt remember exactly what it was but it was him all right apparently he got fired from his roadie job what for bootlegging live concerts not just the band he worked with but all the big names i see banks remembered the booming business in bootleg lps in the seventies first bob dylan jimi hendrix the doors and other popular bands were all bootlegged and none of them made a penny from the illegal sales the same thing also happened later with some of the punk bands not that any of them needed the money and most of them were too stoned to notice but that wasnt the point cloughs employers had noticed and given him the push like i said its not much but he says hes heard this clough bloke is a gangster now a tough guy be careful dad i will im not exactly a fivestone weakling myself you know right oh and theres one more thing yes theres this car a mate of mines selling only three years old got its mot and everything i got another brian what do you want well ive got the asking price down a couple of hundred from what it was but i was wondering you know if you could see your way to helping me out what me help out my rich and famous rockstar son brian laughed give us a break how much do you need three hundred quid would do nicely ill let you have it back when i am rich and famous all right youre sure thats what i said isnt it thats great thanks dad thanks a lot i mean it youre welcome talk to you later banks hung up three hundred quid he could ill afford still he would come up with it somehow after all he had saved a bundle by missing out on paris and he had given tracy a bit of spending money that weekend he remembered how much he had wanted a car when he was young the kids with cars seemed to get all the girls he had finally bought a rusty old vw beetle when he was at college in london it lasted him the length of his course there then clapped out on the north circular one cold rainy sunday in january and he hadnt got another one until he and sandra were married yes hed find a way to help brian out next banks tried tracys number and was surprised when she answered right away dad ive been wanting to talk to you i just heard about mr riddles daughter on the news are you all right i know you didnt get along with him but did you know her yes said banks then he told tracy the bare details about going to london to find emily instead of going with her to paris that weekend oh dad dont feel guilty for doing someone a favor i was disappointed at first but damon and i had the most wonderful time ill bet you did thought banks biting his tongue tracy went on all i heard was that she died after taking an overdose of cocaine in the bar none and theyre all saying she lived a pretty wild life is it something to do with what happened in london i dont know said banks maybe thats terrible was it deliberate could have been do you have any idea who no i know i shouldnt ask its all right love we dont at the moment a few leads to follow thats all im going back to london tomorrow i just wanted to talk to you first see if you were still on for christmas of course i wouldnt miss it for the world good she was only sixteen wasnt she thats right tracy paused look dad i just want you to know i mean i know you worry about me sometimes i know you and mum worried about me when we were all together but you didnt really need to im i mean i never did anything like that i know you didnt no dad you dont know you cant know even if you knew what signs to look for you werent there i dont mean to be nasty about it i know about the demands of your job and all and i know you loved us but you just werent there anyway im telling you the truth i know you think ive always been little miss goody twoshoes but its not true i did try smoking some marijuana once but i didnt like the way it made me feel and once a girl gave me some ecstasy at a dance i didnt like that either it made my heart beat too fast and all i did was sweat and feel frightened i suppose you could say im a failure as far as drugs are concerned im glad to hear it banks wanted to ask if shed been sexually active at fourteen too but he didnt think it would be a fair question to put to his daughter she would tell him what she wanted when she wanted to anyway tracy went on im sure youre very busy and im sure if anyones going to catch him itll be you banks laughed i appreciate your confidence in me take care love talk to you soon bye dad banks hung up the phone gently and let the silence enfold him again he always had that same empty lonely feeling after hed spoken to someone he loved over the telephone as if the silence had somehow become charged with that persons absence he shook it off it was a mild enough night outside and he still had time to go to his little balcony by the falls for a cigarette and a finger or two of laphroaig barry clough said detective superintendent richard dirty dick burgess chewing on a piece of particularly tough steak now theres an interesting bloke it was saturday lunchtime and banks and burgess were sitting in a pub just off oxford street the air around them laced with smoke and conversation it was a mild day much warmer than the last time banks had been to london in early november the pub was crowded with christmas shoppers taking a break and one brave couple actually sat at a table outside burgess was drinking lager and lime but banks had only coffee with his chicken in a basket he had a busy day ahead and needed to stay alert he had phoned burgess before leaving eastvale that morning if anyone could uncover information on clough it was dirty dick burgess he had recently got himself into a bit of trouble for dragging his feet over the investigation into the murder of a black youth as a result hed been shunted off to the national criminal intelligence service where he couldnt do so much harm it didnt seem to bother burgess that he had been identified as a racist he took it all in his stride with his usual lack of concern the two had known each other for years and while they had tentatively come to enjoy each others company their relationship remained mostly confrontational banks especially didnt share burgesss strong rightwing leanings nor did he concur with his racist and sexist opinions in his turn burgess had called banks a pinko about the only thing they had in common was that both were from workingclass backgrounds burgess though unlike banks was the margaret thatcher kind of workingclass lad who had come to the fore in the eighties someone who had triumphed over a deprived background then devoted himself to the pursuit of material benefits and felt no sympathy or solidarity with any of his class who couldnt or wouldnt follow suit banks or so he hoped retained some compassion for his fellowman especially the downtrodden and occasionally even the criminal it was difficult to maintain such a view being a copper all those years but he had sworn to himself not long after finding dawn wadleys dismembered body in the soho alley that as soon as he stopped caring he would quit he had thought that his move from the met to the softer patch of eastvale would have made life easier but somehow without the sheer volume of human misery that had been his lot in the city every case seemed to take more of a toll on him it was similar to the way people found it hard to respond to the deaths of millions of foreigners in a flood or an earthquake but fell to pieces when a kindly old neighbor was run over any mans death diminishes me because i am involved in mankind as john donne had said and banks knew exactly what he meant the odd thing about working dayin dayout against murderers pimps drug dealers muggers and the rest was that you could distance yourself partly you did it by developing a dark sense of humor telling tasteless jokes at crime scenes getting pissed with the lads after attending a postmortem and partly you just built a wall around your feelings but in eastvale where he had more time to devote himself to important cases especially murders his defenses had been slowly eroded until he was nothing but a bundle of raw nerve ends each case took a little bit more of his soul or so he felt banks remembered some of the victims especially the young ones deborah harrison sally lumb caroline hartley he had come to know and care about all these victims even gloria shackleton murdered long before banks had been born had come to obsess him only a few months ago and now emily riddle it didnt matter what anyone said about not becoming personally involved with cases banks thought you had to be personally involved there had to be something more at stake than mere crime statistics problem is burgess went on we dont really know enough about him any form burgess sniffed minor drug bust in half a pound of nepalese black said it was for his own consumption well i believed him i could go through that much in a week easily but the magistrates didnt they gave him eighteen months out in nine is he still dealing not that we know of if he is hes not in the premier league burgess pushed his plate away too bloody tough for my teeth he said apart from his crooked and stained teeth banks noticed burgess seemed in better shape than the last time they had met he had even lost a little weight he still had his graying hair tied in a ponytail which irritated banks who thought that middleaged men with ponytails looked like prize wankers and his gray eyes were as sharp as cynical and as worldweary as ever the last time they had met banks remembered was in amsterdam over a year ago when burgess had got pissed and fallen in a canal banks had helped him out and taken him back to the hotel and the last he had seen of him burgess was trailing dirty canal water across the lobby his shoes squelching as he went head held high trying to walk in a straight line with dignity he had been wearing the same scuffed leather jacket he was wearing today how does he pay for that bloody great villa of his banks asked which one little venice you mean hes got more than one sure theres two that we know of the one in little venice and one outside arenys de mar in spain so where does his money come from hes a gangster so ive heard i didnt know they were back in fashion they never really went away they just adapted changed names switched rackets what sort of a gangster is clough then burgess lit one of his small cigars before answering first off he said hes got a legitimate front he owns a very successful bar in clerkenwell popular with the city boys gets some good bands serves firstclass food and booze you know the type of place how about a little coke and crème caramel to end the perfect evening darling then they go off home for the perfect shag we know hes into all sorts of things but weve never been able to get him on anything he runs things delegates doesnt get his hands dirty basically he bankrolls dodgy or downright criminal operations and rakes in a big cut as far as we know he made a pile of money managing and promoting bands in the music business years ago and invested it in a life of crime bootlegging what thats how he made his pile banks explained making bootleg recordings of live concerts getting them pressed and selling them burgess narrowed his eyes you seem to know a lot about him sure you want me to go on banks smiled its a matter of making a little go a long way thats all i know anyway it looks as if it paid off bigtime what kinds of things is he interested in now if its not drugs all sorts ill give him his due hes innovative prefers newer safer rackets to the old true tested and tried thats why i dont see him dealing drugs taking them yes but not dealing them not his style you wont find him running girls or protection rackets either not barry clough guns though now theres another matter remember that business with the reactivated firearms a year or so back up around your neck of the woods wasnt it thirsk said banks yes i remember undercover policemen posing as london gangsters had arrested four men on charges of conspiracy to transfer firearms and ammunition and for selling prohibited weapons since stricter gun laws were introduced after the dunblane school massacre firearms became harder to get because the risk attached to possessing or selling them was far greater that also put their price up to fill the gap workshops like the one near thirsk sprang up it took about two hours to reactivate an uzi that had been disabled for legal sale to a collector and you could sell it for about tanfoglio pistols went for about a grand apiece discount for bulk needless to say the weapons were especially popular with drug gangs we thought we had clough on that but we couldnt prove he was involved what made you think he was circumstantial evidence tidbits from informers hed made a couple of trips to the area shortly prior to the arrests one of the men arrested had been observed visiting cloughs house he was a collector of disabled firearms himself he had connections in both the drugs and firearms worlds that sort of thing banks nodded he knew what burgess meant you could know it in your bones that a man was guilty of something but if you couldnt get enough evidence to interest the crown prosecution service then you might as well forget it and the cps was notoriously difficult to interest in anything other than a dead cert he also remembered the guns in the case on cloughs wall still not evidence what happened we leaned on him a bit not me personally you understand but we leaned i think he shied away from that line of business at least for a while besides i think he found out that its not as lucrative as hed hoped reactivating guns is more trouble than its worth when you get right down to it and its not as if they arent still being smuggled in by the cartload christ i know where you could buy an uzi for fifty quid not twenty minutes from here and after that we suspect and you know what i mean when i stress that its just a suspicion dont you burgess flicked some ash and winked at banks we suspect that for one thing hes behind one of the big smuggling operations booze and fags high profit low risk you might not know this banks but ive done some work with customs and excise and about eight percent of cigarettes and five percent of beer consumed in this country are smuggled have you any idea what sort of profits were talking about here given the amount people smoke and drink i should imagine its pretty huge understatement burgess pointed his cigar at banks a player like clough might employ fifty people to get the stuff from warehouses in europe to his retail outlets over here once they get it through customs at dover they go to distribution centers industrial estates business parks and the like then their fleet of salesmen pick up their supplies and sell to the retailers shops pubs clubs factories even schools christ weve even got fucking pet shops and ice cream vans selling smuggled booze and cloughs in it that big so we suspect i mean its not as if he drives any of the freighters himself or drops off a carton or two at the local chippie whenever clough comes back from a month at his villa in spain you can be damn certain hes clean as a surgeons scalpel it really pisses me off banks that when a lawabiding citizen such as me drinks his smuggled french lager theres probably a share of the profits going to a gangster like clough so what have you got on him precious little again mostly circumstantial earlier this year customs stopped a lorry at dover and found seven million cigarettes seven fucking million wouldve netted a profit of about half a million quid on the black market and dont ask me how much that is in euros cloughs name came up in the investigation and what else is he into burgess flicked some more ash on the floor like i said we dont know the full extent of his operations hes cagey has a knack of staying one step ahead partly because he contracts out and partly because he operates outside london setting up little workshops like that one near thirsk and then moving on before anyones figured out what hes doing he uses phony companies gets others to front for him so his name never appears on any of the paperwork something in what burgess had said rang a bell for banks it was very faint one a very poor connection but it wasnt an impossible one ever heard of pkf computer system he asked burgess shook his head bloke called courage charlie courage no jonathan fearn nope i can look them up if you like doesnt matter said banks ones dead and the others in a coma would murder be cloughs style at all id say a man who does as high a volume of crime as he does has to maintain a certain level of threat wouldnt you and if he does that he has to make good on it once in a while or nobodys intimidated he has to keep his workers in line nothing like a nice little murder for keeping the lads focused he slurped down some lager and lime two weeks after cloughs name came up in connection with that seized shipment two known baddies got shot in dover city center no connection proven of course but they were business rivals its a fucking war zone down there banks pushed aside the rest of his chicken which was too dry and lit a cigarette he fancied a pint but held off if he was going to see barry clough tonight as he planned then hed need to be sharp especially after what burgess had said what about women he asked burgess frowned what do you mean from what i can gather cloughs a bit of a ladies man so ive heard and apparently he likes them young has he ever been under suspicion of hurting or killing a woman nope doesnt mean he hasnt done it and got away with it though like i said cloughs good at staying ahead of the game the thing is with someone like him people dont like to come forward and make themselves known if you catch my drift right banks sipped some black coffee it tasted bitter as if it had been left on the burner too long still it beat instant heard of andrew handley andy pandy sure hes one of cloughs chief gofers dangerous could be anything on him hurting women not that i know of is this about jimmy riddles daughter yes said banks emily riddles murder was all over the newspapers that morning as banks had guessed it hadnt taken the press long to ferret out that she had died of cocaine laced with strychnine and that was far bigger news than another boring drug overdose youre sio on that yes burgess clapped his hands together and showered ash on the remains of his steak well bugger me no thanks not right after lunch said banks whats so strange about that last i heard jimmy riddle had you suspended i had to pull your chestnuts out of the fire it was you who put them in there in the first place with all that cloakanddagger bollocks said banks but thanks all the same ungrateful cunt think nothing of it now hes got you working on his daughters case whats the connection why you banks told him about finding emily in london why dyou do that to get riddle off your back partly i suppose at least in the first place but most of all i think it was the challenge id been on desk duties again for a couple of months after the hobbs end fiasco and it was real work again it was also a bit of a rush going off alone working outside the rules burgess grinned ah banks youre just like me when you get right down to it arent you crack a few skulls i didnt need to did you fuck her the kid for christs sake said banks his teeth clenching she was sixteen years old so whats wrong with that its legal tasty too ill bet it was at times like this banks wanted to throttle burgess instead he just shook his head and ignored the comment burgess laughed typical knight in bloody shining armor arent you banks that was what emily had called him in the black bull banks remembered not a very successful one he said burgess took a long drag on his cigar he inhaled banks noticed she was sixteen going on thirty from what ive heard on the grapevine what have you heard just that she was a crazy kid bit of an embarrassment to the old man thats true enough so he wanted you to head off any trouble at the pass something like that any ideas id have to put barry clough very high on my list that why youre here to rattle his cage it had crossed my mind im thinking of paying him a visit tonight burgess stubbed out his cigar and raised his eyebrows are you indeed fancy some company it was a different bridge but almost a repeat of his previous trip banks thought as he walked across vauxhall bridge on his way to visit kennington he looked at his watch almost three ruth had been at home last time he just hoped she had a saturday routine she stuck to as it turned out he neednt have worried ruth answered the intercom at the first press of the button and buzzed him up you again she said after letting him into the room what is it this time banks showed her his warrant card ive come about emily a look of triumph shone in her eyes i knew there was something fishy about you i told you didnt i last time you were here a copper ruth i was here unofficially last time i apologize for pretending to be emilys father not that you believed me anyway but it seemed to be the best way to get the job done end justifies the means typical police mentality that is so you knew her real name what you didnt seem at all surprised when i called her emily just now well thats the name they used in the papers yesterday but you already knew that didnt you yeah i knew her real name she told me so what i respected her right not to want to use it if she wanted to call herself louisa gamine it was fine with me can i sit down go ahead banks sat ruth didnt offer him tea this time she didnt sit down herself but lit a cigarette and paced she seemed edgy nervous banks noticed that she had changed her hair color instead of black it was blond still cropped to within half an inch of her skull it didnt look a hell of a lot better and only served to highlight the pastiness of her features she was wearing baggy jeans with a hole in one knee and a sort of shapeless blue thing like an artists smock the kind of thing you wear when youre by yourself around the house and you think nobodys going to see you ruth didnt seem unduly concerned about her appearance though she didnt excuse herself to change or apply makeup banks gave her credit for that the music was playing just a little too loud lauryn hill by the sound of it singing about her latest misadventures why dont you sit down and talk to me banks asked ruth glared at him i dont like being lied to i told you last time people always seem to think they can just walk right over me once again i apologize ruth stood a moment glaring at him through narrowed eyes then she turned the music down sat opposite him and crossed her legs all right im sitting happy now its a start you know what happened i told you i read about it in the paper and saw it on telly then her hard edges seemed to soften for a moment its terrible poor emily i couldnt believe it im sorry i know you were a friend of hers was it i mean were you there did you see her i was at the scene said banks and yes i saw her what did she look like i dont know much about strychnine but was it you know really horrible i really dont think thats a good idea was it quick not quick enough so she suffered she suffered ruth looked away sniffled and reached for a tissue from the low table beside her sorry she said its not like me i just want to ask you a few questions ruth then ill go okay ruth blew her nose then nodded i dont see how i can help you though youd be surprised have you spoken with emily since she left london only on the phone a couple of times i think when she split up with this barry she felt a bit guilty about neglecting me not that i cared mind you it was her life and people always do neglect me that is when was the last time you talked a week maybe two weeks before you know was there anything on her mind what do you mean did she confide any of her fears in you only about that psycho shed been living with barry clough yeah him what did she say about him she didnt give me any gory details but she said hed turned out to be a real waste of space and she sounded worried he was going to come after her did she steal some money from him why do you ask that ruth shrugged dunno hes rich its the sort of thing shed do did she ever steal from you not that i know of ruth managed a quick smile mind you i cant say ive much worth stealing someone ripped the silver spoon out of my mouth at a pretty early age ive always had to work hard just to make ends meet when did you miss your driving license ruth my license how did you know about that it was ages ago how long five six months while emily was here yes just after but you dont mean emily when the report came to me over the phone the first officer on the scene told me the victim was ruth walker hed read the name off her driving license bloody hell so thats what happened i just thought id lost it i do lose things especially bits of paper what did you do applied for a new one the new kind with the photo on it but what possible use could the old one be to emily i think she used it to help her get one of those proofofage cards the clubs give out she wouldnt have had much difficulty from what ive heard they practically give them to pretty young girls whether theyve got any proof in the first place or not the card has her photo on it but your name and i assume your date of birth twentythird of february bloody hell ruth shook her head i knew nothing about it and maybe she also wanted to drive a car she was too young to learn that doesnt always stop people i suppose not some of the most skilled car thieves ive met have been between ten and thirteen youd know about that what did she say about barry clough just that she thought shed pissed him off bigtime when she left without saying goodbye and he wasnt the kind of man just to let it go by did she sound scared not really scared bit nervous maybe in a giggly sort of way she could put a brave face on things could louisa emily when did she tell you her real name shortly after she came to stay with me she asked me not to tell anyone that she wanted to be called louisa so i respected her wishes did you tell clough what her real name was ruth jerked forward give me a break why would i do something like that only asking so you didnt no fucking way has he been in touch with you at all asking about her no i havent seen anything of him at all what about craig did you tell him no but he might have known she might have told him herself but you didnt i didnt tell anyone i can keep a secret banks lit a cigarette and leaned back in the armchair how have you been ruth she frowned what do you mean just a simple question healthy happy im doing all right as well as can be expected why do you want to know hows work fine what exactly is it that you do computers its pretty boring stuff but steady wellpaid its steady thats about the best you can say do you own a car ruth got up and banks followed her to the window there she said pointing that clappedout cream fiesta down there banks smiled i had one like that a few years back he said cortina actually nobody believed i could possibly be driving such a thing theyd stopped making them years ago but it was a good car while it lasted well said ruth folding her arms at the window itll have to last me a few years longer thats for sure they sat down again been on any trips lately banks asked nope seeing anyone whats it to you just being friendly well you dont have to be remember youre a copper and im a suspect suspect what makes you think that a nasty smile twisted ruths features because i know you coppers you wouldnt be here otherwise asking all sorts of questions no matter i didnt do it you cant blame me im not trying to how do you know coppers ruth ever been arrested no i read the papers though watch the news i know what racist sexist bastards you are banks laughed you must be thinking of dirty dick what never mind seeing as how you think youre a suspect though you might as well tell me where you were on thursday i was here at home not at work i had a cold still have i was off thursday and friday does that mean ive got no alibi you havent been on any trips recently no i told you i havent been anywhere and for your information no im not screwing anyone either youve got to be careful these days its a lot different from when you were young you know weve got aids to think about the worst you had to worry about was crabs or a dose of clap either way it wasnt going to kill you banks smiled i suppose youre right did you ever go up to visit emily in yorkshire over the past month no why not too busy at work besides she never asked me ruth snorted i can see why now why it said in the paper that her fathers a chief constable and her mothers a solicitor they dont sound exactly the sort of people shed want to introduce someone like me to oh i dont know said banks you shouldnt be too hard on yourself ruth flushed i know what i am do you know emilys mother at all rosalind no why should i just wondering like i said shed hardly take me home to meet her mum and dad i suppose not so you never spoke with her she answered the phone a couple of times when i called so the two of you have spoken only to say hello like and ask for emily rosalind didnt ask you any questions no just my name thats all and you told her why wouldnt i what is this are you trying to make out her mother killed her now i hardly think so just trying to get things clear thats all have you seen anything of craig ruth made herself more comfortable in the armchair sitting with her legs curled under as a matter of fact he phoned me after he heard about emily on the news yesterday morning we had lunch together he had to come into town what for to pay a call at glamourpuss how would i know he didnt say how did he seem fine i guess i mean we were both upset emily breezed in and out of both our lives but if youve met her then youd know she certainly leaves an impression the thought of somebody doing that to her its too much to bear you are certain it wasnt just an accident arent you an overdose were certain like i said we were you know we couldnt believe it what about her father what about him do you think he might have done it i mean she used to go on about how horrible he was and if anyone can get hold of drugs and poisons its the police remember hes the one who wanted her back yes said ruth leaning forward and lowering her voice to a whisper you told me that but why did he want her back have you ever thought about that though it was saturday there was no time off for eastvale cid that weekend it would cost a fortune in overtime but acc mclaughlin and superintendent gristhorpe would hardly hesitate to approve the budget there would be no stinting on this case if annie hadnt seen the body for herself she might have felt a little uncomfortable about the favoritism of it all but having seen it she knew that even if the victim had been a poxridden whore she would have been working on the case today and working for nothing if she had to and banks the sio was down in london which left annie in charge she understood that he had to go and follow the leads he already knew about but it left her with an unbearably heavy load especially after so little sleep and she couldnt help but still feel irritated with him after their little talk the previous day she had softened toward him but she still felt that he was holding something back she didnt know why or what it was about something to do with emilys sojourn in london she suspected but it gave her the feeling that he knew something she didnt and she didnt like that already that morning she had called in at the incident room and found it the usual hive of activity winsome was sitting at the computer looking flustered as the pile of green sheets for entry into holmes rose quickly beside her and gavin rickerd looked as if he had found his true calling in life making sure every scrap of information was neatly logged and numbered he also looked as if he hadnt slept since the murder after that annie had organized the investigation into emilys whereabouts between three and seven she had ordered the posters the previous day and they were waiting when she got in banks had given her the photo he wanted used and annie thought it made emily look a bit slutty he said that was how people would remember her and there was no point asking her parents for the sort of sanitized school photo or studio portrait they were likely to have he also insisted that her description stressed that she looked older than her sixteen years the photo came above the question have you seen this girl and that in turn was followed by the description the hours they were interested in and a telephone number to contact she had sent out half a dozen uniformed officers to fix them to hoardings and telegraph poles along all the main streets and in as many shop windows as they could manage after that the officers were engaged in conducting a housetohouse in central eastvale and the area around the black bull despite the stolen driving license emily didnt drive or have access to a car as far as anyone knew so the odds were that she had stayed in town she could have taken a bus or a train of course so both stations were being thoroughly covered there was every chance that a bus driver fellow passenger or ticket vendor would remember her if she had traveled anywhere in the missing four hours annie herself was set to go on the evening news program she remembered with a little twinge of fear she didnt like television wasnt comfortable with it at all the way that no matter how serious and publicspirited your appearance was you knew you were only there to make the presenter look good but that was one little prejudice she would have to swallow if she was to get the appeal for information across it was close to lunchtime annies first real chance that day to sit down at her own desk and do a bit of detective work with kevin templeton making phone calls in the background though it was a long shot she thought she should check and see if there were any other crimes with similar mos using cocaine laced with strychnine as a murder weapon the phoenix system set up by the national criminal records office offered her nothing but then there was every chance this killer hadnt ever been convicted catchem offered a few more options essentially you could enter the victim details stressing the salient features of the crime and the system presented you with a potential scale of probability in several categories after a little tinkering annie discovered that it was not necessarily likely that emily knew her killer and that the killer might well be someone who felt slighted by society and had sadistic tendencies so much for computers she was just about to go to lunch when ds hatchley came in annie was one of the few women in eastvale divisional headquarters or western divisional headquarters as it was now officially known who didnt particularly mind sergeant hatchley she thought he was all show all yorkshire bluff she knew he wasnt soft underneath it all hatchley could be a hard man but she didnt think he was as daft as he painted himself either or as prejudiced as he pretended to be some men she had come to realize over the years act the way they think theyre supposed to act especially in institutions such as the police and armed forces while inside they might be desperate to be someone different to be what they really feel they are but they deny it it was a kind of protective coloration hatchley was no pussycat but she thought he had a depth of understanding and sympathy that he didnt know quite what to do with marriage and fatherhood too had knocked off a few of the rough edges or so she had heard of course despite bankss little crack the previous day annie hadnt tracked down dalton at the fox and hounds and she felt a little guilty about palming hatchley off on him but not that guilty hatchleys eyes had certainly lit up at the prospect of a pint annie knew that if dalton stayed around much longer it was only a matter of time before they bumped into each other he might even walk into the detectives office this very moment and then there would be no avoiding him she didnt want to meet him didnt want to talk to him but she wasnt scared of him and she was damned if she was going to go around the place trying to avoid him anymore hatchley said hello and grumbled about his aching feet whereve you been annie asked feeling conciliatory after asking the favor of him not another alien abduction no such luck charlie bloody courage you know some people just dont seem to care how much inconvenience they cause by getting themselves murdered annie smiled daleview again aye and about as much use as the time you were there nobody saw the van on a sunday night about ten oclock nobody there except charlie except the pkf people who were trying to find charlie himself and jonathan fearn the van driver whos still languishing in a coma in newcastle best way to be in newcastle said annie nay lass its not such a bad place some grand pubs there anyway according to my sources charlie did know jonathan fearn so weve got a connection there however tenuous peas in a pod maybe courage lined up the job for him thought he was doing him a favor could be what did you find out from this di whats his name dalton di wayne dalton seems a niceenough sort of bloke you ask me though hes down on a weekend break in december why not the weathers not so bad hes a bit of a rambler apparently talking about going walking up reeth way on sunday morning says if he gets a nineoclock start hell just about be ready to enjoy a pint and roast beef dinner at the bridge in grinton by twelve the bridge does a lovely roast beef and yorkshire pud nice pint too not that youd catch me walking mind you looking at him annie could believe it hatchley was about six feet two with fine fair hair starting to thin a bit on top the roast beef complexion of someone with bloodpressure problems and about thirty or forty pounds excess baggage to be generous her thoughts drifted off at what he said maybe that was the answer if dalton was indeed planning a walk on sunday the odds were that there wouldnt be many people around the middle of nowhere might be the best place to confront him the idea excited her it would mean making herself scarce on sunday morning but she thought she could probably manage that if she had everything in order by then after all with banks away she was in charge so nobody was going to question her if she was out of the station for a few hours dare she do it what would she say if she stepped out in front of him on a deserted footpath what would he do would he get physical perhaps even try to get rid of her permanently having seen him again annie didnt think she need worry on that score but perhaps when it came down to it what worried her more than what he might do to her in a lonely place was what she might do to him the lights were blazing in barry cloughs little venice villa when banks and burgess arrived shortly after eight that saturday evening someone had even rigged up some christmas lights on the facade of the house and put up a big tree in the garden bit early for a party isnt it said burgess glancing at his watch its never too early for this lot said banks their whole life is one long party now now banks isnt envy one of the seven deadly sins thou must not covet thy neighbors arse and all that the iron gates were open but a minder stood at the front door asking for invitations he wasnt one of the two banks had seen on his previous visit maybe clough went through minders the way some people went through chauffeurs or maids hard to get good help these days banks and burgess showed him their warrant cards but he clearly wasnt programmed to deal with anything like that the way he screwed up his face in concentration as he looked at them banks wondered if he even got past the photographs these mean we get in free said burgess ill have to check with the boss wait here the minder opened the door to go inside and before he could close it burgess had followed him with banks not far behind banks realized he had to remember whom he was with what a loose cannon burgess could be and how hed have to be on his toes still he had invited the bastard and it was good to have company you could depend on if the shit hit the fan burgess wasnt one to shirk trouble no matter what form it came in there were people all over the place all sorts of people young old toughlooking artsyfartsy welldressed scruffy black white you name it music blasted through speakers that seemed to be positioned discreetly out of sight just about everywhere creams tales of brave ulysses banks noticed how retro still clough would have been in his midtwenties when he was a roadie for the punk band which meant he had been in his teens when cream came along pretty much the same age as banks the air reeked of marijuana smoke the minder who had noticed his mistake elbowed his way roughly through the crowds in the hallway upsetting one or two lessthansober guests whose drinks he spilled and returned before the song finished with barry clough in tow the man himself did we come at a bad time barry burgess asked after the initial cold anger had fleeted across his chiseled features clough smiled with all the warmth of a piranha clapped his hands and rubbed them together not at all not at all the black tshirt he was wearing stretched tight over his biceps and other muscles bulged at the chest and shoulders all he needed for the complete rebel look was a cigarette packet shoved up the sleeve he wore no jewelry this time and he was wearing his graying hair loose tucked behind his ears on each side and hanging down to his shoulders banks was glad of that he didnt think he could handle matching ponytails the loose hair made clough look younger and softened his appearance a little but there was still no mistaking the icy menace in his eyes and the feral threat in his sharply angled features tales of brave ulysses segued into swlabr someone bumped into banks from behind and muttered an apology he turned and saw it was an attractive young girl not much older than emily had been he vaguely recognized her from somewhere but before he could remember where she had disappeared into the crowd is there somewhere quiet we can talk banks asked clough clough appeared to consider the question for a moment head cocked to one side as if it were his decision a notsosubtle way of gaining a psychological edge in an interview it was wasted on banks he jerked his head toward the stairs up there for example he said finally clough gave a minuscule nod and led them up the stairs the first room they went into turned out to be occupied by a couple squirming and moaning on a pile of the guests coats its unhygienic that said burgess i go to a party you know i dont expect to go home with my raincoat covered in other peoples love juices clough twisted one corner of his tight lips into what passed for a smile theyll be too fucking stoned to notice he said then he turned to banks youre not drugs squad are you banks shook his head its just that there are a lot of important people here even a few coppers anything like that would be terribly messy it would make the stones drugs bust look like a vicarage tea party i remember that one said burgess i wasnt there but i always wanted to meet the young lady with the mars bar a skinny young girl with a joint in her hand walked past them in the hallway in fact burgess went on grabbing the joint from her some of us coppers quite enjoy a little recreational marijuana every now and then he took a deep toke held the smoke awhile then let it out slowly paki black not bad then he dropped the joint on the carpet and trod on it sorry banks he said when hed done forgot you might have wanted a toke on the other hand you dont strike me as the toking type thats all right said banks who actually wouldnt have minded trying the stuff again on another occasion but he was keeping his mind clear for emily instead he lit a cigarette i see said clough staring down at the burned spot on the carpet he looked at burgess youre the bad cop and hes the good cop right you dont know the half of it a muscular young man with bleachedblond hair came up to them as they walked down the upstairs hall everything all right he asked clough only i didnt think mr burgess here was on the invitation list yeah everythings fine and dandy maybe we should remember to add him in the future seems like the life and soul of the party type to me whos that banks asked burgess jamie gilbert nasty little psycho hes barrys chief enforcer gilbert walked away laughing and clough turned to them jamies my administrative assistant he said well that covers a multitude of sins burgess shot back they finally found an empty room on the top floor completely empty no furniture white walls white floorboards is this the best you can do said banks clough shrugged take it or leave it at least it was protected for the most part from the music downstairs and there was a light trying to conduct an interview while sitting on the floor wouldnt be very dignified so they all chose to stand and lean against walls it gave a strange sort of threesided edge to the conversation clough folded his arms and leaned back so whats it all about then dont tell me you dont know said banks humor me last time i saw you you were a friend of emilys father i thought she was called louisa no you didnt you knew what her name was i only found out from the papers so you do know what happened i know shes dead yes nothing to do with me well excuse us for thinking youre a good bet burgess cut in he had agreed to let banks do most of the interviewing but banks knew he would be impossible to shut up completely clough stared at burgess as if he were a piece of dog shit on his shoe he didnt know that burgess thrived on looks like that they only made him better at his job banks could make out the faint sounds of white room coming from downstairs a best of album then and not disraeli gears as he had originally thought the song was strangely appropriate banks thought looking around the white room they were in he wasnt sure what he expected from this interview certainly not for clough to confess if anything he wanted to go away with the certainty that he had the right man in his sights a gut feeling if that was the best he could come up with then begin the slow painstaking grind toward finding enough evidence to prove it knowing that was only the beginning of the struggle between the crown prosecution services reluctance to prosecute anyone and the expensive barristers to whom clough no doubt had access there was every possibility that the man could get away with murder then what private vengeance would riddle do it himself or try to hire banks to kill clough the way he had used him to find emily christ though you had to draw the line somewhere and banks thought he drew his at murder no matter how despicable the victim he wasnt too sure about burgess though sometimes his cynical gray eyes took on the look of a stonekiller what wed expect you to say banks went on but lets back up a little first how did you feel when emily left you what do you mean left me i threw her out not what i heard you heard wrong okay banks held his hand up i can tell youre sensitive about it so lets carry on that final night at the party you pushed her into a room with andrew handley right i pushed her nowhere she was so stoned she could hardly walk she stumbled in there herself but you dont deny she ended up in a room with handley why should i and that he tried to rape her rapes a bit strong for what happened there attempted rape then i dont think so call it what you will it was nothing to do with me if andy wanted to try it on with the little slut that was his business and emily escaped ran away when did she tell you all wait a minute clough put one hand to the side of his head and made an expression of mock thinking wait a minute i get it after she left the party she ran to you right she knew where you were staying she spent the night with you thats why youre so upset tell me chief inspector banks did you like it did you like that wet scaly little tongue of hers licking your clough didnt finish the sentence because as banks struggled with the desire to lash out burgess beat him to it and gave clough a backhander that sent him staggering toward the other wall typical burgess that it was all right for him to tease banks about sleeping with emily but not anyone else clough looked ready to fight back muscles twitching wiping a little thread of blood from the side of his mouth and giving burgess one of those looks but he regained his composure and to give him his due banks thought he didnt make any noise about lawsuits or revenge he stuck his tongue out and licked the blood from the corner of his mouth sorry he said taking up his position against the wall again i got a little carried away then very rude of me to speak ill of the dead like that i apologize banks relaxed and offered him a cigarette apology accepted clough took it and lit it with his own lighter thanks forgot mine downstairs i was in the kitchen enjoying a nice glass of château margaux when you two arrived well make sure you get back to your wine before it turns to vinegar mr clough said banks but no more flights of fancy okay just answer the questions yes officer clough smiled and cracked the crust of blood sending another thin stream down his chin he wiped it off with the back of his hand and went on smoking blood staining the filter of his cigarette after emily left did you check up on her find out who she was where she lived why would i do that id finished with her she wasnt worth the effort so you didnt no did you know who she was not until i read it in the papers sleeping with a chief constables daughter eh he laughed wonder what my associates would say your associates being criminals now thats close to slander that is sue me not worth the effort not much is worth the effort with you is it barry what can i say life goes on seize the moment live for the now banks looked at burgess and i never used to believe it when they said drugs could do you permanent damage burgess laughed whered you get the strychnine barry banks asked the what you heard never touch the stuff ive heard its bad for your health banks sighed is andrew handley here tonight i wouldnt mind a word with him ill bet you wouldnt unfortunately no hes not in fact hes no longer in my employ you fired him lets say we came to a parting of the ways have you got his address we werent that close it was only business ever heard of pkf computer systems what was there just a slight flicker of recognition there clough offguard for a moment letting it through banks knew he could easily be imagining it but he thought his internal antennae had detected something it wasnt as farfetched as he had originally thought when burgess told him about cloughs business practices move into a business park do whatever crooked little thing it is you do and then before anyone twigs on to it move somewhere else which is where the white van rented by pkf which didnt exist was going when it was hijacked the driver still in a coma there were plenty of business parks and trading estates in the country most of them fairly remote they were good places to operate from and emily had said something about clough visiting eastvale she had also thought she saw jamie gilbert there could there be a motive for killing her in that something she knew about cloughs business operations she had a photographic memory like her mother banks remembered pkf banks repeated no never heard of it why should i have charlie courage im sure id remember someone with a name like that but you dont no banks could sense burgess getting impatient across from him maybe he had a point they seemed to be getting nowhere fast where were you last thursday afternoon he asked why is that when it happened just answer the fucking question burgess did his worldweary voice clough didnt even look at him i was out of the country all day all week actually in spain nice for you sure you didnt nip up to yorkshire for an hour or two why would i want to do something like that the weathers far better in spain weekend in the country perhaps get your own back on emily after all you dont like losing your prized possessions do you clough laughed if she told you that then shes got a pretty inflated opinion of herself a little overproof coke barry make her suffer youre mad clough pushed himself away from the wall look ive been patient with you but this is absurd time for you to go wherever coppers crawl after dark and time for me to get back to my fun and games any more talking and my lawyer will be present here is he clough grinned as a matter of fact he is then he opened the door and gestured for them to leave they stood their ground a moment then there being no point staying any longer banks gave burgess the nod and they left as burgess was passing clough on the way out banks heard clough whisper and dont think ill forget what you did back there ill crush you for that little man i own people more important than you burgess gave a mock shudder ooh im quaking in my boots then they pushed their way through the stream of people coming up and down the stairs edged through the hall and said good night to the minder who grunted while they were still in his earshot banks said maybe we should call in the drugs squad after all the bouncer disappeared inside the house like a shot party pooper said burgess besides theyre probably already in there they walked out of the gates and headed toward the canal it was an interesting evening though said burgess very interesting indeed thanks for inviting me i enjoyed myself my pleasure and i must say banks you surprise me what are you talking about oh listen to him so modest so naive the girl banks the girl in the hotel room youre the quiet one arent you but youve got hidden depths my administration for you has just grown by leaps and bounds i didnt realize how close to the mark i was banks gritted his teeth they were near the regents canal now which gave little venice its name for banks at that moment it evoked fond memories not of venice but of amsterdam and of burgess flailing around cursing in the filthy water down the steps a little push a tiny trip but no that would be just too childish nothing happened banks said like i said leaps and bounds burgess repeated clapping his arm around bankss shoulder and now my old cock sparrow the night is still young i suggest we head for the nearest pub and get shitfaced what do you say banks annie didnt stop to consider the folly of her actions or their possible consequences until she was following wayne dalton up skelgate lane a narrow walled path to the north just before reeth school an hour or so earlier after asking winsome jackman and kevin templeton to cover for her she had parked across north market street from the fox and hounds then followed dalton down to the market square where he had parked his car after that she followed him to reeth about a half hour drive away and the rest was easy though it was a perfect day for walking there were few other cars parked on the cobbles outside the shops and none on the green itself annie saw a number of people who looked as if they were dressed for rambling a few clouds marred the blue winter sky blocking the sun occasionally as they floated by but the temperature was about ten degrees and there was very little wind skelgate lane was overgrown stony and muddy in places after the recent rains while annie had put on suitable walking shoes there were times as she squelched through the unavoidable mud when she thought her red wellies would have been more appropriate what the hell did she think she was doing anyway she asked herself after the first half mile the investigation into emily riddles murder of which she was dio was going full steam still in its crucial early stages and here she was leaving two dcs in charge while she took time out to settle old scores or tilt at windmills her behavior offended even her own sense of professionalism but when it came right down to it her profession was the reason she was doing it the situation with dalton was something she had to get resolved quickly because it had become too much of a distraction she had dressed like an anonymous rambler in a charcoal anorak black jeans tucked into her gray woollen socks sturdy walking shoes hat and an ash stick she wasnt carrying a rucksack nor did a plastic folder of ordnance survey maps hang around her neck instead she carried a small book of local walks and when she stopped for a moment to refer to it she saw where dalton was likely to be going it was five and a half miles of relatively easy walking taking them along the daleside above the river swale then down and back along the river to grinton arriving there around lunchtime she looked for a good vantage point where she might confront him and decided that it would be best to wait until they had doubled back over the swing bridge near reeth then they would be near the old corpse way to grinton she had two choices either walk down to the swing bridge and wait a couple of hours for him to come by or follow him at a safe distance she decided on the latter course partly because there were a number of possible diversions from the route the dales were crisscrossed by hundreds of footpaths signposted or not going off in every direction not all of them listed in guidebooks he could for example turn off by calver hill into arkengarthdale for a different walk or continue along the high dale to gunnerside though then it would take him much longer to get back to grinton more like for dinnertime rather than lunch besides even if she were only ten yards from him he would never recognize her not with the hat and the anorak and not when he wasnt expecting to see her annie had always marveled at how even in summer you could walk for miles in the dales and hardly see another soul in winter you were far less likely to bump into someone along the tops after emerging from skelgate lane into open moorland she passed a small group of ramblers probably a club going the other way everyone politely said good morning as they passed by after that she couldnt see a soul except dalton a good half mile or more ahead wearing a distinctive red anorak it certainly made him easy to keep in her sights the guidebook advised her to pause and enjoy views of fremington edge back in the east and harkerside on the opposite side of the valley but though she glanced occasionally at the cloud shadows drifting over the greenishbrown hillsides with their distinctive patterns of drystone walls one field shaped like a milk jug another like a teacup annie was in no mood for sightseeing still up here on the heights looking down on the valley below reminded her of cliff walks around st ives with her father when she was younger how he used to point out examples of interesting perspectives shapes textures and colors in the landscape how he was always stopping to sketch frantically into the book he carried with him eyes and brain tuned to his fingers in moments like that she might as well not have been there she didnt exist all that was missing today was the crashing of the waves and the screeching of gulls instead hares hopped through the spent heather and grouse broke cover the weather turned nasty for a few minutes along the daleside with a brisk west wind whipping up and at one point blowing a brief hailstorm at her she had had to lean forward into the wind to make progress looking up occasionally to see the red anorak in the distance by the time she came to the steep descent into the village of healaugh the wind and hail had all gone and as she walked through the quiet streets she could almost believe it was summer a man in a white coat stood selling meat and vegetables to villagers from the back of a small van everyone paused and looked at her as she walked past none of them smiled or said anything they just stared it was an odd feeling they didnt exactly seem unfriendly but aloof a little mournful even as if they were telling her that their world was not hers and never would be that she was merely passing through it and she should keep going she did shortly beyond the village which was the turning point in the walk the path led her through a field down to the riverside she could see daltons red anorak ahead every now and then appearing and disappearing between the bare alders that lined the swale empty brown seed cones still clung to many of the branches making the trees look chocolate brown the closer she got the more nervous and confused annie became she still wasnt physically afraid of him but daltons arrival in eastvale and the memories it stirred had played havoc with her usually calm emotional center for one thing she didnt know what to say to him what did you say to a man who had been a willing accessory to your rape a man who would have raped you himself if you hadnt managed to wriggle free from his grasp and escape how would he react perhaps she began to think this wasnt such a good idea after all it would be easy enough just to turn left at the swing bridge and walk up to reeth where her car was parked on the cobbles by the green and forget the whole thing get back to work but she kept on going it was only a small bridge at that point the river meandered through meadowland where cows grazed it was however a genuine swing bridge and annie experienced a frisson of fear as she walked the wooden planks and felt it sway while not exactly phobic she had always been a little nervous of bridges though she didnt know why dalton had paused by the riverbank at the other side about a hundred yards or so ahead and he appeared to be watching her approach feeling a little dizzy annie stayed on the bridge and pretended to admire the view waiting for him to carry on but he didnt he stayed where he was and kept on looking at her her heart was in her mouth did he recognize her had he known she was following him all along there was only one thing to do if she wasnt going to run she walked through the gate at the far end of the bridge and along the grassy path to where he stood all the way he kept looking at her but she still didnt sense any recognition on his part her fear was quickly turning into anger how dare he not recognize her after what he had done she tried to take long deep breaths to keep herself calm and centered they helped a little finally about five or six yards away from dalton she stopped and took off her hat letting her wavy chestnut hair fall free to her shoulders she saw the recognition now he hadnt known who she was before she could tell but he did now she even heard his sharp intake of his breath you he said hello wayne she said yes its me nice to see you again banks awoke from a disturbing dream at about eight oclock on sunday morning he had been walking in an unfamiliar landscape which kept switching between rural and urban settings there was a river somewhere or perhaps a canal whatever it was there was a sense in the dream that it was never far away it was always raining and always twilight no matter where he was or how long he seemed to walk other people drifted by like shadows but nobody he knew he had the feeling that he was supposed to be following someone but he didnt know whom or why suddenly he found himself on a green iron bridge and a man was walking just in front of him at that point banks felt panic gather felt as if he couldnt breathe and wanted to wake up and break out of it the man turned he wasnt a monster though just a perfectly ordinarylooking man i know youve been looking for me he said to banks smiling my names graham marshall i was in the army then i had my hair cut now im in the rain emilys with me too but she cant appear to you right now then he went on to tell a garbled life story of which banks could remember nothing when he woke in a cold sweat to church bells ringing in the distance it was still dark outside so banks turned on the bedside light he was in a small hotel near kings cross not the place he had stayed with annie and emily somehow going back there hadnt seemed like a good idea when he had taken stock of himself he realized with relief that he felt only mildly hung over that was he remembered because he had declined the invitation to repair to burgesss flat and drink whiskey all night surely he wasnt getting wiser in his old age anyway he was glad that all theyd done was visit a few pubs and down a few pints it must have been a dull evening for burgess though they hadnt got into any fights or picked up any women mostly burgess had talked about clough and banks got the impression that even if he didnt manage to pin emilys murder on clough himself the mans days of freedom were limited the only problem with clough as a suspect thought banks was that he stood to gain nothing by emilys death still there was always the chance that she had stolen from him as ruth walker had suggested or that she knew too much about his business activities though banks thought she would have told him if that were the case it was also possible that clough only thought she knew something she didnt this was assuming of course that the whole matter was one of logic and profit what if it wasnt clough was certainly capable of killing and if emily had humiliated him in any way then he was probably capable of killing her out of sheer malice banks got up and poured himself a glass of water the dream and the drink had left him with a dry mouth as he showered in the tiny stall he put the graham marshall dream out of his mind and found himself thinking again of what ruth had said how her words had cast suspicion even on riddle himself someone banks had completely overlooked as a suspect he found it hard to take it seriously that a man like jimmy riddle would deliberately give his daughter cocaine laced with strychnine even if for some obscure reason he did want her dead and her death had done nothing to free riddle of the shame of her exploits in fact it had quite the opposite effect and already the tabloids were raking up stories of the chief constables daughter and her wild life that wouldnt do his budding political career any good at all or his standing in the force either then there was rosalind riddle banks had had a strange feeling about her right from the start when riddle first asked him to go to london and find emily rosalind hadnt appeared to want emily back home for some reason more recently rosalind had denied ever hearing of ruth walker yet ruth said she had spoken to her on the telephone on several occasions that probably meant nothing banks realized merely a lapse of memory a misheard name over a poor connection but rosalinds role in all this still nagged away at the back of his mind she was holding something back of that he was certain whether it was important to the investigation or not he couldnt say all families have secrets that can fester away behind their protective walls banks decided for the moment to concentrate on the line of inquiry he was pursuing in london where emily had done most of her drugtaking and mixed with a rough crowd primarily clough of course who lied about everything then ruth walker who remained a bit of an enigma to him yet seemed a woman embittered far beyond her years and finally craig newton hurt exboyfriendturnedstalker and onetime amateur porn photographer whom banks was going to visit again that day after a quick breakfast of coffee and toast and a short walk around st pancras gardens to clear his head banks felt ready to face the day he was only about half a mile away from euston so he walked through the quiet streets of somers town to eversholt street the train service to milton keynes was frequent even on sunday and he only had to wait twenty minutes for an intercity watching the urban sprawl of london give way to prime commuter territory set amid rolling fields and grazing cows banks wrote up his notes on the previous evenings talk with barry clough sometimes he took notes at the time especially of important details but that hadnt seemed appropriate standing in the white room with clough and burgess fortunately though his memory was average in most respects he had excellent audio recall and could remember a conversation practically verbatim for at least a couple of days he also thought about the coming interview with craig newton and tried to come up with a strategy it was official business this time not privateeye work for jimmy riddle approaching craig newton and getting any sort of trust out of him would be a delicate and difficult matter after all the lies he had told on his last visit it had been the same with ruth walker and craig newton struck him as a far more sensitive person than ruth on the other hand craig had lied to banks too though it was his first visit in daylight he still saw nothing of milton keynes on the taxi ride to craigs house except a few glimpses of concrete and glass perhaps that was all there was to see craig newton was home and though he seemed puzzled to see banks again he invited him into the house it hadnt changed much since the last visit still very much the bachelors house with little piles of newspapers and magazines here and there and coffee rings on the low table im sorry said craig you know about your daughter i read about it in the newspaper banks felt like an utter shit craig seemed the trusting sort and here he was letting him down still a hard lesson in the reality of deception probably wouldnt do the kid any harm in the long run having been a policeman for years banks had long since stopped trying to make everybody like him he still felt like an utter shit as he pulled out his warrant card though craig gaped at him but you said i dont understand its simple craig said banks sitting down i lied emilys father wanted me to find her and it seemed a good idea to pretend that i was him instead of trying to explain myself you can understand that cant you i suppose so but it was a simple strategy anyone would have more sympathy for the girls father than for a policeman so you lied yes he seemed to draw in on himself what do you want this time more information im not the only one who lied am i craig you talked to louisa you must have known i would what did she say about me that you were bothering her following her stalking her id never have done her any harm i was just i what craig i loved her cant you understand that it didnt give you the right to follow her around and scare her when she didnt want to see you scare her thats laugh she hardly noticed me clough did though didnt he who oh come on craig you knew his name didnt you you just didnt want me to talk to him about your stalking emily craig rubbed his nose the bastard never a truer word anyway lets leave that behind us for the moment shall we fine with me her real name is emily is that right banks nodded and gamine a joke its an anagram of enigma which is a sort of riddle emily louise riddle was her real name and her fathers my boss i see you probably didnt have much choice then i suppose i shouldnt have believed you in the first place should i i feel like a real idiot now no need to what reason could you possibly have had to think i was lying none but still i had my suspicions i told you i thought there was something funny about you the way you kept asking questions banks smiled yes i remember so credit yourself with that and lets move on i cant see theres anything i could possibly tell you thats of any use the papers said she took some poisoned cocaine in a club is that right thats right did you ever supply emily with cocaine craig no im not a dealer i never have been a user ive snorted it on occasion not for a long time though she must have got it from somewhere ask her new boyfriend i doubt that was the first time she took it well ask ruths friends then it certainly wasnt me what do you mean ruths friends just that theyre more into drugs than i am thats all selling no just recreational the music scene clubbing that sort of thing what about strychnine what about it ever have cause to use it in your line of work im not a bloody ratcatcher you know i mean photography no where were you last thursday craig frowned thursday i dont remember i could check just a minute that might have been the day he got up and pulled a pocket diary from his jacket out in the hall when he opened it to the right date he looked relieved yes that was the day i was in buckingham doing some publicity shots for the university anyone see you the person who was putting the promotional brochure together a lecturer from the law department canadian bloke i can give you his name please craig gave it how long were you with him for an hour or so in the morning and then then i walked around and took the photos so you were pretty much on your own the rest of the day yes but people must have seen me am i a suspect what do you think emily finished with you and you stalked her it wouldnt be the first time that sort of things led to murder obviously if youve got an alibi i can cross you straight off my list makes life easier thats all but craig newton didnt have an alibi he could easily have driven from buckingham to eastvale in about three hours banks had thought about the timing and decided that while there was no telling exactly when emily had been given the poison that killed her the odds were that she wouldnt have left a stash of coke sitting around for too long without snorting any there was also the fact that she was back living at home and she wouldnt dare do it around her parents it wouldnt be much fun at home alone anyway even if they were out coke was a social drug and most likely she would have saved it for a party or a night out clubbing it made most sense then that whoever had given her the stuff had given it to her on thursday afternoon after first giving her a sample of perfectly good uncontaminated cocaine that would explain why she turned up a bit high at the cross keys i didnt kill her i told you i loved her craig if youd been in this business as long as i have youd realize that love is one of the strongest motives it might be in the twisted world you live in but pardon me if i havent had the chance to become that cynical i loved her i wouldnt have harmed her probably not said banks what kind of car do you drive nissan color white i suppose you want the number too please craig told him it meant nothing yet but if they came across someone who had seen emily getting into a car then it could be of value you should be going after that boyfriend of hers you know he went on instead of harassing innocent people like me so you keep saying believe me craig hes never far from my thoughts and im not harassing you youd know it if i was why dont you arrest him no evidence you overestimate our powers we cant just go around arresting people without any evidence actually he could but craig wasnt to know that and he couldnt be bothered to explain the difference between arrest and charge look craig i realize youre not enjoying this but i didnt enjoy seeing emilys body either was it i mean ive heard about what strychnine does did you ever contact emily after shed gone home i didnt even know shed gone home you never told me whether youd found her or not or whether shed agreed to go back to be honest if i didnt read the papers pretty thoroughly i wouldnt even have known she was dead i recognized the photo but not her name i understand you were in london yesterday thats right any particular reason i dont see what its got to do with you but i had two business appointments and they are listed here in my appointment book so you can check them if you want and i also wanted to have a look at some new photographic equipment the high street here may be quaint but you must have noticed that its hardly chockablock with camera shops and you had lunch with ruth walker again thats right she had a cold didnt she she was sniffling a bit yeah so what what did you talk about we were both stunned to hear of louisas death i suppose we wanted to mourn her together for a while toast our memories of her shed been important to both of us after all could ruth have been jealous of you and emily i cant see why its not as if ruth and me were ever lovers or anything but she might have wanted it that way she never said anything like i told you before ruth and me were just good friends there was nothing you know like that between us at least not in your mind its the only one i can speak for perhaps she wanted there to be something craig shrugged i didnt fancy her in that way and im pretty sure she knew it besides what youre suggesting is absurd if ruth had to be jealous of anyone it should have been the new boyfriend he took emily completely away from both of us jealousys rarely rational craig emily breezed in and out of your lives and tossed you both aside at least thats how ruth put it how did you feel about that ruth can be a bit melodramatic when the mood takes her how did i feel you know damn well how i felt i told you last time you were here when you were pretending to be her father i was devastated hurt heartbroken but i got over it only after youd followed her around for a while yeah well im not proud of that i wasnt thinking clearly maybe you werent thinking clearly when you killed her thats absurd no matter how cynical you are i loved her and i would never have hurt her so you said are you sure of course im sure look are you suggesting i killed her over three months after she dumped me people have been known to brood for longer especially stalkers well i didnt and im getting sick of this i dont want to answer any more questions he stood up and if you want anything more out of me youll have to arrest me banks sighed i dont want to do that craig really i dont too much paperwork then youd better leave ive had enough i suppose i had said banks who had asked almost all the questions he wanted but there is one small thing you might be able to help me with craig looked at him through narrowed eyes go on last time i came to see you you told me that when you saw emily with her boyfriend in london you were taking candid pictures in the street right yes were you really taking pictures or just pretending for the sake of cover i took some candids yes do you still have the photos from that day yes do you have one of clough i think so yes why i know youre pissed off at me craig but would you do me a favor and make me a copy i could do that again though why oh i see you want to show it around up north dont you find out if anyone saw him up there i suppose hes got a watertight alibi doesnt he something like that said banks believe me it would be a great help at least youre thinking in the right direction again said craig i can probably get some prints to you by tomorrow what about now now sooner the better but id have to get set up i mean itd take a bit of time i can come back banks looked at his watch lunchtime how about i pop down to the nearest pub and have some lunch while you do the prints then ill come back and pick them up craig sighed anything to get you off my back try the plough down by the roundabout end of the high street and you dont need to come back ill drop them off there half an hour to an hour say ill be there said banks will you do me a favor in exchange depends whens the funeral going to be that depends on when the coroner releases the body will you let me know her parents dont know me so they wont invite me but id like you know at least to be there dont worry craig ill let you know thanks now i suppose id better get up to the darkroom of all the different ways that annie had tried to imagine this moment turning out confronting her rapist the one thing that had never occurred to her was that it would end with a sense of anticlimax of disappointment but disappointment was exactly what she felt as she stood in front of wayne dalton on the banks of the river swale with a pile of steaming cowclap between them indifference even her heart was still pounding but more from the anticipation and the long walk than from the actual encounter and he looked like a guilty schoolboy caught masturbating in the toilets but instead of the monster she had created in her mind what stood before her was all too human dalton wasnt frightening he was pathetic for a few moments they just stared at each other neither spoke annie felt herself calming down becoming centered her heart returned to its normal rhythm she was in control finally dalton broke the silence what are you doing here i work here eastvale i followed you my god i never knew what do you want i dont know annie replied honestly i thought i wanted revenge but now im here it doesnt seem important anymore if its any consolation said dalton avoiding her eyes theres not a day gone by when i havent regretted that night regretted that you didnt get to finish what you started thats not what i mean we were insane annie i dont know what happened the drink the herd mentality he shook his head i know i was there calm as she was inside annie felt tears prickling her eyes and she hated the idea of crying in front of dalton you know ive dreamed of this moment of meeting one of you alone like this of crushing you now were here though it really doesnt matter it does matter annie it matters to me what do you mean and dont you dare call me annie sorry the guilt thats what im talking about what i have to live with day in day out annie couldnt stop herself from laughing oh wayne she said thats a good one thats really good one are you asking me for forgiveness i dont know what im asking for just for some some sort of end some resolution i see you want closure is that it popular term these days especially with victims everyone wants the bad guys put away gives them a sense of closure are you a victim here wayne is that it annie felt herself getting angry as she spoke the indifference resolving itself into something else into something harder two ramblers approached slowly from the woods beyond the river meadows thats not what i meant said dalton then tell me exactly what you did mean wayne because from where im standing youre the bad guy look i know what we did was wrong and i know that being drunk being part of a group is no excuse but im not that kind of person its the first the only time ive ever done anything like that so youre telling me that because youre not a serial rapist youre really an okay guy when it comes right down to it is that it you just made one silly little mistake one night when you and your pals had had a bit too much to drink and there was this young bird just asking for it she could tell her voice was rising as she spoke but she couldnt help herself she was losing it she struggled for control again christ thats not what im saying youre twisting my words oh pardon me said annie shaking her head i dont know whats worse a contrite rapist or an unrepentant one dont get it all out of proportion i didnt rape you no you didnt get your chance did you but you held me you helped rip off my panties and you stood there and enjoyed it while your friend raped me i saw your face wayne remember i know how you felt you were just waiting for your turn werent you like a little kid waiting for his go on the swings and you would have done it if youd got the chance in my mind that doesnt make you any different from the others youre just as bad as the others dalton sighed and looked at the ground annie glared at him as the ramblers passed by they said hello but neither annie nor dalton answered so what do you want from me he asked what do i want id like to see you off the job for a start in jail would be even better but i dont suppose thats going to happen is it would i settle for an apology instead i dont think so what more can i do you can admit what happened you can go back down there go see the chief super again and tell him you lied tell him the three of you got carried away and you raped me that i did nothing to lead you on or encourage you or make you think i was going to let the three of you fuck me senseless thats what you can do dalton shook his head all the color had drained from his face i cant do that you know i cant annie looked at him she felt her eyes burning again then the only thing you can do is fuck off fuck off right out of my life and dont ever come near me again then she turned and crossed the swaying bridge back to reeth the tears like fire as they coursed down her cheeks not turning to see dalton staring pathetically after her banks came out of the meeting early monday afternoon with only a little more information than he went in with a weekend of showing emilys photograph around town and making housetohouse inquiries had turned up several people who thought they had seen her in various eastvale shopping areas on thursday afternoon always alone but only one witness who thought she had seen her with anyone else unfortunately the witness was about as useful as most all she had seen was emily getting into a car outside the red lion hotel at the big york road roundabout she thought the time was about three oclock none of the bar staff at the red lion had seen emily and banks was certain they would remember if they had when it came to the make of car they all looked the same to the witness all she could say was that it was light in color she also hadnt noticed anything in the least bit odd about what she saw the girl had seemed to know the driver and smiled as she got in as if perhaps she had been waiting for the lift no she hadnt really got a glimpse of the driver at all except that maybe he or she was fairhaired so if their witness was to be believed emily had got into a lightcolored car with someone she probably knew and trusted around the time of the meeting she had mentioned at lunch she had left the black bull shortly before half past two dc templeton had checked the bus timetable and discovered that she must have taken the quartertothree to get there on time if and it was a big if their witness was right then the sighting raised several interesting points banks walked over to his office window and lit an illicit cigarette the day was overcast but balmy for the time of year a crew of borough workers were putting up the christmas tree in the market square watched by a group of children and their teacher the highpitched whine of some sort of electric drill came from the extension down the corridor it reminded banks of the dentists and he gave a little shudder in the first place banks thought why was emily meeting someone on the edge of town rather than in another pub or in the swainsdale centre especially if this someone had a car and could easily drive into the town center answer because she was meeting someone who intended to kill her and who had insisted on the arrangement because he or she didnt want to be seen with emily any secrecy could easily be explained by the fact that drugs were being sold objection if this person wanted to kill emily why not drive her into the country and do it at leisure then bury her body where it would never be found that raised the whole issue of the way she was killed poison or so the cliché goes is a womans weapon in this case if emilys killer hadnt been in the bar none at the time of her death then the murder had also occurred at some distance from the killer that suggested someone who wanted to get rid of her but didnt have any particular emotional stake in seeing her die on the other hand the use of strychnine as a method implied someone who wanted emily to suffer an agonizing and dramatic death there are far easier and less painful ways of getting rid of a pest the murder had elements of both calculation in its premeditation and extreme sadism in its method a profile which might easily fit barry clough the gangster who didnt like to lose his prized possessions but would clough drive all the way from london simply to give emily some poisoned cocaine because she had insulted his macho vanity he had said he was in spain at the time and banks was having that checked it wouldnt be easy given how lax border crossings were these days but they could tackle the airlines first and then find out if any of his neighbors in spain had seen him also while strychnine wasnt as difficult to get hold of as some poisons it wasnt exactly on sale in the local chemists shop banks had looked it up strychnine derived originally from the seeds of the nux vomica tree which grows mainly in india was used mostly as a rodenticide it had some medical uses vets used it as a mild stimulant for example and it was sometimes used in research to cause convulsions in experiments for antiseizure drugs and in the treatment of alcoholism none of bankss suspects was a doctor or a nurse and strychnine wasnt issued on prescriptions so the medical side could be ruled out craig newton was a photographer and they sometimes had access to unusual chemicals though not as far as banks could remember strychnine barry clough could no doubt get hold of anything he wanted then there was andrew handley to consider andy pandy cloughs gofer the one he had given emily to the night she fled to bankss hotel such rejection could have driven handley to revenge if he was that kind of person burgess had said he would put some men on trying to track down handley so maybe they would get a chance to ask him soon but would emily have smiled as she got in his car with either clough or handley christ why hadnt emily told banks whom she was going to meet why hadnt he asked her he rested his forehead against the cool glass and felt the vein throb in his temple it was no good banks decided he needed far more information before he could even speculate about what had happened he had found nothing of use in the contents of her handbag once they had been gathered up and bagged nothing but the usual cigarettes tampons electronic organizer keys a purse with in it makeup a crumpled film magazine an old family photograph probably the one ruth walker had mentioned ruths driving license which she hadnt even really needed anymore and the fake proofofage card the socos had turned up nothing of interest from the ladies toilet in the bar none except for any number of unidentified pubic hairs and there were no prints except emilys on the glassine bag in which the cocaine and strychnine had been kept there were hundreds of prints around the stall which testified to the frequency with which the owners thought it necessary to clean the toilets but banks suspected they would come to nothing he was convinced that the killer whoever it was hadnt been in the bar none toilets either with or without emily and had not even been in the club at the time of her death had probably never been there this was murder from a distance perhaps even death by proxy which made it all the more bloody difficult to solve dc templeton had come up with a lead on the couple seen leaving the bar none at ten fortyseven a bartender at the jolly roger pub a popular place for the student crowd on market street seemed to remember them being in the pub earlier that evening she had seen them before she said but didnt know their names she only recognized the way they were dressed and thought they were students at the college like most of her customers next banks turned his mind to charlie courages murder and felt a singular lack of progress there too charlies murderer had been at the scene of course but charlie himself had been far from home in the middle of nowhere the only solid piece of evidence was the tire track and that would be no use at all unless a corresponding car could be found he decided to phone di collaton later in the day and see if anything had turned up at the market harborough end maybe he could have a word with di dalton too see if he had come up with anything more on pkf computer systems banks stubbed out his cigarette in his wastebin making sure it was completely dead and tried to clear the air as best he could by opening the window and waving a file folder about when someone knocked at the door and walked in he felt guilty like the time his mother noticed ash from his cigarette on the outside window ledge of his room and stopped his pocket money but it was only annie cabbot he had asked her to drop by his office as soon as she had finished handing out actions to the newly drafted dcs that red ron mclaughlin had promised she looked particularly good this morning banks thought her shiny chestnut hair falling in waves over her shoulders her almond eyes serious and alert though showing just a hint of wariness she was wearing a loose white shirt and black denim jeans which tapered to an end just above her ankles around one of which she wore a thin gold chain annie sit down annie sat and crossed her legs she twitched her nose youve been smoking in here again mea culpa she smiled what did you want to see me about in the first place id like you to go over to the transportation office at the bus station see if you can find out who was driving the quartertothree bus to york the one that stops at the roundabout annie made a note have a chat with him see if he remembers emily being on the bus and getting into a lightcolored car near the red lion you might also see if he can give you any leads as to his other passengers someone might have noticed something okay and have a chat with that bartender at the jolly roger see if she can come up with anyone who might know where this couple lives who they are its probably a dead end but we have to check it out annie made a note okay anything else banks paused this is a bit awkward annie i dont want you to get the impression that this is in any way personal but its just that since we started this investigation i dont feel ive had your full cooperation annies smile froze what do you mean i mean it feels like theres a part of you not here youve been distracted and id like to know why annie shifted in her chair thats ridiculous not from where im sitting look what is this am i on the carpet or something are you going to give me a bollocking i just want to know whats going on if theres something i can help with nothings going on at least not with me whats that supposed to mean do i have to spell it out for you try all right annie leaned forward you said this wasnt personal but i think it is i think youre behaving this way because of what happened with us because i broke off our relationship you cant handle working with me banks sighed annie this is a murder case a sixteenyearold girl who also happens to be our chief constables daughter was poisoned in a nightclub i would have hoped i wouldnt have to remind you of that until we find out who did it this is a twentyfourhouraday sevendayaweek job for us and if youre not up to it for one reason or another i want to know now are you in or out youre blowing this out of all proportion im on the job i might not be obsessed with the case but im on the job are you implying i am obsessed im not implying anything but if the cap fits what i will say is that its a damn sight more personal for you than it is for me i didnt go to london to track her down or have lunch with her on the day she died you did thats neither here nor there were talking about your commitment to the case what about sunday what do you mean sunday morning when i called in for an update you were out of contact all morning and dc jackman sounded decidedly cagey im hardly responsible for dc jackmans telephone manner annie stood up flushed put her palms on his desk and leaned forward jutting her chin out look i took some personal time all right are you going to put me on report because if you are just do it and cut the fucking lecture will you ive had enough of this with anyone else banks would have hit the roof but he was used to annies insubordinate manner it was one of the things that had intrigued him about her in the first place though he still couldnt be sure whether he liked it or not at the moment he didnt the last thing i want to do is put you on report he said not with your inspectors boards coming up i would hope youd know that thats why im talking to you one on one i dont want this to go any further ill tell you something though if you keep on behaving like this whenever anyone questions your actions youll never make inspector is that a threat dont be absurd look annie sit down please annie held out for a while glaring then she sat cant you see im trying to help you out here said banks if theres a problem something personal something to do with your family i dont know then maybe we can work it out im not here to supervise you twentyfour hours a day you could have fooled me but i need to be able to trust you to leave you alone to get on with the job then why dont you because i dont think thats what youve been doing i trusted you and look what i found out banks sighed ive explained that and ive explained what i was doing not to my satisfaction you havent and i dont have to remind you that im sio on this one its my head on the block so if theres a problem if its something i can help you with then spit it out tell me what it is and i will no matter what you believe im not after doing you any harm because of what did or didnt happen between us not everything is as personal as you think it is credit me with a bit more professionalism than that professionalism is that what this is all about annie theres something wrong let me help you she gave a sharp jerk of her head and got to her feet again no at that moment di dalton popped his head around the door what is it banks asked annoyed at the interruption dalton looked at banks then at annie and an expression of panic crossed his features what is it di dalton dalton looked at them both again and seemed to compose himself i thought you might like to know that the van driver died early this morning jonathan fearn never regained consciousness shit said banks tapping his pen on the desk okay wayne thanks for letting me know dalton glanced at his watch ill be off back to newcastle now keep in touch will do dalton and annie looked at one another for a split second before he left and banks saw right away that there was something between them some spark some secret it hit him smack in the middle of the chest like a hammer blow dalton so that was what she had been up to it fit her odd behavior coincided exactly with his arrival in eastvale annie and dalton had something going banks felt icy worms wriggle their way up inside his spine annie stood for a few seconds her eyes bright glaring at banks defiantly then with an expression of disgust she turned on her heels strode out of his office and slammed the door so hard that his filing cabinet rattled sometimes trying to get a lead was like drawing teeth annie reflected the bus driver had been easy enough to find in fact he had been eating a late breakfast in the station café before his first scheduled trip of the day but he had been no help at all all hed been able to tell her was that he remembered emily getting off at the roundabout but there had been far too much traffic to deal with for him to notice anything more the bus had been mostly empty and he didnt know who any of the other passengers were he could however state with some certainty that emily was the only person to get off at that stop disappointed annie headed for the jolly roger still fuming from her runin with banks after her confrontation with dalton she had actually felt better more confident ready to get on with the job without distractions she might even have told banks why she had been distracted in the first place if he hadnt taken such a highhanded attitude the bloody nerve of him having her on the carpet like that he knew she hated that sort of thing annie had never been able to handle authority well which can be something of a liability in the police force but most of the time she could pay lip service when required not with banks though this time he had hit her where it really hurt her professionalism and the fact that he was partly right hurt even more she would show him though she wasnt going to wallow in selfpity she was going to get back on the damn horse and ride again annie paused briefly at the market square to watch the awestruck expressions on the childrens faces as they gathered around the christmas tree it took her back to her own childhood in st ives there had been few if any practicing christians down at the commune where she had grown up most of the people who passed through had no religion at all other than art and those who had tended toward the more esoteric kinds such as zen buddhism and taoism the ones without god where you could ponder the meaning of nothingness and the sound of one hand clapping annie herself with her meditation and yoga came closer to buddhism than anything else though she never professed to be a buddhist she wasnt detached enough for a start she knew that desire caused suffering but still she desired christian or not every christmas had been a festive time for annie and the other kids there there were always some other children around though most of them never stayed long and she got used to her friends moving away being dependent on herself not on others but at christmas someone always came up with a tree and someone else scrounged around for some tinsel and decorations and annie always got christmas presents from whoever was living there at the time even if many of them were just sketches and small handcarved sculptures she still had most of them and some were worth a bit now not that she would ever sell them christmas was as much a tradition at the commune as anywhere else and it always brought back memories of her mother she still had a photograph of her mother holding her up to look closely at the tree decorations she must have been two or three years old and though she couldnt remember the moment itself the photograph always brought back waves of nostalgia and loss shrugging off the past she walked on to the jolly roger eastvale didnt have a large student population and the college itself was an ugly mess of red brick and concrete boxes on the southern fringes of the town surrounded by marshland and a couple of industrial estates nobody wanted to live out there even if there had been anywhere to live most of the students lived closer to the town center and there were enough of them to turn at least one pub into the typical student hangout and the roger as they called it was the one on first impression annie thought the jolly roger was no different from any other victorianstyle pub on market street but when she looked around inside she noticed it was more rundown and there was an odd selection of music on the jukebox including far more angry alternative stuff than pleasant pop and bigname bands the clientele at that time in the afternoon consisted mostly of students who had finished early or had been there since lunchtime they sat in small groups smoking chatting and drinking some favored the scruffy marxist look of old while others cultivated a more cleancut tony blair style but they all seemed to mix cheerfully together one or two loners in thick glasses sat at tables reading as they slowly sipped their pints annie went to the bar and pulled out the fuzzy image taken from the cctv video ive been told you might know this couple she said to the young man behind the bar who looked like a student himself one of our lads had a word yesterday not me love he said i wasnt on yesterday thatll be kath over there he pointed to a petite blonde busy pulling a pint and chatting to another girl across the bar annie walked over and showed her the photo any more thoughts on who this might be she asked after introducing herself ive given it a bit of thought said kath but i cant say as i have i know ive seen them here but i just cant place them lets have a look kath said the girl she didnt look old enough to be drinking but annie wasnt there to enforce the licensing laws she was dressed all in black including her lacetrimmed gloves with orange hair and a pale pixieish face she looked at annie if thats all right with you she added thats fine said annie we need all the help we can get im sam short for samantha annie didnt think it was short for samuel but you never knew pleased to meet you sam lousy picture sam commented that from the big brother video yes said annie its from the cctv cameras in the market square talk about an invasion of privacy the girl began you know id like to spend some time arguing the pros and cons of city center cctv with you sam said annie sweetly really i would but a young girl probably no older than you was murdered in the bar none last week and were trying to find out who killed her yeah i heard said sam looking away its a fucking shame a woman cant go anywhere by herself these days any idea who they are course i do will you tell me did they do it i very much doubt it but they might have seen something its alex and carly alex pender and carly grant carly and i do art together know where they live theyve got a flat on sebastopol avenue you know one of those big old victorian terraces landlords divide them up into poky flats and rent them out for a fortune talk about exploitation do you know the number sam told her knowing now the reasons for annies erratic behavior didnt make banks feel any better in fact as the afternoon wore on it made him feel worse when she had stormed out of his office he had stood for a moment to let his realization sink in then felt the bile rise and burn in his throat he might not be sleeping with annie anymore but the thought of her being with dalton hurt he had been through the same thing with sandra for months after she left when he knew she had moved in with sean the intolerable images crowded his mind and during the long nights of drinking alone with random phrases from bitter bob dylan love songs echoing around his mind the jealousy burned like acid on his soul perhaps it wasnt even jealousy but envy he couldnt have annie but he couldnt bear thinking about dalton having her whatever it was it hurt and banks had to make an effort to put it out of his mind for the time being and get on with the job first he sent dc templeton off to get copies made of the photo of clough he had got from craig newton it was a good shot candid or not and craig had cropped it so that it showed only clough in full mean face when that was done he would send a team out to check every hotel and guest house in the area to see if clough had been staying there recently he would also have jim hatchley and winsome jackman show it around daleview and charlie courages neighborhood in the meantime information had started trickling in now the working week had begun again he didnt learn much from the riddles phone records british telecoms investigations department had furnished dc templeton with a list of numbers called on the riddles house telephone for the last month and a subscriber check had supplied the names and addresses most seemed to be political cronies of jimmy riddle or calls to rosalinds law office someone emily presumably had phoned ruth walkers number twice but not within ten days of her death there were no calls to either craig newton andrew handley or barry clough the only other calls emily seemed to have made had been to darren hirst and to a sixthform college in scarborough banks thought it might be a good idea to get hold of craigs and cloughs records and do a crossreference it would take time but it might throw up a lead of some sort oddly enough banks couldnt find the call that emily had made to him the day before she died then he remembered the background noise and realized she must have used a public telephone now that jonathan fearn was dead banks also had another murder on his plate or manslaughter at least strictly speaking it was di daltons case the way charlie courages murder was collatons but there was a strong eastvale connection the daleview business park and pkf computer systems being at the heart of both banks was just about to check if anything was happening in the incident room when his phone rang it was vic manson the fingerprints expert its about that cd case you had sent over manson said find anything some very clear prints ive checked the national index and lo and behold they belong to a bloke called gregory manners who the hells he when hes at home you may well ask hes been a naughty boy though did six months a couple of years back for attempting to defraud customs and excise what smuggling to you and me well well well ring any bells so loud theyre deafening me thanks vic thanks a lot no problem the minute banks got off the phone with manson he called dirty dick burgess at the national criminal intelligence service banks solved your murder yet murders and no i havent how can i help ive got a few loose strands that seem to be coming together remember that pkf business i asked you about something to do with computers wasnt it thats right charlie courage night watchman and onetime con gets murdered the day after a van clears out pkfs daleview offices heading for another business park up tyneside way over the past four weeks hes made five twohundredpound cash deposits at his bank with me so far hanging on your every word the van itself gets hijacked north of newcastle and the entire contents disappear the driver jonathan fearn who by the way is a known associate of courages has just died of injuries received another murder then looks that way but let me finish pkf is a phony company and we cant trace anyone involved in it the only bit of evidence weve got is a cd case thats hardly evidence is it burgess commented stands to reason therell be cases around computer people thats not all ive just found out that the prints on this cd case are those of one gregory manners late of her majestys firstclass hotel in preston manners did six months for smuggling a lorryload of cigarettes through dover or trying to when questioned he said he was working alone and nobody was able to prove any different all right youve got a point as a matter of fact i do remember that one it was one of customs and excises few successes that year let me guess who was behind it barry clough the man himself seems hes everywhere we look isnt he he certainly is this manners connection links him directly to pkf whatever it was up to and by extension to the murders of charlie courage and jonathan fearn still like him for the girls murder too very much but we dont have enough to bring him in yet you told me yourself how slippery he is as a jellied eel you know what im thinking banks what this hijack you told me about it sounds very much as if someone ripped barry clough off indeed it does and we know barry doesnt like that barry throws tantrums when people upset him enough for two people to end up dead id say so so maybe courage was on cloughs payroll then he decided to work his own scam selling information about when pkf was moving and where they were going hed hardly have looked the other way during a robbery at daleview because it would have seemed far too obvious a hijacked vans pretty obvious too if you ask me said burgess charlie wasnt that bright obviously not anyway it all sounds possible it must have been valuable merchandise though to make it worth the risk there wasnt much risk to speak of believe me not on the road up there at that time on a sunday night ah the provinces they never cease to amaze me ever wondered where the stuffs got to yes said banks whatever it was im assuming its either been sold or its in someones lockup waiting to cool down im trying to run a check on other business parks around the country see if thereve been any more pkftype scams lately but thatll take forever what do you want me to do can you fax me what youve got on gregory manners for a start sure and have you any photos of andrew handley and jamie gilbert on file indeed we do could you fax them up here too it might not be a bad idea to have someone show them around daleview and charlie courages neighborhood along with cloughs okay thanks and will you keep a close eye on clough its being done as we speak because ill be wanting to talk to him again soon if anything breaks and this time i think well have him up here oh hell like that ill bet anyway thanks ill be in touch my pleasure by the way theres nothing on andy pandy yet it seems that when he wants to hide he stays hidden the lads are still on it though ill keep you informed thanks banks hung up the phone and tried to piece together what hed got not much really just a lot of vague suspicions as far as both cases were concerned there was still something missing the magnet the one piece that would rearrange the chaotic jumble of iron filings into a discernible pattern until he had that he would get nowhere he had a feeling that part of the answer at least lay with pkf and whatever it had been doing at least he could have gregory manners brought in and find out what he had to say about the operation annie found a place to park outside number sebastopol avenue walked up the front steps and rang the doorbell to flat number luck was still with her they were in the flat was quite nicely done up annie thought when they let her in and offered her a cup of tea the furniture looked used probably secondhand or parental donations but it was serviceable and comfortable the small living room was clean and uncluttered and the only decoration was a poster of a modigliani nude over the tiled mantelpiece annie recognized it from one of her fathers books he had always been a big fan of modigliani and of nudes under the window was a desk with a pc and a mini stereo unit stood in a cabinet along with stacks of compact discs there was no television what are you studying annie asked as alex brought the tea physics beyond my ken im afraid she nodded toward the painting someone likes art though i see thats me said carly im studying art history she was a slight girl with dyed black hair a ring through the far edge of her left eyebrow and another through the center of her lower lip which gave her voice a curious lisp they talked about art for a while then when they both seemed relaxed annie got down to business it wasnt as if she was there to interrogate them but people often got nervous around the police the way annie did around gynecologists have you any idea why im here she asked they shook their heads i found someone in the jolly roger who told me where you lived why havent you come forward before now you must know of all the appeals for information weve had out information about what alex asked a puzzled expression on his face he was goodlooking enough in a boyish sort of way though his hair looked as if it needed a wash and he had an adams apple the size of a gobstopper could do with a shave too annie thought or was she just getting conservative in her old age there was a time she reminded herself when she hadnt minded a little stubble on a man she had even worn a stud through her nose it wasnt that long ago either about the murder she went on emily riddles murder surely you know it happened at the bar none shortly after you left on thursday night alex and carly looked blank no it was in all the papers on telly everyones talking about it we dont have a tv set and well to be honest alex said we havent looked at a paper in days too busy at college seems like it annie thought but havent you heard anyone talking about it ive heard people talking about a drug overdose carly said but i didnt make the connection i didnt pay much attention its so negative i never read about things like that it upsets my balance why are you here why did you leave the club so early they looked at one another then carly lisped we didnt like the music thats it its enough isnt it i mean you wouldnt like to have to listen to that crap all night would you annie smiled she certainly wouldnt so why go in the first place we didnt know what sort of music they played alex answered someone at college said it was a pretty good place to have a few drinks and dance and you know unwind and buy drugs carly reddened we dont do drugs is that why you went to buy drugs and when youd bought them you left she said we dont do drugs and we dont said alex why cant you just believe us not every young persons some sort of drug addict you know i knew the cops were prejudiced against blacks and gays but i didnt think they were prejudiced against the young in general annie sighed shed heard it all before id love to believe you alex she said in a perfect world maybe but a girl died a very nasty death after taking some adulterated cocaine in the bar none not more than half an hour after you left and as yet we dont know when she got it or where she got it from if you can give me any help at all then surely that gives me the right to come here and ask you a few simple questions doesnt it it still doesnt give you the right to accuse us of being druggies said alex oh for crying out loud grow up alex if i were accusing the two of you of being junkies youd be down in the cells now waiting for your legal aid solicitor but you said lets move on shall we they both sulked for a moment then nodded what kind of music do you like alex shrugged all sorts really just not that technoravedisco crap they play at the bar none it gives me a headache annie got up and wandered over to look at their cd collection to see for herself hole nirvana the dancing pigs even an old van morrison there was quite a variety but certainly no dance mix one odd thing she noticed was that some of the cds had no covers only typed labels stuck on the cases identifying the contents when she looked more closely she also saw that the cds themselves didnt all have recordcompany logos she glanced at the desk and saw a couple of popular computer software programs and games there again there was no form of official identification where did you get these she asked noticing that carly had reddened when she picked up one of the cd cases shop what shop computer shop come on carly you think im stupid just because im an old fogy is that it you didnt buy this in any legitimate computer shop its a knockoff like the music cds where did you buy them its not illegal we wont go into the ins and outs of breach of copyright just now i just want to know where you bought them after letting the silence stretch for almost a minute alex answered bloke in the used bookshop down by the castle sells them castle hill books thats the one annie made a note it probably wasnt important and it wasnt her case but she couldnt dismiss the connection she felt with the empty cd case she had found at pfk she would pass the information on to sergeant hatchley are you going to arrest us carly asked no im not going to arrest you but i do want you to answer a few more questions okay okay while you were in the club did you notice anyone selling drugs or behaving suspiciously there werent many people in the place carly said everyone was just getting in drinks or sitting down a few people were dancing alex added but things hadnt really got going by then did you notice this girl annie showed them a picture of emily i think thats the girl who came in with some friends just after us carly said at least it looks like her about five foot six taller in her platforms flared jeans thats the one carly said no i didnt see her doing anything odd at all they sat down someone went for drinks i think she was dancing at one point i dont know i wasnt really paying attention the music was already driving me crazy you didnt notice her talk to anyone outside her immediate group no did you see her go to the toilet we werent watching people coming and going from the toilets so you didnt notice her go no all right did you recognize her have you ever seen her before no alex answered with a sly glance at carly and i think id remember carly threw a cushion at him he laughed she was too young for you alex said annie and by all accounts youd have been far too young for her she thought again of banks and his lunch with emily the day she died was there any more to it than that she still got the impression he was holding back hiding something things were going nowhere fast with carly and alex so she decided to wrap up the interview and call it a day okay she said standing up and stretching her back if either of you remembers anything about that evening no matter how insignificant it might seem to you give me a ring at this number she handed her card to carly who put it on the computer desk then left the flat ready to head home it had been a rough day maybe she could treat herself to a book and a long hot bath and put banks and dalton out of her mind the postman came before banks set off for work on wednesday morning and in addition to the usual bills and another letter from sandras lawyer which banks put aside for later he also brought with him a small oblong package noting the return address banks ripped open the padded envelope and held in his hand his sons first officially recorded compact disc blue rain along with a thank you note for the threehundredpound check banks had sent him and which had cut severely into his laphroaig budget there was a photograph of the band on the cover brian at the center in a practiced cool sort of slouch torn jeans tshirt a lock of hair practically covering one eye andy jamisse and ali flanked him it was a poorquality photograph banks noticed sandra certainly wouldnt approve and looked more like a grainy blackandwhite photocopy of a color original banks didnt much like the bands name either jimson weed sounded far too sixtyish and druggie but what did he know the music was what counted and banks was pleased to see that they had recorded their cover version of dylans love minus zerono limit a song he had been surprised to hear them play on the only occasion he had seen them perform live the rest of the songs were all originals with brian and jamisse sharing most of the writing credits apart from an old mississippi john hurt number avalon blues they werent a blues band but blues was an underlying influence on their music sometimes overlaid with rock folk and hiphop elements the grateful dead meet snoop doggy dogg banks was also absurdly pleased to see that in the liner notes brian had credited him with nurturing an interest in music hadnt mentioned that his dad was a copper though that wouldnt go down too well in the music business he didnt have time to listen to the cd before heading to the office if he expected his team to put in a full day on emilys murder then he had to set an example thoughts of work soon led into thoughts of annie who had contributed toward yet another sleepless night he couldnt understand what she saw in dalton who seemed such a dull unprepossessing type to banks not particularly goodlooking either but as he well knew there was neither rhyme nor reason in matters of sex and love he just wished he could get the images of them out of his mind last night he had tossed and turned unable to stop himself from imagining them making love in all sorts of positions dalton pleasing her far more than he had ever done making her cry out in ecstasy as she climaxed riding him wildly the morning dark and wet as it was brought a respite from the images but not from the feelings that had generated them working with her was turning out to be far more difficult than he had imagined it would be maybe she was right and he just couldnt hack it as he turned toward the town center and slowed in the knot of traffic on north market street which was just opening up for the day he wondered if everyone suffered from jealousy as much as he did it had always been that way for him jealousy had wrecked his relationship with the first girl he had ever slept with her name was kay summerville and she lived on the same peterborough estate as he did for weeks he had lusted after her as he watched her walk by in her jeans and yellow jacket long blond hair trailing halfway down her back she seemed unobtainable ethereal like most of the women he lusted after but he was surprised when one day walking back from the newsagents over the road with her he plucked up the courage to ask her out and she said yes everything went well until kay left school and got an office job in town she made new friends started going for drinks with the crowd regularly after work on a friday banks was still at school having stayed on for his alevels and a schoolboy had far less appeal than these slightly older better dressed more sophisticated men of the world at the office they had more money to flash around and even more important some of them had cars kay insisted there was no hankypanky going on but banks became tortured with jealousy racked by imagined infidelities and in the end kay walked away she couldnt stand his constant harping on whom she was seeing and what she was doing she said and the way he got stroppy if she ever so much as looked at another man shortly after banks moved to london and went to college there a year or two after that and several casual relationships later he met sandra after a rocky few months at the start when he realized he wanted her so much he couldnt bear the thought of anyone else being with her he saw that if he played his cards right nobody else but him was going to be and for the next twenty years or so he had very few problems with jealousy then she left him and sean came on the scene or vice versa now this with annie he was beginning to feel like a sexobsessed acneplagued teenager again and he didnt like it at all though he couldnt play it banks had brians cd on the passenger seat beside him feeling pride every time he managed to break off his miserable thoughts and look down to see his sons face on the cover the marriage might have ended badly but at least it had produced brian and tracy banks told himself and the world was a better place for having them in it he picked up the cd and dashed through the rain with it into the station once in his office he set it on his desk hoping that anyone who dropped by would ask about it because tuesday had been a day of paperwork phonework and legwork banks was hoping some of it would pay off today teams of uniformed and plainclothes officers had been sent out with photos of gregory manners andrew handley jamie gilbert and barry clough if any of those four had been up to no good in the eastvale area over the past month or so then someone would recognize them also as he had looked at the cover of the jimson weed cd and thought about some of the things he had discovered lately a number of disparate strands had started to come together and he made an appointment to have lunch at half past one in the queens arms with granville baird of north yorkshire trading standards annie was surprised to find herself feeling so good on wednesday morning the best shed felt in a long time she had awakened after a long deep and dreamless sleep feeling that old calm had done her meditation and yoga and seemed to be getting back in the groove agitated voices still muttered in the distance of her mind and talons raked at the raw edges of her emotions but even so she felt much better all would be well she wondered if it was anything to do with daltons having gone back to newcastle and decided that was only partly it certainly it was a blessing not to have him around the place constantly reminding her whether he intended to or not of that terrible night two years ago in a way though she had exorcised all that by confronting him by the swing bridge anyway she didnt intend to dwell on why she was feeling so good one thing she had learned from her meditation was that sometimes its best to let go simply to accept the feelings you have and ride with them banks had been cool and distant toward her since their blowup on monday afternoon and while a little warmth wouldnt go amiss that suited her perfectly well at the moment because all she wanted to do was get on with the job and early that wednesday afternoon she was doing exactly that heading for scarlea house the desk clerk there had said he recognized barry cloughs photograph when one of the dcs turned up on the doorstep showing it around it was a dull afternoon and annie needed to turn her headlights on the heavy gray cloud was so low it seemed to rest on top of fremlington hill a high limestone scar or edge which curved like bared teeth around the junction of swainsdale and the smaller arkbeckdale which ran northwest she drove through sleepy lyndgarth with its village green like a handkerchief flapping in the wind its chapel church and three pubs smoke drifted from the chimneys and lost itself in the clouds like her thoughts when she meditated she passed through the remote hamlet of longbridge a name most found funny as it had the smallest shortest bridge in the dale she remembered it was supposed to be famous because someone drove over it in the opening credits of a television program but that had been before her time up north not a soul stirred the hamlet looked deserted its shop closed rough stone cottages shut up only a glimmer of light from the pub showed that anyone lived there at all it was an eerie feeling especially in the halflight annie felt that if she got out of her car and walked around she would find everything in order meals on the table todays newspapers lying open kettles boiling on the cookers and nobody there like on the marie celeste scarlea house loomed ahead a huge dark gothic limestone pile none of the windows seemed to have any curtains it stood on a slight rise at the end of a broad gravel drive and in the weak light against the backdrop of the rising dullgreen daleside it looked like a vampires castle from an old horror film all that was needed to complete the effect was a few flickers of lightning and the distant rumble of thunder but when annie pulled up outside and turned off her engine everything was silent apart from the occasional bird call and the burbling of the river arkbeck on its way to join the swain along the valley bottom christ annie she thought youre about to enter one of the most upmarket shooting lodges in the dales and just look at you youre a mess she hadnt dressed for upmarket when she climbed into her jeans and flung on a red rollneck jumper that morning even less so when she picked up her denim jacket on her way out theyll just have to take me as they find me she told herself opening the heavy front door and walking over to the reception area the ceiling in the hall was taller than her entire cottage and if it wasnt quite the sistine chapel it was certainly ornate complete with gilded panels and a chandelier the walls were all dark wood wainscoting and here and there hung overlarge oil paintings of men with bulbous noses wearing their collars too tight faces the color and texture of rare roast beef like jim hatchleys the kind of paintings that ray her father called optical egotism they paid the rent though if a local artist got one of those selfstyled bigwigs to commission such a portrait it would probably keep him in paint and canvas for a few years even ray knew the value of that can i help you miss an elegant silverhaired man in a black suit came forward to greet her annies first impression was that he looked like a funeralparlor worker actually she said feeling a bit snotty and more than a trifle intimidated by her surroundings its not miss its detective sergeant cabbot ah yes sergeant weve been expecting you my names lacey george lacey general manager please come this way he gestured toward a door with his name on it and when they went inside annie saw it was a modern office complete with fax machine computer laser printer the works she would never have expected it from the oldfashioned decor but the paying guests would be welloff businessmen and they would demand all the modern conveniences of the electronic age as well as the primitive excitement of blood lust and why not they could afford it all annie sat in a swivel chair and took out her notebook i dont know if i can tell you any more than i told the other officer lacey said making a steeple of his hands on the desk he had prissy sort of lips annie noticed shaped in a cupids bow and far too red they irritated her when he talked she tried to keep her eyes on the knot of his regimental tie im just here to confirm that it really was the man in the photograph who stayed here she laid her copy of cloughs photo on the desk in front of him this man lacey nodded mr clough yes that was indeed him has he been here before mr clough is a frequent guest during the season can you tell me the dates he was here just a moment lacey tapped a few keys on the computer and frowned at the screen he stayed here from saturday the fifth of december until thursday the tenth its a bit late in the year for a holiday in the dales isnt it this is a shooting lodge sergeant people do not come here for holidays they come here to shoot grouse this was the last weekend of the season and we were full to capacity what about now not quite so busy it comes and goes but you stay open all winter even though the grouse season is over oh yes were generally booked up over christmas and new year of course the rest of the time its well quieter though we get a number of foreign guests our restaurant has an international reputation one often has to make dinner reservations weeks in advance it must be an expensive operation to run quite lacey looked at her as if the mere mention of money were vulgar was mr clough alone while he was here mr clough as usual came with his personal assistant and a small group of colleagues the season is very much a social event his personal assistant a mr gilbert jamie gilbert ah yes of course banks had told her when she had forced his confession about the lunch with emily that emily had imagined she saw jamie gilbert in eastvale the monday of the week she died maybe she hadnt imagined it after all it was also interesting that clough had arrived in yorkshire only a day or two before charlie courages murder and left the day of emilys which meant that he had certainly been in a position to supply her with the strychninelaced cocaine do you know what time mr clough left on the tenth she asked not exactly usually our guests depart after breakfast id say between nine and ten oclock perhaps is there anything else you can tell me about his stay his comings and goings im afraid not i am not employed to spy on our guests is there anyone who might be able to tell me lacey looked at his watch and curled his lip mr ferguson perhaps hes the bartender as such he spends far more time close to the guests in social situations he might be able to tell you more okay said annie where is he he wont be in until later this afternoon around five oclock if youd care to come back then fine annie thought of asking for fergusons home address and calling on him there but decided she could wait banks was at lunch with someone from trading standards and annie knew that he would want to be here if she took this line of inquiry any further she could phone him on her mobile and arrange to meet back at scarlea at five in the meantime she would head out to barnard castle and investigate a reported sighting of emily riddle there the afternoon before she died the news about clough was exciting though it was the only positive lead they had on him since gregory mannerss fingerprints on the cd case linked him to pkf and it was the first real lead theyd had linking clough with yorkshire and catching him out in a lie yes banks would certainly want to be in on this banks had first met granville baird two years ago when north yorkshire trading standards had asked for police assistance after one of their investigators had been threatened with violence since then they had worked together when their duties overlapped and had even met socially now and then for a game of darts in the queens arms they werent close friends but they were about the same age and granville like banks was a jazz fan and a keen operagoer they chatted about opera norths season for a while then jumbo yorkshire pudding on order and a pint of theakstons bitter in front of him the buzz of lunchtime conversation all around banks lit a cigarette and asked granville know anything about pirating compact discs granville raised an eyebrow does that mean youre in the market for something the ring cycle perhaps no though now you come to mention it i wouldnt mind the complete duke ellington centenary set all twentyfour if you can run some off for me wish i could afford it does this mean that the police are actually looking at doing something about pirating at last apart from copyright infringement which is hardly a police matter i wasnt aware that any laws were being broken if you expect us to come charging in to bill gatess rescue every time someone pirates a copy of windows then youve got a very funny idea of what our job really is granville laughed youre behind the times alan its big business these days if it were simply a matter of copying windows or the latest michael jackson cd for a friend nobody would bat an eyelid but were talking big operations here big money too thats exactly what im interested in said banks how big the last raid we carried out we netted about a quarter of a million quids worth of stuff banks whistled that big tip of the iceberg so it would be a lucrative business for organized crime would it especially as you lot dont even seem to think its a crime point taken look weve got a case on right now it started with a murder and ive been putting two and two together and coming up with a pirating business i dont know how big yet in fact we dont know much at all brians cd had been the final piece in the puzzle seeing its amateurishly produced cover banks had thought of the cd case annie had found at pkf the cds she saw at alex and carlys flat about gregory mannerss fingerprints barry cloughs dismissal as a roadie for bootlegging live recordings and the van worth hijacking the driver worth killing they still hadnt found the vans contents yet but banks would bet a pound to a penny they consisted of equipment for copying cds along with any stock and blank discs that happened to have been there what banks needed to know from granville baird was whether there was enough profit in the pirating business to make it of interest to clough the way smuggling was what do you know granville asked a phony company leases small units in rural business parks operates for a while then moves on make any sense granville nodded ive heard rumors of such a setup yes and if you had two or three of these operations running at once around the country you could be turning over a mill or two a year or more easy if you had the proper equipment of course definitely worth his while then whose while were not sure yet this is just speculation what sort of things would they pirate everything they can get their dirty little hands on music software programs games you name it for the moment by far the biggest profits are in games sony playstation stuff that sort of thing everyones kid wants the latest computer game right weve even found pirated stuff on sale that isnt on the market yet some of the star wars tiein games came over from the states before the film even came out here what about pirated movies theres a lot of that but most of its done in the far east how do they get the originals insiders mostly yes as far as the movies are concerned though sometimes all they have for a master is a handheld video of the film being shown at a theater full of people ive seen some of the stuff and its awful when it comes to the computer programs and games though its easy enough for some employee to sneak a disc out and if he can make a couple of hundred quid from it all the better there even used to be a private web site where for a membership fee you got offered a variety of pirated stuff to download but thats defunct mind you its very much a matter of caveat emptor some of its a ripoff we found a lot of games among the last haul that couldnt be played without complicated bypasses of internal security systems the manufacturers are wising up then slowly their food came and they paused awhile to eat banks took a bite of his yorkshire pudding filled with roast beef and gravy and washed it down with some beer he looked at granville who was drinking mineral water and nibbling at a salad whats up on a diet granville frowned annual checkup last month doc says my cholesterols too high so ive got to cut out booze and fatty foods banks was surprised granville looked healthy enough played squash and was hardly any heavier than banks was sorry to hear that no sweat you just go right on enjoying yourself until its your turn banks who felt he had led a charmed life healthwise thus far despite the bad diet the cigarettes and the ale nodded itll be either that or the prostate i know what about distribution wherever you can shift it ive even heard stories of the local icecream van selling playstation games to kids gives a whole new meaning to mr softee banks laughed that made a lot of sense he thought as he ate clough could use the same distribution network he had set up for the smuggled cigarettes and alcohol small shopkeepers like castle hill books to whom dc winsome jackman should be talking this afternoon market stallholders pubs clubs factories after all the customers would often be the same people none of whom thought they were really doing anything wrong in buying the odd packet of smuggled fags or a pirated computer game for their kids birthday half the cops in the country were smoking contraband cigarettes and drinking smuggled lager banks even knew a di with west yorkshire who drove to calais every few weeks and filled up his trunk with booze and cigarettes he made enough selling them at the station to cover the expenses of his trip and keep himself in the necessities till the next time so why not people thought big deal they were getting a bargain bill gates already had too much money and the tax on booze and fags was extortionate now the ec had also cut out dutyfree purchases between its members in a way banks agreed the consumers had a point except that people like barry clough were getting rich from them he tried to work out how events might have occurred cloughs men pay off charlie courage whose ability to sniff out wrongdoing and try for a slice of the pie was legendary then charlie sells them out to a rival who hijacks the van and steals the equipment and stock of pirated cds to set up somewhere on his own only it goes wrong cloughs men torture charlie does he give up the hijacker you bet he does and what happens to both of them it makes sense he said to granville especially if theres the kind of money in it youre saying there is take my word for it there is and if your mans really organized hell have multidisc copying writers so he can churn them out by the dozen thatd be an expensive piece of equipment i should imagine indeed it would an investment of thousands that answered one question that had been puzzling banks if the pkf van had been carrying a few pirated discs it would have hardly been worth hijacking not to mention killing jonathan fearn but if it had been carrying industrialstandard multidisc copying equipment that was another matter entirely a very healthy return id imagine though if youve got the startup capital banks said indeed and clough certainly had the capital to invest from his gunrestoring racket the music business his club his smuggling operations and whatever other dirty little scams he was involved in he had plenty of seed money the problem was how to prove his involvement it was as burgess had said about cloughs smuggling activities there was plenty of ground for suspicion but scant evidence of actual guilt everything was done through minions and intermediaries people like gregory manners jamie gilbert and andy pandy clough never got his own hands dirty his only contact with anything but the profits was entirely circumstantial or was it had emily riddle posed some sort of threat to him did she have knowledge he considered dangerous clough didnt like to lose didnt like people walking out on him especially if they took something with them be that something money or knowledge it was beginning to seem entirely possible to banks that the two cases were connected and that emily riddle might have been killed by the same person and for the same reason as charlie courage but who was it which of his minions had clough used andy pandy who already had a grudge against emily the kind of grudge you develop from a hard knee in the balls jamie gilbert to whom burgess had referred as a psycho or someone else someone they hadnt encountered yet gregory manners might be able to help them if they could find him banks finished his yorkshire and lit another cigarette he had about a third of a pint left and he decided not to have another one you said youd heard rumors about a big local operation he said anything in them theres always something dont you think no smoke without fire as they say its mostly a matter of finding a lot more pirated goods flooding the markets around north yorkshire which reeks of the kind of organization youve just been talking about you say theyve moved on their van was heading for another business park near wooler in northumbria when it was hijacked everything disappeared and the driver was in a coma for a few days before he died no prints at the scene nothing all we have is a cd case from pkfs daleview operation which bears the fingerprints of one gregory manners convicted for smuggling and a known associate of our mr big thats the thing said granville leaning forward theyre getting into these new areas the big guys like cigarette smuggling and pirating games theres a pile of money to be made if you do it right and the risks are far less than dealing in drugs besides drugs are cheaper than theyve ever been these days with smuggling and pirating you just sit back and rake in the profits thats what weve been trying to tell you lot for ages and the more you squeeze the drug dealers the more theyre likely to find more creative ways of making their fortunes banks looked at his watch just gone half past two time to check on what was happening in the incident room then acc mclaughlin and detective superintendent gristhorpe would be waiting for an update ive got to go now granville he said but could you do me a favor and keep your eyes and ears open banks asked my pleasure granville paused then said i heard about jimmy riddles daughter terrible business yes it is banks agreed your case for my sins anything in those rumors in the papers sex and drugs you know what its like granville said banks stubbing out his cigarette and getting up to leave theres always something in it isnt there no smoke without fire annies news about cloughs being seen in the area around the time of both murders gave banks that tingle of excitement he hadnt felt in a while as he headed for scarlea house late that afternoon taking the unfenced high roads where the only things that slowed him down were wandering sheep he put richard and linda thompsons shoot out the lights on the car stereo and turned it up a bit louder than usual annies purple astra was parked outside scarlea and she was waiting in the lobby when banks arrived gerald ferguson had reported for work ten minutes ago according to george lacey he pointed the way and banks and annie walked down the gloomy hallway to the double doors at the far end anything on that sighting in barnard castle banks asked annie shook her head false alarm witness was an elderly woman and she admitted all teenagers looked alike to her soon as i showed her the photo again she began to have doubts banks pushed open the heavy doors it took more strength than he expected and they entered the magnificently appointed dining room once a banquet hall he guessed it had a number of large windows looking out over the valley bottom to the steep dalesides crisscrossed with drystone walls it was too dark to see anything now of course but breakfasting grouse shooters could no doubt look at the view and anticipate the joys of the coming days slaughter as they ate their eggs benedict or juice and cereal there would probably have been one large central banquet table before the place had been turned into an upmarket restaurant banks thought but now there were a number of tables scattered about the room each covered by a spotless heavy linen tablecloth at the far end were more doors probably to the kitchen and a long bar took up one wall all dark polished wood and brass the rows of bottles gleaming on shelves in front of the mirror at the back banks had never seen so many singlemalt whiskeys in one place before most of them he had never even heard of a man in a burgundy jacket stood with his back to them fiddling with the optic on the gin bottle when banks went over and introduced himself and annie charmed to meet you the man said glancing back at them im gerald ferguson and this bloody thing is a pain in the arse excuse my french love ive told them to buy a new one but theyre too bloody tightfisted the hell with it he left the optic and leaned on the bar to face them what can i do for you he was a round little man of about fifty with a red face muttonchops sideboards and a soupstrainer mustache his jacket tugged a bit at the gold buttons around his chest and stomach and banks thought one deep breath would pop them we were hoping you might be able to help us with some information about a guest mr ferguson he said gerald please he looked around then put his finger to the side of his nose fancy a wee dram banks and annie sat on the high barstools we wouldnt want to get you into any trouble said banks gerald waved his hand and looked toward the door they had entered by his fingers were surprisingly long and tappered banks thought the nails neatly clipped and shiny perhaps he played piano as a hobby what he doesnt know wont harm him whats your poison it was an unfortunate turn of phrase banks thought as he scanned the row of bottles and settled on the caskstrength port ellen detective sergeant cabbot nothing for me thank you you certain certain gerald shrugged up to you he poured two glasses of port ellen very generous measures banks thought set one in front of himself and another in front of banks slainte he said and knocked it back in one slainte said banks and took a little sip heaven he set the glass down its a guest called clough were interested in barry clough apparently hes a regular in grouse season aye hes that all right banks caught the tone of disapproval in his voice you dont like him i didnt say that did i said ferguson pouring himself another port ellen banks guessed it wasnt his first and wouldnt be his last one of the day either at least this time he sipped it slowly tell us what you do think of him then hes a thug in fancy dress and as for that factotum of his jamie gilbert if thats his name the one with the queer hair thats him go on ferguson took another sip of whiskey and lowered his voice this place used to have a bit of class do you know that ive worked here going on twentyfive years and ive seen them all come and go weve had mps a prime minister and an american president once judges foreign dignitaries businessmen from the city and some of them might have been stingy bastards but they all had one thing in common they were gentlemen and now ferguson snorted now i wouldnt give you twopence for the crowd we get these days he glanced over at the doors again not since he came mr lacey mr george bloody lacey general manager him and his new ideas modernization for crying out loud he pointed toward the windows what do you need modernization for when youve got the best bloody view in the world and all nature on your doorstep tell me the answer to that if you can banks who knew a rhetorical question when he heard one gave a sympathetic nod since he came ferguson went on weve had nothing but bloody pop stars actors television personalities whiz kids from the stock market christ weve even had bloody women sorry love no offense intended but grouse shooting never used to be much of a womans sport he knocked back another mouthful of port ellen annie smiled but banks had seen that one before she didnt mean it ferguson had better watch out half of them dont even know one end of a shotgun from tother ferguson went on its a wonder we dont have more accidents i tell you but theyve got plenty of money to throw about oh aye take a bloke like that there clough thinks if he tosses you a few bob at the start of the evening youre at his beck and call for the rest of the night pillock and mary shes one the lasses clean the rooms nice lass but a couple of bob short of a pound if you know what i mean the stories shes told me about some of the things shes found like what banks asked ferguson thrust his face forward and whispered syringes for a start in cloughs room no that were one of the pop stars stayed here a week and never once came out of his room i ask you money to throw away that lot back to barry clough mr ferguson ferguson laughed and scratched his head aye sorry i do run off at the mouth sometimes dont i you got me started on one of my little hobbyhorses thats fine said banks but can you tell us any more about barry clough what sort of things would you be wanting to know did you see much of him while he was here aye i was on the bar every night i get help when were busy like mandy one of the local girls from longbridge and clough was always here for drinks before dinner and most times he ate here too ferguson looked around and leaned forward conspiratorially they say the foods spectacular here but if you ask me theres nowt edible foreign muck for the most part but mr clough enjoyed it he did and he knew what wines to order with what courses weve got a wine waiter sommelier as he likes to call himself the stuckup bugger from his château neuf du bloody pape to his sauternes and his vintage port see hes got all the trappings the expensive clothes armani paul smith all the topquality shooting gear and what have you and he thinks hes got style but you can tell hes common as muck underneath it all mustve read a bluffers guide but he couldnt fool me theres one thing you cant fake class like i said a thug why whats he done we dont know that hes done anything yet ill bet you suspect him of something though dont you stands to reason you mark my words bloke like him hes bound to have done something bound to did you talk to him much like i said he came on like he thought he was a gentleman but he couldnt pull it off for a start a real gentleman wouldnt pass the time of day talking to the likes of me he might make a friendly comment on the weather or the quality of that days shooting but thats as far as hed go there are clear lines this clough though chatty as anything propping up the bar drinking his bloody cosmopolitans and smoking his cuban cigars and that bloody ponytail what did he talk about nothing much when alls said and done football seems hes an arsenal supporter im a newcastle man myself goes on about his villa in spain about going to parties with all these bloody celebrities as if i give a toss did he ever talk about his business not that i recall what is it thats what wed like to know well i wont say some people dont sometimes let something slip you know comes with the territory ive actually managed one or two good investments over the years based on things ive heard on this job but dont tell anyone that im paid to stand behind this bar all bloody night and sometimes people they look on you as a sort of father confessor not that im catholic or anything straight c of e not clough though no thats why i can hardly remember a word he said was he with a party yes about five or six of them who they were a mixed bunch there was that pretty young pop singer whose picture you see all over the place these days the one where shes wearing hardly more than a pair of gold silk knickers amanda khan shes called touch of the tarbrush lovely skin though banks had seen the image in question it was on the cover of her new cd and also graced posters in hmv and virgin records she looked about as old as emily riddle couldnt even hold a bloody gun her let alone shoot one still i must say she seemed a niceenough lass especially for a pop singer polite and far too nice not to mention too young for the likes of clough was she with him what do you mean were they sleeping together yes i dont know whatever they get up to when the bar closes is none of my business did you get the impression that they were sleeping together well they did seem a bit close and i did see him touch her every now and then you know put an arm around her pat her bum that sort of thing more as if she were a possession he kept wanting to touch than anything else that sounded like clough banks thought it hadnt taken him long to get another girl who else ferguson scratched his head again banks took another sip of the fiery malt i didnt recognize any of the others im sure our mr lacey will let you have a look at the registration book or bloody diskette or whatever he calls it now used to have a nice big black leatherbound book mustve been worth a bob or two but now its all bloody computer discs and web sites i ask you web sites banks slipped the photograph of emily riddle out of his briefcase did he ever meet with this girl some of the color left fergusons face so thats what its all about is it i know who she is poor lass i read about her in the papers you think he did it clough we dont know said banks thats why were asking these questions i cant give him an alibi said ferguson like i said i saw him most evenings but never during the day he could have slipped out anytime really an alibis not much use in a case like this banks said at the moment its enough to know that he was in the area at the time oh he was in the area all right did you see him meet with anyone outside his party only the once when was this i cant recall if it was sunday or monday i think it must have been sunday that was the day we had the saddle of lamb would have been nice too if it hadnt been for all them fancy herbs and sauces cook sloshes over everything he makes freshen your drink no thanks sure you wont have a drop miss no thanks mr ferguson gerald i told you its gerald annie smiled that nonsmile again no gerald he beamed at her thats better this person clough met banks said man or a woman man you know there was something familiar about him but i just cant put my finger on it right now a media personality i dont think so but ive seen him in the papers what did he look like about sixfootsomething bit dourlooking as if hes just been sucking on a lemon didnt seem at all comfortable to be there only drank mineral water kept looking around could you tell if theyd met before hard to say really if i had to guess id say it was their first meeting i dont know why but there you are what you lot would call a hunch did you hear any of what they said no i was here behind the bar and they had a window table did they seem friendly as a matter of fact no they didnt the bloke got up and left before his main course had even arrived were they arguing if they were they were doing it quietly he was certainly red in the face when he left i can tell you that clough no the other fellow clough were cool as a cucumber anything else you can tell me about this man bald as a coot heavy eyebrows there was something else familiar about him too about his bearing as if maybe he was a military man or something no theres still something missing a uniform perhaps banks suggested feeling the tingle at the bottom of his spine a police uniform fergusons eyes opened wide by george i think youve got it he was wearing a suit that night but if you picture him in a uniform youre right ive seen him on telly opening farm shows and spouting about crime figures being down mr riddle thats who it was now i think back your own chief constable i wonder what all that was about great thought banks with that sinking feeling just what we need he had sensed something odd about riddle the night he went to break the news of emilys murder riddle had mentioned clough immediately though banks had never told him the mans name and he was damn sure emily hadnt thank you mr ferguson he said slugging back the last millimeter of port ellen thank you very much we might need to talk to you again if thats all right you know where i am well try the caol ila twentytwoyearold next time you drop by lovely drop of malt itll knock your socks off banks felt as if his socks had been knocked off already as he walked out into the evening darkness neither he nor annie could think of anything to say he felt tired his brain couldnt even grapple with the consequences of what gerald ferguson had just told him about chief constable riddle dining with barry clough there was too much to take in but he couldnt let it lie he had to confront riddle and the sooner the better banks still felt tired when he pulled up yet again in front of the old mill that night annie had seemed annoyed back at the station when he told her he wanted to confront riddle alone with fergusons story but she hadnt argued riddle was chief constable after all and banks didnt want to give the appearance of a formal interrogation the way it would appear if two detectives turned up on his doorstep he wanted an honest explanation though he had his own ideas about what had transpired and he believed that riddle would give him one it was a job he would have gladly delegated if he thought that was at all possible but it wasnt he was still sio and if anyone was going to face chief constable riddle with this new development then it had to be banks riddle himself answered the door and invited banks in ros is out im afraid he said shes visiting with charlotte king our neighbor benjamins in bed they walked through to the large living room and sat down riddle didnt offer anything in the way of refreshments which was fine banks didnt want anything he blamed the small whiskey hed had at scarlea for his tiredness hows he taking everything he asked benjamin he doesnt know whats happened he knows that his sister has gone to live with jesus and he misses her terribly he keeps asking if its something to do with the funny pictures of her in the computer what do you tell him that its not to forget about that but it seems he cant were going to send him to stay with his grandparents ross mother and father down in barnstaple after the funeral hes always got along well with them and we think a change of scene will do him good whens the funeral tomorrow morning the coroner released the body as quickly as she could he paused will you be there if i wouldnt be intruding for better or for worse youre part of this banks wished to hell he werent but riddle was right ill be there he said good and your wife hows mrs riddle doing shes bearing up ros is strong shell survive anyway youre not here to make small talk about my family banks what is it have there been any developments banks paused yes he said finally as a matter of fact there have out with it then youre not going to like it more bad news banks noticed a quick flash of fear in riddles eyes something he had never seen there before riddle averted his gaze anyway it doesnt matter whether i like it or not he said things have gone too far for that two months ago i wouldnt have even imagined having you in my house let alone inviting you to my daughters funeral it doesnt mean ive changed my mind about you banks just that circumstances have changed ive been useful to you and havent i fulfilled my part of the bargain what were you doing having dinner with barry clough at scarlea house on sunday december the sixth riddle paused before answering i was hoping you wouldnt find out about that he said too much to hope for i suppose you should have known yes well anyway i didnt have dinner with him i left before things went that far dont split hairs you met with him why because he asked me to when two days earlier friday yes he telephoned me at the station and said he was coming up to yorkshire for the end of the grouse season the next day that hed like to meet me to talk about emily thats all he would tell me on the telephone he called her emily yes not louisa no so hed found out who she was oh hed found out all right starting with her conversation with you in his living room bugged of course thats what he told me anyway what did he want with you what do you think blackmail in a nutshell ive come across his kind before banks they collect people they think they might be able to use at some point tell me about your conversation riddle scowled youre enjoying this arent you what do you mean putting me on the receiving end isnt this what youve always dreamed about you overestimate your importance to me said banks and to be perfectly honest the answers no im not enjoying it i havent enjoyed any of this not breaking the news to you about emilys death not questioning you and your wife about her movements and certainly not this ive had the feeling that one or both of you has been lying or concealing things right from the start and now i have some concrete evidence of it i still wish i could simply wash my hands of the lot of you but i cant ive got my job to do and believe it or not i feel that i owe your daughter something why what did she ever do for you nothing thats not it at all what is then you wouldnt understand lets just get back to that sunday dinner at scarlea shall we what did clough want to talk to you about what do you think hed discovered that im chief constable and that i was contemplating entering into politics the idea of having such an influential person in his pocket appealed to him what did he say he said that he knew emily in london as louisa gamine of course that they had lived together for two or three months and that he had compromising photographs and all sorts of interesting stories he could give to the newspapers about her things that would spoil my chances of election should i ever get that far and things that would even call into doubt my fitness to stay on as chief constable should i not he made a few obscene comments about her and he also indicated that he could probably persuade her to go back with him anytime he wanted he seemed to believe that all he would have to do was whistle what did you say to him i told him to sod off what do you think what did he say to that he said he could perfectly understand my reaction and that hed give me a couple of weeks to think it over then get in touch again is that when you got up and walked away yes did you ever hear anything else from him after that no its only been a week and a half no threats or anything nothing and i dont expect to why not well hes hardly going to draw attention to himself by making good on his blackmail threat to me now is he not after the murder you dont think the murder was a sort of warning for you a signal dont be absurd things were in a delicate balance clough had everything to lose by harming emily and everything to gain by keeping her alive hes not a stupid man banks what do you imagine hed guess my reaction to be if i thought for a moment that hed murdered my daughter it just doesnt make sense i wouldnt be too sure about that banks really wanted a cigarette but he knew he couldnt have one not in riddles house you must have known wed find out sooner or later he said why on earth didnt you tell me it was a calculated risk why should i tell you it was my personal business my problem its up to me to deal with it this wasnt a personal problem it stopped being that the minute someone murdered emily for christs sake maybe clough you were withholding evidence what evidence that he was in the area around the time of her death for a start he could have easily given her the drugs ive tried not to interfere with the investigation in any way i would like to have steered you away from clough as a suspect but i obviously couldnt do that without raising suspicion riddle leaned forward and rested his hands on his knees think about it for a minute banks before you go off halfcocked on this what possible reason could clough have for wanting to kill emily when she represented his hold over me she didnt need to be alive for him to make good on his threat but it wasnt just the threat of revelations he made remember he also said he could take her back with him whenever he wanted he knew i wouldnt be able to bear the thought of her being with him you should have told me banks when you brought her back you should have told us the sort of trouble shed been getting herself into you blame me for withholding evidence but neither of you said a word about what emily had been up to in london banks sighed what good would it have done though maybe he should have he thought miserably he had believed that in keeping quiet he was saving the riddles from unnecessary pain and saving emily perhaps from their disciplinarian backlash but look what had happened emily was dead and jimmy riddle was in deep trouble himself trouble from which he might never fully recover banks remembered what emily had told him about riddle being a poor detective always coming up with the wrong killer in the crime novels he read as an adolescent he could believe it its no use blaming me he went on believe me there are times i wish id done things differently but you youre a professional copper youre a bloody chief constable for crying out loud i cant believe youd be so stupid and stubborn and proud not to tell me that a man ive been seriously suspecting as your daughters killer actually approached you as a blackmail target only four days before she was murdered riddles expression hardened i told you it was a private matter it has nothing to do with emilys death he had no motive for killing her dont you think that if i really believed clough had killed emily id have throttled him with my bare hands by now you might not understand this banks but i loved my daughter who can really know with someone like clough banks argued perhaps from a business standpoint he would be better off with emily alive but hes also a violent man from what ive heard and a possessive one he doesnt like people walking out on him maybe thats why he killed her besides i dont believe she would have gone back to him that easily she was frightened of him well that might be one good reason for going back to him mightnt it men like him might have a certain fascination for girls like like emily what do you mean precocious mischievous rebellious shes always been like that you know that she and i didnt get on no matter how much i cared about her it always came out wrong and clough hes about my age but hes a criminal policeman criminal dont you see that she was doing this to hurt me if shed wanted to hurt you shed have made sure you knew about it riddle just shook his head did clough say anything about his business interests at this dinner no did he mention pkf computer systems no charlie courage gregory manners jamie gilbert no ive told you what he said dont you think that if hed told me anything incriminating i would have passed it along to you after what ive just heard i dont know about that there was nothing banks just his notsosubtle blackmail hints but he was here in the eastvale area when both charlie courage and your daughter were killed doesnt that make you stop and think the first thing it makes me think is that he cant have been responsible for the murders hes not so stupid as to be on the doorstep when they went down stop defending him for crying out loud anyone would think you had what never mind what are you going to do about it banks shook his head i dont know whatever it is please have the decency to wait until after the funeral would you banks said he would but his mind was elsewhere with what he had left unsaid he could think of only one good reason why riddle would be so unprofessional as to conceal the details about his secret meeting with clough that he was at least considering capitulating to cloughs request which brought banks to consider an even greater problem with emilys death clearly a large part of cloughs hold over riddle had been extinguished if clough hadnt killed her then who did want emily riddle dead and why alot of people banks mused thought that the police attended the funerals of murder victims in the hope of finding the killer there they didnt that only happened in books and on television on the other hand given that a victims close relatives were likely to be at the funeral and given that by far the largest percentage of murders were committed by close family members then the odds were pretty good that the murderer would be at the funeral not this one though barry clough wasnt there for a start and he was the closest they had to a suspect so far even though riddle was probably right about emily being of far more value to him alive was banks wearing blinkers when it came to clough or was he going off halfcocked as gristhorpe had warned him against doing he didnt think so he knew it didnt make sense for clough to kill emily just after he had used her to attempt to blackmail her father but he was sure there must be something he was missing some angle he hadnt considered yet the only thing he had thought of but didnt really believe in was that clough was some sort of psychopath and simply hadnt been able to stop himself if that had been the case he would have made damn sure he was there to watch and participate in emilys murder craig newton and ruth walker had traveled up together they stood looking puzzled and miserable in the rain as the vicar intoned the twentythird psalm banks caught their eyes craig gave him a curt nod and ruth gave him a dirty look the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters there was nothing green about the dales pastures that morning everything from sky to houses to the unevenly shaped fields and drystone walls was a dull slategray or a mudbrown nor was there anything still about the river swain which tumbled over a series of small waterfalls beside the graveyard and along with the wind screaming through the gaps in the drystone wall like a stockhausen composition almost drowned out the vicars words the wind also drove the rain hard across the churchyard and the mourners seemed to draw as deeply into their heavy overcoats gloves and hats as they could at least the vicar was using the old version banks noticed the lord is my shepherd therefore can i lack nothing had about as much resonance as as in a mirror dimly he thought not that he went to church very often but like many people he remembered the powerful church language of his youth and anything less fell far short he hadnt known what half of it meant either then or now but it never seemed to matter religion he thought was mostly a matter of mumbojumbo anyway chants mantras whatever comforting mumbojumbo in this case though nobody was fooled rosalind riddle dabbed at her eyes with a white hanky every now and then benjamin stood next to her looking confused and her husband looked as if he had been up all night grappling with his conscience when riddle caught bankss eye briefly on the way out to the graveside he looked away guiltily and well he might thought banks who still felt a residue of anger toward him for stalling the investigation he had realized after his interview with riddle the previous day though that he had also been guilty of hiding too many things he hadnt told annie about the lunch with emily at first and he still hadnt told her about the night in the hotel room with any luck now she wouldnt find out about that of course he could rationalize his own shortcomings a lot more easily than he could riddles but he could at least understand why riddle might not like to admit to him that he had kept a dinner engagement with his daughters lover a man who also happened to have a criminal reputation would riddle have capitulated with whatever clough wanted from him in order to protect himself and emily what kind of man was he when it came to the crunch he would never have the chance to find out now virtue cant prove itself until its tested yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death the valley of the shadow of death was a phrase that had always moved banks sent a shiver up his spine though he would have been hardpressed to explain what it meant to him it was one phrase they hadnt got rid of in the new translation too he thought of poor graham marshall all those years ago walking through the valley of the shadow of death they had never found his body so he never had a funeral like emily there had been some sort of memorial service at school banks remembered or a remembrance service he wasnt sure which the headmaster had recited the twentythird psalm so much death sometimes his head seemed full of the voices of the dead banks found himself wishing the funeral would soon be over it wasnt only the weather the rain dripping down the back of his neck and the wet cold wind that cut right through three layers of clothing to the bone but the sight of the coffin perched at the graveside ready to be lowered knowing that emily was in there the oncevital mischievous spirit who had curled up and slept like a little child with her thumb in her mouth in a hotel room once with him sitting in the chair listening to dawn upshaws song about sleep cold cold is the grave a line from an old folk ballad passed through his mind the grave looked cold indeed but the only one not feeling it now was emily when it was over the body lowered into its final resting place people started drifting toward the car park ruth and craig approached the riddles the chief constable seemed oblivious to them and craig hung back ruth said something to rosalind something that looked deeply earnest rosalind uttered a few words and touched her arm then rosalind saw banks alone and walked over to him with an elderly couple in tow my mother and father she said introducing them banks shook their hands and offered his condolences are you coming to the house rosalind asked no he said im afraid i cant too much work he could probably have spared half an hour or so but the truth was that he didnt fancy making small talk with the riddle family what did ruth want he asked oh so thats who it is said rosalind i wondered she said she was a friend of emilys and wondered if she might have some sort of keepsake and i suggested she drop by the house and id see what i could do why no reason the boy with hers craig newton emilys exboyfriend is he a suspect technically yes he pestered her after they split up and he doesnt have an alibi but realistically banks shook his head i dont think so rosalind glanced over at the two of them then i suppose i should invite them both back to the house shouldnt i theyve come a long way how did they know it was today i phoned craig last night the last time i interviewed him he said hed like to be there and i could see no reason why not he must have contacted ruth rosalind shook bankss hand and walked over with her mother and father toward ruths car banks also saw darren hirst and the others who had been in the bar none with emily on the night of her death tina and jackie they all looked shellshocked darren nodded and walked by that reminded banks of a glimmer of an idea hed had something he wanted to ask darren not now though it would keep leave the poor lad to his grief for a while back at the office before banks could even get his overcoat off and sit down ds hatchley knocked on his door and entered hows it going jim banks asked fine the funeral what youd expect hatchley shut the door behind him and sat down opposite banks he was the opposite of annie when it came to looking comfortable always perched at the edge of the chair squirming as if something sharp were digging into his arse he took his cigarettes out and glanced at banks for permission banks got up and opened the window despite the cold and both of them lit up its about castle hill books said hatchley i sent young losesome out there yesterday afternoon and she came back with an interesting haul go on the owners a slimy little sod called stan fish hes been selling porn on the side for years anyway it turns out hes got a whole cupboardful of pirated computer software games and music cds he says he got them from a chap he knows only as greg this greg comes around every couple of weeks in a white van with a selection so losesome whips out her picture of gregory manners and bobsyouruncle good said banks thatll give us a bit of extra ammunition he looked at his watch manners is on his way here as we speak losesome also brought in a few samples of the goods hatchley went on vic mansons checking them for prints now ill get him to put a rush on it if he can match them with mannerss it still doesnt give us much though said banks even if we can do manners for pirating and distributing copyrighted software its hardly a serious charge it might give you a handle on this other villain youre after though barry clough aye hatchley stubbed out his cigarette yon losesome has also been showing mannerss picture around daleview and a couple of people recognized him nobodys seen clough andy pandy or jamie gilbert around there though not yet but were still asking hatchley got up to leave before he could go the door opened and detective superintendent gristhorpe barged in brandishing one of the more notorious london tabloids gristhorpe sniffed the air scowled at both of them then said seen the papers this morning alan banks looked at the newspaper even if id had time he said it wouldnt have been that one a smile split gristhorpes ruddy pockmarked face wouldnt be my first choice either he said more the sort of thing youd be reading eh sergeant hatchley if id time sir muttered hatchley edging his way out of the office winking at banks as he shut the door behind him gristhorpe dropped the tabloid on bankss desk youd better have a gander alan he said it looks as if im going to be on damage control for the rest of the day then he left as abruptly as hed entered the color cover photo in itself was almost enough to give banks a heart attack there were two photos actually one of barry clough leaving a soho restaurant thrusting his palm toward the cameraman and one of jimmy riddle leaving police headquarters the way the photos were arranged together made it look as if the two men were meeting facetoface centered below them was a photograph of emily it was a good one professional and it featured her sophisticated heroinchic look she had her blond hair piled up in an expensive mess and wore a strapless black evening gown not the same dress shed been wearing the night of the hotel room but a similar one banks had seen the picture before or one very much like it in craig newtons house could craig have sold it to the newspapers was he still that bitter over his splitup with emily more likely banks thought that barry clough had got hold of some copies when emily was living with him and that this was his response to emilys death and riddles silence the headline screamed up at him chief constables daughter murder case what are they hiding the story went on to tell of emilys association with wellknown club owner and manabouttown barry clough a man the same age as her senior policeman father after a couple of not so subtle indications that wellknown club owner and manabouttown was sort of shorthand for gangster there were a couple of morally highhanded digressions of the do you know what your daughters doing and who shes with tonight sort before the reporter got the real nittygritty speculation about cloughs expanding his business empire up north and about his and riddles being involved in some sort of crooked partnership emilys role in all this was left to the readers to guess the article had obviously been vetted by the papers solicitors and it stopped just short of libel for example never at any point did the reporter state that riddle and clough had met and talked or that riddle had known about emilys relationship with clough the reporter clearly hadnt found out about scarlea house yet but the whole thing was a masterpiece of innuendo and the implications in themselves were damaging enough banks could only imagine how riddles political cronies would react to it banks also realized that the damage wouldnt stop with the political set either this sort of thing could also easily make riddle a pariah on the job whether there was anything in them or not such rumors could effectively end his police career already banks suspected there were mutterings at high levels about a chief constable so careless as to let his own daughter get murdered while snorting cocaine in a nightclub not to mention the rumors of drugs and sex that went with it all one way or another as a politician or as a highranking copper banks imagined that jimmy riddles tenuous reign had come to an end humptydumpty what surprised banks was that he felt sorry for the poor bastard and what about rosalind and benjamin what would all this do to them banks still remembered ruth walkers final question to him only last saturday why did emilys father want her back when he hadnt appeared to care about her before banks had thought about that a lot since at first he had suspected riddle wanted her back to avoid more damage to his career and to credit him with some fatherly feelings because he was worried about her after he saw the photos on the porno web site perhaps he was wrong about that at some point in the investigation the riddles themselves had joined the group of suspects in bankss mind the big problem with jimmy riddle as a suspect was that whichever way you looked at it emilys murder only made things worse for him sure her continuing existence had always held out the risk of scandal but her death guaranteed it on the other hand given the pressure that riddle might have been under since cloughs approach at scarlea something could have snapped in him and what about rosalind she hadnt particularly wanted emily back at home she had made that clear from the start what if she had a good reason for it and emily had become somehow a threat to her but how why it still didnt feel right especially given the method but perhaps it was time to start pushing the grieving parents a bit harder a knock at his door jolted him out of his musings it was dc templeton yes kev thought youd like to know sir uniformed just brought gregory manners in hes waiting in interview room three thanks ill be right there ask ds hatchley to sit in too will you will do sir by the way whered they find him strangest place you could imagine oh and wheres that dc templeton grinned at home sir nice little flat out thirsk way banks grinned back oh and kev theres one more thing id like you to do gregory manners was a smoothie right from his carefully combed impossibly brown hair to the soles of his italian loafers he was goodlooking in a way and banks could see that he might appeal to a certain kind of woman the interview room was a dingy airless sort of place with whitewashed walls a tiny wiremesh window and metal table and chairs bolted to the floor the old blue ashtray stolen from the queens arms was gone now that smoking had been banned from the building but the air still seemed to smell of stale smoke sweat and fear manners sat there coolly legs crossed idly staring into space when banks and hatchley entered he asked why he had been brought there banks ignored him and checked the tapes in the recording machine hatchley sat impassive as buddha and almost as fat the tapes worked banks went through the time date and place routine naming those present in the room then he turned to manners and said youre here to help us with our inquiries mr manners what inquiries things will become clear as we move along manners leaned forward and rested his arms on the table should i have my lawyer present i understand you put in a call to your solicitor before you left home before i was brought here yes and all i got was his answering machine theyre busy people you left a message i told him to get up here sharpish in the meantime youve been offered the services of a duty solicitor some wetbehindtheears little pillock who cant get a proper job and youve declined yes in that case mr manners lets proceed with the interview just for the record you havent been charged with anything yet so theres no need to get overexcited im sure your own solicitor will get here as soon as he possibly can but in the meantime lets just have a little chat all right manners narrowed his eyes but sat back in his chair and relaxed crossing his legs again what do you want to know ive done nothing wrong im sure you havent banks took the cd case that annie had found at pkf out of its envelope and pushed it over the rickety metal table to manners know what this is manners looked at it its a cd container good maybe you can tell me what your fingerprints are doing on this particular cd container i suppose i must have touched it yes said banks indeed you must have touched it can you tell me what you were doing at the daleview business park daleview working why i dont know gregory thats why im asking you well thats what i was doing working i dont understand this i havent done anything illegal why are you questioning me we want to know about the operations of pkf computer systems what about it is that who you worked for at daleview yes but i still dont understand what youre getting at and what if i told you that its dummy company that it doesnt exist then id be very surprised indeed who set it up what pkf i did of course the whole things me just me look there must be some mistake theres no mistake a mistake with the paperwork i was sure i did it right there is no paperwork gregory bugger all pkf doesnt exist well if it doesnt exist then i can hardly know anything about it can i so why dont i just leave now sit down hatchley slammed his hamsized fist on the table and the noise made manners jump hey said manners theres no need for that thats intimidation any more of this bollocks and ill show you what intimidation is growled hatchley im sure if you just answer my questions as clearly and fully as you can ds hatchley will listen as eagerly as i will wont you sergeant aye said hatchley soon as he stops trying to feed us this crap manners swallowed look what do you want to know im sorry if i ballsed up the paperwork is it a criminal offense probably said banks but well worry about that later what did you do at pkf developed produced and marketed a commercial database program called pkf you invented this i did you worked alone for the most part it sounds like a lot of work for one person ive never been afraid of hard work on occasion i hired casual labor to help with distribution and such things people like jonathan fearn manners frowned the name doesnt ring a bell but i might have yes banks took the photographs of andrew handley jamie gilbert and barry clough out of his file folder and slid them across to manners ever seen any of these men no banks tapped the picture of clough this one in particular he said go on have a good look think about it i told you no didnt you do six months for smuggling offenses down south not long ago i just happened to get caught doing something people get away with every day you must be a heavy smoker and drinker then i dont smoke so you were going to sell the goods you smuggled of course i was going to sell them people go over to calais and load up their cars every bloody weekend for crying out loud whats this got to do with anything banks tapped cloughs photo again we have information that leads us to believe this man was behind both the smuggling operation and whatever pkf was up to then your information is wrong ive never seen him in my life or the other two i imported the stuff myself and i also ran pkf which wasnt up to anything by the way maybe i got the paperwork wrong maybe i just forgot to make everything all official but if thats why im here just charge me and get it over with you know ill be walking out the minute my lawyer gets here who said anything about charging you i cant understand why else you had me brought here whats happened to pkf im sure you know already said manners the van was hijacked on its way to our new business premises in northumbria and everything was stolen there is no pkf anymore and the driver was killed yes very unfortunate that a mr fearn jonathan fearn yes well as i said im sorry but i dont remember his name i simply hired him to do the job where did you find him mr courage the night watchman at daleview recommended him ah yes said banks shuffling some papers in his folder charlie courage smalltime villain must have got in over his head manners frowned come again funny you should mention mr courage greg he also met with an unfortunate accident shortly after mr fearn he found himself at the wrong end of a shotgun yes i read about that in the paper said manners it was a terrible shock he seemed a decentenough bloke he was a crook but you know all about that lets move on by all means manners shifted in his chair and rearranged his legs do you believe in coincidences they happen all the time and do you believe that the van getting hijacked jonathan fearn dying of injuries received and charlie courage being shot just happen to be coincidences they could be why were you leaving daleview the rent was too expensive this new place was cheaper and the space was better bigger tell me again what pkf actually did i manufactured and distributed a database system i invented background in computers college selftaught a lot of people in the business are to whom did you distribute this software retailers names look im sure i have a list somewhere what is this all about the knock came at the door as arranged and it couldnt have been better timed banks announced dc templetons arrival and paused the tape what is it kev thought you might be interested in this sir said templeton glancing at manners as he spoke its just come in from fingerprints those cd cases ah yes said banks lets have a look shall we he opened the file templeton left the office banks pored over the file frowning for a while showed the papers to hatchley then he set the tapes going again this is interesting he said to manners what is it fingerprint results another cd case but i dont understand youve already found my prints on the cd case ive explained that to you already but this is different see greg said banks this is another case entirely well im sure ive touched more than one yes but its where we found it and what it contained that interests me manners seemed to turn a little pale i dont where did you find it shop called castle hill books run by a man called stan fish ring any bells he might have been one of my retailers for your pkf database software yes then how come this particular case contained a brand new sony playstation game i dont know maybe the owner of the shop switched them around could be said banks in fact id be inclined to believe that would be exactly the case except except what except we found your prints on six other cases containing the same game and we have a lot more to test before were finished some of them contain a brandnew music cd by rem hardly even in the shops yet then there are a few wordprocessing programs and so forth funny though greg no pkf database system manners crossed his arms right thats it he said im not saying another word until my lawyer gets here two hours later toward the end of the afternoon manners was still in custody waiting for his solicitor and banks was in his office reading through witness statements when his telephone rang it was dirty dick burgess calling from london guess what banks youve been made head of the race relations board very funny no but andy pandys turned up at last has he indeed thought youd be interested any chance of a chat with him in the near future not unless you fancy holding a séance hes dead dead as the proverbial doornail though i never could see how a doornail could be dead as it was never alive in the first place anyway enough philosophical speculation hes dead where pretty remote spot on the edge of exmoor i tell you banks if it werent for the anorak brigade and the dogwalkers bless their souls wed never find half the corpses we do the long ride indeed so shotgun wound to the upper body pretty close range not much left same as charlie courage any signs of torture christ banks theres hardly any signs of the poor buggers chest what do you expect miracles so what do you think pretty obvious isnt it humor me andy pandys been a naughty boy hes ripped off mr clough mr clough doesnt like being ripped off so he sends andy on the long ride way i see it and charlie courage part of it hardly an innocent bystander from what you told me he was taking money from clough or from cloughs local oppo gregory manners to make sure pkf operated without hassles then suddenly pkf is moving and charlies bonuses are gone i think charlie knew where pkf was moving to and when and i think andy pandy came along with a better offer why would he do that because hes pissed off with clough for taking him for granted he wants more respect and hes also angry with clough over the incident with emily when she kneed him in the balls banks thought maybe said burgess sounding unconvinced so he hijacks the van to set up his own business the vans full of pkf stock but more important than that its also carrying two or three multidisc copying machines very valuable pieces of equipment he thinks clough will never guess in a million years that he did it but cloughs no fool he sends a couple of goons up to push charlie around a bit now charlie might have been a crook but no one ever said he was a brave man charlie rats andy pandy out under torture and theyre both history i wondered why gregory manners is still alive come again manners was in charge of pkf so he must have been cloughs first suspect clough put the frighteners on him and manners must have convinced him he had nothing to do with the hijack maybe manners told him andy pandy had been hanging about asking questions well probably never know for sure now so what do we do next well keep showing the photographs around daleview ive also got gregory manners kicking his heels in the cells here waiting for his lawyer so maybe ill have another chat with him first he wont tell you anything too shitscared of clough probably but i can push him a bit harder itd be nice to threaten him with conspiracy to commit murder or something juicy like that at the moment theres nothing much except pirating software to hold him on and thatll probably never stick minute his lawyer gets here hell be off and whats the betting youll never see him again id put money on it so where do we go with andy pandy well have a hell of a job proving its anything to do with clough banks said anything at the scene tire track banks thought for a moment then said i think its about time we brought mr clough up north for a chat but first ive got an idea it was late and banks was listening to annesophie mutters interpretation of beethovens spring violin sonata and reading a biography of ian fleming when he heard a car draw up outside that was unusual in itself the dirt lane that ran in front of his cottage ended at the woods about ten yards farther where it became a narrow path between the trees and gratly beck occasionally tourists would take the wrong road and have to back out but not usually at that time of night or that time of year curious banks put down his book walked over to the window and opened the curtains a few inches a sportylooking car to judge from its shape had pulled up in front of the cottage and a woman was getting out he couldnt make out her features as it was pitchblack outside she was wearing a scarf and there were no street lamps on the isolated lane he would soon find out though he thought as she walked up to his front door and knocked when he opened it and saw rosalind riddle take off her scarf he must have looked surprised enough to embarrass her im sorry she said have i come at a bad time no said banks no not at all he stood aside come in as she passed close to him in the doorway he felt her breast brush lightly against his arm and he thought he could smell juniper berries on her breath gin most likely he took her fur coat and hung it in the cupboard by the door underneath she was wearing a simple blue pastel dress more suitable banks thought for summer than for a miserable winters night like this one still with a mink on top you didnt really need anything underneath he stopped that line of thought before it went any further this is nice she said standing and looking around the small room with its blue walls and meltingbrie ceiling banks had hung a couple of watercolors he had picked up at auctions on the walls and a blowup of what he thought the best of sandras photographs took pride of place over the mantelpiece it had been taken coincidentally not far away from the cottage where banks now lived alone and it showed the view down the daleside to helmthorpe in late evening with a redandorange sunset sprawled across the sky smoke drifting from the chimneys the church with its square tower and odd little turret attached to one corner the dark graveyard where sheep grazed among the lichenstained tombstones and crooked rows of flagstone roofs he and sandra might no longer be together but that didnt mean he rejected her talent there wasnt much furniture in the room just a sofa under the window and two matching armchairs arranged at angles to the fireplace where a couple of lumps of peat burned and cast shadows on the walls do you live here alone she asked theres hardly room enough for two i shouldnt have asked im sorry of course i do know something of your circumstances your wife cup of tea or something or something after a day like this one i need something a bit stronger than tea gin and tonic if youve got it coming up banks went into the kitchen and took the gin out of the cupboard where he kept his haphazard selection of spirits some rum a few ounces of vodka half a bottle of cognac and the laphroaig single malt that smoky islay his favorite and a constant drain on his wallet how strange what banks turned to see that rosalind had followed him into the kitchen she was standing at its center with an odd expression on her face as if she were listening to a distant voice it feels i dont know sort of haunted but in a good way banks was gobsmacked one of the reasons he had bought the house in the first place was that he had dreamed of the kitchen before he knew it existed a dream full of warmth and feelings of extreme wellbeing so that when he saw it he knew he had to have it luckily the old lady who was selling didnt want it to fall into the hands of an absentee landlord so she let him have it for the ridiculously low price of a gift when you considered that there were semis and terrace cottages smaller even than this one going for and above in some of the more popular dales villages all banks sensed about the kitchen was that there was definitely some sort of presence that it was benevolent and only god knew why that it was feminine he didnt really believe in gods and ghosts had never thought much about them being a more practical sort of man but this was another change that had taken place since sandra left in the end he accepted even embraced whatever the presence was and came to believe it was some sort of spirit of the house the way places are said to have spirits he had read a little about the subject and named his spirit haltia after the finnish generally believed to be the spirit of the first person to lay claim to a site either by lighting a fire on it by building a house on it or even in some cases the first person to die there rosalind was the first person other than banks to feel it others had been there tracy brian sandra annie superintendent gristhorpe jim hatchley but none of them had felt the preternatural appeal of the kitchen banks felt almost inclined to tell rosalind about the dream but he held back for some reason he hadnt told anyone about it yet for fear of seeming foolish or mad and there was no point starting now its a comfortable room to be in he said pouring the drink you should see it when the suns shining through the windows glorious that was his favorite time in the kitchen when the morning sunlight came skipping over low fell and sliding down the green daleside spilling into the kitchen like honey that wouldnt happen again for a few more months id like that said rosalind then she looked away and blushed she had dark semicircles under her eyes banks noticed which made her look mysterious tragic even which was hardly surprising given what she had been through this past while despite the poor first impression rosalind had made on him banks found himself thinking that she was a woman he would like to have known perhaps in another time another life also in another part of his mind he suspected that she might have had something to do with her daughters murder ice lemon just the tonic water please banks handed her the gin and tonic and poured himself a couple of fingers of rapidly dwindling laphroaig they went back into the living room the only light came from the fire and the reading lamp by his armchair he wondered if he should turn on the overhead light and decided not to by the look of her as she sat down wearily opposite him rosalind riddle looked glad of the semidarkness he turned down the music and lit a cigarette how was the gettogether what youd expect you were fortunate you had work to keep you away im not good at those sorts of things did you get a chance at talk to ruth and craig a little you know what these things are like what was your impression he seemed a niceenough boy he probably is banks said and ruth i didnt really get much chance to talk to her im just glad that its over thats all why did you want to see me was there something you wanted to tell me tell you no what makes you think that what is it then she swirled her drink in her glass before answering im worried about jerry hes taking this all very badly its hardly surprising i mean after all your only daughter is dead murdered hes bound to take it badly hes not made of stone and now this thing in the newspaper no its more than that what do you mean rosalind sighed and stretched her legs out crossing them at the ankles it was a gesture that reminded banks of annie cabbot all his life rosalind began the only thing thats counted for jerry was his work the job you know what its like what the demands are the sacrifices hes made weve made she gave a quick shake of her head im not saying he doesnt love us his family but weve taken the backseat all along my careers taken a backseat too weve always had to move where and when jerry wanted no matter what i was doing or how well the children were getting on at school its been hard but i accept it i dont mind after all i dont have to stay if i dont want to but the rewards have made it worthwhile i know you think hes a social climber and maybe he is but his origins are pretty humble like yours i should imagine banks smoked and listened he had never thought about riddles origins before but remembered he had vaguely heard something about his coming from a farmworkers family in suffolk he got the impression that rosalind just wanted to talk and he was quite happy to let her ramble on as long as she liked though why she had chosen him to unburden herself on was a mystery still it felt good to have an attractive woman in the house and one who understood the spirit of the place at that even if she was jimmy riddles wife and for another there was always the possibility that he might learn something relevant to emilys murder as i said hes worked hard and weve made a lot of sacrifices jerry isnt i mean hes not the most demonstrative of men our marriage he finds it difficult to show emotion she smiled i know most men are the same but hes more so he loved emily dearly but hes never been able to express it hes come across as overprotective a sort of tyrant who sets the rules and leaves them to me to enforce which made me a tyrant in my daughters eyes too he was never there when she might have needed him they never managed to form a strong bond of any kind yet he loved her yes dearly he doted on her and her achievements as much as hes capable of doting on anyone other than himself why are you telling me all this she smiled i dont know maybe because youre a good listener go on theres not much more to tell really because of whats happened because of the guilt over never having been able to show his feelings of always trying to control her rather than showing affection hes coming apart at the seams he just sits there half the time he doesnt even answer when i talk to him its as if hes come adrift got lost in some inner hell and he cant find his way out after the funeral it was even worse i cant talk to him anymore hes shutting me out fortunately benjamins gone down to barnstaple with my parents or i dont know what id do i know im not explaining this very well im not very good with words but im worried about him is there anything else on his mind i dont know nothing hes told me about anyway isnt it enough maybe you should try to get him to seek help grief counseling im sure your doctor could recommend the right sort of treatment ive mentioned it but its no good he wont go then i dont know what to suggest would you talk to him me banks almost laughed out loud i cant see that doing him any good you know he cant stand the sight of me you might find that hes softened his attitude toward you a bit lately since i got emily to come home banks shook his head i dont think so hes just sticking to the bargain banks remembered what emily had told him about riddles envy deeprooted feelings like that didnt just disappear after youd done someone a favor or two in most cases they intensified because people who didnt like you to start with resented being beholden to you besides banks had caught riddle in a lie too and that must rankle he remembered the guilty expression at the funeral but he wanted you in charge of the investigation that was a purely professional decision i still wish youd talk to him if he doesnt listen to you hed hardly listen to me he might at least youre a man he doesnt have a lot of friends what about his political colleagues he must have friends there rosalind sipped some more gin and tonic theyre dropping him like a hot potato it started with emilys murder but its got worse ever since the newspaper article with all those innuendoes plenty of phone calls lots of sympathy then the old perhaps it would be best for all us if for the good of the party hypocrites im sorry to hear that yes well im sure it will only contribute more proof to your poor theory of human nature especially the human nature of conservatives banks said nothing he looked into the fire and watched the burning peat shift and sigh out a breath of sparks im sorry i shouldnt have said that rosalind laughed harshly im talking about me more than about you i must admit my own view of human nature has taken a bit of a nosedive over the past few days the music ended and banks let the silence stretch if you want to put something else on thats all right said rosalind i like classical music banks went to the stereo and picked another beethoven violin sonata the kreutzer this time mmm said rosalind lovely banks marveled at how much she resembled emily especially her lips they were the same full but finely outlined shape and the same natural pinkish red color they even moved in the same way when she spoke i still dont see that theres anything i can do said banks even if i do talk to him and im not saying i will you can at least try if it does no good rosalind shrugged what about you me what about me how are you doing im coping surviving sometimes i feel as if im being pulled apart by millions of little redhot fishhooks but other than that im fine she smiled someone has to be i went back to the office this afternoon after everyone had gone i know it sounds odd but boring estate deals help keep my mind off more serious matters but jerry hasnt even got his work now hes got nothing he just sits at home all the time brooding its frightening watching someone like him unravel hes always been so strong so solid how the mighty are fallen thought banks but he didnt voice it because it would have been cruel even so he had thought it and that made him bad was he such a rotten person he understood what rosalind meant of course it is far more terrifying to see someone you have always depended on your rock crack apart than it is to watch someone who was fragile to start with have yet another breakdown banks had a distant aunt who kept having funny turns as his mother called them but as she was mentally flimsy to begin with no one was much surprised it wasnt that people didnt sympathize or care just that her turns lacked any sort of tragic dimension all right he said ill try to make time to go over tomorrow and have a talk with him i cant promise anything mind you her face lit up you will but thats wonderful thats all i ask how do i let myself get talked into these things banks wondered do i look like a sucker first i give up a weekend in paris with my daughter abandoning her to the clutches of the monosyllabic damon and head off to london to look for emily riddle now im playing visiting shrink to jimmy riddle the man whos done about as much for my career as margaret thatcher did for the trade unions while youre here there are a couple of things id like to ask you if i may really rosalind looked away from him and started twisting the wedding ring on her finger she had finished her drink and let the empty tumbler stand on the arm of the chair another g and t no thanks i have to drive she glanced at her tiny gold wristwatch and sat forward besides i really should be getting back i told jerry i was going for a drive i dont like to leave him alone for too long at night its a bad time for him i understand said banks i promise i wont keep you more than a couple of minutes more she sat back in the chair but didnt relax what was she so nervous about banks wondered what was she holding back ruth walker told me that you had answered when she phoned to talk to emily but you said youd never heard of her why you surely cant expect me to remember the name of every single person who calls and asks for emily can you perhaps she never even said what her name was people usually do though dont they i mean its only polite to say who you are youd be surprised how many people lack basic politeness or maybe you wouldnt what exactly are you getting at i dont know i just get this funny feeling that theres something youre not telling me maybe its to do with ruth walker and maybe its not but you get very vague every time her name comes up it must be your imagination maybe ive been told more than once that ive got too much of it for my own good your husbands told me often enough banks leaned forward look mrs riddle you probably dont think its very relevant or important but ive got to warn you that youre making a poor judgment here the best course of action is to tell me everything you know and let me be the judge thats my job rosalind stood up thanks for the advice if i did know anything of relevance to your investigation you can be sure id take it but as i dont anyway i really must be going now thank you very much for your hospitality you will call in on jerry tomorrow barring any emergencies yes ill call dont tell him though he might board up the doors and bar the windows rosalind smiled it was a sad smile banks thought but nice nonetheless and please think about what i said if theres anything rosalind nodded quickly and left banks stood in the doorway and watched her drive back toward the helmthorpe road then he poured another laphroaig and returned to annesophie mutters beethoven banks and annie watched barry clough walking along the corridor toward them his police escort following behind along with another man banks noted the paul smith suit the ponytail the matching gold chain and bracelet the cocky confident strut and thought pillock sorry to get you out of bed so early barry he said opening the door to interview room the smallest and smelliest interview room they had it passed the pace regulations about the same way bankss old cortina had passed its final mot test barely youd better have a damn good reason for dragging me halfway across the country clough said cheerfully one my lawyer will understand he gave annie an appraising look which she ignored then turned to the man who had followed him down the corridor simon gallagher the man said and im the lawyer in question and very questionable indeed you look thought banks for once the client looked betterdressed than the lawyer but banks was willing to bet that gallaghers casual elegance cost every bit as much as cloughs paul smith and that it had been thrown together at short notice he was also willing to bet that appearances aside gallagher was sharp as a tack and very wellversed in the intricacies of criminal law he was in his late twenties banks guessed with a heavy five oclock shadow and his dark hair hung in greasy strands over his collar he also had that edgy wasted look of someone who stays up too late at too many clubs and takes too many classa drugs he sniffed the stale air of the interview room and pulled a face annie turned on the tape recorders and went through the preamble then she sat beside banks a little out of cloughs line of vision on the periphery banks had told her she could remain unnoticed or distract him with a movement if she wished can we get on with it gallagher said glancing at his watch ive got an important appointment back in the city this evening banks smiled well do our best to make sure you dont miss it mr gallagher then he turned to clough do you have any idea why we want to talk to you clough held out his hands palm open none at all okay lets start with emily riddle you do admit to knowing her i knew her as louisa gamine you know that you came to my house but you now know that her real name was emily louise riddle yes how did you find out i told you i saw it in the papers are you sure you didnt know before that how could i perhaps the room in your house the room in which i talked to her was wired for sound clough laughed and glanced over at simon gallagher get that simon thats a laugh eh my house bugged he looked at banks again no longer laughing now you tell me why id want to do something like that information what sort of information business information i dont eavesdrop electronically on my clients or my partners chief inspector besides its my home were talking about not my office lets leave that for the moment then shall we banks went on what was your relationship with emily riddle relationship yes you know the sort of thing human beings have with one another clough shrugged i fucked her once in a while he said she was okay in bed a hell of a lot better than she was at giving blow jobs is that all what do you mean is that all did you ever do anything else together talk for example i suppose we must have though i cant say i remember a word she said did you ever tell her anything about your business interests certainly not if you think id go around telling some bimbo about my business you must be crazy did she live with you she lived in the same house in little venice yes did she live with you we were together some of the time its a big house sometimes guests come and forget to leave for a long time you can get lost in there you should know youve seen it twice is this what happened with emily she sort of got lost in your big house i suppose so i dont remember how she got there a party probably did you sleep together we didnt do much sleeping look chief inspector gallagher chipped in this all seems pretty innocuous as the girl in question was of legal age but i cant really see where its getting us did emily riddle know anything at all about your business dealings barry no not unless she spied on me is that possible anythings possible im careful but what exactly is your business bit of this bit of that more specifically clough looked at gallagher who nodded i manage a couple of fairly successful rock bands i own a bar in clerkenwell i also promote concerts from time to time i suppose you could call me a sort of impresario an impresario banks savored the word if you say so barry has a sort of oldfashioned ring to it dont you think sunday night at the london palladium and all that were you worried that emily riddle might have known too much about this impresario business of yours no why would i you tell me no did she ever indicate that she did did she ask you for money for example you mean blackmail did she emily no i told you she was just some young bimbo i used to fuck thats all and now shes dead and now shes dead sad isnt it yes said banks reining in his rising temper it is clough got to his feet is that it then can we go now sit down barry youll go when i tell you to go clough looked at gallagher who nodded again did you see emily at all after she left london no easy come easy go were you at scarlea house between december the fifth and december the tenth this year i cant remember oh come on barry you were there for the grouse shooting you had your minder jamie gilbert with you and a young woman in tow amanda khan the pop singer oh yes i remember now last time i asked you you said you were in spain at that time i get confused i do a lot of travelling what can i say but i remember now you didnt see emily while you were staying in the area why would i amanda gives far better head for old times sake let go and move on thats my motto perhaps to give her a glassine envelope of cocaine laced with strychnine chief inspector said gallagher youre treading in dangerous territory here be careful did you banks asked clough now where would i get hold of strychnine i daresay youd have your sources cocaine wasnt much trouble was it you know as well as i do chief inspector that theres probably enough of that stuff around at any given moment to pay off the national debt if you like that sort of thing not for me of course but strychnine i wouldnt know where to start while you were at scarlea did you have dinner with chief constable jeremiah riddle what if i did how did you know him mutual acquaintance bollocks barry when emily left with the information youd overheard from our conversation you found out who she really was where she lived and when you found that her father was a seniorranking policeman you tried to move in and blackmail him chief inspector simon gallagher broke in im going to have to ask you to stop these absurd insinuations if you want to question my client go ahead and question him in the prescribed manner i apologize said banks why did you have dinner with chief constable riddle why dont you ask him i already have clough seemed surprised at that but he soon regained his composure we talked about his daughter and if he told you anything different then hes a liar how did you feel when emily left you come again you heard what i said feel i didnt feel anything really why would i i mean she was only some bimbo you used to fuck yes yes so you said before no need to keep on repeating yourself but you dont like your bimbos to run out on you do you you prefer to give them the boot yourself thats exactly what happened shed served her purpose it was time to move on she didnt get the message so i had to help her along a bit by trying to toss her into bed with andrew handley andy pandy whats he got to do with this you do admit to knowing him then he works for me from time to time not anymore barry hes dead what andy dead i dont believe it he was found shot to death near exmoor know anything about that of course i dont its sad yeah andy was all right is that why you pushed emily into a room with him i did no such thing ive told you before if she went into a room with andy she went on her own accord sure he didnt get tired of taking your leftovers and decide to strike out for himself look chief inspector my client has answered all these questions before unless theres anything new gregory manners said banks who said clough gregory manners he ran the pkf operation for you at daleview remember i told you their van got hijacked on the way to a new location and the night watchman at daleview was murdered oddly enough it was the same mo as the andrew handley murder i vaguely remember you going on about that when you came to the house with that other copper i didnt understand why then and i dont now right so what about it what do you mean come on barry we found gregory mannerss fingerprints on a whole stack of bootlegged games and software thats what you were doing at pkf a big operation you had multidisc copying machines and they were in that van andy pandy wanted to break away didnt he go into business by himself so he hatched a plot with the night watchman at daleview charlie courage had already figured out there was something dodgy going on at pkf charlie had a nose for that sort of thing and you were paying him off then andy comes along with a better offer they arrange it to look like a hijack but your lads pick up gregory manners first and he tells you he thought there was something fishy going on between charlie and andy pandy then you pick up charlie and he tells all so they kill charlie and then they kill andy pandy isnt that how it went clough turned his head slowly to gallagher and raised his eyebrows am i missing something simon he said i am barry clough arent i mr banks here seems to have me confused with some criminal named gregory manners gallagher stood up chief inspector youve got an active imagination ill say that but you cant corroborate any of this you havent a single shred of evidence connecting my client to either of these men mr manners is still helping us with our inquiries banks lied we have every reason to believe hell tell us what he knows when he realizes the full extent of the charges that might be brought against him clough gave banks a stony gaze so what he said what about andrew handley banks said to gallagher your client has already admitted to knowing him but that doesnt mean he had anything to do with mr handleys unfortunate demise unfortunate demise banks repeated andrew handleys upper body was shredded by a closerange shotgun wound id hardly call that an unfortunate fucking demise unfortunate turn of phrase muttered gallagher and theres no need to swear at me were all adults here arent we and im hardly the first theres a lady present said clough grinning at annie fuck you said annie gallagher waved his hands in the air all right all right ladies and gentlemen can we all just calm down a minute and get back on track if there is a track thank you mr gallagher said banks i believe we were talking about andrew handley all right said clough yes i knew him he worked for me sometimes doing what managing things i delegate a lot banks laughed out loud chief inspector sorry couldnt help it delegate right would you say the two of you were friends not really we might have a drink together every now and then talk about business but other than that no i dont know what he got up to nor he you suppose not do you own a shotgun barry do i look like a fucking farmer you certainly have plenty of guns at your london house theyre all deactivated and all legal im a collector so you dont own a shotgun ive already told you no you havent you didnt answer my question do you own a shotgun no banks paused a moment then what did you use for shooting grouse at scarlea a peashooter gallagher put his head in his hands they have guns available to their guests for rental oh come off it barry do you expect me to believe that a keen regular grouse shooter like you doesnt own a shotgun i find that difficult believe what you want we can check okay okay so maybe i own a shotgun then why didnt you say so because the way things are going it looks as if youre trying to pin a fucking murder on me and my fucking lawyer is barry said gallagher shut up just shut up okay let me take care of it lying just makes it worse said banks he tipped annie the nod and she officially terminated the taped interview whats going on clough asked can i go now afraid not barry said banks well be issuing a warrant for your shotgun to be examined by forensic experts in the murders of andrew handley and charles courage clough smiled go ahead if i did have anything to do with those murders which i didnt do you think id be stupid enough to use my own shotgun and leave it lying around the house banks smiled back probably not he said but it doesnt really matter at least a forensic examination will settle things one way or another wont it were also looking into some tire tracks found at the murder scenes in the meantime you can sample some of our legendary northern hospitality you mean i cant go banks shook his head simon your lawyer will tell you we can detain you for twentyfour hours barry any period of time after that has to be okayed by a more senior officer than me but if you think thats likely to be a problem remember that emily riddle was our chief constables daughter you know he cant do this can he simon im afraid he can said gallagher staring at banks but any detention longer than twentyfour hours will come under very severe scrutiny i can assure you now if youll excuse me id better cancel my appointment banks opened the door and asked the uniformed officers to escort clough to the custody suite in the stations basement youll be well taken care of barry banks said soon be lunchtime beefburger and chips i think it is today sorry theres no château margeaux to accompany it you might be able to get a mug of tea careful you dont crease your paul smith while banks went to pay another visit to the riddle house annie wandered into the incident room to see what was going on it was a hive of activity most of the phone lines were busy and the fax machines were churning stuff out dc rickerd held sway over it all a man who had truly found himself he blushed when annie gave him a wink poor winsome was back at the computer a stack of green sheets for input and another stack she had already entered hows it going annie asked picking up the entered stack and idly leafing through it just because everything went into holmes didnt mean any of it was ever seen again not unless some sort of link or connection came up and then you had to be looking for it winsome smiled okay i suppose sometimes i wish id never done that damn course though i know what you mean said annie still itll come in useful when you sit your boards i suppose so annie was hardly reading the information on the entered sheets more just letting her gaze slip over them but something she saw on one of them reached out and smacked her right between the eyes winsome she said picking it out and putting it on the desk what happened with this winsome scrutinized the sheet dci banks signed off on it yesterday she said no further action no further action annie repeated under her breath something wrong no said annie quickly replacing the sheet in the pile nothing just curious thats all see you later annie hurried back to her office aware of winsomes puzzled gaze noticed she had it all to herself picked up the telephone and dialed an outside line hotel fiftyfive the answering voice said can i help you mr poulson oh you want roger just a minute annie waited a minute and another voice came on the line roger poulson here can i help you detective sergeant cabbot eastvale cid i understand you phoned our incident room yesterday with information relating to the death of emily riddle i wouldnt go that far poulson said it was just an odd coincidence thats all tell me about it anyway mr poulson well as i said to the gentleman yesterday what gentleman the policeman who called me back yesterday i didnt catch his name ill bet you didnt thought annie and wed have heard no more about it if i hadnt come across the name and number by accident hotel fiftyfive it was where she had stayed with banks when they visited london in connection with the gloria shackleton case when they were lovers what did he say annie asked he simply took the details and thanked me for calling to be honest i didnt expect to hear any more of it he didnt sound very interested why has something turned up annie felt a tightness in her chest no she said nothing like that its just down to me to keep the paperwork uptodate you know what its like tell me about it said poulson how can i help you if youd just go over the information again briefly of course as i said its nothing really it was about a month ago when i was on night duty i think i saw her the girl who was killed go on at least she looked sort of like the girl in the newspaper photo yesterday with her hair up a nice evening gown mostly its the eyes and lips though id almost swear it was her you say you saw her at the hotel yes was she a guest not exactly what do you mean well she walked in i think shed just got out of a taxi and said she wanted to see her father her father annie was confused she didnt know that jimmy riddle had been down to london looking for his daughter only banks she felt icy water rising fast around her ankles thats right she said he was staying here i had no reason not to believe her of course not what did you do i called his room and told him his daughter was in the lobby wanting to see him and she was in a bit of a state naturally he told me to send her up the thing was you see she looked very disheveled as if shed been attacked or involved in some rough stuff natural to come to daddy under such circumstances even if it was three oclock in the morning when you say rough stuff what exactly do you mean nothing really serious but there was a tear in her dress and a little blood at the corner of her lip what happened after shed gone up nothing i mean i didnt see anything i was on duty until eight oclock the next morning and i didnt see either of them again so she stayed in his room the rest of the night yes the cold water was up to annies navel by now and she decided to plunge right in sometimes it was the best way what was her fathers name well it wasnt riddle like it says in the paper as i said to your colleague yesterday thats why i thought it was funny so i pulled the credit card slip hes stayed with us here before i remember once with a very attractive young lady his name is banks alan banks the shock numbed annies blood even though she had been half expecting it she thanked mr poulson then hung up in a daze banks in a hotel room with emily riddle half the night the same hotel hed taken annie to and he hadnt told her this put a new complexion on things indeed banks slipped the tape he had made of brians bands cd in the cassette player and reflected on his interview with clough as he drove out to the old mill clough was still cooling his heels in the holding cells but they wouldnt really be able to hold him much after the following morning gallagher was right about that any infringement of pace because clough was a suspect in the murder of the chief constables daughter would go down very badly indeed and only increase his chances of getting off scotfree that was how things were now in the old days they used to be different of course and banks still wasnt certain which was best he just hoped to hell that some of the information he was desperate for arrived before the deadline the question he always came back to though was that if clough had killed emily what was his motive clough was an astute gangster surely smart enough not to let an affair with a sixteenyearold girl ruin the rest of what was clearly a charmed and profitable life still banks thought remembering the famous gangsters of movieland james cagney edward g robinson there were plenty of mob bosses who were also psychopaths and killed for reasons other than pure business if banks were clough though when he found out that emily had gone and then discovered she was a chief constables daughter he would have cut his losses and left well enough alone but perhaps that was why banks wasnt clough had emily really been doing something foolish like trying to blackmail clough banks didnt think so she was a mixedup kid but he didnt think she was a blackmailer he had also got the feeling from talking to her that she was genuinely scared of clough and that the more permanent distance there was between them the better besides her family didnt lack for money and as riddle had pointed out at the start they had spoiled her rotten even so the idea of an undisclosed income of her very own might appeal but would it overcome her fear also why would clough wait so long to kill her if he was after revenge for her leaving it was over a month since banks had brought emily back from london perhaps it had taken him that long to find out who and where she was or perhaps it had taken her that long to start blackmailing him there had been no telephone calls to clough on riddles phone records but that didnt necessarily mean emily hadnt called him from a public box something about the sparse phone records nagged at his mind but he couldnt quite grasp it never mind as his mother always said if it was that important it would come to the surface soon enough he showed his warrant card to the officers at the end of the lane and they waved him through a hundred yards farther on he pulled up on the gravel drive outside the old mill and turned off the engine the rain had stopped but it had swelled the millrace which sounded even louder and faster than on his last visit this time riddle wasnt watching for his arrival he wondered if rosalind had told him banks was coming he hoped not he knocked at the door and waited nothing surely riddle couldnt have gone back to work already he knocked again harder in case the noise from the stream was covering the sound still nothing banks stepped back a few paces from the front door and looked at the front of the house no windows open it was a dull afternoon and someone at home might have put a light or two on but none showed perhaps riddle had gone out maybe for a long drive to think things over banks felt relief he had come to fulfill his promise to rosalind but it wasnt his fault if riddle wasnt home what more could he do but surely if riddle had gone out the duty officers would have told banks it was then that he became aware of another faint noise beyond the sound of the rushing millrace at first it didnt mean much then when he realized what it was it sent a chill through him it was coming from the converted barn and it was the sound of a car engine idling banks dashed toward the barn doubting his own ears at first but there was no mistaking the smooth purr of the german engineering the garage door was closed but not locked banks bent and grasped the handle pulling as he moved back and the door slid up smoothly and silently on its overhead runners the stink of exhaust fumes hit him immediately and he staggered back digging his hands in his raincoat pocket for a handkerchief he couldnt find one but he went in anyway with his forearm over his nose and mouth it was dark and smoky inside the garage and banks couldnt make out very much at first his eyes adjusted as he moved inside noticing that rolledup cloths or towels had been placed against the gap between the floor and bottom of the garage door on the inside he did the best he could to keep the fumes at bay covering his mouth and nose with one hand breathing only as little as necessary at least now air from outside was displacing the carbon monoxide when banks got to the car he could see riddle slumped across the two front seats there was no way of knowing yet whether he was dead so banks first tried to open a door they were all locked he looked around and found a crowbar on one of the shelves standing back and swinging it hard he broke open one of the back windows to avoid disturbing the front reached inside and disengaged the lock mechanism then he opened the front door at the drivers side reached across riddle and turned off the engine the fumes were dissipating slowly now the garage doors stood wide open but banks was beginning to feel nauseated and dizzy he felt for a pulse and found none riddles whole face was as red as his bald head got when he was angry cherryred the hosing he had rigged from the exhaust to the back window was still in place he had opened the window a crack to admit it and stuffed the opening with oilstained rags riddle was wearing his uniform everything polished shiny in order apart from the thin streak of yellowish vomit down his front above the dashboard was a sheet of paper with handwriting on it leaving it where it was banks leaned over and squinted it was short and to the point the games over please take care of benjamin and try to ensure that he doesnt think too ill of his father im sorry jerry banks read it again angry tears pricking at his stinging eyes you bastard he thought you selfish bastard as if his family hadnt suffered enough already groggy and sick banks stumbled outside and made it to the millrace before he emptied out his lunch he bent over and took handfuls of cold clear water and splashed it over his face drinking down as much of it as he could manage he knew that there were two officers only a hundred yards away but he wasnt sure his legs would carry him that far so he went back to his car picked up his mobile and called the station then he bent forward put his hands on his knees and took deep breaths as he waited for the circus to begin banks spent the evening at home trying to make sense of the days events he still felt weak and nauseated but apart from that there seemed no serious damage the ambulance crew had insisted on giving him oxygen and taking him to eastvale general for a checkup but the doctor pronounced him fit to go home with a warning to lay off the ciggies for a while from what he had been able to piece together so far it appeared almost certain that riddle had committed suicide they wouldnt know for sure until dr glendenning performed the postmortem probably tomorrow but there were no signs of external violence on riddles body the note appeared to be in his handwriting and the rags and towels used to keep the petrol fumes in the garage had been placed on the inside of the doors after they had been closed there were no windows or other means of exit banks would never have pegged riddle as the suicidal type but he would be the first to admit that he had no idea if such a type existed certainly the murder of his daughter the destruction of all his political and professional hopes and the smear campaign started against him in the tabloid would be enough to drive anyone over the edge so suicide it may be banks thought but barry clough still had a lot to answer for clough was enjoying the hospitality of the eastvale cells that night while the detectives and forensic experts mobilized by burgess down south were working overtime following up all the leads they had on the charlie courage and andy pandy shootings with any luck by tomorrow banks would have something more substantial to confront clough with in the interview room it was nine oclock when a car pulled up and someone knocked at the door puzzled banks went to see who it was rosalind riddle stood there in the cold night air wearing only a long skirt and sweater can i come in she said its been a hell of a day banks could think of no reply to that he stood aside to let her in and shut the door behind her she smoothed down her skirt and sat in the armchair by the fire rubbing her hands together theres a chill in the air she said we might get frost tonight what are you doing here banks asked ive been going insane just sitting around the house charlotte came to stay with me for a while but i sent her away shes nice but you know were not that close its so empty and theres nothing to do there my mind has been running around in circles i want to talk to you it seemed i dont know im sorry perhaps i shouldnt have come she moved to stand up no sit down you might as well stop youre here now drink rosalind paused are you sure yes all right she sat down again thank you i wouldnt mind a glass of white wine if you have any im afraid ive only got red okay its nothing fancy she smiled dont worry i might be a snob about some things but not about wine good banks headed into the kitchen to open the marks and sparks bulgarian merlot he poured himself a glass too he had a feeling he would need it after he had handed rosalind her drink banks sat opposite her she had clearly made an effort to look her best wearing an expensive gray skirt and fair isle jumper applying a little makeup to give some color to her pallid features but there was no disguising the bruiselike circles under her eyes or the rims pink from crying this was a woman hanging on the edge by her fingernails how are you he asked it sounded like a stupid question after what had happened to her but he couldnt think of anything else to say im i i dont really know i thought i was coping but inside she tapped her chest it all feels so tight and hot inside here i keep thinking im going to explode her eyes brimmed with tears its quite a thing you know losing both your daughter and your husband within a week of one another she gave a harsh laugh then thumped the armrest of her chair how dare he do this how dare he what do you mean hes run away from it all hasnt he and where does that leave me a cold heartless bitch because im still alive because i didnt care about my daughters murder enough to kill myself over it dont do this rosalind said banks getting up and putting his hands on her shoulders he could feel the little convulsions as grief and anger surged through her after a while she reached up and gently disengaged his hands im all right she said wiping the tears out of her eyes im sorry for inflicting myself on you but its been on my mind all day going over and over it again i cant understand my feelings i should feel sorrow loss but all i feel is anger i hate him i hate him for doing this and i hate myself for feeling like that banks could do nothing but sit down helplessly and let her cry again he remembered his own reaction to finding riddles body there had been a lot of anger in that too before it gave way to guilt the selfish bastard when rosalind had finished he said look i cant pretend to know how you feel but i feel terrible myself if id gone out there sooner i might have saved him it sounded even more pathetic than his opening gambit but he felt he had to get it off his chest rosalind gave him a sharp look you dont be silly jerry was a very determined man if he wanted to kill himself hed damn well do it one way or another there was nothing you could have done except perhaps postpone the inevitable even so i keep thinking if only i hadnt put off the visit if only i hadnt i dont know disliked him so much banks looked away i suppose thats a part of it dont worry jerry wasnt a very likable man even death wont change that theres no sense in your feeling guilty ive been thinking about what might have caused him to do it banks said after a short pause i know you said he was depressed over emilys death and all the fallout that engendered but somehow even all that just didnt seem enough in itself he was upset about those lies in the newspaper banks paused he knew he shouldnt be telling rosalind about her husbands problems with barry clough but he felt she deserved something from him he also thought it might put riddles death in perspective for her a little more clearly call it guilt talking he took a deep breath then said i was out at a place called scarlea house yesterday afternoon ever heard of it ive heard of it yes its an upmarket shooting lodge isnt it yes according to the bartender your husband had dinner with barry clough there the sunday before last rosalind paled barry clough yes the man emily lived with for a while in london i remember the name and youre telling me that jerry had dinner with him yes are you sure you didnt know no jerry never said anything to me about it i knew he was out for dinner that night yes but i thought it was just one of his political things id stopped asking him where he went a long time ago how would a newspaper find out about that anyway even if it is true they didnt have to know about that specific meeting said banks remember the article never made any direct assertions it was all innuendo its even possible that someone on the staff at scarlea house one of the waiters perhaps talked to a reporter but refused to be quoted as a source i dont know these journalists have their tricks of the trade the point is that it happened did you have any idea at all that your husband had talked to or met with clough no absolutely none banks believed her for one thing riddle wasnt stupid enough to tell his wife he was having dinner with the man suspected of murdering their daughter your husband told me that clough was trying to blackmail him using emily but jerry would never agree to anything like that i think that was his dilemma that was what tore him apart certainly emilys murder hurt him deeply but this was what finally pushed him over the edge there he was a man of honor who has to decide whether he wants to fall into the hands of a gangster or have his daughter and by extension his entire family vilified in public are you saying that he didnt know whether he would have done what clough asked or not and he couldnt face making the decision possibly but going by the tabloid article it looks as if he had already turned clough down or that clough had lost patience waiting if clough was behind it who else i dont know rosalind leaned forward but if all youre saying is true it doesnt make sense for clough to kill emily no thats true thats what your husband said too when i asked him about it clough had nothing to gain i still think hes a strong candidate but i must admit the whole things been puzzling me a lot who then i dont know i feel as far away from a solution as i ever have what will you do about clough keep at him there are other things we want to talk to him about too ive got to tell you though that im not at all hopeful about convicting clough of anything no matter what hes done why not a man like him if he can blackmail a chief constable imagine what else hes got going who he might have in his pocket besides he never does anything himself he delegates keeps his hands clean even if for some reason we havent considered he was responsible for emilys murder hed have got one of his minions like andrew handley or jamie gilbert to do the dirty work and hes rich that means hell be able to afford the best defense sometimes i wish i was in criminal law rosalind said her eyes burning id love to take on his prosecution banks smiled first wed have to persuade the cps it was worth pursuing and thats a herculean effort in itself in the meantime weve still got a murderer to catch rosalind sipped some wine at least she didnt pull a face and spit it out youve probably deduced this already she said but our marriage was very much a matter of convenience he gave me the things i wanted and i didnt embarrass him in public i like to think i might even have helped him advance other than that we went our separate ways affairs jerry i dont think so for one thing he didnt have the time he was married to his work and his political ambitions she looked banks straight in the eye me a few nothing important all discreet none recently they sat quietly for a few seconds a gust of wind rattled the loose window upstairs you said you wanted to talk to me banks said oh its nothing to do with the murder im sorry i didnt mean to mislead you in any way its just that well you give the impression you think ive been holding something back not telling you everything banks nodded yes i do think that i have done from the start youre right and now youre going to tell me no reason not to now but first do you think i might have another glass of wine that evening at home annie reheated some vegetable curry in a bowl and sat in front of the television hoping the flickering images would take her mind off her problem no such luck there seemed to be nothing on but nature programs current events or sports and nothing she watched had the power to absorb or distract her at all she flipped through her meager collection and briefly entertained the idea of watching a comfort video doctor zhivago or the wizard of oz but she even felt too agitated to concentrate on a movie damn banks she thought as she washed out her dish how could he do this to her maybe she had let things cool between them romantically but that gave him no right to treat her like some probationary dc who couldnt be trusted with the full story she knew that his action hadnt been technically wrong in any way but it had been dishonest and cowardly as sio banks was quite entitled to follow up a lead and decide whether it required action or not obviously in the case of his night with emily riddle he knew exactly what had occurred so he knew that no further action was needed he must also have known that he was hiding the truth from annie though or he would have told her about that night before when he came clean about going to london to find emily and having lunch with her the day she died annie remembered asking him then if that was all he had to tell and he had said yes that made him a liar so what to do about it that was the question she agonized over the way she saw it she had two choices she could of course simply do nothing just put in for a transfer and leave the whole mess behind that had its appeal certainly but it left too much up in the air she had hidden from unpleasant things and turned her back for far too long now that her career had actually come to mean something to her again after the years of apathetic exile in harkside where she had conned herself into thinking everything was well with the world annie wanted to set things on the right track and just how would an abrupt transfer look with her inspectors boards coming up so soon on the other hand she could confront banks and find out what he had to say for himself maybe she should give him the benefit of the doubt innocent until proven guilty and all that after all it wasnt as if she didnt still have feelings for the bastard but she already knew he wasnt innocent that it was simply a matter of what he was guilty of how much might a runin with banks upset her chances of making inspector she didnt think he was vindictive didnt think he would deliberately stand in her way but everything has fallout especially given the history banks and annie had between them giving up on the television annie did what she usually did when she felt agitated and unable to find her calm center she flung on her fleecelined jacket and went for a drive it didnt matter where it had turned into a cold night and she got the heater going fullblast even so the car took a while to warm up the mist was crystallizing on the bare trees sparkling as her headlights flicked across branches and twigs on her way out of harkside icecrusted puddles crackled under her wheels she crossed the narrow bridge over the river rowan between the harksmere and linwood reservoirs harksmere stretched cold and dark to the west and beyond it lay thornfield reservoir where the remains of hobbs end had once more been covered with water that was where she had first met banks she remembered toward the end of the hottest driest summer in years he had come scrambling down the steep rim looking like a sightseer and she had stopped him at the bridge she had been wearing her red wellies and must have looked a sight he still didnt know this but annie had known who he was the minute she saw him she had been expecting him but she wanted a little fun first so she had challenged him on the packhorse bridge she had liked his manner he hadnt been stuffy or officious with her he had simply made some reference to robin hood and little john after that annie had to admit that she hadnt resisted him very hard and now he was her senior officer and he had been keeping things from her past the old air base annie took the left fork and headed for the open moorland that stretched for miles on the tops between there and swainsdale up on the unfenced road the full moon came out from behind the thinning cloud cover and she could see that the ground all around her was white with rimefrost it had an eerie beauty that suited her mood well she could drive for hours through this lunar landscape and her mind would empty of all her problems she would become nothing but the driver floating through space the wheel the car merely extensions of her being as if she were traveling the astral plane except that annie knew now where she was going knew that the road she was on was the one that led over the moors and down through the village of gratly where banks lived and she knew that when she got to his drive she would turn into it banks refilled the wineglasses and sat down again go on he said rosalind smiled you might find this hard to believe she began but i havent always been the dull decent wife of the dull decent chief constable banks was startled by her smile it had so much of emily in it that hint of mischief of just watch me that sounds like the beginning of a story he said it is im all ears first we have to go back a while believe it or not my father was a vicar hes retired now of course i grew up in the vicarage in a small village in kent an only child and my childhood was relatively uneventful i dont mean that it was bad in any way i did all the normal things kids do i was happy it was just unexceptional dull even like the way philip larkin described his in that poem then in the midseventies when i was sixteen we moved to a parish out ealing way oh it was a very nice area none of that innercity stuff and the parishioners were for the most part lawabiding reasonably affluent citizens but but it was near the tube you cant imagine what wonderful new worlds that opened up to an impressionable sixteenyearold banks thought he could when he moved from peterborough to notting hill at the age of eighteen his life had changed in many ways he had met jem across the hall from his bedsit for a start and had lurked at the fringes of the sixties scene which stretched well into the early seventies enjoying the music more than the drugs there was an excitement and vibrancy about the capital that was missing from peterborough and would certainly have been missing from a vicarage in kent let me guess the vicars daughter went a little wild i was born in it was november when we moved to ealing while everyone else was listening to queen abba and hot chocolate me and my friends were taking the tube into town to listen to the sex pistols this was right at the start before anyone really knew anything about them theyd just played their first gig the day after bonfire night at saint martins college of art and one of the girls at my new school was there she couldnt talk about anything else for weeks next time they played she took me with her it was fantastic punk banks remembered those days he was older than rosalind though and identified more closely with sixties music than that of the seventies when he had lived in london his favorites had been pink floyd led zeppelin and the various local blues bands that seemed to form and split up with amazing regularity still he had responded to the angry energy of some of the punk music especially the clash by far the best of the bunch in his opinion but not enough to buy any of their records also as he had been a probationary police constable back then he had experienced the violence of punk firsthand from the other side and that too had put him off pretty soon rosalind went on becoming more animated as she relived her memories it was in full swing the look the music the attitude everything my parents didnt know me anymore we saw the clash the damned the stranglers the jam you name them mostly in small clubs we pogoed we hurled ourselves into one another and we spat at each other we dyed out hair weird colors we wore torn clothes safety pins in our ears and she paused and pulled up the sleeve of her jumper banks could see a number of more or less round white marks like old scars we stubbed cigarettes out on ourselves banks raised an eyebrow how on earth did you explain all that to your husband he was never that curious i just told him it was an old burn scar go on you cant imagine how exhilarating it was after the stuffy and boring childhood in a village in kent we went wild anyway to cut a long story short i was just seventeen and i got pregnant it doesnt matter who the father was his name was mal and he was long gone before i even knew myself it happened in someones poky bedsit after the pistols did one of their gigs at the club the summer of this is what i could never tell jerry he was a terrible prude as if you didnt know i dont know if he actually believed i was a virgin when we married but im certain he was if hed ever found out well who can say i kept it from him banks remembered the club well on oxford street it had been part of his patch and he had been inside the cavernous cellar more than once trying to stop fights and help get rid of unruly customers it turned into a jazz club some years later he remembered i can understand why you might not have wanted him to know he said even in this day and age some people are funny about that sort of thing and it doesnt surprise me that jimmy i mean the chief constable was but why is that important now he knew you all called him jimmy riddle you know he did he never said anything he didnt care something like that it didnt bother him wasnt even of passing interest to him he was strangely impervious to criticism or having the piss taken he really didnt have much of a sense of humor you know anyway i havent told you the full story yet youll see why its important she moved forward in her chair and clasped her hands on her knees when she spoke she almost whispered as if she thought someone were eavesdropping on them my first thought was to have an abortion but i dont know i didnt really know how to go about it if you can believe that a fully fledged punk pregnant but i was still a naive country girl in a lot of ways then there was my religious background when it came down to it i hadnt the nerve to face it all by myself and the boy well as i said he was long gone my fathers a good man he had been preaching about grace mercy and christian charity all his life so you went to your parents yes and they took it well considering they were upset naturally but they were good to me they persuaded me to have the baby of course as i knew they would father doesnt believe in abortion its not only catholics who dont you know anyway we did it the way they used to do it years ago a spell with aunt soandso in tiverton for the last few months when it started to show a quick adoption and it was as if nothing had ever happened in the meantime if i happened to get cured of punk so much the better did you get cured of punk yes by the time id had my baby i was about to sit my alevels it was i dont know if you remember but punk had become very popular and the big bands were all being signed up by major labels the whole scene had got very commercial now it seemed that everybody was talking about it adopting the look somehow it just wasnt the same they werent ours any more besides i was older and wiser i was a mother even if i wasnt a practicing one yes i was cured i spent the summer at home and in october i went to the university of bath to study english literature became an intellectual snob and switched to new wave which id always secretly preferred anyway elvis costello talking heads roxy music television patti smith art school music i did one year of english then changed to law theres more isnt there yes the child as you know its perfectly legal now for children to track down their birth parents i can understand it but i have to say that in many cases its the cause of nothing but grief in your case she found me easily enough last january it was the childrens act came into effect in before she was born as you probably know that meant she didnt even have to go for counseling before the registrar general gave her the information that led her to me it was always on the cards she just walked into my office one day it didnt take her long to work out that i was terrified of her telling my husband i dont know what would have happened it was bad enough that he was so prudish and possessive and that id kept it from him all those years but this also happened just as his political ambitions were getting all stirred up and i wanted to be on that ride too i wanted westminster jerry was always big on family values and any hint of a family scandal expunk wife of chief constable love child tells all well it would have ruined everything at least i believed it would what did she do asked for money your own daughter blackmailed you i wouldnt call it that she just asked for help now and then financial help yes i mean i did owe her didnt i apparently she hadnt had such a good life with her adoptive parents they turned out to be unsuitable she said though she didnt explain why and they didnt have much money then they died in a fire just after her second year of university and she was left all alone she was in her last year of university at the time she found me so every little bit helped i didnt really mind did she ever threaten to tell your husband the truth if you didnt pay up she she hinted that she might and you paid for her continuing silence rosalind averted her eyes yes even after she left university yes thats blackmail said banks are you going to tell me who she is does it matter it might rosalind drank some wine then she said its ruth ruth walker banks almost choked on his drink ruth walker is your daughter emilys halfsister rosalind nodded my god why didnt you tell me this before i cant see how it could be relevant thats for me to judge did emily know this i didnt think so what do you mean as far as i knew at the time they met only once ruth used to come to my office in eastvale thats where we did all all our business believe it or not i didnt even know her address where she lived except she told me shed grown up in salford once last easter i think it was emily was there shed come to borrow some money from me to go shopping ruth walked in i introduced my daughter and told her ruth was there about the new computer system we were thinking of installing they chatted a bit about music what school emily was at that sort of thing just polite chitchat that was all or so i thought so emily didnt know who ruth really was thats what i believed at the time what changed your mind after emily came after you brought emily back home the phone rang one day it was ruth i thought she was calling for me i was angry because id specifically told her never to phone the house but she asked to speak to emily and afterward i asked emily about it then she told me about how ruth had phoned her a lot at school how shed even been down to london once for a weekend and stayed with her how they were friends so emily knew that ruth was her halfsister yes what was her reaction you knew emily she thought it was all rather cool her mother having a secret past she promised me not to say anything she was well aware of how her father would react did you trust her for the most part emily wasnt malicious though she could be unpredictable you know at her age i wasnt much different if wed been contemporaries who knows we might have been friends i can only imagine the havoc the two of you might have wreaked rosalind smiled her emily smile again yes did she know about the blackmail good lord no at least she never said anything about it and i doubt thats something ruth would have admitted to her halfsister emily was very headstrong and irresponsible but she was honest at the bottom of it all i cant see her condoning what ruth was doing if she knew about it that made sense but what if emily had found out on her own why tell me all this now he asked rosalind shrugged a lot of reasons jerrys death your finding him your bringing emily back you know for better or for worse youve become part of our lives this last while i had to tell someone and i couldnt think of anyone else isnt that pathetic ever since emily came home ive been going crazy keeping it to myself but i couldnt risk telling you then not while jerry was alive i know you didnt like him but i know that you policemen stick together and anything you discover often makes its way into the papers im not saying you would have said anything but the walls have ears something like that and now it doesnt matter now does it nothing matters now apart from my anger i just feel empty she put her glass aside and stood up now i really must go ive said what i came to say thank you for listening as annie was about to turn left into bankss drive just before gratly bridge a car shot out backward and swung toward her so fast she had to floor the brake pedal to avoid a collision the other car then set off down the hill toward helmthorpe heart beating fast annie turned left and drove slowly up to bankss cottage she could see him silhouetted in the open door wearing only a shirt and jeans despite the cold annie pulled up in front and got out what the hell are you doing here banks said thats a nice welcome can i come in he stood aside you might as well everyone else does annie had come prepared to launch right into him having pumped herself up on the drive but the adrenaline surge of her near accident and bankss offhand manner took some of the wind out of her sails inside the cottage she sat down in the armchair it was still warm from whoever had just left it and what can i do for you banks said shutting the door and going over to put more peat on the fire first you can get me a drink annie nodded toward the low table that wine will do just fine banks went into the kitchen got another glass and poured her some wine who was that she asked taking the glass who the person who just left like a bat out of hell the person who damn near backed right into me oh that person rosalind riddle friend of yours work work oh well i can see why you wouldnt want to tell me anything about it then after all im only your dio arent i knock off the sarcasm annie it doesnt suit you of course i was going to tell you like you tell me everything come again oh you know what i mean humor me rosalind riddle is work like her daughter was work right i dont get it what are you implying im not implying anything annie told him about leafing through the green sheets and finding the reference to the hotel fiftyfive no further action or so winsome told me so i wondered why i hadnt heard anything about it i phoned the hotel and lo and behold who spent most of a night there together a month ago banks said nothing he just gazed sheepishly into the fire whats the matter annie went on cat got your tongue i dont see why i should have to explain myself to you oh you dont dont you ill tell you why murder thats why emily riddle was murdered last week or have you forgotten that as she spoke annie felt the embers of her anger start to rekindle again now after the things ive discovered i dont think youre fit to be working the case but im your dio and you owe me at least the fucking courtesy of telling me the truth about your relationship with the victim there was no relationship liar annie there liar will you let me talk if you tell the truth i am telling the truth liar all right so i liked emily so what i dont know why she was a pain in the arse but i liked her thats all more like a daughter than anything thats as far as it went it was my job to find her in london she got herself into a bit of bother at a party and the only place she knew to come was to the hotel id given her a card with the name written on so she could contact me if she decided to come home she was scared and alone and she came there its as simple as that what bother banks told her about the incident with andy pandy at the party and you didnt see fit to share this tidbit of information with me your dio annie shook her head i cant believe it what else have you been keeping me in the dark about nothing annie look i know it was wrong of me but surely you can see why i was worried how it might appear how it might appear emily riddle turns up at your room at three oclock in the morning and stays there the rest of the night and youre worried about how it might appear oh yes i think i can see why surely you cant think what else am i supposed to think you tell me you spend the night in a hotel room with a randy sixteenyearold slut and you want me to believe nothing happened do you think i was born yesterday emily riddle wasnt a slut oh pardon me isnt that grand coming to the defense of your poor damsel in distress annie the girls dead at least you could show show what respect yes were you showing her respect when you slept with her in that hotel room annie ive told you i didnt sleep with her and i dont believe you oh maybe you only intended to comfort her give her a little cuddle tell her everything was all right now but from what ive heard of her and from what i know about men i very much doubt it ended there i never touched her you should have got her a room of her own i was going to but she fell asleep on the bed oh come on she did she was stoned thats exactly what happened and you where were you i remember those rooms theyre not very big in the armchair by the window i sat up for a while listening to some music on the walkman then i spent the rest of the night listening to her snoring while i was trying to get to sleep if you must know annie said nothing she was trying to work out whether he was telling the truth or not she suspected that he probably was but she was determined not to let him off the hook that easily however much it hurt or upset annie whether banks had slept with emily riddle or not wasnt the real issue she told herself he could sleep with whomever he damn well pleased even if it happened to be a sixteenyearold girl annie had no hold over him what really mattered was that he had kept important information from her as he had done before in this investigation and she was beginning to find it harder and harder to trust him anyway banks went on youve got some bloody nerve accusing me of screwing up on the job annie stiffened what do you mean what about you do you really think youve been pulling your weight lately annie flinched from the accusation ive had a few problems thats all i told you personal problems a few problems is that what you call sneaking off to sleep with di dalton every minute my back was turned dont think i didnt notice im not stupid annie shot forward and slapped him hard across the face she could tell it hurt him and he drew back his cheek reddening hot tears brimmed in her eyes im sorry he said i didnt mean it to sound so harsh but youve got to admit you were pretty obvious how do you think i felt annie could feel the blood roaring through her veins and her heart knocking against her ribs even louder and faster than when the car almost hit her earlier she paused for what felt like hours taking slow deliberate breaths trying to calm herself get rid of the panic and rage that seemed to possess her when she finally spoke it was in a voice barely above a whisper you bloody idiot for your information di dalton was one of the men who raped me but dont let that bother you ill go now she started to get up jesus christ annie no dont go please dont go banks grasped her wrist she looked at his hand for a moment then she sat down again all the fight gone out of her banks refilled her wineglass and his own i dont know what to say he said i feel like a fool why didnt you say something like what come crying to my boss the first week on the job like this is the man who raped me is he the one who actually one of the others but it doesnt mean he wouldnt have done it too if id given him half a chance as far as im concerned theyre all three of them equally guilty but you could have told me you knew that id understand and what would you have done gone flexing your macho muscles beat him up something like that had a pissing competition no thanks it was my problem i preferred to handle it myself looks like you did a good job hes still alive isnt he banks smiled annie you dont have to handle everything in life by yourself shows what you know about it wasnt anyone around to help when it happened was there that doesnt mean theres no one now annie looked at him and felt herself soften i cant handle this she said shaking her head annie im sorry what can i say it doesnt matter yes it does i saw the way you and dalton tensed up when you met and i read it wrongly i thought there was something between you there was just not what you thought it was i know that now and im sorry i should have trusted you annie made a sound halfway between a sniff and a laugh like i trusted you i was jealous besides i didnt give you much reason to trust me did i ive handled this all wrong you can say that again annie i swear on my honor that nothing happened between me and emily riddle except she passed out in my room what was i to do the next day i bought her some new clothes on oxford street and we went home on the train and you really sat in one of those horrible hotel armchairs listening to your walkman yes and smoking and smoking of course yes then you tried to sleep but her snoring kept you awake yes and the wind and rain and the wind and rain he looked so earnest that annie couldnt help herself she burst into laughter the thing was she could just picture him there doing exactly what he said he looked hurt im sorry alan really i am nobody could make up a story as silly as that if it didnt really happen banks frowned so you believe me now i believe you i just wish youd told me earlier all this deception on both sides oh no i didnt deceive you you read the situation wrongly but you kept something from me that was private business it wasnt to do with the case not like your relationship with emily riddle you really liked her i dont think i could have stood being around her for very long she could be quite exhausting never stopped talking and a hell of an attitude but yes i did annie tilted her head and gave him a crooked grin youre a funny one youre so straight in some ways but theres a definite bohemian edge to you is that good itll do but i want you to know that im still seriously pissed off at you for not treating me as a professional youve got a lot of making up to do annie im sorry really i am its been difficult given what we had then me thinking you and dalton you know i mean its not as if i dont still annie felt her heart give a little somersault dont still what fancy you the fire was waning and the air becoming chilly banks looked at annie and she felt the stirrings of her feelings for him that shed been trying to ignore since they split up he picked up a lump of peat are you staying he asked shall i put some more on its getting cold annie gave him a serious look then bit her lip stretched out her hand the same hand she had slapped him with and said okay but weve got a lot of talking to do annie pulled up in the staff car park of the red brick fire station in salford just past eleventhirty the next morning after over an hour spent crawling along the m and getting lost in the center of manchester a lorry had overturned at one of the junctions near huddersfield and traffic was backed up as far as the intersection with the m the weather hadnt helped either after last nights deep freeze the roads were icy despite the brilliant winter sunshine that glinted on windscreens and bonnet ornaments the fire station stood on an arterial road near the estate of shabby georgian semis where ruth walker had grown up banks had told annie about ruths being rosalind riddles daughter ruth had told a lot of lies he said and he thought they should find out more about her background including the fire in which both her parents were killed eighteen months ago it had been easy to track down the address via the salford fire department which was annies first port of call the firestation captain george whitmore said he would be pleased to talk to her the firemen were sitting around playing cards in a large upper room above the gleaming red engines the place smelled of sweat aftershave and oil they were an odd lot firemen annie had always thought when everything was going well they had no job to do at all just the way the police would have nothing to do if people werent committing crimes annie had known one of the local lads back in st ives who spent his time at work writing westerns under a pseudonym selling about one a month to an american publisher she had also been out with a fireman who ran a carpetcleaning business on the side and one of his friends ran an airport taxi service they all seemed to have three or four jobs on the go of course fires are as inevitable as crime and when it came to the crunch nobody would deny the heroism of firemen if the occasion demanded it and no matter how politically correct you tried to be about it no matter how much people talked about recruiting more women to the job whether you called them combustion control engineers or flame suppressant units the truth about firemen was summed up in what they always had been and always would be called as far as annie was concerned firemen mr whitmore around she asked one of the card players he gave her the onceover smiled as if he thought he was sexy and pointed with his thumb office back there annie felt his eyes on her behind as she walked away heard a whisper then mens laughter she thought of turning and making some comment about how childish they were but decided they werent worth the effort george whitmore turned out to be a pleasant goodnatured man with cropped gray hair not far from retirement age by the look of him he had framed photos of his family including grandchildren on his desk youre the lass who phoned earlier are you he said bidding annie to sit down yes well i shouldve told you youve probably made a long journey for nothing annie smiled at him i dont mind its nice to get out of the office for a while she took out her notebook you remember the walker fire yes i was on the crew back then before my bad back put me on office duties a year ago you were at the scene yes it happened oh about three or four in the morning or a bit after i could look it up if you want the exact time it doesnt matter for the moment just your impressions will do he paused and frowned if you dont mind me asking love why do the police want to know about the walker fire now after all this time its just a background check annie said routine because there was nothing funny about it i understand there was no police investigation not beyond whats required by law and the insurance company no reason for one what was the cause of the fire a smoldering cigarette end down the side of the sofa another reason smokings bad for your health thought annie and you ruled out arson whitmore nodded early on there were no signs of forced entry of anything being disturbed for a start there was also no evidence of accelerants being used and quite honestly nobody had any reason to harm the walkers you knew them only in passing to say hello to they were active in chapel everyone knew that im not a particularly religious sort myself nice godfearing couple though by all accounts nice daughter they had too poor lass barely escaped with her life thatd be ruth aye they only had the one so what happened from the moment the alarm went off they didnt have a smoke detector if theyd had one its likely they wouldnt have died a neighbor saw the smoke and flames and phoned us by the time we got there most of the neighbors were already out in the street see a cigarette can smolder for hours and generate a lot of heat when it takes hold it really goes the fire had taken hold by then and it took us a good hour or so to put it out completely at least we managed to stop it spreading where was ruth at this time theyd taken her to hospital she jumped out of her bedroom window in the nick of time broke her ankle and dislocated her shoulder nasty the ankle was the worst bad fracture apparently took her weeks before she could walk again without crutches or a stick anyway it wasnt nearly as nasty as what happened to her mum and dad she was the lucky one thered been a shower earlier in the evening and the ground was soft or she might have broken more bones how did her parents die smoke inhalation thats what the postmortem showed never even had time to get out of bed ruth had inhaled some smoke too before she jumped but not enough to do her much harm a whiff of oxygen and she was right as rain why did she have time to escape and her parents didnt whitmore shrugged younger stronger quicker reflexes also her room was at the front and the fire was worse further back her parents were probably dead when she jumped can you tell me anything else thats about it really love told you youd probably had a wasted journey well you know what its like said annie was the house completely destroyed pretty much inside at any rate and now oh someone bought it and had it renovated to look at it now youd never know such tragedy happened there annie stood up where is it from here exactly carry on along the main road go left at the next lights and its the second street on the right thanks very much annie left whitmores tiny office and walked back past the card players this time one of them whistled at her she smiled to herself it felt quite nice actually thirtysomething and she still got whistled at shed have to tell alan about that alan they had talked most of the night while the peat fire blazed in the hearth and soft jazz played in the background he told her about rosalinds visit about emily and ruth about the guilt he felt on finding riddle dead in his garage and she told him about how daltons appearance had knocked her out of kilter brought back feelings she didnt know she still harbored and how she had confronted him on sunday morning had it been summer they would have been up talking until dawn but because it was december the only light that shone through the windows at four oclock in the morning came from a full moon as white as frost even then they continued to talk and the way annie remembered it she thought she had probably fallen asleep in midsentence it wasnt until both had slept for about three hours that they made love tentatively and tenderly and in the morning they had to scrape the ice off their car windows and drive like hell to get to work on time now it seemed to annie as if there were no more secrets as if nothing stood between them she still worried about their working together especially now that she was stationed at western divisional hq too and she could never quite get over her fear of commitment of rejection but banks hadnt asked her for commitment and if anything it was she who had rejected him last time out of fear of his past impinging on her life all she really knew she decided was that whatever it was they had she wanted it it was time again to take her lesson from eastern philosophy go with the flow annie smiled as she touched up her makeup using the rearview then she headed off to see if she could discover anything from the walkerss neighbors the atmosphere that had hung over the death scene at riddles garage the previous day seemed to have permeated the entire station banks thought as he looked out of his window at the market square the place had all the atmosphere of a funeral parlor while riddle might not have been the most loved or admired chief constable they had ever had he had been one of them and he was dead it was like losing a member of the family a distant and austere uncle perhaps but still a family member even banks felt heavyhearted as he sipped his bitter black coffee the dark mood reminded him of the days after graham marshalls disappearance when everyone in the school seemed to be going around walking on eggs in a daze and conversations all seemed to be carried out in whispers those days had given banks his first real taste of guilt a sense of being responsible for people that was one of the things that spurred him on now in his job he knew deep down that he was no more responsible for graham marshalls disappearance than he was for phil simpkinss bleeding to death on the railings or jems overdose of heroin but he seemed to attract the guilt draw it to him and wrap it around himself like a comforting mantle when he thought of annie though he felt his spirits rise he knew not to expect too much she had made that quite clear but at least they had got beyond the rumors and fears they had been bogged down in the past week banks sensed the possibility of a new deeper trust it would have to develop naturally though there could be no pushing not with someone as scared of intimacy as annie was or someone as recently battlescarred as himself sandras asking for a divorce and telling him she wanted to marry sean might have given him a sense of finality of liberation but the old wounds were still there which reminded him he ought to respond to the second solicitors letter or sandra would think he had changed his mind banks could see a knot of reporters outside the station he looked at his watch almost opening time pretty soon theyd all be ensconced in the queens arms padding out each others expense accounts riddles suicide was the kind of thing that got the london dailies this far up north no official statements had been issued yet and the riddle house was still under secure guard of course they could have a field day with this one chief constable commits suicide with police guard only yards away they could spin that to read whatever way they wanted rosalind was going down to stay with her parents in barnstaple when she had made the funeral arrangements then she had told banks just before she left the previous evening she would sell the house and decide what to do next there was no hurry she would be well provided for but she would move as far away from yorkshire as possible banks felt for her he had absolutely no conception of how awful it must feel to lose a daughter and a spouse in the space of only a few days he couldnt even imagine how terrible it would be to lose brian or tracy bankss ancient heater hissed and sputtered as he sat down and thought over the previous evenings conversation with rosalind one obvious point was that by telling him what she had she had inadvertently supplied him with a motive for getting rid of emily or was it inadvertent he had no doubt that rosalind could be devious when she wanted to after all she was a lawyer but he had no idea as to why she would want to incriminate herself that way put simply though if rosalind wanted to keep ruths existence from her husband and if emily was a loose cannon on the deck then rosalind had a motive for getting emily out of the way and by extension she had an even better motive for wanting ruth walker out of the way permanently since riddles suicide though it was all academic the money the status the celebrity the possibility of political life they had all vanished into thin air nothing remained for rosalind except benjamin and ruth and banks doubted she would have anything more to do with ruth after all that had happened it was enough to prove the writer of ecclesiastes right when he wrote that all is vanity banks couldnt bring himself to believe that rosalind had actually given her own daughter cocaine laced with strychnine or that she was right now plotting the demise of her other daughter but at the same time he had to bear in mind that there was no love lost between any of them and that once rosalind had given her child away to strangers and moved on to the wealth and power and their trappings she seemed to need so much and when it came right down to it no matter what banks gut instinct told him we are all capable of murder given the right incentive whichever way he looked at it ruth walkers sudden prominence in the case was a complication he could do without while annie dug up information on ruths background in salford banks was trying to find out as much as he could about her present life in kennington while he waited for a call from burgess he had already made several phone calls and had two pages of notes when his telephone rang he thought it was ruths boss calling him back but it was the other phone call hed been waiting for burgesss the one that gave a green light for the second interview with barry clough and not before time too they could only hang on to him for another couple of hours at most it seemed a pleasant enough neighborhood annie thought standing by the side of the road looking at the houses not at all the sort of place you would expect in salford though if she was honest she would have to admit she had never been to salford before and had no idea what to expect semidetached houses lined both sides of the quiet road each with a fairsized front lawn tucked away behind a privet hedge the cars parked in the street were not ostentatious but they werent rusted and clappedout tenyearold fiestas either most of them were imported japanese or korean models and annies astra didnt look too out of place crimewise she guessed the biggest problems would be the occasional breakin and car theft number was much like the other houses as whitmore had said there was no indication whatsoever of the tragedy that had taken place there annie tried to imagine the flames the smoke the screams and neighbors standing out in their slippers and dressing gowns watching helpless as ruth jumped from the upstairs window and her parents suffocated unable even to get out of their beds help you dearie annie turned and saw an elderly woman clutching a shopping bag with arthritiscrippled fingers only you look like youre lost or something no said annie smiling to reassure the woman she wasnt crazy or anything just lost in thought maybe did you know the walkers no only you were looking at their house yes im a policewoman annie introduced herself tattersall gladys tattersall the woman said pleased to meet you im sure dont tell me youre opening an investigation into the fire after all this time no do you think we should be why dont you come inside ill put the kettle on im at number thirtyseven here it was the semi adjoining the walker house it must have been frightening for you annie said as she followed mrs tattersall down the path and into the hall i was more frightened during the bombing in the war mind you i was just a lass then come in sit down annie entered the living room and sat on a plum velour armchair a giltframed mirror hung over the fireplace and the inevitable television set sat on its stand in the corner at the far end of the room was a dining table with four chairs arranged around it mrs tattersall went into the kitchen and came back wont be long she said sitting on the sofa youre right though it was a frightening night was it you who called the fire brigade no that was the hennessy lad over the road he was coming home late from a club and he saw the flames and smoke it was him came knocking on our door and told us to get out fast thats me and my husband bernard he passed away last winter cancer im sorry to hear it oh its all right lass it was a blessing really it was in his lungs though he was never a smoker the painkillers werent doing him much good toward the end annie paused for a moment it seemed appropriate after the mention of the late mr tattersall was your house damaged mrs tattersall shook her head we were lucky the walls got a bit warm i can tell you but the fire brigade sprayed the exterior with enough water to start a swimming pool it was august you see warm weather and wed left a window open so a bit of it got inside and did some damage to the walls peeling paper stains that sort of thing but nothing serious the insurance paid for it perhaps the worst that came out of it for us was having to live here while the people that bought the house after the fire hammered and banged away all hours of the day and night the renovators yes the kettle boiled mrs tattersall disappeared for a few minutes and returned with the tea service on a tray which she set down on the low table in front of the electric fire you havent told me why youre asking she said its just a routine check nothing to do with the fire really it just seemed like an easy place to start routine thats what you always say on telly annie laughed its probably about the only realistic thing about tv coppers then its ruth were interested in the daughter is she in any trouble not as far as i know why do you ask mrs tattersall leaned forward and poured milk and sugar just milk please you wouldnt be asking about her for the good of your health would you its to do with a friend of hers annie said like most police she was loath to give away the slightest scrap of information i suppose thatll have to do then said mrs tattersall handing annie the cup and saucer thank you did you know the walkers well pretty well i mean as well as you could do what do you mean they werent the most sociable types werent the walkers standoffish snobbish no not really i mean they were polite enough polite to a tee and helpful if you needed anything lord knows they didnt have much themselves but theyd give you the shirt off their backs they just didnt mix she paused then whispered religious the same way she had whispered cancer more than most id say so oh it was nothing strange none of those weird cults or churches where you cant have blood transfusions or anything straight methodist but strict observers against sunday shopping drinking pop music that sort of thing what was mr walkers occupation wages clerk did his wife work pauline good heavens no they were as traditional as you get she was a housewife you dont get many of those in this day and age mrs tattersall laughed youre telling me you dont lass me half the time i couldnt wait to get out of the house and to work not that i had such a wonderful job myself i was only a receptionist at the medical center down the road but you get to meet people chat find out whats going on in the world id go barmy if i was stuck between four walls day in day out wouldnt you i would said annie but mrs walker didnt seem to mind she never complained but its against their religion isnt it complaining i didnt know that annie would have been the first to admit that she didnt know much about religion except what she had read and she had read mostly about buddhism and taoism her father was an atheist so he hadnt subjected her to sunday school or any of the usual childhood indoctrination and the people who came and went in the commune carried with them a variety of ideas about religion and philosophy everything was always up for debate up in the air i mean if whatever happens to you is gods will good or bad then youve no call to be complaining to god about god if you see what i mean i think i do they were just a bit oldfashioned thats all people used to laugh behind their backs oh nothing vicious or anything it was mostly goodhumored not that theyd have noticed that was another thing that wasnt in their religion humor i did feel a bit sorry for young ruth sometimes why well there wasnt much fun in her life and young people need fun even us old uns need a bit of fun from time to time but when youre young she sighed anyway the walkers values were different from other folks and they didnt have much money with only him working how did they get by parsimony she were a good housekeeper pauline ill give her that good budgeter but it meant that young ruth could hardly stay uptodate with fashions and whatnot youd see her in the same outfit year after year a nip here and a tuck there and shoes good lord shed be clomping around in the most ugly things you could imagine pauline bought her them because they were durable you see sturdy sensible things with thick soles so theyd last a long time none of these nike trainers or reeboks like the other kids were wearing like it or not love fashions are so important to children especially in their teens she laughed i should know ive brought up two of them what happened the usual the other girls at school laughed at her called her names tormented her children can be so cruel and theyd no time for music or telly either wouldnt have a record player or a television set in the house so poor ruth couldnt join in the conversations with the rest she didnt know all about the latest hits and the popular television programs she was always a bit of a loner it wasnt as if she was a great beauty either she was always a rather pastyfaced dumpy sort of lass and that kind are easy to pick on it was starting to sound like a pretty miserable household to grow up in annie thought the artists colony where she had grown up herself didnt have a television either but there was always music often live and all sorts of interesting people around some nights they would sing songs and recite poems she could hear them from her bedroom it was all mumbojumbo to her then of course none of it rhymed or anything but they seemed to enjoy themselves sometimes they let her sing for them too and if she said so herself she didnt have a bad voice for traditional folk music still she thought she could relate to ruths feeling of being an outsider if youre different in any way no matter whether your familys too strict or too liberal you get picked on especially if you arent up on the latest styles too children are cruel mrs tattersall was right about that annie could remember some of their cruelties of her own childhood very well indeed once when she was about thirteen a gang of classmates had waylaid her in the lane on her way home from school dragged her into the trees stripped her and painted flowers all over her body while they made remarks about filthy drugtaking hippies and flower power they had then run off with her clothes and left her to make the rest of her way home naked cruel you could say that again she had found her clothes hanging on a tree by the side of the lane going to school the next day and that was in when hippies were history and the sixties was something her classmates could only have read about in books or seen on television documentaries the people who lived at the commune were artists and writers free thinkers yes but hippies no annies only sin was to be different to wear the kind of clothes she wanted to wear and that her father could afford artists never having been among the richest members of society yes in an odd way she could sympathize very easily with ruth walker two sides of the same coin ruth went off to university didnt she yes thats what changed everything what do you mean well they wanted her to go to manchester like and keep on living at home so they could keep an eye on her but she went to london they thought university was a den of iniquity you see full of sex and drugs but they also knew you dont get very far in this day and age without a good education it was a bit of a dilemma for them anyway she got her student grant or loan or whatever they get so she had a bit of money of her own for the first time and in the holidays she usually got a job it gave her her first taste of independence what did she do with her money bought clothes mostly you should have seen her when she came back after her first year had all the latest styles whatever they were wearing at the moment it all changes far too quickly for me to keep up with it anyway she looked like any other rebellious young lass her age had her hair dyed all the colors of the rainbow rings through her ears and eyebrows looked awfully painful shed found her brave new world all right how did her parents react i dont know they never said anything in public i cant imagine they were pleased though i got the feeling they were ashamed of her did you hear any rows through the walls they never got angry against their religion i think they pleaded with her and tried to get her to switch to a course at manchester and come back home but shed changed too much by then it was too late shed had her taste of freedom and she wasnt about to give it up i cant say i blame her so the matter went unresolved i suppose so she spent that summer working at the local supermarket general floor washer and shelf stacker that sort of thing she was a bright lass and a hard worker and to do her justice even when she looked like a tearaway she didnt cause any trouble she was always polite so she just looked strange thats about all i think shed reacted against the religion too at least she didnt go to chapel with them anymore but kids do that dont they they do annie agreed i was talking to one of the firemen mr whitmore earlier i know george whitmore he was a friend of my bernards they used to enjoy a game of darts down at the king billy on a friday night he said they didnt see any need to investigate the fire thats right i cant see why they would thats why i was wondering what on earth you were doing here nobody would want to hurt the walkers mr whitmore said it was probably started by a cigarette left smoldering down the side of the sofa well that was a bit odd said mrs tattersall slowly being religious and all the way they were you see the walkers didnt smoke or drink but ill bet ruth did said annie clough looked a little the worse for wear after his night in the cell though the kind of suit he wore hardly showed a wrinkle he had chosen not to shave and the stubble along with the tan the gold and the elegant dress made him look slightly unreal like some sort of aging pop star his lawyer simon gallagher however who had no doubt spent the night in burgundy house eastvales poshest and priciest hotel had taken the opportunity to clean himself up a bit and now he looked every inch the highpriced solicitor he still had the twitchy perky manner of a habitual cokehead though and banks wondered if hed snorted up a couple of lines before the interview he didnt say a lot but he just couldnt sit still with annie in salford and winsome back inputting data into holmes banks got kevin templeton to attend the interview with him after the usual preliminaries banks began hope you had a comfortable night barry you dont give a rats arse what kind of night i had so why dont you cut the crap and get to the point clough looked at his watch according to this my twentyfour hours are up in about one hour and fortyfive minutes that right simon simon gallagher nodded or twitched we aim to please said banks anyway i dont know if youve heard but since we last talked chief constable riddle committed suicide well at least thats one thing you cant bang me up for then isnt it is that all youve got to say about it what do you expect i didnt know the man even people who did know riddle banks thought might show as little concern as clough banks himself hadnt liked the man and he didnt intend to be hypocritical about it now but the tragedy and despair of the act pierced his dislike to some extent nobody should be reduced to that were you putting pressure on him barry what do you mean i think you know what i mean putting pressure on him to become your man to do you the odd favor or two make sure we looked the other way when you set up your little scams in north yorkshire why would i want to do that you tell me i wouldnt but thats what your meeting was about wasnt it thats why he walked out before you really got started isnt it what were you using barry was it emily do you have photographs did you threaten him that you could take her back anytime you wanted clough sighed and rolled his eyes at gallagher i think youve already exhausted this line of questioning gallagher said as you are well aware my client could have had nothing to do with mr riddles unfortunate death even if it hadnt been suicide he has the best of all alibis he was in your cells your client might have been one of the chief factors that drove the chief constable over the edge you cant prove that said gallagher and even if you could it hardly constitutes an indictable offense stick to the facts chief inspector move on banks was loath to give up and move on but gallagher was probably right it would take a hell of a lot more than he had to persuade the cps to even look at the possibility of prosecuting someone for complicity in the suicide of another if banks remembered his criminal law correctly complicity could mean aiding abetting counseling or procuring anothers suicide and there was no evidence that clough even though he might have been trying to blackmail riddle had done any of those things he was simply the straw that broke the camels back banks moved on remember we were talking yesterday about charlie courage and andrew handley vaguely that both were killed by shotgun blasts and both were found in rural areas some distance from their homes i believe i asked what that had to do with me at the time and now im asking again just this said banks pausing and opening the file folder he had brought in with him while youve been enjoying our hospitality downstairs weve been very busy indeed and our forensics men have been able to match the tire tracks at the two scenes im impressed said clough raising an eyebrow the wonders of modern science theres even better to come on further investigation they were able to match the tracks found at the scene of the two murders to a cream citroën owned by a mr jamie gilbert one of your employees yes jamie you already know that and it also turns out that one of charlie courages neighbors recognized the photograph of jamie gilbert our officer showed her jamie was seen getting into a car with charlie courage around the time he disappeared anything to say they must be mistaken who your scientists this witness banks shook his head afraid not not only do the tires match but we were also able to find hair samples and minute traces of blood we believe belong to either charlie courage or andrew handley in the car jamie was careless he didnt clean it out thoroughly enough the samples are being checked for dna now i dont know what to say said clough im shocked stunned even and i thought i knew jamie evidently not anyway mr gilbert is in custody back in london at the moment hell no doubt be telling the interviewing officers down there exactly what happened jamie wont jamie wont what barry clough smiled i was just about to say that jamie wont be saying anything you dont know him as well as i do hes not the type but you said just now that you only thought you knew him that youre surprised hes a murderer an alleged murderer simon gallagher chipped in my apologies banks went on an alleged murderer you know what i mean do you have any idea why jamie gilbert would want to kill charlie courage and andrew handley none at all did he even know charlie courage i dont know who he hangs about with in his spare time but he works for you worked if you think im going to keep a murderer in my employ you must think im crazy hes fired as of now he worked for you at the time of the murders he was your chief enforcer and he did know andrew handley jamie was my administrative assistant i already told you that what did he administer for you punishment he handled my business affairs just exactly what might those be for crying out loud clough looked at gallagher cant you get him to stop this its like an old lp with the bloody needle stuck legitimate questions barry legitimate questions clough glared at gallagher who turned to banks get to the point quickly chief inspector were all running out of time and patience here not me said banks barry is it true you were fired as a roadie for bootlegging the bands live performances clough faltered clearly not expecting the question what the hell has that got to do with anything just answer my question please it was years ago there were no charges or anything but you do have a history in bootlegging it was a mistake well pirating is big business these days movies computer software games big business maybe not as big here as it is in the far east or eastern europe but big enough to provide maximum profits for minimum risks just the kind of business venture that interests you isnt it barry chief inspector sorry mr gallagher slip of the tongue banks could see kevin templeton trying to stifle his grin youve already admitted you know gregory manners havent you banks pressed on ive admitted no such thing mr manners has a conviction for smuggling customs and excise had their eyes on him for a while whats that got to do with me they had their eyes on you too well if theyd seen anything theyd have arrested me wouldnt they youre obviously a very careful man its odd though isnt it what is so many of your friends and employees being criminals jamie gilbert andrew handley gregory manners charlie courage i told you ive never heard of a gregory manners or a charlie courage of course not my mistake the others though like i said its hardly my responsibility what my employees get up to in their own time maybe criminals have more fun one might be forgiven for assuming that they were merely carrying out your orders assume what you want you cant prove anything id say if a man has one criminal employee that might be carelessness but two are we going anywhere with this chief inspector gallagher chipped in because if were not we can stop right here as they say in the vernacular either shit or get off the pot and you a welleducated man mr gallagher tuttut im appalled wash your mouth out as my mother would say clough stood up ive had enough of this sit down barry said banks you cant make me im free to go whenever sit down clough was so taken aback by bankss harsh tone that he subsided slowly into his chair again gallagher said nothing he looked as if he badly needed another couple of lines banks leaned forward and rested his arms on the table now let me tell you what i think happened barry you had a nice little earner going pirating software and games youd rent units in business parks all over the country for a while under phony company names flood the local markets using the same distribution setup youd organized for your smuggling business then youd move on like playing hopscotch always one step ahead of trading standards gregory manners ran the operation in the daleview business park and andrew handley oversaw the regional operation just my guess of course but andy wasnt seen around the place as much as mr manners was andy pandy got very pissed off at you perhaps because of the way you treated him like shit pushing emily into the room with him passing on your leftovers he decided in revenge to rip off the operation to do this he enlisted charlie courage night watchman and petty criminal charlie probably arranged for the move to northumbria and passed the details on to andy pandy who arranged a hijack killing the driver jonathan fearn a local wideboy recruited by charlie how am i doing so far clough sat with his arms folded a supercilious grin on his face its fascinating you should write detective fiction but you suspect a double cross you dont trust what you hear about charlie courage maybe you dont like strangers being brought in on things whatever you lean on gregory manners enough to know its not him which leaves andy pandy then you have jamie gilbert and another minder pick up charlie and ask him a few questions the hard way charlie never did have much of a stomach for violence and it doesnt take long before he spills the whole scam they take him for the long ride and blow him away then they do the same with andy pandy after theyve beaten the whereabouts of the stolen stock and multidisc copying machines from him and where are these machines then seeing as youre so clever barry gallagher cut in id strongly advise banks waved him down its all right mr gallagher ill answer barrys question andy pandy had a lockup in golders green and it was broken into shortly after he disappeared i think your lads also did that took back the stolen equipment my guess is that youve sold it by now and moved on to something else how am i doing so far clough contemplated his fingernails like i said its a fascinating story youve missed your vocation see simon theyve got nothing remember chief inspector said gallagher times running out shit or get off the pot banks paused scribbled a couple of meaningless notes in his file then got up and said to kevin templeton take mr clough downstairs to the custody sergeant kevin and have him charged with conspiracy to commit murder im sure mr gallagher will make sure everythings done according to pace regulations clough flushed you cant do this tell them simon tell them they cant do this ill deal with it barry said gallagher dont worry ill have you out in no time what do you mean youll have me out in no time out of where he means out of prison barry said banks and if you ask me i think hes being overly optimistic if truth be told said banks to annie over an afterwork pint in the queens arms that evening i think it was me being overly optimistic in thinking we can make any charges stick against clough annie sipped her pint and settled into her chair she looked around the pub was pretty quiet at that time in the evening most people were at home having dinner and watching the news occasionally a christmas shopper or two would come in with carrier bags from marks amp spencers tandys or wh smiths in the swainsdale centre across the square knock back a quick whiskey to warm the cockles and head out again christmas decorations hung across the ceiling the pubs dim light glowed in the polished wood and brass the dimpled coppertopped tables the sparkling glasses and the bottles arranged behind the bar cyril the landlord stood chatting to a regular the jukebox was mercifully silent and annie could hear the church choir collecting for a refugee relief fund singing away in a manger under the giant christmas tree outside poor kids she thought it was real brassmonkey weather out there they must be freezing you dont think theres much hope then she asked banks shrugged well set up a meeting with stafford oakes in the cps office but lets just say its pretty flimsy evidence so far what about the forensics ive never put much faith in tire tracks most people dont know goodyear from michelin but the blood might be something there if the lab doesnt lose the evidence what do you mean remember that fire at the wetherby lab a few years ago yes that was started to destroy evidence being kept there dont you think someone like clough is capable of something similar i hadnt thought of that what about the witness who saw jamie gilbert with courage easy meat oh dear indeed i have a terrible feeling that theyll both walk conspiracys always a bugger to prove and as for implicating him in riddles suicide that was pissing against the wind it was suicide then not much doubt about it i had a brief word with dr glendenning after he did the postmortem this afternoon no signs of a struggle no signs of restraint or drugs in the system hell run a full tox check of course just to be certain and the notes been checked by an expert its riddles handwriting no i think we can be pretty certain that jimmy riddle voluntarily sat in his car with the engine running we can also be damn certain that the business with emily and the pressure clough was putting on him were a big part of what drove him to it but we cant touch clough for that hes a slippery bastard all right anyway im getting more and more interested in ruth walker you think she killed emily i think she might have it never really made any sense to me that clough would have done it especially after he tried to blackmail riddle much as id have loved to put him away for it but ruth she certainly had the opportunity for a start she was off work poorly at the time emily was killed or so she says she could have driven up and back easily and the means she said she had a cold but i think her sniffle might have been caused by something else coke at a guess what about the strychnine though one of the leads im following up as far as i can piece it together her degrees in computers and information technology shes very bright got firstclass honors and walked straight from university into a good job she works for a computer software company one of the employees told me that they customdesign specific software systems for specific business applications you think she could be connected with cloughs pirating racket it is a connection that springs immediately to mind ill admit but no thats not it this isnt the sort of thing you could profitably pirate its tailormade for very specific business functions so where does it lead us this employee i talked to she thinks that ruths working on an inventorycontrol system for a large pharmaceutical company annie whistled i see what im trying to find out if i can get hold of the boss there is whether the job could possibly have given her access to controlled drugs such as strychnine and if theres any missing yes but it could have been such a small quantity it wouldnt be missed i dont know how tightly they control these things pretty tightly id say but if ruth really was working on inventory control she might have access to the inventory yes and she might also have been in a position to falsify data about quantities well just have to wait and see in the meantime theres another couple of things we need to follow up on banks lit a cigarette want something to eat annie shook her head ive got some leftover pasta at home pub foods not very appetizing to a vegetarian they do a nice salad sandwich im told i know ive had one a strip of wilted lettuce and a couple of slices of green tomato what next first off i want you to ask darren hirst the boy who was with emily the night she died for access to his cellphone records i just realized last night what was bothering me about the riddless phone records what emilys call to me the day before she died it wasnt listed she could have used a public box thats what i thought at first with the background noise and all but darren has a cell phone and she was out with him and the gang that night its my bet she used his phone and that she also used it to talk to whoever she set up the drug buy with its hardly likely shed risk using her home phone for something like that what id like to know is whether she used darrens phone to call ruth close to the time of her murder that should be easy enough to find out theres another thing i also phoned craig newton emilys exboyfriend down in stony stratford and when i went to talk to him i remember noticing some photographs of emily that bore a strong resemblance to the one that appeared in the newspaper yesterday you think he was behind the story craig no but he confirmed that ruth also had prints of the photos because theyd been taken at a party theyd all attended one of cloughs parties not this time no before clough the point is though that ruth could have supplied the newspaper with the photograph and the hints about clough and jimmy riddle but how could she know ive no idea its all speculation so far she obviously knew about emily and clough probably knew clough was a bit of a gangster if she had discovered that rosalind riddle was her birth mother and was blackmailing her over it its no great leap of imagination to assume that she knew jimmy riddle was chief constable i suppose not but why to cause trouble for the riddles she was already blackmailing rosalind remember perhaps after emilys murder rosalind refused to pay up any more are we going to talk to ruth again soon definitely up here this time ill have her brought up tomorrow i hope well have answers to some of our questions before she arrives theres one other thing whats that we need to talk to the person who saw emily get into the car at the red lion so far ive been thinking that a lightcolored car driven by someone with short blond hair probably meant jamie gilbert and now ruth walker she drives a cream car ive seen it and shed bleached her hair blond the second time i saw her another drink better not annie said ive got a long drive home you should be careful too youre going home dont look so disappointed weve got a busy day tomorrow youre right but you cant blame me for showing a little disappointment annie smiled id be pissed off if you hadnt anyway after last night im worn out im surprised youre not tired too its been a long day thats true banks swirled the last quarter of his pint around the bottom of his glass do you think ruth killed her adoptive parents very unlikely mind you i think she was definitely responsible for the cigarette end that started the fire her parents didnt smoke or drink they were good methodists ruth went a bit wild when she got to university maybe shed had a few drinks and didnt put it out properly it doesnt sound as if she made any attempt to save them who knows what happened in there what she could or couldnt have done she hurt herself badly getting out yes but she lived were postmortems performed on the parents annie nodded i checked no cause for suspicion in both cases death was due to smoke inhalation just as with chief constable riddle there were no signs that they were restrained in any way or drugged and no indication that any obstacles had been placed in the way of their getting out they were old and slow thats all there is to it makes you wonder though doesnt it about what oh life the universe everything annie slapped his arm laughed and stood up im off before you start getting really philosophical what about you one more cigarette then ive got a couple more things to do back at the office see you tomorrow then see you annie walked out into the cold night air and paused for a while listening to the choir singing silent night through chattering teeth then she dropped a few coins in the collection box and hurried off to her car before she changed her mind about banks offer ruth walker arrived with her police escort shortly after lunch the following day wearing baggy jeans and a shapeless mauve sweatshirt with sleeves that fell long past her hands she looked both nervous and defiant as she took her seat in the gloomy interview room she held her head high but her eyes were all over the place everywhere but on the person speaking to her a sprinkling of acne lay over her pale cheeks and her skin looked pasty and dry unlike barry clough who was now back at his little venice villa ruth didnt have an expensive lawyer in tow they had offered to bring in a duty solicitor for her but she said she didnt need anyone banks set the tape recorders going gave details of the session and began annie sat beside him he had the answers to most of his previous days questions including two calls from darrens mobile only one of which had been to banks in a buff folder on the desk in front of him and he didnt like the story they told one bit i suppose you know why youre here dont you ruth banks began ruth stared at a squashed fly high on the opposite wall weve been doing a bit of digging not really the season for that is it ruth said this isnt a joking matter banks said so drop it ruth it doesnt suit you whatever youve told me a lot of lies lies pork pies theyre what ive been living what else have i got to tell you its my job to try and sort out a few truths lets start with the fire whats that got to do with it with what with why im here i told you im trying to get at some truths there was a fire i woke up and my room was full of smoke i had to jump out of the window i broke my ankle really badly you might have noticed ive still got a limp what else can you tell us about the fire whats to tell it was an accident i couldnt walk for weeks what caused the fire they said it was a cigarette it cant have been mine i put it out i remember whose was it then ruth shrugged dunno it wasnt mine ruth it must have been your cigarette your parents died in that fire and all you can think about is your broken ankle whats wrong with this picture you tell me and they werent my parents everyone says i was the lucky one so i suppose they must be right did you feel lucky do you feel lucky today punk sorry bad joke again blame it on being deprived of humor throughout my childhood and adolescence were you deprived of humor it wasnt part of the deal what deal you know the one where youre not supposed to dance sing laugh cry love fuck the religious deal i sometimes think the reason they had to adopt a child was that they thought it was a sin to do what they had to do to produce one naturally how did you feel toward your parents i told you they werent my parents they were my adoptive parents believe me it does make a difference do you know they never even told me i was adopted how did you find out the papers but surely they must have been destroyed by the fire they were kept in a safety deposit box at the bank i only found out after they died and i had to open it thats where they kept me in a box but they were the only parents who brought you up oh yes everyone says they were decent honest godfearing folk salt of the earth what do you say they were stupid imbeciles too brainwashed to make their own decisions about anything they were scared of everything except the chapel their bodies the world beyond the street their lives they inflicted all that on me and more they made my life miserable made me a laughingstock at school i had no friends i had no one to talk to they didnt like me hanging around with the other kids they said god ought to be enough of a friend for anyone what do you expect me to say about them were you glad they died yes ruths left hand shot out of the end of her sleeve and scratched the side of her nose her grubby fingernails were bitten to the quick what about your birth mother ros i call her that you know its a bit late to be calling her mother dont you think and mrs riddle seems just a wee bit too formal how did you find her the edges of ruths lips curled in an ugly smirk you ought to know that if youve done so much digging my degrees in information technology you can find out anything these days if you know where to look the telephone directory is usually pretty reliable you know a good place to start but theres the internet too lots of information out on that superhighway where did you begin with the registrar generals office theyll let you see your original birth certificate if you ask them nicely from there its pretty easy what did the birth certificate tell you that i was born at seventythree launceston terrace tiverton on the twentythird of february what else ruth stared at the walls again looking bored that my mother was rosalind gorwyn and that there was a blank space where my fathers name was supposed to be what did you do next i went to seventythree launceston terrace tiverton and found an elderly couple by the name of gorwyn living there its not a very common name even in devon i knew they couldnt be my real parents they were too old so i pushed them a bit and found out they were her aunt and uncle and that she had stayed with them while she had the baby me hid away from the world while she gave birth to me what else did they tell you that my mother had married a man called jeremiah archibald riddle an important policeman that she was a solicitor now and they lived in north yorkshire by then theyd have told me anything to get rid of me after that it was really easy a child could have found them did you speak to rosalinds parents at all not right at first but i found out that theyd retired to barnstaple he was a vicar which probably explains why my mother let me live what do you mean annie asked ruth looked at her as if seeing her for the first time she didnt seem to mind what she saw well either way i didnt have much of a chance did i she said she couldve just got rid of me had an abortion thats what id have done in her place then i would never have existed at all and none of this would have happened or she could have kept me then id have been an unwanted baby with a single mother and your chief constable would never have married her id probably have been brought up in some sort of punk commune or something with people shooting heroin all around my cot getting high and forgetting me so id have crawled to the edge of the stairs and fallen over and died anyway so i imagine she thought putting me up for adoption was a better choice for her pity it didnt turn out that way for me ive been told the adoption people are pretty good very strict in their standards but some of us slip through the cracks like i said everyone thought the walkers were the salt of the earth that they would make wonderful parents but the lord hadnt seen fit to bless them with issue youd think theyd take that as a sign wouldnt you banks and annie paused to take in what she said then banks picked up the questioning again you went to rosalinds law office yes i thought it would be best that way turned out i was right ruth gave a mean little giggle she was scared shitless id say something to her husband thought hed turf her out on her arse if he found out so you blackmailed her ruth slammed her fist onto the desk it was only my due i only asked for my due id had nothing from her in all those years nothing and id had fat little but misery from the bloody walkers do you know they once made me wear an old pair of shoes that were so small and tight that my toenails came off and my shoes were full of blood when i got home from school that was what your bloody saltoftheearth walkers were like i had a right to something from ros she owed me why should she get it all just because she was born a few years later than me on the right side of the blanket answer me that one it should all have been mine but she tossed me away it was only my due the interview room was starting to feel very claustrophobic banks couldnt quite sort out the shes half the time it seemed as if ruth was referring to rosalind the rest to emily were you abused by your adoptive parents ruth ruth gave a harsh laugh abused thats a good one you at least have to care about someone to abuse them no i wasnt abused not in the way you mean it i suppose theres more than one kind of abuse though i mean id call being made to wear those shoes until my toes bled abuse wouldnt you mostly they were just cold ironic they should die by fire isnt it again banks felt that shiver creep up his spine he saw annie frowning ruth paid them no attention did you see rosalind often banks asked not that often when you needed something i only wanted my due what about emily how did you feel toward her id be a liar if i said i liked her but you befriended her took her in at least i assume thats how it happened and you didnt just meet her by accident near the station is that right ruth nodded when i met her the once in ross office i made a point of finding out where she went to school she was a boarding student so i phoned her there and visited her when she started to trust me when we began to be friends she used to call me a lot from school too shed complain about her parents how strict they were i had to laugh i mean shed complain to me about that i told her that after she was sixteen she could do what she wanted it was near the end of the school year and shed had her birthday so i said why didnt she come and stay with me in london for a while if she wanted you mean you lured her to london you encouraged her to leave home i think lured is too strong a word i had no trouble getting her there she was only too pleased to come but you didnt tell her parents where she was why should i it was her business and she didnt want them to know do you think rosalind knew i doubt it she didnt know how close me and emily had become i dont think she even knew where i lived didnt bother to ask thats how interested in me she was after all those years did you introduce emily to craig newton banks asked ruths face clouded i thought he was my friend i thought he loved me but he was just like all the rest did it hurt you when she took up with craig ruth shot him a tortured glance what do you think is that why you killed her i didnt kill her come on ruth weve got the evidence we know you might as well tell us how it happened im sure there were extenuating circumstances what about barry clough what part did he play in all this for example ruths eyes narrowed i wondered when youd get around to him what do you know about him plenty like what ruth paused a minute and rubbed her fist over the top of her thigh as if she had an itch i bet its something you dont know clever clogs maybe it is why dont you tell me they didnt name my father on the birth certificate as i told you but i found out thats who it was barry clough my father ruth flopped back in her chair and stared at the ceiling im tired and i want something to eat you have to give me something to eat dont you i dont know about you annie banks said when ruth was back in her cell eating her canteen beefburger and chips but i could do with a breath of fresh air my feelings exactly they left the station and walked across the market square then they took the narrow cobbled castle wynde past the bare formal gardens down to the riverside it was a crisp cold winter day and their breaths plumed as they walked crunching over puddles the hill went down to the river steeply with small limestone cottages lining both sides and the cobbles were slippery banks could feel the icy wind blowing up from the river it was just what he needed to get the smell of the interview room out of his system what do you make of all that then annie asked when they were halfway down banks didnt know what to make of ruths bombshell he didnt even know if it was true after all she had told plenty of lies already but why lie about something like that it raises more questions than it answers he said such as did anyone else know and did it have anything to do with emilys murder for a start if rosalind riddle knew she kept it well hidden i hadnt thought her that good an actress do you think ruth killed emily if she didnt she knows what happened she knows who did shes a part of it im certain of that they arrived at the river and paused for a while by the waisthigh stone wall that ran along its bank the falls rushed and foamed along the shallows huge mosscovered slabs of ancient rock jutting out here and there the result of a geological fault millions of years ago banks could feel the icy spray on his cheeks and in his hair if the cold spell continued for much longer even the falls would freeze above them the dark mass of the ruined castle keep and towers lay heavy against a pewter sky it was a blackandwhite world or like the world of a blackandwhite photograph with all its subtle variations of gray annie slipped her arm in his it was a good feeling the only good feeling hed had that morning they walked along the riverside path past the terraced gardens no more than a small park dotted with trees to their left there werent many people around just a young couple walking their airedale and an old age pensioner in a flat cap taking his daily constitutional banks had often considered buying a flat cap himself all these years in yorkshire and he still didnt have one but he didnt like wearing hats even in winter across the river to the right bare trees lined the opposite bank beyond them banks could make out the shapes of the large houses facing the green beyond which lay the notorious east side estate which pretty much kept the eastvale police in business yearround in one of those big houses lived jenny fuller a psychologist banks had worked with on a number of cases a friend too and a onetime potential lover jenny had been polite but cool toward him ever since he stood her up on a date three months ago through no fault of his own it was more than just that though it was as if jenny had put too much of herself on the line exposed her feelings for him and the seeming rejection had grazed a raw nerve made her curl in on herself she was on the rebound from a sour relationship with an american professor at the time banks already knew so she was hurting to start with he wished he could do something to bridge the distance rekindle the friendship it had been important to him over the years but there was annie too banks was no expert but he knew enough of women to realize that annie wouldnt appreciate his spending time with someone other than her now that he felt free from his marriage sandra wants a divorce he suddenly said to annie he felt her arm stiffen in his but she didnt remove it first good sign this was one thing he hadnt told her the other night one thing he had found too difficult to put into words it still was but he knew he would have to try if he and annie were to go any further it might put her more at ease or it might scare her off that was the risk he would have to take im sorry she said without looking at him no i didnt mean it like that i mean im glad annie slowed down and turned slowly to face him youre what they started walking again and he tried to explain to her what he had felt in london after he first heard the news he wasnt sure whether he did a good job or not but annie nodded here and there and seemed to contemplate what hed said after hed finished finally she said thats all right then it is time to let go second good sign i suppose so does it hurt not anymore oh there are memories always will be and some residual feelings anger disappointment whatever but no it doesnt hurt in fact i feel better than i have in years good look do you fancy coming over to the cottage for christmas dinner tracy will be there just the three of us i cant really im sorry alan but i always go home for christmas ray would never forgive me if i missed it i understand annie gave his arm a little squeeze i mean it alan its not an excuse id love to meet tracy maybe some other time banks knew she was telling the truth annie wasnt a very good liar as he had discovered lying made her all grumpy and withdrawn well have a drink together sometime then he said do you think shell hate me why should she annie smiled sometimes you can be pretty damn thick when it comes to women alan banks im not being thick banks said mothers daughters fathers it can all get pretty complicated i know that but tracys not a hater i know my daughter i wouldnt expect her to rush up to you and hug you no doubt shell be a little hesitant checking you out as they say but shes not a hater and she doesnt see me as the villain in all this shes got a good head on her shoulders unlike ruth walker indeed did you feel the atmosphere in that room annie nodded i felt something like it before the times i talked to her in london banks said but it wasnt as powerful i think its because she senses shes near the end shes given up shes unraveling you think so yes i think she wants us to know it all now so we can see her point of view so we can understand her forgive her annie shook her head i dont think she wants forgiveness alan at least not the way im reading her i dont think she sees theres anything to forgive perhaps not i should have known should have known what that something was wrong there but youve only just found out ruth was emilys halfsister how could you have known that i dont know i should have dug deeper sooner why do you have to take the burden on yourself like this why is everything your fault why do you think if you only acted differently you could prevent people being killed banks stopped and looked out over the swirling river it was the color of a pint of bitter an intruder in the blackandwhite world do i you know you do banks lit a cigarette it must be something to do with graham marshall graham marshall whos he a boy at school i wont say a friend because i didnt know him very well he was a quiet kid bright shy what happened one day he simply disappeared what happened nobody knows he was never found dead or alive what did the police think the general consensus was that hed been abducted by a child molester whod murdered him after hed had his way this would probably have been around the time of the moors murders though in a different part of the country so people were especially sensitive to the disappearance of children thats sad annie rested her elbows on the wall beside banks but i still dont see what its got to do with you about three or four months before graham marshalls disappearance i was playing with some friends down by the river we were throwing stones in just having a bit of harmless fun the way kids do as he spoke banks remembered the day vividly it was spitting and the raindrops pitted the murky water a man approached along the riverbank all banks could remember now was that he was tall but then every adult was tall to him then and thin with greasy dark hair and a rough pockmarked complexion banks smiled and politely paused before dropping in a large stone one he had to hold in both hands to let the stranger pass by without splashing him the next thing he knew the man had grabbed him by the arms and was pushing him toward the river the stone forgotten at their feet he could smell beer on the mans breath the same smell he remembered from his father and something else sweat a wetdog smell body odor like the smell of his socks after a long rugby game as he struggled for his life he called out and looked around for his friends but they were running down to the gap in the fence where they had got in the struggle seemed to go on forever banks managed to wedge his heels at the edge of the riverbank and push back with all his might but the grass was wet and the soil under it was fast turning to mud he didnt think he could keep his grip much longer his smallness and wiriness were his only advantages he knew and he wriggled as hard as an eel to slip out of the mans strong grasp he knew that if he didnt escape he would drown he tried to bite the mans arm but all he got was a mouthful of viletasting cloth so he gave up the man was breathing hard now as if the effort was becoming too much for him banks drew on his last reserves of energy and wriggled as hard and fast as he could he managed to get one arm free the man held him by the other arm and punched him at the side of his right eye he felt something sharp like a ring cut his skin he flinched with pain and pulled away succeeding in freeing his other arm he didnt wait to see if he was being pursued but ran like the clappers to the hole in the fence only when he caught up with his friends at the edge of the park did he dare risk looking back nobody in sight his friends seemed sheepish as they asked him how he was but he toughed it out no problem inside though he was terribly shaken they made a pact not to say anything none of them was supposed to be playing down by the river in the first place their parents said it was dangerous banks didnt dare tell his parents what had happened explaining the cut by his eye by saying he had fallen and cut it on a piece of glass and he had never relied on anyone to help him out of trouble again in his life i was wrong i should have told my parents annie they would have made me report it to the police and they might have caught him before he did any more harm there was a dangerous man out there and my fear and shame left him free to do as he pleased you blamed yourself for what happened to graham marshall for the acts of a child molester banks turned away from the beercolored water to face annie when he went missing all i could think of was the tall man with the greasy dark hair and the body odor banks shivered sometimes he still woke in the night gagging on the taste of the dirty cloth of the mans sleeve and in the dream when he looked at the river it was full of dead boys all floating in the same direction in perfectly matched rows and graham marshall was the only one he recognized so much guilt but you dont know that it was the same man doesnt matter i still took the guilt on myself id been attacked by an older man possibly a pervert and i didnt report it then a boy was abducted possibly by a pervert of course i blamed myself and i certainly couldnt say anything about it later annie put her hand on his arm so you made a mistake so you should have reported it you cant spend your life sulking over all the mistakes youve made youd never bother getting out of bed in the morning banks smiled youre right i try not to let it get me down too much its only when something like this happens something i think i could have prevented annie started walking again youre not god she said over her shoulder you cant change the way things are banks flicked his cigarette in the river and followed her annie was right he knew he only wished he could feel better about it they turned left at the main road by the preroman site a sort of barrow where ancient graves had been discovered and then left again back toward the station toward whatever other horrors ruth walker had in store for them banks started the tape recorders again all right ruth he said youve had some food and rest ready to talk to us again ruth nodded and retracted her hands deep into the sleeves of her sweatshirt for the record banks said ms walker nodded to indicate that she is ready to resume the interview ruth stared down at her lap before the break ruth you told us that barry clough is your father im sure you know that gives rise to a lot more questions go ahead first of all is it true of course it is why should i lie about it youve lied before remember right at the beginning you told me your life has been a lie this is true hes my father you can check how did you find out about this if it wasnt on the birth certificate i talked to ross parents and they told you just like that it wasnt as easy as that how easy was it then it was a matter of finding out what name he was using now what do you mean all they could tell me was that ros got herself made pregnant by some punk he hung around with bands worked as a roadie played bass a bit something like that ros had told them his name but he was long gone by the time she even found out she was pregnant he was in america they told me and she didnt want anything to do with him anyway neither did her parents everybody just did their best to forget him and it seems as if that was pretty easy what was his name ruth laughed you know what they were like back then all using silly names thinking they sounded tough rat scabies sid vicious johnny rotten i remember said banks well this bloke was going by the name of mal licious i ask you mal licious what an apt name for barry clough banks thought so nobody knew his real name ross parents and uncle and aunt didnt did you ask rosalind herself yes and she didnt know either mal licious was all he went by she just called him mal seems she hadnt known him that well i think it was a onenight stand she didnt really want to talk about it how did you find out then ruth shifted in her chair easy information technology i know a bit about the music scene ive been to a lot of clubs and raves and stuff and craig had a few contacts hed taken band photos that sort of thing i asked around it seemed a logical way to start there was always a chance that this mal licious was still on the scene somewhere a lot of these people never grow up look at rod stewart for christs sake clough was a pretty wellknown name on the scene partly because of his trendy bar and partly because of the bands he promoted there were still people around whod known him way back and someone told me he used to be called mal licious thought it was a bit of a laugh well there cant have been two of them can there stands to reason indeed it did thought banks bright girl or woman a lot of things were starting to make sense now so none of what happened since emily went to london was coincidence then he said what do you mean emily shacking up with barry clough clough finding out about riddle the article in the newspaper linking them together a look of triumph filled ruths eyes no she said none of it was coincidence it was all me i set things in motion beyond that they took on a life of their own i soon found out that clough liked young girls and it wasnt hard to get an invitation to one of his parties what happened next was up to nature not me it really pissed off craig did you ever approach clough hes a wealthy man wealthier than rosalind i should imagine ruth frowned at him its not all about money you know no i didnt approach him what was he going to say probably didnt even remember ross name let alone that hed shagged her they were probably stoned out of their minds did you tell rosalind about emily and clough no why on earth not he was her banks had to pause and think for a moment no matter how terrible it seemed for rosalinds daughter to be sleeping with a man her mother had slept with and whose child she had given birth to emily wasnt any relation to clough whatsoever emily was your halfsister was all he could manage ruth smiled information management knowledge is power as im sure you know if you use it only a little at a time it can go a long way i might have had a use for that information eventually but i was enjoying myself plenty with what i already had i think if id told ros about them everything would have come tumbling down and it wasnt time for that yet youre damn right the whole house of cards would have come tumbling down banks thought before he could respond annie eased in you said you were enjoying yourself ruth in what way ruth faced her for a moment before her eyes went off in another direction why shouldnt i enjoy myself ive had little enough fun in my life why not have a bit for a change fun repeated annie ruth two people have died because of all this emily and her father a familys been torn apart and you think its fun i didnt mean to kill her annie glanced at banks and indicated he should pick up the thread it was the first hint of a confession theyd heard from ruth so far banks didnt want to lose her now but at the same time he wanted no problems over pace were heading into dangerous ground ruth he said im telling you again that youre entitled to have a solicitor present and im asking you if you want us to provide one for you ive told you before ruth shouted directly into the microphone i dont want any fucking solicitor is that clear enough for you itll do said banks let me get this straight then you discovered that barry clough was your father and you didnt tell either him or rosalind this am i right yes did you tell emily of course not but you introduced them at a party that was all i needed to do ruths eyes shone that was the beauty of it you see i knew clough liked young girls and you didnt have to talk to emily for long before you found out what a twisted little electra complex she had she wanted to fuck her daddy well i couldnt arrange that but at least i could give her a chance to fuck mine it was perfect why because i was the only one who knew the truth the joke was on them on someone else for a change not on me what about barry clough and emilys father that was just a bonus i know a young reporter it was a big story probably made his career i just gave him one of those photos of emily all dressed up for a party and i told him that she was fucking barry clough and her father was a chief constable he was off to yorkshire like a shot did the rest of the footwork himself what about barry clough after emily had left did you tell him who she was where she lived who her father was yes i thought it would probably interest him he struck me as the kind of man who liked to own others i just thought it would be interesting to put the two of them together when neither of them knew how close they really were so he doesnt know that youre his daughter or that emilys your halfsister of course not it wasnt time to go that far yet again why they all thought they were so cool so beautiful so powerful so in control but all the time it was me pulling the strings me they were just running around like headless chickens and this amused you yes im not mad if thats what youre thinking im not looking to get off on some insanity plea or anything like that i would like a little recognition for all the work i put in though what about emily you told her she was your halfsister didnt you i had to otherwise she would never have trusted me or come to live with me shed have thought i was after her or something this way it made more sense it was our little secret banks paused before going on knowing he had reached a crucial stage ruth we know you were working for a pharmaceutical company and had access to strychnine cocaines easy enough to get did you give emily the lethal mixture it wasnt meant to be lethal what did you intend it to do to her give her a scare give her the jitters i didnt mean for it to kill her honest im not a murderer what are you then ruth tugged at a frayed edge on her sweatshirt maybe ive got some problems people dont like me but im not a murderer there were tears in her eyes all right ruth what happened wed talked on the telephone a few times and she kept saying she was off the stuff first i just wanted to see if i could get her back on again i mean people say all sorts of things dont they like theyve given up smoking but if you offer them a cigarette if you put just a little temptation their way and thats what you did yes dangled a carrot well a gram of coke actually she could probably have scored some up north if shed asked around but that was a bit too close to her fathers territory i mean you never know if your dealer is an undercover cop do you i even offered to deliver it said i had to visit some relatives in durham and id stop by on the way what did she say she said shed ring me back i knew she was thinking seriously about it anyway the day before i was working late she phoned me at work on some lads mobile and said she was getting bored and she wouldnt mind some for the next day she was going clubbing with some mates i knew i could get a couple of days off say i had a cold or something anyway just after i talked to her and said id see her the next day i had to go into the controlled area to do some product coding and thats when i got the idea of the strychnine i didnt know how much to put in id heard they sometimes used it as a base in some street drugs and it makes your jaw and your neck stiff i just wanted to give her a scare thats all it was only a little bit i didnt think it was enough to kill her but it might make her twitch a bit in public maybe even puke and piss herself that was what you wanted to do to her humiliate her in public it was a start even though you wouldnt be there to witness it but id know wouldnt i being there would be too dangerous dont you see the point i mean i didnt actually see her doing it but i knew she was fucking my father if you have a bit of imagination you can amuse yourself easily enough it has to be more than that ruth annie chipped in ruth looked away why it just does why did you hate emily so much what did she ever do to you she had my life didnt she what should have been mine why did you want her to suffer because she had it all she took craig from me craig was never with you that way banks said picking up on annies rhythm he was never your lover ruth jutted her chin out thats what he says now why should he lie hes against me she poisoned him against me thats not enough ruth annie chimed in again ruth gave her a sharp glance what do you want blood no that seems to be what you wanted we want some answers it was all so bloody easy for her everything just fell into her lap craig barry clough my own father for christs sake was running his hands over her thighs ten minutes after they met but that was part of your plan you said annie went on you cant always arrange things so they dont hurt you at least just a little bit she got everything she wanted just like that then why did she want to run away from home ruth uh what do you mean if everything was so perfect in emilys life why did she want to run away from her parents they wouldnt let her do what she wanted they were strict like yours nowhere near as bad as mine you dont know the half of it then why didnt you sympathize with her i did at first then she just she got everything she wanted craig started ignoring me even emily deserted me banks took over again why did you kill her ruth ruth didnt know whom to look at she looked at the squashed fly again i didnt i didnt mean to kill her but you did kill her banks pressed on why ruth paused and her face seemed to go through the kind of contortions as emilys must have when the strychnine hit why did you kill her ruth banks persisted his voice hardly above a whisper why because they took her back ruth blurted out after all that happened after everything she did to them she broke their hearts and they took her back she threw me out but she took her back they took her back they took her back ruth started crying fat tears rolling down her acned cheeks there was nothing more to say banks called in the uniformed officers to take ruth back to her cell now it was time to charge her and bring on the lawyers banks drove out to the old mill that night with a heavy heart he knew he had to be the one to tell rosalind what had happened what ruth had done just as he had had to break the news about emilys murder but it wasnt a task he cherished the lights were on in the front room he parked out front glancing toward the garage as he pulled up his collar against the wind and rain and rang the doorbell rosalind answered and invited him in she was wearing a short skirt and a cashmere jumper he followed her into the living room her legs looked good and it didnt seem as if she was wearing any tights he thought he noticed something different about the smell of the place but he dismissed it there were far more serious matters on his mind drink rosalind asked small whiskey please you might as well have a large one i dont like the stuff and theres no one else to drink it i have to drive she raised her eyebrow as she poured really really christ banks thought she was flirting he would have to tread carefully he accepted the crystal glass and sat down in the only uncovered armchair the room was as sterile as ever and a couple of packing crates sat on the floor the baby grand was covered by a white sheet as was most of the other furniture he took a sip of whiskey it was glenfiddich not one of his favorites at the moment though anything would do i was just doing some packing rosalind said do you know how remarkably little i have to show for all these years she poured herself a large gin and tonic clearly not her first of the evening pulled a sheet off one of the armchairs and sat down opposite banks as she did so he caught a glimpse of black silk between her legs he looked away where are you going he asked first thats a start im going down to barnstaple after the funeral to be with benjamin well be staying with my parents for a while i cant stand hanging about up here any longer i feel like some crazy old woman all alone in a gothic mansion its too big to be here alone in ive even started talking to the furniture and the creaks in the woodwork banks smiled and then after barnstaple i dont know ill have to reinvent myself wont i i rather fancy the coast a little devon fishing village for example i can become the mysterious woman who paces the widows walk in a long black cloak that was lyme regis banks said the french lieutenants woman i know i saw the film but this is my version what about your job thats not important it never has been jerrys was the only important career in the family and now thats gone none of it really matters and benjamin he can walk with me it would make me more mysterious im sorry i dont mean to be flippant its just she ran her hand across her brow ive probably had too much to drink she frowned why are you here ive got something to tell you her eyes widened have you caught him emilys killer banks swallowed this was going to be harder than he had imagined yes he said weve got a confession clough that was another bridge hed have to cross mal licious no not clough he leaned forward and cupped his drink in both hands staring into the pale liquid and catching a whiff of it look theres no easy way to say this what it was ruth ruth but she cant i mean she confessed she said she didnt mean to kill emily just to give her a scare is that true i honestly dont know shes contradicted herself quite a bit ruth rosalind fell silent and banks let it stretch wind lashed the rain against the windowpanes the way it had the first night he came to the riddle house it seemed like years ago do you want to hear what happened banks asked rosalind looked at him there was fear in her large blue eyes i suppose id better she said look do smoke if you want to i know youre a smoker its all right suit yourself rosalind got up a little unsteadily and pulled a packet of dunhills and a box of matches from her handbag she lit up refreshed her gin and tonic and sat down again i didnt know you smoked said banks i didnt not for twenty years but ive started again why why not banks lit up too its bad for you sos life there was no answer to that slowly banks told her the whole story about ruth walkers twisted private campaign of hatred and revenge against the riddle family first he told her about ruths lessthanperfect life with the overzealous walkers and about the fire that killed them then he told her how ruth had discovered that barry clough was her father and had hooked him up with emily out of spite then put the tabloid on the scent of a scandal and he told her how ruth arranged to meet emily and give her the poisoned cocaine how she didnt even need to be there that it was enough for her simply to imagine emilys pain and shame as she humiliated herself as he spoke what little color there had been left rosalind riddles face and her eyes filled with tears they didnt fall just gathered there at the rims waiting magnifying her despair rosalind left her drink and her cigarette untouched as she listened a long column of ash gathered and fell onto the hardwood floor when a slight tremor passed through her fingers when banks had finished rosalind sat in silence for a while taking it all in digesting it as best she could shaking her head slowly as if disagreeing with some inner voice then she knocked back the rest of her drink and whispered but why why did she do it can you answer me that one shes ill thats no reason why why did she do it why did she hate us so much didnt i do my best for her i didnt have an abortion i gave her life how the hell was i to know her adoptive parents would turn out to be religious fanatics you werent so why does she blame me ruths last words still echoed in bankss mind from that afternoon because they took her back she broke their hearts and they took her back because ruth sees everything from her own point of view and only that he said all she knows is how things affect her how things hurt her how she was deprived in her way of looking at the world everything was either done for her or against her mostly it was against her she doesnt know any different doesnt recognize peoples normal feelings rosalind laughed harshly my daughter the psychopath no no i dont think so not as simple as that she enjoyed exercising power over people inflicting pain yes but she didnt have the detachment of a psychopath she was obsessed yes but not psychopathic and she knows the difference between right and wrong youd have to ask a psychiatrist of course but thats my opinion rosalind got up and fixed herself another drink she offered banks one but he refused he still had a quarter inch in the bottom of his glass and that would do him nicely will she be put in a mental hospital rosalind asked shell be sent for psychiatric evaluation for what its worth theyll determine whats best done with her therell be a trial prison im afraid so rosalind shook her head emilys dead jerrys dead ruths a murderer before emily died she lived with the man who left me pregnant with ruth more than twenty years ago then i find out that my daughter my abandoned daughter ruth led her into it on purpose just to humiliate us all in her eyes so that she could be the only one to know we were all living a lie then she killed her i had two daughters and one murdered the other how do you expect me to put all that together how can i possibly make sense of it all she took a long sip of gin and tonic banks shook his head i dont know in time perhaps remember the first time we met rosalind said crossing her long legs and leaning back in her chair so that a smooth white stretch of thigh showed her voice was a little slurred yes i was obnoxious wasnt i you were upset no thats not it at all i was obnoxious jerry was upset if anything i was annoyed irritated by emilys irresponsible behavior worried what impact it might have on jerrys political ambitions on my future i didnt want emily back i couldnt handle her you wanted to protect the world youd made and what a world that was all style and no substance all glitter and no gold she waved her arm in a gesture at the room and spilled some gin and tonic on her jumper she didnt bother to wipe it off all this its strange but i was thinking about it when you arrived while i was packing funny it doesnt mean very much now none of it does you were right to despise me i didnt despise you yes you did admit it maybe i resented you a little and now now do you despise me now resent me no why not im the same person no youre not how profound but youre right im not all the money the status the power the thrill of political ambition the whiff of westminster it all used to mean so much it means nothing now less than nothing dust what does have meaning for you now rosalind paused sipped some more gin and tonic and stared at him her eyes slightly unfocused outside the wind continued to howl and rain lashed against the windowpanes nothing she whispered not yet i have to find out but i wont give up until i do im not like jerry she got unsteadily to her feet stay and have another drink with me no really i must be going please where do you have to go to thats so important who do you have to go to she had a point there was annie of course but he wouldnt be going to annie so late another small drink couldnt do any harm all right the drink when it came wasnt small but he didnt have to drink all of it he told himself im sorry theres no music rosalind said we never did have music in the house i remember your little cottage how cozy it is with the fire the music playing maybe ill find somewhere like that she looked around bleakly there was nothing like that here banks wanted to point out the grand piano but he had a feeling it was just for show emily had been forced to take piano lessons he remembered because it was part and parcel of the riddle lifestyle along with the pony the proper schools and the rest some people managed to be happy with those things for their entire lives then there were people like rosalind who caught tragedys wandering eye and got to watch it all come toppling down around them i should never have put her up for adoption what else could you do i could have had an abortion and then emilys killer would never have been born if we all knew the consequences of every decision we made wed probably never make any said banks besides it wasnt your fault that you had to give ruth up for adoption your parents played a part in that does that make them responsible for emilys death too he shook his head it doesnt make any sense rosalind you were young you couldnt have cared for a child properly especially without the fathers help you thought she would have a better life it wasnt your fault that the adoption agency thought they had found ruth a home with decent people who turned out to be strict religious types and it wasnt even the walkerss fault that ruth turned out the way she did im sure they did their best in many ways from what ive gathered they werent intentionally cruel just thoughtless and strict and cold no you can keep on assigning blame here there and everywhere but when it comes right down to it were responsible for what we do ourselves rosalind stubbed out her cigarette and tossed back the rest of her drink oh youre right i know itll pass everythings just too overwhelming at the moment i cant seem to take it all in she went to refill her glass and bumped her hip against the corner of the cocktail cabinet glasses and bottles rattled id really better be going banks said its getting late rosalind turned and walked toward him swaying a little no you cant go yet i dont want to be alone i cant help you anymore said banks rosalind pouted please theres nothing more i can do there must be youre a nice man youve been good to me youre the only person who has banks walked toward the front door and opened it he felt the cold wind around his hands and bare head rosalind leaned against the wall drink in her hand tears in her eyes im sorry said banks then he pulled the door shut behind him and dashed toward his car sorry as he felt for rosalind riddle he didnt want to be part of her life any longer he wanted to put as much distance between them as possible gratly would do for a start and barnstaple would be even better before he could get into his car he heard the crystal tumbler shatter against the door behind him epilogue christmas day banks woke up early on christmas morning and after sitting quietly in the kitchen for a while drinking his tea and enjoying the peace he always felt there he went into the living room turned the tree lights on slipped his buena vista social club cd in the stereo and went back to the kitchen humming along with chan chan as he stood over the large freerange chicken that lay splayed on the chopping block a copy of delia smiths christmas open flat beside it he was going to make the traditional pork sage and onion stuffing for which he had purchased all the ingredients yesterday he was shocked to read that delia smith said you should make your stuffing on christmas eve but he decided that was perhaps because the enormous turkey she was cooking would probably take all day hed be fine he looked at his watch plenty of time his back ached because he had had to sleep on the small sofa downstairs it was a small price to pay for having both of his kids with him for christmas though a couple of days ago brian had phoned to say that he had bought the car hed been after and he had a few days free he offered to pick up tracy in leeds on his way to gratly if banks had room for them both banks was overjoyed of course he had room he immediately went out and bought more presents a threecd history of the blue horizon label for brian and some of the finest mostexpensive makeup brushes he could find for tracy along with a few odds and ends to fill out their stockings they were both staying until boxing day when brian would drive tracy down to london to see her mother and sean who were spending christmas in dublin annie was with her father and the rest of his colony of oddballs in cornwall but that was all right she would be back soon and they had a date for new years eve so this was his imperfect christmas with his imperfect family but at least he reminded himself he still had a family despite the damage done over the last year all rosalind riddle had was a young son who would be forever asking where his daddy and his big sister had gone and a longabandoned daughter facing charges for murdering her halfsister though banks had a feeling that ruth walker would probably be committed to a mental hospital rather than sent to prison many times over the past week or so banks had remembered that expression of despair on rosalinds face as she sat amid the packing crates and sheeted furniture listening to him tell her the full story of ruths obsession he also remembered the sound of the crystal glass shattering against the door as he left it had worried him so much that he had called on rosalinds closest neighbor charlotte king on his way home and asked her to keep an eye on rosalind he had also attended jimmy riddles funeral with full police honors a week before christmas rosalind had been there along with benjamin and her parents but she had ignored him another person who had opened up to him too much like jenny fuller and revealed far too much of the raw naked self below the surface then regretted it and turned away afterward he heard they had all gone down to barnstaple and the old mill was on the market he wished rosalind well god knew she had suffered enough banks peered at the recipe he had just mixed the bread crumbs sage and onion with the boiling water when his telephone rang who the hell could that be at nine oclock on christmas morning he wondered as he put the bowl aside and went into the living room merry crimble banks bloody hell it was dirty dick burgess merry christmas banks said to what do i owe the honor got a christmas present for you you shouldnt have i didnt okay i give up what the hell are you talking about i thought it would come better from me rather than you reading about it when its all over the papers or watching it on television what would barry clough barry clough what about him hes dead dead stop talking like a bloody parrot banks yes dead dead dead banks gripped the handset tighter and sat down tell me what happened as far as banks knew after he and annie had gone to see stafford oakes at the cps office a week or so ago all charges against clough had been dropped it turned out that the tire match probably wouldnt withstand a close crossexamination and someone had cocked up on the warrant for the search of jamie gilberts car rendering all evidence found therein inadmissible british justice to add to their troubles the witness who said she had seen jamie gilbert with charlie courage had begun having mysterious lapses of memory in the early hours of the morning burgess said clough was coming out of a nightclub in arenys de mar just up the coast from barcelona and somebody shot him dead who girl named amanda khan supposed to be some kind of pop star thats why its going to be a big story but i cant say as ive ever heard of her sounds like an arab to me shes half pakistani said banks amanda khan cloughs new girlfriend emilys replacement whatever anyway it sounds like the classic love triangle from what ive managed to pick up so far seems that clough jilted her for some dago bimbo and this amanda was a few stops closer to barking than he realized funny old world innit you can say that again banks didnt usually smoke in the mornings but he reached for his cigarettes what makes it even funnier burgess went on is that she used one of cloughs own guns fine irony that she was staying at his villa and apparently he was carrying on with this dolores somebodyorother right under her eyes and trying to palm amanda off on one of the servants she picked up one of cloughs guns and waited for them until they came out of the club shades of ruth ellis indeed ruth ellis was the last woman to be hanged in england she had shot her lover outside a london pub was the girl hurt winged one bullet in her upper arm flesh wound nothing serious according to my spanish sources the khan woman fired six shots two of them hit clough one in his ugly mug and one in his miserable bloody heart wonder it didnt just bounce off but he was dead before he hit the ground two hit jamie gilbert one in the chest and one in the groin hes not dead but they say hell never be quite the same again and his voice has gone up a few octaves one shot hit the girl and the last hit an innocent bystander in the hand a local teenager he lost two fingers so said banks justice of a kind best well get thanks for calling the girl how is she amanda khan why dont tell me you know her too no i was just wondering as well as anyone in the custody of the spanish police can expect to be byebye banks have a good christmas you too banks put the phone down slowly clough dead he could only feel a sense of relief that something had finally gone wrong for the bastard for a while clough had seemed able to get away with anything and everything and thumb his nose at the rest of the world while he was doing it no more it probably wasnt very christian to celebrate another mans death especially on christmas day but banks would have been a hypocrite if he hadnt admitted to himself that he was glad clough wouldnt be around to wreak his peculiar brand of havoc on the world anymore he also imagined the pain and confusion that must have driven amanda khan to such an extreme act how those six shots had probably destroyed her life too her future her career but if any death was worth celebrating it was barry cloughs banks stubbed out the half cigarette that remained then went back into the kitchen and washed his hands before he started working the sausage meat into the sageandonion mixture he looked at the chicken not entirely certain which end was which rubén gonzálezs delicate joyous piano playing on pueblos nuevo drifted through from the living room a little sunlight spilled over the long anvilshaped top of low fell into the kitchen and glinted on the copper bottoms of the pans hanging from the wall banks heard stirrings from upstairs old floorboards creaking probably tracy brian liked to sleep all morning banks remembered how when they were kids they got up before dawn to open their presents once as he had been creeping around their rooms at one oclock in the morning filling pillowcases with presents he was certain he had felt brians eyes on him awake to see if there really was a santa claus neither of them had ever referred to the incident and brian had acted as he always did when he opened his presents but banks suspected that from that christmas on his son had lost a little of his innocence that was probably how it happened he mused innocence was something you lost a bit at a time over the years it didnt just happen overnight but there were intense experiences epiphanies of a kind that brought about quantum leaps banks remembered standing by the riverbank that day rain pitting the water smiling like an idiot being polite clutching the big stone to his chest so as not to wet the gentleman passing by then the struggle the hot beery breath his heels slipping on the muddy bank the terror the punch the world had changed for him that day and even now he could still taste the dirty sweaty cloth of the mans sleeve as he leaned against the kitchen counter he thought of emily riddle of rosalind of ruth walker and amanda khan when he heard tracys footsteps on the staircase he had a sudden image of dr glendennings scalpel bisecting the spider tattoo on emilys midriff and he realized with a shock that the loss of innocence never stopped happening that he was still losing it that it was like a wound that never healed and he would probably go on losing it drop by drop until the day he died acknowledgments first many thanks to those who read and commented on the manuscript throughout its development my wife and first
