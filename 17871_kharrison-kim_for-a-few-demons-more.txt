for a few demons more kim harrison to the guy who knows that the rose is more beautiful with the thorns still on it id like to thank two people who have been with me from almost day one whose combined efforts and business savvy have been so instrumental in putting me somewhere i never dreamed possible my editor diana gill and my agent richard curtis one hammering my fist against the back of my closet wasnt one of my more pleasant dreams actually it hurt the pain broke through my comfortable sleepy haze and i felt the primitive part of me that never slept coolly measuring my slow gathering of will as i tried to wake up with an eerie feeling of disconnection i watched it happen even as in my dream i tore the clothes off the rod and threw them to my rumpled bed something though wasnt right i wasnt waking up the dream wasnt passively shredding into hardtoremember bits and with a jolt i realized i was conscious but not awake what in hell something was really really wrong and instinct sent a pulse of adrenaline thorough me demanding i wake but i didnt my breath was quick and ragged and after i emptied the closet i dropped to the floor and tapped my knuckles on the boards for a secret compartment i knew wasnt there frightened i grasped my will and forced myself awake pain reverberated through my forehead i sprawled all my muscles going flaccid i managed to turn my head and my ear stung instead of my nose breaking hard wood pressed against me cold through my pajama shorts and top my cry came out as a gurgle i couldnt breathe something something was in here with me in my head trying to possess me terror smothered me like a blanket i couldnt see it couldnt hear it could hardly sense it but my body had become a battlefieldone where i didnt know how to win possession was a black art and i hadnt taken the right classes damn it my life isnt supposed to be like this utter panic gave me strength i tried to mobilize my legs and arms under me and push i managed to rise to my hands and knees then fell into my bedside table it crashed to the floor and rolled to the empty closet my pulse hammering the fear of suffocating overtook me i managed to stagger into the hallway looking for help my unknown assailant and i found common ground and working together we took a breath that escaped in a choked cry where the devil was ivy was she deaf maybe she hadnt yet come in from her run with jenks shed said theyd be late as if bothered by the cooperation my attacker gripped harder and i collapsed to the floor my eyes were open and the red sheet of my hair stood between me and the end of the dusky hallway it had won whatever it was it had won and i panicked as i found myself sitting up with an eerie slowness the thick scent of burnt amber hung in my nose rising from my skin no i cried in my thoughtsbut i couldnt even speak i wanted to scream but my possessor made me take a slow sedate breath instead malum i heard myself curse my voice carrying an odd accent and a sophisticated lilt that had never been mine that was the last penny in the jar fear shifted to anger i didnt know who was in here with me but whoever it was was going to get out right now making me speak in tongues was just rude falling into my thoughts i felt the barest brush of someone elses confusion fine i could build on that before the intruder could figure out what i was doing i tapped the ley line out back in the graveyard stark foreign surprise filled me and while my assailant struggled to break me from the line i formed a protection circle in my thoughts practice makes perfect i thought smugly then braced myself this was going to hurt like hell i opened my thoughts to the ley line with an abandon id never dared before and it came magic roared in it overflowed my chi and poured into my body burning my synapses and neurons tulpa i thought in agony the word opening the mental channels to spindle the energy the rush would have killed me if i hadnt already burned a trail of nerves from my chi to my mind groaning i felt the power sear anew as it raced to the protection circle in my thoughts expanding it like a balloon it was how i spindled ley line energy to use later but at this rate it was like diving into a vat of molten metal an internal yelp of pain resounded in me and with a mental push that i mirrored with my hands i shoved away from myself a snap reverberated through me and i was free of the unknown presence from the churchs belfry above came the sound of the bell tollingan echo of my actions something rolled and bumped down the corridor to crash into the wall at the end of the hall i gasped and pulled my head up then groaned in pain moving hurt i held too much ley line power it felt as if it had settled in my muscles and using them squeezed the energy out ow i panted very aware that something at the end of the hall was standing up but at least now it wasnt in my head my heart beat and that hurt too oh god id never held this much power before and i stank i reeked of burnt amber what the turn was going on with a pained determination i squeezed the protection circle in my mind until the energy slipped back through my chi and into the ley line it hurt almost as much as taking it in but when i unspindled the everafter from my thoughts to leave only that which my chi could hold i looked up past the snarls of my hair panting oh god it was newt what are you doing here i said feeling coated in everafter slime the powerful demon looked confused but i was still too out of things to appreciate its shocked expression either a smoothfaced adolescent boy or a strongfeatured female slender of build it stood barefoot in my hallway between the kitchen and the living room squinting i looked againyeah the demon was standing this time not floating its long bony feet definitely pressing the floorboardsand i wondered how newt had managed to attack me when i was on hallowed ground the addition to the church where it stood now wasnt sanctified though and it looked bewildered wearing a dark red robe that looked somewhere between a kimono and what lawrence of arabia might wear on his day off there was a soft blurring of black ley line energy and a slender obsidian staff as tall as i was melted into existence in newts grasp completing the vision i remembered from the time i had been trapped in the everafter and had had to buy a trip home from newt the demons eyes were entirely blackeven what should be the whitesbut they were more alive than any id ever seen as they stared at me unblinking down the twenty feet that separated ustwenty tiny feet and a swath of hallowed ground at least i hoped it was still hallowed ground how did you learn how to do that it said and i stiffened at the odd accent the vowels that seemed to insert themselves into the folds of my brain al i whispered and the demons almostnonexistent eyebrows rose shoulder against the wall i never took my eyes from it as i slid upward to stand this was not the way i wanted to start my day god help me id only been asleep for an hour by the looks of the light whats the matter with you you cant just show up i exclaimed trying to burn off some adrenaline as i stood in the hallway still in the skimpy shirt and shorts i wore to bed no one summoned you and how could you stand on hallowed ground demons cant stand on sacred ground its in every book i do what i want newt peered into the living room poking the staff over the threshold as if looking for traps and assumptions like that will kill you the demon added adjusting the strand of black gold that glinted dully against the midnight red of its robe i wasnt standing on hallowed groundyou were and minias minias said i wrote most of those books so who knows how right they are its smooth features melted into annoyance at itself not me sometimes i dont remember the past right newt said its voice distant or maybe they simply change it and dont tell me my face went cold in the predawn chill newt was insane i had an insane demon standing in my hallway and roommates coming home in about twenty minutes how could something this powerful survive being this unbalanced but unbalanced seldom equated with stupid though powerful did and clever and ruthless demonic what do you want i asked wondering how long until the sun would rise with a troubled look newt exhaled i dont remember it finally said but you have something of mine i want it back while unknown emotions flitted through and newts thoughts cataloged themselves i squinted down the shadowy hallway trying to decide if it was male or female demons could look like anything they wanted to right now newt had pale eyebrows and a light absolutely even skin tone id say it was feminine but the jaw was strong and those bare feet were too bony to be pretty nail polish would look wrong on them it was wearing the same hat as beforeround with straight sides and a flat top made from a scrumptiously rich red fabric and gold braiding the short nondescript hair falling to just below the ear gave no clue to gender the time id questioned what sex he or she was newt had asked me if it made a difference and watching newt struggle to place a thought i had a feeling it wasnt that the demon didnt think it was important but that newt didnt remember what parts he or she had been born with maybe minias did whoever minias was newt i said hoping my shaking voice wasnt too obvious i demand you leave go directly to the everafter from this place and dont return to bother me again it was a good banishmentapart from my not having put it in a circle firstand newt raised one eyebrow at me its puzzlement set aside with an ease that spoke of much practice thats not my summoning name the demon jerked into motion i shrank back to invoke a circlepaltry though it would be undrawn and unscribedbut newt stepped into the living room the hem of its robe the last thing i saw slipping around the doorframe from out of sight came the sound of nails being pulled from wood there was a sharp crack of splintering paneling and newt swore colorfully in latin jenkss cat rex padded past me curiosity doing its best to fulfill its promise i lunged after the stupid animal but she didnt like me and so skittered away the caramelcolored kitten paused at the threshold with her ears pricked tail twitching she sat and watched newt wasnt trying to pull me into the everafter and it wasnt trying to kill me it was looking for something and i think the only reason it had possessed me was so it could search the sanctified church which boded well as a sign that the grounds were still holy but the damned thing was crazy who knew how long it would ignore me until it decided i might be able to tell it where it was whatever it was a thump from the living room made me jump tail crooked rex padded in the sudden knocking on the front door of the church spun me the other way to the empty sanctuary but before i could call out a warning the heavy oak door swung open unlocked in expectation of ivys return great now what rachel a worried voice called and ceri strode in fully dressed in faded jeans with dirtwet knees clearly having been in the garden despite it being before sunrise her eyes were wide with worry and her long fair hair billowed about her as she paced quickly across the barren sanctuary tracking in mud from her gardeninappropriate elaboratelyembroidered slippers she was an elf in hiding and i knew that her schedule was like a pixys awake all day and night but for four hours around each midnight and noon frantic i waved my hands alternating my attention between the empty hallway and her out i all but yelped ceri get out your church bell rang she said cheeks pale with concern as she came to take my hands she smelled wonderfulthe elven scent of wine and cinnamon mixing with the honest smell of dirtand the crucifix ivy had given her glinted in the dim light are you all right oh yeah i thought remembering hearing the bell in the belfry toll when i had pushed newt from my thoughts the expression ringing the bells wasnt just a figure of speech and i wondered how much energy i had channeled to make the bell in the tower resonate from the living room came the ugly noise of paneling being ripped from the wall ceris blond eyebrows rose crap she was calm and sedate and i was shaking in my underwear its a demon i whispered wondering if we should leave or try for the circle i had etched in the kitchen floor the sanctuary was still hallowed ground but i didnt trust anything except a welldrawn circle to protect me from a demon especially this one the questioning look on ceris delicate heartshaped face went hard with anger she had spent a thousand years trapped as a demons familiar and she treated them like snakes cautious yes but she had long since lost her fear why are you summoning demons she accused and in your sleepwear her narrow shoulders stiffened i said id help you with your magic thank you very much ms rachel mariana morgan for making me feel worthless i took her elbow and started dragging her backward ceri i pleaded not believing that her delicate temper had taken this the wrong way i didnt call it it showed up on its own like i would even touch demon magic now my soul was already tainted with enough demon smut to paint a gymnasium at that ceri pulled me to a stop steps from the open sanctuary demons cant show up on their own she said the flicker of concern returning as her white fingers touched her crucifix someone must have summoned it then let it go improperly the soft scuff of bare feet at the end of the hallway cut through me like a gunshot my pulse catching i turned ceris attention following mine an instant later cantor dont newt said the kitten was in its arms paws kneading ceris knees buckled and i reached for her dont touch me she shrieked and i was suddenly battling her as she swung blindly pulling from me and lunging into the sanctuary shit i think were in trouble i lurched after her but she jerked me back when we found the middle of the empty space sit she said her hands shaking as she tried to yank me down okay we werent leaving ceri i began and then my jaw dropped when she flicked a dirtcaked jackknife from her back pocket ceri i exclaimed as she sliced her thumb open blood gushed and while i stared she drew a large circle mumbling latin her waistlength almosttranslucent hair hid her features but she was trembling my god she was terrified ceri the sanctuary is holy i protested but she tapped a line and invoked her circle a blackstained field of everafter rose to encompass us and i shuddered feeling the smut of her past demon magic slither over me the circle was a good five feet in diameter rather large for one person to hold but ceri was probably the best ley line practitioner in cincinnati she cut her middle finger and i grabbed her arm ceri stop were safe wideeyed in panic she shoved me off her and i fell into the inside of her field hitting it like a wall get out of the way she ordered starting to draw a second circle inside the first shocked i pulled myself to the center and she smeared her blood behind me ceri i tried again stopping when i saw her intertwining the line with the first enforcing it id never seen that before latin words fell from her lips dark and threatening pinpricks of power crawled over my skin and i stared when she cut her pinkie and started a third circuit silent desperate tears marked her face as she finished and invoked it a third sheet of black rose over us heavy and oppressive she switched the filthy gardening blade to her bloodied hand and shaking prepared to cut her left thumb stop i protested frightened i grabbed her wrist sticky with her own blood her head swung up blue eyes lost in terror met mine her skin was chalk white its okay i said wondering what newt had done to cause this selfassured unflappable woman to lose it were in the church its sanctified you built a damn fine circle i looked at it humming over my head worried the triple circle was black with a thousand years of curses that algaliarept the demon id saved her from made her pay for id never felt such a strong barrier ceris pretty head shook back and forth lips parted to show tiny teeth you have to call minias god help us you have to call him minias i questioned who in hell is minias newts familiar ceri stammered her blue eyes showing her fear was she nuts newts familiar was another demon give me that knife i said wrestling it from her her thumb was bleeding and i looked for something to wrap it in we were safe newt could have the run of the back for all i cared sunup was near and id sat in a circle and waited for it before memories of my exboyfriend nick rose through me and vanished you have to call him ceri gushed and i stared when she fell to her knees and started scribing a platesize circle with her blood tears spotting the old oak timbers as she worked ceri its okay i said standing over her in confusion but when she looked up my confidence faltered no it isnt she said her voice low the elegant accent that gave away her royal beginnings now carrying the sound of defeat a wave of something pulsed bending the bubble of force that sheltered us my gaze went to the half sphere of everafter around us and from above came a clear bong of the church bell resonating the black sheet protecting us quivered flashing the pure color of ceris blue aura for an instant before returning to its demonfouled black state from the archway at the back of the church came newts soft voice dont cry ceri it wont hurt as bad the second time ceri jerked and i snatched her arm to keep her from running for the open door and breaking her own circle her flailing hand struck my face and at my yelp she collapsed to slump at my feet newt broke the sanctity ceri said around her sobs she broke it i cant go back there al lost a bet and i twisted her curses for ten years i cant go back there rachel frightened i put my hand on her shoulder but then hesitated newt was female then my face blanked newt was in the hallwaythe sanctified part my thoughts returned to that pulse of energy ceri had once said it was possible for a demon to desanctify the church but that it was unlikely as it cost far too much and newt had done so without a thought shit swallowing i looked to find newt framed by the hallway well within what had been holy ground rex was still in the demons arms smiling a stupid cat smile the orange feline wouldnt let me touch her but shed purr while an insane demon pet her figures with her black staff tucked in the crook of her elbow and draped in her elegantly cut robes newt looked almost biblical her femininity was obvious once her gender was settled her black unblinking eyes placidly taking in ceris circle in the middle of the allbutbarren sanctuary i crossed my arms over myself to hide my near nakedness not that there was that much to hide my heart pounded and my breath came fast the demon mark on the underside of my footproof that i owed newt a favor for returning me back from the everafter into reality last solsticethrobbed as if aware that its maker was in the room from beyond the tall stainedglass windows and the open front door came the soft whoosh of a passing car and the twitters of early birds i prayed the pixies would stay in the garden the knife was red and sticky in my hand from ceris blood and i felt ill its too late to flee she said taking the knife back call minias newt stiffened rex jumped from her arms to land upon my desk panicked the cat leapt to the floor scattering papers as she streaked into the hall red robe furling newt strode to ceris circle slamming her spinning staff into it minias doesnt belong here she shouted give it to me its mine i want it back adrenaline made my head hurt i watched the circle quiver then hold we have only moments after she becomes serious ceri whispered whitefaced but looking more collected can you distract her i nodded and ceri began to prepare her spell tension pulled my shoulders tight and i prayed my conversation skills were better than my magic what do you want tell me and ill give it to you i said voice quaking newt began to pace the circle looking like a caged tiger as her deep red robe hissed against the floor i dont remember confusion made her face hard dont call him the demon warned black eyes shining every time i do he makes me forget i want it back and you have it oh this just gets better and better newts gaze went to ceri and i blocked her view i had a halfsecond warning before the demon again jabbed her staff at the circle corrumpro she shouted as it connected at my feet ceri trembled when the outermost circle flashed into utter blackness as newt owned it with a little smile newt touched the circle and it vanished to leave two thin shining bands of unreality between us and death dressed in a dark red robe and wielding a black staff your skills are much improved ceridwen merriam dulciate newt said al is an exceptional teacher perhaps enough that you might be worth my kitchen ceri didnt look up the curtain of her pale hair hid what she was doing and its tips were stained red from her blood my breath was fast and i continued to turn to keep newt in sight until my back was again facing the open door to the church i remember you newt said tapping the butt of her staff along the circle where it met the floor each jab sent a deeper wash of black crawling over the barrier i put your soul back together when you traveled the lines you owe me a favor i stifled a shiver when the demons gaze went past my bare pasty legs to ceri give me ceri and ill call it null i stiffened kneeling behind me ceri found her strength i have my soul she stated voice quivering i dont belong to anyone newt seemed to shrug fingers playing with her necklace ceris signature is all over the imbalance on your soul the demon said to me as she moved to ivys piano and turned her back on me she is twisting curses for you and youre taking them if that doesnt make her your familiar then what does she twisted a curse for me i admitted watching the demons long fingers caress the black wood but i took the imbalance not her that makes her my friend not my familiar but newt had apparently forgotten us standing beside ivys piano the robed figure seemed to gather the power of the room into her turning all that had once been holy and pure to her own purpose here she murmured i came to get something of mine you stole but this tucking her staff into the crook of her arm newt bowed her head and held it this bothers me i dont like it here it hurts why does it hurt here keeping newt distracted while ceri worked was well and good but the demon was nuts the last time i had run into newt she had been at least rational but this was unimaginable power fueled by insanity it was here the demon shouted and i jumped stifling a gasp ceris breath caught audibly as newt turned her black eyes full of malevolence i dont like this newt accused it hurts it shouldnt hurt you shouldnt be here i said feeling airy and unreal as if i were balancing on a knifes edge you should go home i dont remember where home is newt said vehement anger colored her soft voice ceri tugged at me its ready she whispered call him i pulled my eyes from newt as the demon began to circle again dropping my attention to the ugly elaborate twinringed pentagram drawn with ceris blood you think calling one demon to take care of another is a good idea i whispered and newts pace quickened hes the only one who can reason with her she said panicked and desperate please rachel id do it but i cant its demon magic i shook my head her familiar would you have helped al while newt chuckled over my nickname for algaliarept her demon captor ceris chin trembled newt is insane she whispered you think i snapped jumping when newt slammed a side kick into the barrier her robes swirling dramatically great she knew martial arts on top of everything else why not shed obviously been around a while thats why she has a demon for a familiar ceri said eyes flicking nervously they had a contest the loser became her familiar hes more of a caretaker and hes probably looking for her they dont like it when she slips his watch the lights in my head started to go on and my mouth dropped open seeing my understanding ceri tugged me down to her pentagram drawn in blood grabbing my wrist she tuned it palm side up and aimed for my finger with her knife hey i shouted snatching my hand back ceri looked at me her lips pressed together she was getting bitchy that was good it meant she thought shewemight live through this do you have a finger stick she snapped no then let me cut your finger youre already bleeding i said use your blood mine wont work she said from between gritted teeth its demon magic and yeah i got it i interrupted her blood didnt have the right enzymes and thanks to some illegal genetic tinkering to save my life i had survived being born possessing them the humming presence of the circle above us seemed to hesitate and newt made a sound of success ceri shuddered as she lost control of the middle circle and newt took it down one thin fragile circle left i held out my handconsumed with fear ceris eyes met mine stress making her angular features beautiful i only looked ugly when i got scared newts hand hovered over the last circle smiling evilly as she muttered latin it had become a race ceri made a quick swipe at my finger and i jerked against the sting watching a bead of red swell what do i do i asked not liking this at all blue eyes dropping she turned my hand palm down and set it in the circle the old oak seemed to vibrate as if its stored life force were running through me connecting me to the spinning of the earth and the burning of the sun its a public curse she said her words falling over themselves the invocation phrase is mater tintinnabulum say it and miniass name in your thoughts and the curse will put you through dont summon minias newt threatened and i felt ceris control over the last circle swell while the demon was distracted hell kill you faster than i will you arent summoning him youre asking for his attention ceri said desperately the imbalance would normally go to you but you can bargain with newts location and hell take it if he doesnt i will it was a huge concession from the smutcovered elf this was looking better and better but the sun wasnt up yet and newt looked ready to tear us apart i didnt think ceri could hold her concentration much longer against a master demon and i had to believe that the demons possessed a way to control this member of their species otherwise theyd be dead already if his name was minias and he masqueraded as her familiar then thats the way it was hurry ceri whispered sweat tracking her face youll probably show up as an unregistered user but unless shes cursed him again hes likely looking for her and will answer unregistered i wondered licking my lips i closed my eyes i was already connected to the line so all that was left was invoking the curse and thinking his name mater tintinnabulum minias i thought not expecting anything to happen my breath came in a quick heave and i felt ceris hand clamp on my wrist forcing my own to stay in the circle a jolt of everafter spun from me colored with my aura i felt it leave me like a winging bird and i struggled to hold myself together as i saw it flee in my imagination taking a portion of me with it i wont let him steal it from me newt shouted its mine i want it back concentrate ceri whispered and i fell into myself feeling that freed slice of me ring like a bell through the entirety of the everafter and like a ringing bell it was answered im a little busy came an irritated thought leave a message on the damned landline and ill get back to you i shuddered at the sensation of thoughts not my own curling through my mind but ceri kept my hand unmoving within minias was a background clutter of worry guilt aggravation but he had dismissed me like a telemarketer and was ready to snap the connection newt i thought take the imbalance for my calling you and ill tell you where she is and promise you wont hurt us i added or let her hurt us and get her the hell out of my church hurry ceri cried and my concentration bobbled done the voice thought decisively miniass worry sharpened to a point and joined mine where are you my brief elation vanished uh i thought wondering how you give directions to a demon but miniass own thoughts faltered in confusion what the devil is she doing past the lines its almost sunup shes trying to kill me i thought get your ass over here and collect her you arent registered how am i supposed to know where you are ill have to i stiffened jerking my hand out of the circle and ceris grip when the voices presence squeezed my thoughts harder gasping i fell backward onto my butt my body mirroring my attempt to jerk away from miniass presence come through on your thoughts a darkly mellow voice said heavenly father save us ceri gasped my head spun and i caught a glimpse of ceri falling backward she hit her circle and panic iced through me when it broke in a flash of black oh god were dead she met my gaze as she sprawled half upright up on the floor her eyes saying she thought she had killed us newt cried out and i spun where i was sitting only to freeze in shock nothing stood between newt and us now but a man his purple robes reflecting hers in all but color he was barefoot and only now did i remember the flash of those robes coming between me and ceri as he shoved the elf into the bubble to break it so he could get to newt let me go minias newt snarled and my eyes widened at his thickknuckled hand gripping her upper arm she has something of mine i want it back what has she got of yours he asked calmly his back to me newt was a head shorter than minias and it made her look vulnerable despite the scathing vehemence in her voice his voice carried the intent sound of a morethancasual question and my eyes dropped to the grip he had on her staff right above her hand it never eased up not even as his honeyamber voice spilled into the violated sanctuary like a balm soothing yes but holding tension too newt said nothing i could see the hem of her robe past minias tremble i scrambled up ceri finding her feet beside me she didnt bother to reinstate the circle what was the point minias shifted to block newts view he was focused on her but i was sure he was aware of us and he looked like he knew what he was doing i had yet to see his face but his brown hair was short the curls crushed by the same hat newt wore breathe minias said as if trying to trigger something tell me what you want i want to remember she whispered it was as if we werent even in the room anymore so focused were they on each other and only now did miniass grip become gentle then why do you because it hurts she said her bare feet shifting leaning in as if concerned he asked gently why did you come here she was silent and then finally i dont remember it was agitated soft and threateningand the only reason i believed her was that she had clearly forgotten before minias had shown up minias lost the last of his anger i felt as if we were witnessing a common but seldomseen event and i hoped he would hold to his promise that they wouldnt take us when they were ready to leave then lets go he soothed and i wondered how much of this was caretaker and how much was simply caring could demons care about each other maybe youll remember when we get back he said turning newt as if going to lead her away if you forget something you should go to where you first thought it and it will be waiting for you newt refused to step with him and our eyes met when minias moved out of the way its not at home she said her brow furrowed to show a deep inner pain and under that a seething power held in check by the demon whose grip had slid from her staff to her hand its here not there whatever it is its here or it was here i i know it anger slipped over her brow born from frustration you dont want me to remember she accused i dont want you to remember he asked harshly his hand falling from her and extending in demand give them to me now my gaze flicked between them he had gone from lover to jailer in a pulse im missing my cache of yew he said i didnt make you forget give them to me newts lips pressed together and spots of color appeared on her cheeks it was starting to make sense yew was highly toxic and used almost exclusively in communing with the dead and for making forget charms illegal forget charms i had found a yew in the back of the graveyard by an abandoned mausoleum and though i didnt commune with the dead i had left it hoping that plausible deniability would keep my butt out of court if anyone found it there growing yew wasnt illegal but growing it in a graveyard where the potency was enhanced was i made them newt snapped theyre mine i made them myself she turned to leave and he reached out and spun her back i could see miniass face now he had a strong jaw clenched with emotion his red demon eyes were so dark they almost hid the characteristic goatslitted appearance and his nose was strongly roman anger was heavy on him balancing newts own temper perfectly emotions cascaded over them both in a rapid fluid torrent it was as if a fiveminute argument were passing in three seconds her face changing his responding causing a shift of her mood that was reflected in his body language he carefully manipulated her this demon who had removed the sanctity of the church without a second thought who had turned a triple bloodcircle to her willsomething that i had been told was impossible but of which ceri had known newt was fully capable i didnt know whom to be more frightened ofnewt who could plague the world or minias who controlled her please he asked when her face shifted to chagrin and her black eyes dropped hesitating briefly she reached into the pocket of her expansive sleeve and handed him a fistful of vials how many did you invoke when you remembered he asked the vials clattering newts eyes went to the floor beaten but the sly look to her demeanor told me she wasnt sorry about it i dont recall he jiggled them in his hand before pocketing them clearly seeing her unrepentant mood there are four missing she looked at him real tears showing it hurts she said scaring the crap out of me newt had inflicted her own memory loss what had she remembered that she didnt want to ceri was standing beside me almost forgotten and she slumped telling me that it was almost done i wondered how often she had seen this played out his mood easing minias pulled newt close the purple of his robe curving around her newt folded her arms against herself and let him hold her her eyes shut and her head tucked under his chin they looked elegant and selfpossessed standing in their strongly colored robes and proud stances i wondered how i could ever have doubted newts gender it was so clear now and i spared a thought that perhaps she had subtly shifted her appearance seeing them together made a shudder ripple over me minias was the only thing holding newt to her sanity i didnt think he was just her familiar i dont think he had ever been just anything you shouldnt take them he whispered his breath brushing her forehead his voice was captivating moving up and down like music it hurts she said her own voice muffled i know his demonic eyes locked with mine and i shivered thats why i dont like it when you go out without me he said looking at me but talking to her you dont need them breaking our eye contact minias turned her face to his his hand cupping her strong jawline my arms wrapped around my middle i wondered how long they had been together long enough that a forced burden became one willingly shouldered i dont want to remember newt said the things ive done a demon with a conscience why not they did have souls dont minias said interrupting her he held her more gently promise youll tell me the next time you remember something instead of going looking for answers newt nodded then stiffened in his arms thats where i was she whispered and my gut clenched at the sound of realization in her voice minias froze and beside me ceri paled it was in your journals newt exclaimed pushing him away minias fell back wary but the demon was beyond noticing youve been writing it down youve written down everything i remember how much do you have in your books minias how much do you know that i wanted to forget newt he warned his fingers fumbling in his pocket i found them newt shouted you know why im here tell me why am i over here i jumped when ceri gripped my arm shouting in rage newt swung her staff at him miniass fingers danced in the air as if babbling in sign language forming a ley line spell i felt a huge drop as someone pulled on the line out back and with a surprising shout minias ended his spell by popping the lid to a vial hed taken from newt and flinging it at her newt cried out in dismay as the sparkles hung in the air her anger frustration and pain shocking in their depth and then the potion hit her and her face went blank sliding to a stop she blinked glancing over the empty sanctuary with no recognition in her gaze as it landed on ceri and me she saw minias then threw her staff to the floor as if it were a snake it hit with a clatter and bounced outside past the stainedglass windows the robins were singing in the predawn haze but in here it was as if the air were dead minias she said her tone confused and dismayed its done he said gently he came forward scooping up her staff and handing it to her did i hurt you her voice was worried and when minias shook his head relief spilled over her quickly turning to depression i felt sick take me home the demon said glancing at me my head hurts wait for me miniass gaze flicked to mine then returned to her well go together ceri held her breath as the demon approached us his face down and wide shoulders hunched i thought briefly about reinstating the circle but didnt minias stopped before me too close for comfort his tired eyes took in my nightclothes ceris blood staining my hands and the three circles that had nearly failed to stop newt his gaze rose to encompass the interior of the sanctuary with my desk ivys piano and the stark emptiness between them you were the one who stole ceri from her demon he asked surprising me i wanted to explain that it had been a rescue not stealing her but i just nodded his head moved up and down once mocking me and i fixed on his eyes the red was so dark that they looked brown and the characteristic demonic sideways pupil gave me pause your blood kindled the curse he said his red goatslitted eyes darting to the blood circle beside me she told me about shoving you through the lines last winter his eyes traveled over me evaluating no wonder al is interested in you do you have anything that might have attracted her other than the favor i owe her i said my voice shaking i dont think so his eyes dropped to the elaborate circle ceri had drawn for me to contact him with if you think of anything call me ill pick up the imbalance i dont want her coming over here again ceris fingers on my arm tightened yeah me neither i thought stay here he said as he turned away ill be back to settle up alarmed i pulled from ceri whoa hold up demon boy i dont owe you anything his eyebrows were high and mocking when he turned around i owe you idiot the sun is almost up i have to get out of here ill be back when i can ceris eyes were wide somehow i didnt think that having a demon owe me a favor was a good thing hey i said taking a step forward i dont want you just showing up thats rude and really scary he looked impatient to be away as he adjusted his clothing yes i know why do you think demons try to kill their summoners youre crude unintelligent grasping hacks with no sense of social grace demanding we cross the lines and pickup the cost i warmed but before i could tell him to shove it he said ill call first you take the imbalance for that since you asked for it i glanced at ceri for guidance and she nodded the guarantee that he wouldnt show up while i was showering was worth it deal i said hiding my hand so he wouldnt take it from behind him newt eyed me with her brow creased miniass steps were silent as he moved to take her elbow possessively his worried eyes darting to mine his head rose to look past ceri and me to the open door and i heard the lublublub of a cycle pulling into the carport in the time between one heartbeat and the next they vanished i slumped in relief ceri leaned against the piano the flat of her arms getting blood on it her shoulders started to shake and i put a hand on one wanting nothing more than to do the same from outside came the sudden silence of ivys bike turning off and then her distinctive steps on the cement walk so then the pixy says to the druggist jenks said the clatter of his wings obvious tax i thought they stayed on by themselves the pixy laughed the tinkling sound of it like wind chimes get it ivy tax tacks yes i got it she muttered her pace shifting as she took the cement steps good one jenks hey the door is open the light coming into the church was eclipsed and ceri pulled herself up wiping her face and smearing it with blood tears and dirt from her garden i could smell the stink of burnt amber on me and throughout the church and i wondered if i would ever feel clean again together we stood numb as ivy halted just past the foyer jenks hovered for three seconds and then dropping swear words like the golden sparkles he was shedding he tore off in search of his wife and kids ivy put a hand on her cocked hip and took in the threeno four circles made of blood me in my pjs and ceri crying silently her hand sticky with drying blood clutching her crucifix what on gods green earth did you do now wondering if id ever sleep again i glanced at ceri i have no idea two i didnt feel good my stomach queasy as i sat on my hardbacked chair in the kitchen at ivys heavy and very large antique table shoved up against an interior wall the sun was a thin slice of gold shining on the stainlesssteel fridge i didnt see that often i wasnt used to being up this early and my body was starting to let me know about it i didnt think it was from the mornings trouble yeah right tugging my terrycloth robe shut i flipped through the yellow pages while jenks and ivy argued by the sink the phone was on my lap so ivy wouldnt take over as i searched for someone to resanctify the church id already called the guys who had reshingled the roof to give us an estimate on the living room they were human and ivy and i liked using them since they generally got here bright and early at noon newt had torn up the carpet and pulled several pieces of paneling off the walls what in hell had she been looking for jenkss kids were in there right now though they werent even supposed to be in the church and by the shrieks and chiming laughs they were making a mess of the exposed insulation turning another thin page i wondered if ivy and i might take the opportunity to do some remodeling there was a nice hardwood floor under the carpet and ivy had a great eye for decorating she had redone the kitchen before id moved in and i loved it the large industrialsized kitchen had never been sanctified having been added on to the church for sunday suppers and wedding receptions it had two stovesone electric one gasso i didnt have to cook dinner and stir my spells on the same surface not that i made dinner on the stovetop too often it was usually microwave something or cook on ivys hellacious grill out back in the tidy witchs garden between the church and the graveyard proper actually i did most of my spelling at the island counter between the sink and ivys farmhouse kitchen table there was an overhead rack where i hung the herbs i was currently messing with and my spelling equipment that didnt fit under the counter and with the large circle etched out in the linoleum it made a secure place to invoke a magical circle there were no pipes or wires crossing either overhead in the attic or under in the crawl space to break it i knew i had checked the one window overlooked the garden and graveyard making a comfortable mix of my earthy spelling supplies and ivys computer and tight organization it was my favorite room in the church even if most of the arguments took place here the biting scent of rose hips came from the tea ceri had made me before she left i frowned at the pale pink liquid id rather have coffee but ivy wasnt making any and i was going to bed as soon as i got the reek of burnt amber off me jenks was standing on the windowsill in his peter pan pose his hands on his hips and cocky as hell the sun hit his blond hair and dragonflylike wings sending flashes of light everywhere as they moved damn the cost he said standing between my beta mr fish who swam around in an oversize brandy sniffer and jenkss tank of brine shrimp money doesnt do you any good if youre dead his tiny angular features sharpened at least not for us ivy ivy stiffened her perfect oval face emptying of emotion on an exhale she drew her athletic sixfoot height up from where shed been leaning against the counter straightening the leather pants she usually wore while on an investigation run and tossing her enviably straight black hair from habit shed had cut it a couple of months ago and i knew she kept forgetting how short it was just above her ears id commented last week that i liked it and she had gotten it styled into downward spikes with gold tips it looked great on her and i wondered where her recent attention to her appearance was coming from skimmer maybe she glanced at me her lips pressed together and spots of color showing on her usually pale complexion the hint of almondshaped eyes gave away her asian heritage and that combined with her small strongly defined features made her striking her eyes were brown most of the time going pupil black when her livingvampire status got the better of her i had let her sink her teeth into me once and though as exhilarating and pleasurable as all hell it had scared the crap out of both of us when she lost control and nearly killed me even so i was willing to cautiously risk trying to find a blood balance ivy flatly refused though it was becoming painfully obvious the pressures were building in both of us she was terrified of hurting me in a haze of bloodlust ivy dealt with fear by ignoring its existence and avoiding its origin but her selfimposed denial was just about killing her even as it gave her strength if my roommatesbusiness partners could be believed finding thrills was what i organized both my daily life and my sex life around jenks called me an adrenaline junky but if i was making money at it and remembered my limits where was the harm and i knew to the depths of my soul that ivy didnt fall under that looking for a thrill umbrella yes the rush had been incredible but it was the selfworth i had given her that told me it hadnt been a mistake not the blood ecstasy she had instilled for an instant ivy had seen herself as i did strong capable able to love someone fully and be loved in return by giving her my blood i had told her that yes she was worth sacrificing for that i liked her for who she was and that her needs werent wrong needs were needs it was us who labeled them right or wrong i wanted her to feel that way all the time but god help me it had been a rush as if she had heard my thought ivy turned from jenks stop it she said and i flushed she couldnt read my mind but she might as well have a vamps sense of smell was tuned to pheromones she could read my mood as easily as i could smell the sharp scent of rose hips coming from my untouched tea crap ceri really expected me to drink this jenkss wings reddened clearly not liking the shift in topic from how to spend our pooled business money to how to keep our teeth to ourselves and ivy gestured with a long slim hand to include me in their argument its not that i dont want to spend the money she said both soothing and assertive but why do it if a demon will take it down again i snorted turning to the phone book and shifting a page newt isnt just a demon ceri says shes one of the oldest most powerful demons in the everafter and shes stark raving nuts i muttered turning a page to another listing ceri doesnt think shell be back ivy crossed her arms to look slinky and svelte so why bother resanctifying at all jenks snickered yeah rache why bother i mean this could be good ivy could invite her mom over for a housewarming weve been here a year and the woman is dying to come over well at least she would be if she were still alive worried i looked up from the phone book alarm sifted over ivy for a moment it was so quiet i could hear the clock above the sink and then ivy jerked her speed edging into that eerie vamp quickness she took pains to hide give me the phone she said snatching it the black plastic slipped from my lap and ivy drew the heavy book off the table retreating to her end of the table with quick steps she set the directory on her knees and pulled a legal pad from a stack while jenks laughed she sketched a graph with columns headed by phone number availability cost and religious affiliation confident wed be on holy ground before the week was out i stifled my ire that she had taken over jenks was smiling when he flitted from the windowsill gold sparkles landing in my teacup before he settled beside it thanks i said knowing ivy would hear me even if i whispered i dont think im going to sleep again until were resanctifiedand i like sleeping head bobbing in an exaggerated motion he nodded why dont you just put the church in a circle he questioned nothing can get through that it wouldnt be secure unless we removed all the electricity and gas lines coming in i explained not wanting to tell him that newt could apparently get through any circle with enough reason you want to live without your mtv oh hell no he said glancing at ivy when she offered the person on the phone double to get the job done before sunset tonight ivy didnt get along with her mother very well tired i slumped back into my chair feeling the weight of the insane morning hour fall on me jenkss wife matalina had gotten the pixy kids out of the living room and the sound of them in the garden slipped in with the morning breeze ceri said if newt doesnt show up in the next three weeks shell probably forget about us i said around a yawn but i still want to get the church resanctified i looked at my chipped nail polish in dismay minias hit her with a forget charm but the demon is freaking crazy and she shows up without being summoned ivy stopped talking on the phone and after she and jenks exchanged a look she clicked it off without saying goodbye who is minias newts familiar i gave her a tightlipped smile to soften the shortness of my answer sometimes ivy was like an exboyfriend hell she was like that most times as her vampire instincts fought with her reasoning i was not her shadow aka source of blood but living with her blurred the lines between what she knew and how her instincts said she should feel she remained silent clearly having heard the lack of completeness i didnt want to talk about it the fear being too damn close to my skin literally i stank like the everafter and all i wanted was to clean up and hide under my covers for the next three days having had newt in my head gave me the willies even if id regained control almost immediately ivy took a breath to press for more dissuaded when jenks clattered a warning with his wings id tell the whole story just not now my blood pressure dropped at jenkss show of support and lurching to my feet i went to the pantry for the mop and bucket if we were going to have a holy person in our church i wanted the blood circles gone i mean really youve been up since noon yesterday i can do that ivy protested but lack of sleep had made me bitchy and i dropped the bucket in the sink slamming the cupboard door under it when i brought out the disinfectant and tossed the scrub brush in youve been up as long as i have i said over the rush of water and youre arranging whos going to bless the grounds the sooner we get that done the better ill sleep something i was taking care of until you butted in i thought snarkily as i took off the metallic bracelet kisten had given me and draped it around the base of mr fishs bowl the black gold of the chain and mundane charms glittered and i wondered if i should take the time to try to put a ley line spell into them or just leave them as something pretty to wear the sharp orange scent tickled my nose and i shut off the tap my back protesting i lugged the bucket over the edge of the counter spilling some i awkwardly rubbed the mop over the drops and headed out bare feet squeaking its not a biggie ivy i said five minutes the clatter of pixy wings followed me isnt newts familiar a demon jenks asked when he landed on my shoulder okay so maybe it hadnt been a show of support but merely him wanting to feel me out as to what info to give ivy she was a worrywart and the last thing i wanted was her thinking i couldnt go out for a can of spam without her protection he was a better judge of her mood than i was so i set the bucket by the circles and whispered yeah but hes more of a caretaker tinks a disney whore he swore taking a potshot at his infamous kin as i plunged the mop up and down a few times before squeezing out the excess water dont tell me you got another demon mark he left my shoulder when i sent the mop across the floor apparently finding the backandforth motion too much to take no he owes me i said nervously and jenkss jaw dropped im going to see if hell take als mark off me in exchange or maybe newts jenks hovered before me and i straightened tired as i leaned on the mop his eyes were wide and incredulous the pixy had a wife and way too many kids living in a stump in the garden he was a family man but he had the face and body of an eighteenyearold a very sexy tiny eighteenyearold with wings and sparkles and a mop of blond hair that needed arranging his wife matalina was a very happy pixy and she dressed him in skintight outfits that were distracting despite his minute size that he was near ing the end of his life span was killing me and ivy both he was more than a steadfast partner skilled in detection infiltration and securityhe was our friend you think the demon will do that jenks said damn rache thatd be great i shrugged its worth a shot but all i did was tell him where newt was from the kitchen came ivys voice raised in irritation its oakstaff yes there was a hesitation then really i didnt know you kept those kinds of records it would have been nice if someone had told us we were a paranormal city shelter shouldnt we be getting a tax break or something her voice had gone wary and i wondered what was up jenks alighted on the edge of the bucket wiping a spot to sit before settling himself his dragonfly wings stilling to look like gossamer the mop wasnt doing it i would have to scrub sighing i dropped to my knees and felt around the bottom of the bucket for the brush no it was sanctified ivy continued her voice growing louder clear over the hiss of the bristles it isnt anymore a slight pause and she added we had an incident another hesitation and she said we had an incident how much to do the entire church my stomach clenched when she added softly how much to do just the bedrooms i looked at jenks guilt rising thick in me maybe we could get the city to defray the cost if we refiled as a city shelter it wasnt as if we could ask the landlord to fix it piscary owned the church and though ivy had dropped the facade of paying rent to the master vampire she looked to we were responsible for the upkeep it was like living rent free in your parents house when they were on an extended vacation vacation being jail in this case thanks to me it was an ugly story but at least i hadnt killed him uh for good ivys sigh was audible over the sound of my work can you get out here before tonight she asked making me feel marginally better i didnt hear the answer to that but there was no more conversation forthcoming and i focused on rubbing out the smears moving clockwise as i went jenks watched for a moment from the rim of the bucket then said you look like a porno star on your hands and knees mopping in your underwear push it baby he moaned push it i glanced up to find him making rude motions doesnt he have anything better to do but i knew he was trying to cheer me upat least thats what i was telling myself as his wings turned red from laughter i jerked my robe closed and sat back on my knees before i blew a shoulderlength red curl from my face taking a swing at his smirk would be uselesshe had gotten really fast since his stint under a demon curse that made him peoplesize and turning my back to him would be worse would you straighten my desk for me i asked allowing a touch of annoyance into my voice your cat dumped my papers you bet he said zipping off immediately i felt my blood pressure drop ivys soft steps intruded and jenks cussed fluently at her when she pulled the papers off the floor and set them on the desktop for him politely telling him to shove a slug up his ass she strode past me to her piano a spray bottle in one hand and a chamois cloth in the other someones coming out this morning she said starting to clean ceris blood from the varnished wood old blood didnt flip any switches in living vampsnot like the chance to take it did theyre going to give us an estimate and if our credit checks out theyll do the entire church you want to pay the extra five thousand to insure it five thousand to insure it holy crap how much was this going to cost uneasy i sat back up on my heels and dunked the brush my rolledup sleeve slipped soaking in an instant from my desk jenks called out go for it rache it says here you won a million dollars i glanced behind me to find him manhandling my mail irritated i dropped the brush and squeezed the water from my robe can we find out how much its going to cost first i asked and she nodded giving her piano a heavy coat of whatever was in that unlabeled spray bottle it evaporated quickly and she wiped it to a shine here she said setting the bottle down beside the bucket it will get rid of the her words stopped just wipe the floor with it she added and my eyebrows rose okaaay i bent back over the floor hesitating at the circle ceri had scribed to call minias then smeared it to nothing ceri could help me make a new one and i wasnt going to have demonic blood circles on the floor of my church hey ivy jenks called you want to keep this she rocked into motion and i shifted to keep her in my view jenks had a coupon for pizza and i smirked right like she would even consider ordering anything but piscarys pizza what else does she have in here ivy said throwing it away i turned my back on them knowing that the clutter i kept my desk in drove ivy insane shed probably take the opportunity to tidy it god id never be able to find a thing spellofthemonth club toss jenks said and i heard it thunk into the trash can free issue of witch weekly toss credit check toss crap rachel dont you throw anything away i ignored him having only a small arc to finish wax on wax off my arm was hurting the zoo wants to know if you want to renew your offhours runners pass save that i said jenks whistled long and low and i wondered what they had found now an invitation to ellasbeth withons wedding ivy drawled in question oh yeah i forgot about that tink knocks your kickers jenks exclaimed and i sat back on my heels rachel he called hovering over the invitation that had probably cost more than my last dinner out when did you get an invitation from trent for his wedding i dont remember i dunked the brush and started in again but the hush of linen against paper brought me upright hey i protested wiping my hands dry on my robe to make the tie come undone you cant do that its illegal to open mail not addressed to you jenks had landed on ivys shoulder and they each gave me a long look over the invitation in her grip the seal was broken ivy said shaking to the floor the stupid little white tissue paper i had carefully replaced trent kalamack was the bane of my existence one of cincinnatis most beloved councilmen and the northern hemispheres most eligible bachelor no one seemed to care he ran half of the citys underworld and worked a good slice of the worlds illegal brimstone trade that wasnt even considering his punishablebydeath dealings in genetic manipulation and outlawed medicines my being alive because of them was a big part of my keeping quiet about it i didnt like the antarctic any more than the next person and thats where id end up if it got out that is if they didnt just kill me burn me and send my ashes to the sun suddenly having a demon trash my living room didnt seem so bad holy crap jenks swore again ellasbeth wants you to be a bridesmaid jerking my robe closed i stalked across the sanctuary and snatched the invitation out of ivys hand its not an invitation its a badly worded request for me to work security the woman hates me look she didnt even sign it i bet she doesnt even know it exists i waved it in the air and shoved it into a drawer slamming it shut trents fiancee was a bitch in all ways but the literal thin elegant rich and bitingly polite we had gotten along really well the night we had breakfast together just her me and trent caught between us course part of that might have been from my letting her believe that trent and i had been childhood sweethearts but she was the one who decided i was a courtesan stupid yellow pages ad ivys expression was wary she knew better than to push me when it came to trent but jenks wouldnt let it go yeah but think of it rache its going to be a hell of a party the best of cincinnati is going to be there you never know who will show up i lifted a plant and ran my hand under itmy version of dusting people who want to kill trent i said lightly i like excitement but im not insane ivy moved my bucket and mop to a dry part of the floor and sprayed a heavy layer of that unlabeled bottle you going to do it she asked as if i hadnt already said no no in one motion i swept all the papers off the desktop and into the uppermost drawer jenks landed on the clean surface his wings stilling as he leaned against the pencil cup and crossed his ankles and arms to look surprisingly alluring for a fourinchtall man why not he accused you think hes going to stiff you again i added in my thoughts because i already saved his freaking elf ass once i said you do it once its a mistake you do it twice and its not a mistake anymore mop and bucket in hand ivy walked out snickering its rsvp by tomorrow jenks needled rehearsal is friday youre invited i know that it was my birthday too and i wasnt going to spend it with trent ticked i headed into the kitchen after ivy flying backward jenks got in my face and preceded me down the hallway slices of sunlight coming in from the living room ive got two reasons you should do it he said one it will piss ellasbeth off and two you could charge him enough to afford to resancitify the church my steps slowed and i tried to keep the ugly look off my face that was unfair by the sink ivy frowned clearly thinking the same jenks im just saying shes not working for kalamack ivy threatened and this time he shut his mouth i stood in the kitchen not knowing why i was here i gotta shower i said go ivy said meticulouslyand needlesslywashing the bucket with soapy water before putting it away ill wait up for the man coming over with an estimate i didnt like that shed probably fudge on the quote knowing that her pockets were deeper than mine she had told me she was nearly broke but nearly broke for the last living member of the tamwood vampires was not my broke rather more of a downtosixfiguresinherbankaccount broke if she wanted something she got it but i was too tired to fight her i owe you i said as i grabbed the cooled tea ceri had made for me and shuffled out god jenks ivy was saying as i avoided my room with my scattered clothes and just headed for my bathroom the last thing she needs is to be working for kalamack i just thought the pixy said no you didnt think ivy accused trent isnt some pantywaist rich pushover hes a powerhungry murdering drug lord who looks good in a suit you dont think hes got some reason for inviting her to work security other than his welfare i wasnt going to let her go alone he protested and i shut the door sipping the tart tea i dropped my pjs into the washer and got the shower going so i wouldnt have to listen to them sometimes i felt as if they thought i couldnt hear at all just because i couldnt hear a pixy belch across the graveyard yeah theyd had a contest one night jenks won the waters warmth was wonderful and after the sharp scent of pine soap washed away the choking smell of burnt amber i stepped from the shower feeling refreshed and almost awake purple towel wrapped around me i rubbed the mist from the long mirror leaningclose to see if i had any new freckles nope not yet opening my mouth i checked out my beautiful pristine teeth it was nice not having any fillings i may have coated my soul in blackness when i had twisted a demon curse to turn into a wolf this spring but i wasnt going to feel guilty over the beautiful unmarked skin i had when i turned back the accumulated damage of twentyfive years of existence had been removed and if i didnt find a way to get rid of the demon smut from twisting the curse before i died i was going to pay for it by burning in hell at least im not going to feel too guilty about it i thought as i reached for my lotion heavy on the spf protection and i certainly wasnt going to waste it my mothers family had come from ireland long before the turn and from her i got my red hair my green eyes and my pale skin now as satisfyingly soft and supple as a newborns from my dad i got my height my lean athletic build and my attitude from both of them i got a rare genetic condition that would have killed me before my first birthday if trents father hadnt set himself above the law and fixed it in his illegal genetic lab our fathers had been friends before theyd died a week apart under suspicious circumstances at least they were suspicious to me and that was the reason i distrusted trent if his being a drug lord a murderer and nastily adept at manipulating me werent enough suddenly overcome with missing my dad i shuffled through the cabinet behind the mirror until i found the wooden ring hed given me on my thirteenth birthday it had been the last one wed shared before he died i looked at it small and perfect in my palm and on impulse i put it on i hadnt worn it since the charm it once held to hide my freckles had been broken and i hadnt needed it since twisting that demon curse but i missed him and after being attacked by a demon this morning i could use some serious emotional security i smiled at it circling my pinkie feeling better already the ring had come with a lifetime charm reinstatement and i had an appointment every fourth friday in july maybe id take the madam out for coffee instead ask her about maybe changing it to a sunscreen charmif there was such a thing the giveandtake of masculine and feminine voices from the kitchen became obvious as i toweled my hair hes here already i grumbled finding a pair of underwear jeans and a red camisole in the dryer slipping them on i dabbed some perfume behind each ear to help block my scent and ivys from mixing combed my damp hair back with my fingers and headed out but it wasnt a holy man i found in the kitchen covered in pixy children it was glenn three hi glenn i said as i slumped barefoot into my chair whos pinching your ass today the clearly uncomfortable rather tall fib detective was in a suit which didnt bode well he had jenkss kids all over him which was really weird and ivy was glaring at him from her computer which was mildly troubling but considering that the first time she met him she almost bit him in anger and he almost shot her i guessed we were doing okay jenks scraped his wings and his kids scattered rising up through my rack of spelling supplies and herbs in a swirl of silk and shouts that hurt my eyeballs before flowing into the hall and probably out the chimney in the living room i hadnt seen him on the sill until now standing by his pet sea monkeys how come a pixy has more pets than i do i smiled tiredly at glenn across the table trying to make up for my roommates stellar attitude there was a paperboard tray with two cups steaming between us and the warm breeze coming in from the garden was pushing the heavenly aroma of freshly brewed coffee right to me i wanted one in the worst way ivys fingers hit her keyboard aggressively as she weeded out her spam detective glenn was just leaving werent you the tall black man silently clenched his jaw since id seen him last he had gotten rid of his goatee and mustache and replaced them with stud earrings i wondered what his dad thought about that but personally i thought it added to his carefully maintained polished image of young and capable law enforcer his suit was still offtherack but it fit his very nice physique as if made for him the tips of his dress shoes poking out from under the hems looked comfortable enough to run in if he had to his trim body certainly seemed up to it with that wide chest and narrow waist the butt of a weapon glinted from a holster on his belt to give him a nice hint of danger not that im in the market for a new boyfriend i thought i had a damn fine boyfriend kisten and glenn wasnt interested though im sure if he tried a witch hed never switch and since i knew that his lack of interest wasnt born of prejudice that was cool i exhaled my fingers shaking from fatigue my eyes went from his expressive brown ones pinched in worry and annoyance to the coffee is one of these mine by chance i asked and when he nodded i reached forward saying bless you back to the turn pulling off the plastic lid i took a gulp my eyes closed and i held the second swallow in my mouth for a moment it was a double shot hot black and oh so what i needed right now ivy kept typing and while jenks excused himself to help the forgotten toddler crying in the ladle back to the stump in the garden i took the time to wonder what glenn was doing here and so obscenely early it was seven in the freakin morning i hadnt done anything to tick off the fibhad i glenn worked for the federal inderland bureau the humanrun institution that functioned on a local and national level the fib was way outclassed by the is the interlanderrun side of the coin when it came to enforcing the law but during a previous investigation on which id helped glenn id found that the fib had a scary amount of information on us inderlanders making me wish i hadnt written up those species summaries for his dad last fall glenn was gincys fib inderland specialist which meant that he had enough guts to try working both sides of the street it had been his dads idea and since i owed his dad big time i helped when he asked no one was talking though and i figured id better say something before i fell asleep at the table whats the run glenn i asked taking a sip and wishing the caffeine would kick in glenn stood his thick hands adjusting his id badge on his belt square jaw tightening he gave ivy a wary glance i left a message last night didnt you get it the depth of his voice was as soothing as the coffee hed brought but coming back in through the pixy hole in the screen jenks did an aboutface i think i hear matalina he said vanishing to leave behind a sifting ribbon of gold sparkles my eyes went from the haze of pixy dust to ivy and she shrugged no i prompted ivys eyes switched to black jenks she called but the pixy didnt show i shrugged and gave glenn an apologetic look jenks ivy yelled if youre going to hit the message button youd damn well better write it down i took a slow breath but ivy interrupted me glenn rachel hasnt been to bed yet can you come back about four the morgue will have changed shifts by then he protested im sorry you didnt get my message but will you look anyway i thought thats why you were up annoyance tightened my shoulders i was tired and cranky and i didnt like ivy trying to field my business in a sudden wash of bitchiness i stood framed by her new haircut ivys oval face looked questioning where are you going i grabbed my bag already packed with a variety of spells and charms then snapped the top back onto my coffee to the morgue apparently ive been up this late before but not after a night like you just had silent i pulled my bracelet from around mr fish and wrangled the clasp glenn slowly stood his posture holding a wary slant he had once asked me why i lived with ivy and the threat she posed to my life and free will and though i knew why now telling him would make him worry more not less jeez ivy i said aware he was analyzing us professionally id rather do it now consider it my bedtime story i headed into the hall trying to remember where id left my sandals the foyer from the kitchen ivy said you dont have to go running whenever the fib crooks their finger no i shouted back fatigue making me stupid but i do have to come up with some money to resanctify the church glenns steps behind me faltered on the hardwood floor it isnt holy anymore he asked as we emerged into the brighter sanctuary what happened we had an incident the darkness of the foyer was soothing when i found it and i sighed when i scuffed into my sandals and pushed open the heavy door to the sanctuary good lord i thought squinting at the bright glare of a latejuly morning no wonder i slept through this it was noisy with shrieking birds and already hot if i had known i was going out i would have put on shorts glenn took my elbow when i stumbled on the step and i would have spilled my coffee if i hadnt replaced the top not a morning person eh he teased and i jerked away jenks i shouted when my sandals reached the cracked sidewalk the least he could do was come with me seeing glenns cruiser parked at the curb i hesitated lets take two cars i offered not wanting to be seen riding in a fib cruiser when i could be driving my red convertible it was hot i could put the top down glenn chuckled with your suspended license not a chance the scuffing of my sandals slowed and i looked askance at him bothered at the amusement in his dark eyes crap how did you find out about that he opened the passengerside door for me duh i work for the fib our street force has been running interference for you every time you go out for groceries if you get caught driving with a suspended license the is is going to jail your ass and we like your ass on the street where it can do some good ms morgan i got into the front seat and set my bag on my lap i hadnt known the fib had even heard about that much less had been distracting the is thanks i said softly and he shut the door with a grunt of acknowledgment glenn crossed in front while i buckled myself in it was stuffy and i fiddled with the window control to put it down the car wasnt on yet but i was irritated i jammed my coffee in the cup holder and kept messing with the window until glenn folded his height into the front seat and gave me a look my brow furrowed in frustration its not fair glenn i complained they had no right to take my license theyre picking on me just take the driversed class and get it over with but its not fair theyre intentionally making my life difficult golly imagine that the key slid into the ignition and glenn paused to tug a pair of sunglasses out of his pocket and put them on to up his cool factor by about ten face easing in relief he looked down the quiet street shaded with trees almost eighty years old what do you expect he said you gave them an excuse they took it i drew a frustrated breath holding it so i ran a red light it was yellow most of the way and i went a little fast on the interstate once but i suppose letting my exboyfriend run into me with a mack truck to help a vampire start his undead existence might be cause for a few points no one had died but the vampire thoughand he wanted to i fiddled with the button again and glenn took the hint warm air sifted in as the window whined down replacing the scent of my perfume with the aroma of cut grass jenks i called as he started the car lets go the rumble of the big car hid the clatter of jenkss wings as he zipped in sorry about the message rache he muttered as he landed on the rearview mirror dont sweat it i stretched my arm along the length of the open window not wanting to ream him out over it id taken enough flak from my brother for doing the same thing and i knew it hadnt been intentional i settled into the leather seats as glenn pulled onto the empty street it would stay empty until about noon when most of the hollows started to wake up my pulse was slow from the early hour and the heat of the day made me sleepy glenn kept his car as tidy as himself not an old coffeestained cup or clutter of paperwork marred the floor or backseat soooo i drawled around a yawn whats at the morgue besides the obvious glenn glanced at me as he yielded to a stop sign suicide but its murder of course it is nodding i waved at the is cruiser behind an overgrown bush then made a bunnyeared kisskiss to the small were in fatigues dozing on a bench in the sun watching them it was brett the militant were had been kicked out of his pack for having failed at kidnapping me a few months ago so of course i was the one he wanted to pack up with next it made sense in a warped sort of way i had bested his alpha therefore i was stronger david my alpha wasnt having anything to do with it seeing as he hadnt wanted a pack in the first place it was why hed bucked the system and started one with a witch in order to keep his job and so brett was reduced to lurking on the outskirts of my life looking for a way in it was flattering as all hell but depressing i was going to have to talk to david having a militant were attached to my chaotic life wasnt a bad idea and brett truly wanted someone to look to it was how most weres were put together davids protest that brett was trying to get in good with his original alpha by spying on me to see if i had the were artifact that had instigated the kidnapping attempt was crap everyone believed that it had gone over the mackinac bridge though in truth it was hidden in davids cat box jenks cleared his throat and when i glanced at him he rubbed his thumb and fingers together in the universal indication of money my eyes followed his to glenn hey i said shifting in my seat this pays right glenn smiled and irritated i sharpened my voice it does pay right chuckling the fib detective glanced in the rearview mirror at brett and nodded why he started and i interrupted he wants into my pack and david is balking i said whats so important about this body that you need me to look at it im a lousy detective its not what i do glenns square face was heavy with concern as he looked back at me from the were behind us shes a were the is says suicide but i think its murder and theyre covering it up i let the air pressure push my hand up and then down enjoying the breeze in my showerdamp hair and the feel of my bracelet sliding against my skin the is is covering up a murder big surprise there jenks looked happy silent now that we were working and the question of money had been raised though not settled standard consultant fee i said five hundred a day plus expenses glenn said and i laughed try double that ketchup boy i have insurance to pay and a church to sanctify and a living room to repair glenns attention on the road went distant for two hours of your time that would be what twofifty crap he wanted to go hourly i frowned and jenkss wings slowed to nothing that might pay for the paneling and the guys to put it in maybe okay i said digging through my bag to find the calendar datebook that ivy had given me last year it wasnt accurate anymore but the pages were blank and i needed somewhere to keep track of my time but you can expect an itemized bill glenn grinned what i said squinting from the comeandgo sun he lifted one shoulder and let it fall you look so organized he said and when jenks snickered i flung my hand out and bopped glenn on the shoulder with the back of my fist just for that no more ketchup for you i muttered slouching his grip on the wheel tightened and i knew id hit a sore spot aw dont worry glenn jenks teased christmas is coming ill get you a jar of bellybuster jalapeño that will knock your socks off if rachel wont pimp tomatoes to you anymore glenn shot me a sideways look um actually ive got a list he said fumbling in an inner coat pocket to bring out a narrow strip of paper with his distinctive precise handwriting on it my eyebrows rose as i took it hot ketchup spicy bbq sauce tomato paste salsa his usual you need a new pair of cuffs right he said nervously yeah i said suddenly a lot more awake but if you can get a hold of some of those zipstrips the is uses to keep ley line witches from invoking their magic thatd be great ill see what i can do he said and i bobbed my head satisfied though glenns stiff neck said he was uncomfortable bartering lawenforcement tools for ketchup i thought it funny that the stoic straitlaced human was too embarrassed to walk into a store that sold tomatoes humanity avoided them like the plague which was understandable seeing as a tomato had carried the virus that killed a sizable portion of their population four decades ago and revealed the supernatural species previously hidden by the sheer numbers of humans but he had been forced into eating pizza real pizza not the alfredo crap that humans serve and it had been all downhill from there i wasnt going to give him a hard time about it we all had our fears the fact that glenns was that he craved something every other human on the planet shunned was the least of my worries and if it got me some zipstrips that might someday save my life i thought as i settled back into the leather seats then its a secret well kept four the morgue was quiet and cool a quick shift from july to september and i was glad i had jeans on my sandals popped against the dirty cement steps as i descended sideways and the fluorescent light in the stairway only added to the bleak feeling jenks was on my shoulder for the warmth and glenn made a quick turn to the right when he reached the landing following the big blue arrows painted on the walls past wide elevators and to the double doors cheerfully proclaiming cincinnati morgue an equalopportunity service since between the underground dimness and glenns coffee still in my grip i was feeling better but most of my good mood was from the honesttogod temp name tag glenn had handed me when we started down the steps it wasnt the bent nasty yellow laminated fourbysix card everyone else got but a real heavyweight plastic tag embossed with my name jenks had one too and he was obnoxiously proud of it even though i was the one wearing it right under mine it would get me into the morgue when nothing else would well besides being dead i didnt do much for the fib but somehow i had become their darling the poor little witch girl who fled the is tyranny to make her own way they were the ones who had given me my car in lieu of monetary compensation when the is called foul after i helped the fib solve a crime that is hadnt been able to it had since been ruled that because i wasnt on the fibs payroll the fib could hire me much as any corporation or individual could nana na naaa na it was the small things that really made your day glenn pushed open one of the double doors standing aside so i could go in first flipflops plopping i scanned the large reception room more rectangle than square half of it empty floor half upright file cabinets and an ugly steel desk that should have been thrown away in the seventies a collegeage kid wearing a lab coat was behind it his feet on the papercluttered desk and a handheld game in his hands a sheetdraped gurney holding a body waited for attention but apparently some space aliens needed taking care of first the blond kid looked up at our entrance and after giving me the onceover set his game down and stood it smelled in here pine and dead tissue yuck yo iceman glenn said and jenks grunted in surprise when the straitlaced fib detective exchanged a complicated arm fist elbowslapping thing with the guy at the desk glenn the blond kid said still giving me glances youve got about ten minutes glenn slipped him a fifty and jenks choked thanks i owe you you cool just make it fast he handed glenn a key chained to a naked bitemebetty doll no way would anyone be walking out with the morgue key i gave him an ambiguous smile and headed for another set of double doors miss the kid called his adopted colorful accent dissolving into farmboy americana jenks snickered someone wants a date sandals scuffing i turned to find iceman following us ms morgan the guy said his eyes dropping to my twin name tags if you dont mind could you leave your coffee out here at my blank look he added it might wake someone up early and with the vamp orderly out getting lunch it would he winced it might be bad my lips parted in understanding sure i said handing it to him no problem immediately he relaxed thanks he turned back to his desk then hesitated ah you arent rachel morgan the runner are you from my shoulder jenks sniggered my arent we the famous one but i beamed facing the kid fully as glenn fidgeted he could wait i wasnt often recognizedand it was even more rarely that i didnt have to run away when i was yes i am i said enthusiastically shaking his hand pleased to meet you icemans hands were warm and his eyes gave away his delight ace he said jiggling on his feet wait here ive got something for you glenns grip on the bitemebetty doll tightened until he realized where his fingers were and he shifted his grip to the tiny key iceman had gone back to his desk and was rummaging in a drawer its here he said give me a sec jenks started humming the tune to jeopardy finishing when the kid slammed the drawer triumphantly got it he jogged back to us and i felt my face lose its expression when i saw what he was extending proudly to me a toe tag jenks left my shoulder shocking iceman out of a years growth when he landed on my wrist so he could see it i dont think hed even known that jenks was here holy crap rachel jenks exclaimed its got your name on it in ink even he lifted into the air laughing isnt that sweet he mocked but the guy was too flustered to notice a toe tag i held it loosely in my hand bemused uh thanks i managed glenn made a derisive noise from deep in his chest i was starting to feel like the butt of a joke when iceman grinned and said i was working the night that boat exploded last christmas i made it up for you but you never came in i kept it as a souvenir his cleancut face suddenly went nervous i uh thought you might want it relaxing in understanding i tucked it in my bag yes thank you i said then touched his shoulder so hed know it was okay thank you very much can we go in now glenn grumbled and iceman gave me an embarrassed smile before returning to his desk steps fast to make his open lab coat furl sighing the fib detective pushed open one of the double doors for me actually i was really glad to have the toe tag it had been made with the intent for use and therefore was imbued with a strong connection that a ley line charm could use to target me better i have it than someone else id get rid of it safely when i had the time past the door was another to make an airlock of sorts the smell of dead things grew and jenks landed on my shoulder standing right by my ear and the dab of perfume id put on earlier spend a lot of time down here i asked glenn as we entered the morgue proper fair amount he wasnt looking at me more interested in the numbers and index cards slid into the holders fastened to the peoplesize drawer doors i was getting the creeps id never been to the city morgue before and i dubiously eyed the arrangement of comfortable chairs around a coffee table at the far end that looked like a reception area at a doctors office the room was long having four rows of drawers on either side of the wide middle space it was storage and selfrepair only no autopsies necropsies or assisted tissue repair humans on one side inderlanders on the other though ivy had told me they all had pull tabs inside in case of accidental misfiling i followed glenn to midway down the inderland side watching him doublecheck the card against a slip of paper before unlocking the door and yanking it open came in monday he said over the sound of sliding metal as the tray slid out iceman didnt like the attention given to her so he gave me a call monday as in yesterday the full moon isnt until next week i said avoiding the sheetdraped body isnt that early for a were suicide i met his deep brown eyes reading a sad understanding thats what i thought too not knowing what i would see i looked down as glenn folded the sheet back holy crap jenks exclaimed mr rays secretary a sour expression fixed on me when had being a secretary become a highrisk position no way had vanessa committed suicide she wasnt an alpha but she was pretty damn close glenns surprise turned to understanding thats right his low voice rumbled you stole that fish from mr rays office irritation flickered through me i thought i was rescuing it and it wasnt his fish david said mr ray stole it first eyebrows bunched glenn seemed to think it made no difference she came in as a wolf he was saying his manner professional as his eyes lit on only the bruised and torn parts of her naked body a small but gorgeous koi tattoo swam in orange and black across a high patch of her upper chest a permanent sign of her inclusion into the ray pack standard procedure is to turn them back after the first look its easier to find the cause of death on a person than on a wolf the smell of dead things in a pine forest was getting to me it didnt help that i was running on empty the coffee wasnt sitting well anymore and id known the sop having briefly dated a guy who made the charms to force a shift back to human he was a geek but he had lots of moneyit wasnt an easy job and no one wanted it jenks was making a cold spot on my neck and not seeing anything out of the ordinaryother than her being dead and her arm torn to the bonei murmured what am i looking at nodding glenn went to a low drawer at the end of the room and after checking the tag pulled it open this is a were suicide that came in last month he said you can see the differences she would have been cremated by now but we dont know who she is two additional jane wolfs came in on the same night and theyre giving them a little extra time they all came in together i asked going over to look no he said softly gazing down at her in pity theres no connection other than the timing and that none of them can be found in the computer no ones claimed them and they dont match any missingpersons reportuswide from my shoulder came jenkss muffled voice saying she dont smell like a were she smells like perfume i winced when glenn unzipped the bag to show that the womans entire side had been ravaged selfinflicted he said they found tissue between her teeth its not uncommon though theyre usually a lot less brutal than this and simply open a vein and bleed out a jogger found her in an alley in cincinnati he called the pound the faint wrinkles around glenns eyes deepened with anger he didnt have to say that the jogger had been human jenks was quiet and i searched for cool detachment as i examined her she was tall for a were but not overly so big up top with shoulderlength hair that curled gently where it wasnt matted pretty no tattoos that i could see midthirties she took care of herself given the definition i wondered what had been so bad that she thought the answer was to end it seeing me satisfied glenn opened a third drawer this one was hit by a car he said as he unzipped the sturdy bag the officer recognized her as being a were and she made it to the hospital they actually had her turned back to treat her but she died creases appeared in his brow as he looked at her damaged body her heart gave out right on the table i forced my gaze down flinching at the bruises and skin split by the accident iv tips were still in her evidence of the efforts to save her life jane wolf number two had brown hair as well longer this time but it curled the same way she looked the same age and had the same narrow chin apart from a scrape on her cheekbone her face was untouched and she seemed professional and collected running in front of a car wasnt uncommon the were equivalent of a human jumper most times they werent successful landing under a doctors care where they should have been in the first place i followed glenn to a fourth drawer finding out why jenks was being so quiet when he gagged and flew to the trash can train glenn said simply his voice soft with regret coffee and lack of sleep were warring in me but id seen a demon slaughter and this was like dying in your sleep compared to that i think i was earning points with glenn as i looked her over trying not to breathe in the scent of decay the chill of the room couldnt stop it appeared as if jane wolf number three was as tall as the first woman and possessed the same athletic body build brown hair to her shoulders i couldnt tell if she had been pretty or not seeing me nod glenn zipped up the bag and shut the drawer closing all of them on his way back to vanessa not entirely sure why he had wanted me to see this i trailed behind him jenkss wings were silent as he returned and i gave him a sympathetic smile dont tell ivy i lost it he asked and i nodded they all smell the same he said and i felt him hold on to my ear for balance as he stood as close as he could to my perfumed neck jeez jenks they all look the same to me but i dont think he appreciated my attempt at humor glenns steps slowed to a halt and we gazed at mr rays secretary those three women were suicides he said the first one dying by selfmutilation as mr rays secretary appears to have died i think she was murdered then doctored up to mimic suicide i glanced at him wondering if he was looking for ghosts in the fog seeing my doubt he ran a hand over his short curly hair look at this he said leaning over vanessa and picking up a limp hand see he said his dark fingers circling her thin wrist in sharp contrast to her pale skin that looks like a bruise caused by restraints soft restraints but restraints they arent on the woman who made it to the hospital and i know they had to tie her down okay now i was interested maybe vanessa had been into sex games and it went too far leaning forward i agreed that the soft red ring could have resulted from a restraint but it was her nails that caught my attention they had been professionally manicured but the tips were split and ragged a woman considering suicide doesnt pay beaucoup bucks to get her nails done then tear them up before she can end her life properly where was she found i asked softly glenn heard my interest and flicked me a grin that quickly sobered under a dock in the hollows a tour group spotted her before she could get cold not wanting to be left out jenks flew from my shoulder to hover over her she smells like a were he proclaimed and fish and rubbing alcohol glenn twitched the sheet with which shed been covered in lieu of a bag all the way off her ankles have pressure marks too my brow furrowed so someone held her against her will and then killed her jenkss wings clattered theres a strand of medical tape caught in her teeth the breath glenn had taken to answer me exploded out of him youre kidding adrenaline pinged and feeling woozy i looked to see im not trained for this i said when glenn took a penlight from his pocket and motioned for me to hold her mouth open gingerly i took her jaw in my hands im not going to take a knife to her and poke around good he trained the light on her teeth i dont have authorization for that the squeak of the double doors pulled my head up jenks swore as i let go of vanessas jaw my swinging hand almost smacking him tension flashed to fear for an instant as i saw denon my old boss from the is standing in the middle of the floor like the king of the dead this is an inderland matter you dont have clearance to even look at her he said his honeysmooth voice rippling over my spine like water over rocks damn it all to hell i thought jerking my fear back he wasnt my boss anymore he wasnt anything but i was too deep underground to tap a line and i didnt like it the lowblood living vampire smiled to show his human teeth a startling white beside his ohsobeautiful mahogany skin iceman was behind him along with a second living vampire highblood this time by his small but sharp canines the scent of burgers and fries had come in with them and it looked like glenns fifty dollars had bought less time than hed hoped jenks rose in a hum of wings look what the cat dragged in and puked up he snarled it smells like it used to be something but i cant tell what rache fuzzy rat balls maybe denon ignored him as he ignored everyone he thought beneath his notice but i caught a twitch of an eye as he kept smiling trying to impress me with his mere presence glenn clicked off his penlight and tucked it away his jaw tensed unrepentant denon wasnt anything to be afraid of not that he ever had been and especially not now he was probably the reason i had lost my license though and that ticked me off with a practiced swagger the large muscular man came forward on catlight feet he was technically a ghoul a rude term for a human bitten by an undead and intentionally infected with enough of the vamp virus to partially turn him and whereas living highblood vampires like ivy were born to their status and envied for having a portion of the undeads strengths without the drawbacks a lowblood vampire was little more than a source of blood as they tried to curry the favor of the one who had promised them immortality denon clearly worked hard to build up his human strength and though his biceps strained his polo shirt and his thighs were heavy with ironpumping muscle he still fell short of his brethren and would until he died and became a true undead and that was contingent upon his sponsor remembering andor bothering to finish the job with denon taking the blame for ivys leaving the is with me that likelihood was looking slim his master had turned a blind eye and denon knew it it made him unpredictable and dangerous since he was trying to ingratiate himself back into his masters good graces the fact that he was working the morning shift spoke volumes though still beautiful he had lost the ageless look of one who feeds upon the undead it was likely they were still feeding on him though he had once overseen an entire floor of runners but this was the second time id seen him working the streets since leaving hows your car morgan his beautiful voice taunted and i bristled fine anger overpowered my fatigue to make me stupid the two techs slipped quietly out and i heard a soft conversation and the metallic clinks of a gurney being set up denons pupilblack eyes rose from the dead secretary come to see your handiwork he mocked and jenks lit us with a burst of light move off the corpse jenks i muttered coming out from behind the drawer to give myself room to move youre getting dust all over it denon smirked hiding his humansize teeth like the joke they were i put my hands on my hips and tossed my hair are you saying this isnt a suicide i taunted seeing a chance to irritate him cause if you say im responsible for her murder im going to sue your little brown candy ass from here to the next turn in a smooth motion glenn yanked the sheet over vanessa he hadnt said anything yet which i thought was remarkable since it had been only a year ago that he thought he didnt owe vampires any respect at all leave the needling to those who might survive it the evidence speaks for itself denon moved forward to force glenn and jenks back im releasing her to her next of kin for cremation move damn it back to the turn in a few hours everything would be gone even the paper and computer files thats why he was doing this at such an insane hour by the time everyone was at work itd be too late eyes narrowing i forced a laugh it was bitter and i didnt like the sound of it is that what youre doing now i mocked you been bumped to clerk denons eyes tried to go black it was stupid pushing him like this but i felt the lack of sleep keenly and i did have glenn beside me what was denon going to do the rattle of the gurney intruded and denon swaggered forward trying to shove glenn away with his presence glenn wasnt moving you cant take her the fib detective said putting a possessive hand on the top of the door this has become a murder investigation denon laughed but the two guys with the gurney hesitated and exchanged knowing looks its been ruled a suicide you have no jurisdiction the body is mine crap we didnt have anything yet and if we didnt find it wed look like fools until its been ruled a human didnt murder her i have all the jurisdiction i need glenn said she has pressure marks on her wrists she was held against her will circumstantial denons brown fingers reached for the drawer handle glenn didnt back down and the tension rose until jenkss wings were making a high whine i shuffled around in my bag and brought out my cell phone not that i could actually reach a tower down here we can have a court order in four hours your enthusiasm to destroy the evidence will be on it still want to release her jenks landed on my shoulder you cant get a court order that fast he whispered and sweat broke out on me yeah i knew it would take a day if i could get one at all but i couldnt just let denon walk out of here with the body denons jaw was gritted pressure marks dont mean shit jenks flew from me to hover over vanessa how about needle marks he said where i blurted crossing the room to look i dont see them the small pixy was smug cause theyre small pixysize needles like fiberoptics you can see the welt on the torn skin whoever drugged her tried to cover it up by tearing her arm as if it was a suicide but theyre there youll need a microscope to see them a grim smile twitched glenns lips and together we turned to denon the word of a pixy didnt mean squat in court but knowingly destroying evidence did the vampire looked ticked good id hate to think i was the only one having a bad morning get her arm looked at he said brusquely muscles hard with tension i want the report before the ink dries oh god i thought rolling my eyes could he have picked a more trite analogy glenn shoved the drawer closed locking it before handing the key to iceman jenks was hovering beside me and i said nothing smiling because i knew we were right and denon was wrong and the is was going to come out looking like idiots but denon chuckled surprising me you keep pissing people off morgan and before long the only people who will want to hire you are those homeless bridge trolls and miscreants dealing in black magic its your fault she died no one elses the blood drained from my face and jenks snapped his wings aggressively not only did denon know she had been murdered and was trying to cover it up but he was blaming me for it you son of a bitch jenks seethed and i moved my fingers to tell him to stay out of it i couldnt catch a pixy but maybe a ticked vampire could giving me a beautiful smile denon turned as confident and powerhungry as when he had come in jenks was a blur of wings and anger dont listen to him rachel this wasnt your fault it couldnt have been i looked at the covered corpse please god let it have nothing to do with me yeah i know i said hoping he was right there was no way my only connection to her was that fish and that had been settled she had been mr rays secretary not responsible for it at all and besides the fish hadnt been mr rays to begin with glenn put a comforting hand on my shoulder and we walked slowly to the double doors to allow denon time to leave the reception room held only iceman and a fading conversation filtering in from the hall i waited while glenn exchanged a few words with the orderly promising to come back for the paperwork after escorting me home vanessas body wouldnt be released now until murder had been ruled out but i wasnt finding any satisfaction in it the is was going to be really ticked if i blew one of their coverups goody goody tugging my bag back up my shoulder i waved to the edgy iceman and headed out with glenn jenks was silent glenn had my coffee in one hand my elbow in the other my thoughts were on vanessa while he guided me unseeing through the upper levels of the building and back into the sun i didnt say a word all the way home and the conversation between jenks and glenn lagged in their silence i thought i heard agreement that i might have been responsible in some way for the womans death but i couldnt i just couldnt have been i didnt look up from the dash until i felt the soothing shade of my street jenks muttered something and slipped out the open window before glenn brought the car to a stop i glanced up then finding the hazy morning slipping into the time of day i was usually just waking thanks for coming out with me glenn said and i turned to him surprised at the honest relief in his eyes officer denon gives me the creeps he added and i managed a smile hes a pushover i said gathering my bag onto my lap glenn pulled his eyebrows up if you say so at least vanessas body wont be destroyed and now ill have access to any record i want until human involvement is ruled out i think i can take it from here i huffed then why did you have me come out mr fib agent he grinned to show his teeth jenks found the needle marks and you distracted denon and got him to back down a court order he said chuckling i shrugged and glenn added hes afraid of you you know me i dont think so i fumbled for the door handle crap i was tired im still sending you a bill i said checking the time on the dashs clock uh rachel glenn said before i got out ive another reason i came over my motion to leave hesitated and looking unhappy he reached under the seat and handed me a thick folder held closed with a rubber band what is it i questioned and he gestured at me to open it setting it atop my lap i rolled the rubber band off and leafed through the file it was mostly photocopied newspaper clippings and reports from the fib and is concerning theft crimes spanning the entire north american continent and a few overseas in the uk and germany rare books magical artifacts jewelry with historical significance i felt myself go cold despite the july heat as i realized that this was nicks file call me if he contacts you glenn said his voice with a curious tightness to it he didnt like asking me but he was i swallowed unable to look at him he went off the mackinac bridge i said feeling unreal you think he survived that i knew he had he had called me when he realized hed swiped the fake were artifact from me and i had the real one a band fixed around my chest and squeezed crap thats what newt was looking for shit shit shitthis was why vanessa was murdered the is knew id possessed the focus once but they and everyone else thought it had gone over the bridge with nick sparagmos did the someone know that it had survived and was now killing weres to find out who had it oh god david i want this one rachel glenn said jerking me back to reality i know its nick i felt like i was wrapped in cotton and i knew my eyes were too wide when i turned to him i guessed he was a thief i didnt know until he left i didnt want to believe it i said soft pity was in his eyes i know you didnt my pulse leapt and i took a fast breath glenn touched my shoulder probably thinking it was the shock of finding out for sure that nick was a thief that had my hands shaking not that i knew what newt wanted and why vanessa had been murdered damn it shed been drugged and then murdered because she hadnt known anything about it telling glenn wouldnt do any good this was an inderland concern and he would only get himself killed i had to call david take it back before newt tracked it to him he couldnt fight a demon like i can i reached for the door latch my mind whirling thanks for the ride glenn i said my manners on autopilot whoa whoa whoa he said putting a dark hand on my arm are you going to be okay i forced myself to meet his eyes yeah ill be fine i lied this threw me is all his hand slipped away and i slid the folder onto the seat between us and got out to stand unsteadily on the sidewalk my eyes went to the house where ceri lived she was probably asleep but as soon as she woke up i was going to talk to her rachel maybe she knew a way to destroy the focus rachel sighing i leaned to look back into the car glenn was extending the folder to me shoulder muscles bunched from the weight of it keep it he said and when i moved to protest he added theyre copies you should know what hes done in any case hesitating i took them feeling its heavy bulk pulling me down into the sidewalk thanks i said not caring i shut the door and headed for the church rachel he called and i jerked to a stop and turned the visitor tags he prompted oh yeah i came back and set the file on the roof of the car while i removed the tags and handed them to him through the window promise me you wont drive until you finish your drivers ed he said in parting sure thing i muttered walking away it was out again the world knew the focus hadnt been lost and as soon as someone realized i still had it i was going to be in seriously deep shit five the hot morning had turned to rain by the time id gotten up again and it felt odd rising so close to sunset id gone to bed in a bad mood and i awoke with the same having been startled into consciousness by skimmer ringing the front bell at about four in the afternoon im sure ivy had answered it as fast as she could but going back to sleep was too much an effort besides ceri was coming over tonight and she wasnt going to find me in my underwear again my arm ached as i stood at the sink in my shorts and camisole and polished the copper teakettle ceris silent disgust at my kettle this morning had galvanized me into cleaning it she was going to help me sketch out another calling circle maybe in chalk this time so it wasnt as gross i was starting to look forward to miniass visit he might destroy the focus in exchange for my finding newt for him and after watching ceri bargain with al i wanted her help with minias that woman was more devious with her turns of phrase than trent i had called david before falling asleep and after a heated discussion that had emptied the church of every last pixy he flatly told me that if the murderer hadnt tracked the focus to him by now whoever it was probably wouldnt and moving it out of his freezer would only draw attention to it i wasnt convinced but if he wouldnt bring it to me id have to go get it meaning id be bringing it home on the bus or the back of ivys cycle neither of which was a good idea blowing a red curl out of the way i rinsed the kettle dried it and set it on the back burner it wasnt gleaming but it was better the cloying scent of polish was thick in the close air and since the rain had stopped i shoved the window open with two gritty fingers cool damp drifted in and i looked out onto the dark soggy garden as i washed my hands a frown settled as i saw my nails the polish ruined and green in the cuticles crap i just did them too sighing i set the dish towel aside and turned to the pantry i was starved and if i didnt eat something before ceri got here id look like a pig when i ate the entire bag of cookies intended for the occasion i stood in the walkin pantry staring at the cans of fruit bottles of ketchup and cake mixes in the tidy rows into which ivy organized our groceries shed probably label them if i let her i reached for the elbow macaroni and an envelope of powdered saucequick fast full of carbs just what the witch doctor ordered from the sanctuary came a thump and a light laugh reminding me i wasnt alone ivy had galvanized her old highschool roommate skimmer into moving the livingroom furniture to the sanctuary partly to make room for three guys and a toolbox to put the paneling up partly to put space between skimmer and me though skimmer was frustratingly nice she was piscarys lawyeras if being a living vampire wasnt scary enoughand i wasnt keen on being nice back to her dropping the saucepan on the stove i dug around under the counter until i remembered that jenkss kids were using the big pot as a fort in the garden bothered i filled my largest spell pot with water and set it on the stove mixing food prep and spell prep wasnt a good idea but i didnt use this one for spells anymorenow that it had a dent the size of ivys head in it i melted the butter for the sauce while the water warmed there was a burst of noise from the sanctuary and my shoulders eased at nins belligerent music the volume dropped and skimmers cheerful voice made a pleasant counterpoint to ivys soft response it struck me that though a living vampire skimmer was a lot like me in that she was quick to laugh and didnt let bad things bother her on the outsidea quality ivy seemed to need to balance herself out skimmer had been in cincinnati for a good six months out from california and a sympathetic vampire camarilla to get piscary out of prison she and ivy had met their last two years of high school on the west coast sharing blood and their bodies both and that not piscary was what had pulled skimmer from her master vampire and family i had met her last year when she started our relationship off firmly on the wrong foot by mistaking me for ivys shadow and as was polite making a courteous bid for my blood my motions to push the pat of butter around the saucepan slowed and i forced my hand from my neck not liking that id tried to cover the scar hidden there under my perfect skin the jolt of desire the woman had given me had been heady and shocking surpassed only by the embarrassment that she had misunderstood the relationship ivy and i had hell i didnt understand it expecting skimmer to in the first thirty seconds of meeting me was ridiculous i knew that ivy and skimmer had picked up where theyd left off which i think was the reason piscary agreed to take skimmer into his own camarilla if the pretty vampire could win his case and as i mixed the butter milk and sauce powder i wondered if piscary was starting to rue his leniency in letting ivy maintain a friendship with me that was based not on blood but on respect he probably expected skimmer to lure ivy back to a proper vampiric frame of mind ivy though had been a lot easier to live with the last few months as she slaked her blood lust with someone she loved who could survive her attentions she was happy guilty but happy i didnt think ivy could be happy if she didnt slather it with guilt and in the interim we could pretend that i wasnt feeling the first lure of blood ecstasy not pushing the issue because ivy was afraid our roles were reversed and i didnt have as much practice as ivy did at telling myself i couldnt have something i wanted the wooden spoon rattled against the pan as my hand trembled the thrill of adrenaline zinging through me at the memory of her teeth sliding cleanly into me fear and pleasure mixing in an unreal sensation filling me with the rush of ecstasy as if the memory had called her ivys lanky silhouette appeared in the hallway dressed in tight jeans and a shirt cut high to show her bellybutton ring she went to the fridge for a bottled water her motions to open it slowed as she scented the air realizing id been thinking about her or at least about something that would get my rush flowing and my pulse up pupils swelling she eyed me from across the kitchen that perfume isnt working anymore she said i hid my smile thinking i should just stop wearing it but pushing her into biting me again was a bad idea its an old one i said i didnt have anything else in the bathroom much to my surprise she shook her head and chuckled she was in a good mood and i wondered what she and skimmer had been doing in there besides rearranging the furniture not my business i thought turning back to my sauce ivy was silent as she took another swig leaning against the counter with her ankles crossed i felt her eyes rove the kitchen landing on the kettle shining dully on a back burner is ceri coming over she asked nodding i looked into the damp garden shadowed into an early dusk from the clouds shes going to help me with my calling glyph i glanced at her my spoon still circling clockwise clockwise never widdershins whats your schedule tonight im out and wont be back until almost sunup ive got a run in a motion of powerful grace she used one hand to ease herself up to sit on the counter you going to take jenks i asked wanting him here with me but my scaredycat fears came in second after a real job no ivy ran her fingers up through the downward spikes of her shorter hair in a show of nervousness telling me she was doing something for piscary not her bank account she was the master vampires scion and that came firstwhen it didnt involve me do you think that ugly statue is what that demon was after the focus running a finger over the spoon i licked it and set it in the sink what else could it be ceri says if newt knew that david had it she would have shown up at his apartment not here but im going to bring it back anyway someone in cincy knows its surfaced again my gaze went distant and a nasty feeling of betrayal settled into my belly besides ivy jenks and kisten the only person who knew i still had the focus was nick i couldnt believe he would have betrayed me like that but he had sold information about me to big al before and now he was pissed at me the water was boiling and i shook in enough macaroni for three leaning ivy dragged the open box of pasta to her what did glenn want she asked crunching through a dry piece breaking apart the clumps of macaroni i turned the flame down my opinion of a were murder it was mr rays secretary whoever did it tried to make it look like a suicide defined eyebrows high ivys gaze went to the calendar pinned to the wall beside her computer a week from the full moon no way was it a suicide and the is knows it i nodded i dont think they expected the fib to take an interest she had pressure marks from restraints and needle marks denon was covering it up ivys reach into the box for another piece of pasta hesitated you think it has something to do with the focus why not i said exasperated damn it id only had the ugly statue for two months and already word was out that it hadnt been lost going over the mackinac bridge tucking a strand of hair out of the way i stirred my pasta and tried to remember if id gone to see or even called david in all that time apart from the night i gave it to him i didnt think i had he was my alpha but it wasnt like we were married or anything crap this wasnt safe i needed to get it back from him like today i can ask around if you want ivy said swinging her boots up onto the counter to sit crosslegged with the box of pasta my thoughts jerked back to her absolutely not i said the less i dig the safer ill be besides well never get paid for it if you do find something she laughed and my mood eased ivy didnt laugh often and i loved the sound of it is that why youre thinking about nick she asked shocking me you never make pasta in alfredo sauce unless you are my mouth dropped open in protest then snapped shut crap shes right mmmm i said peeved as i stirred the pasta glenn gave me his file today its four inches thick really she drawled and i frowned she hadnt liked nick from day one yes really i hesitated watching the steam rise hes been at this awhile im sorry i forced my face into a bland expression she hated nick but she was genuinely sorry he had cracked my heart im over it and i was except for the part about feeling used hed been selling information to al about me for favors before we broke up ass nins only went soft and i wasnt surprised when skimmer came into the kitchen probably wanting to know what we were up to i felt more than saw ivys posture shift to a more closed mien when skimmers jeansclad dancers body breezed in ivy was as open with me as she was with skimmer but she wasnt comfortable letting skimmer know that we three had an odd dynamic one i wasnt keen on skimmer flatly loved ivy having moved here on the promise that if she got piscary out of prison shed be accepted into his camarilla and could stay i was the one who had put him there and the day he got out id probably find my life not worth troll farts ivy was a large part of why i was still alive which put her in a hard spot whose pressures slowly built with each court success skimmer would do what she had to do to stay with ivy i would do what i had to do to keep my body and soul together and ivy was going to go quietly insane wanting both of us to succeed it wouldve helped if skimmer werent so darn nice the perceptive vampire clearly recognized that shed interrupted something and tucking her long blond severely straight hair back behind an ear she settled herself into ivys chair at the table from the corner of my sight i saw her features scrunch up for a moment when she and ivy exchanged a look but then she smoothed them her small nose and chin easing into a pleasant expression beside skimmers delicate features i thought my strong jaw and cheekbones looked neanderthal though sharp as a cracked whip and at the top of her game the woman looked innocent with her blue eyes and west cost tan a trait that probably stood her in good stead in her profession when the competition underestimated her lunch she said brightly her pleasant voice showing a calculated hint of distress just white pasta i said going to drain the macaroni ive got enough for three if youre interested i turned from the sink finding that her vivid blue eyes had a shrinking iris of blue to make them even more striking her eyelashes were thick and long accentuating her delicate features i wondered what theyd been doing in the sanctuary there was more than one place to bite someoneand most of them were covered by clothes count me in she said glancing at her watch with its diamondchip numbers ive got an hour before i need to be back in the office and if im not there they can damn well wait for me that was coolseeing as she was the bossbut my blood pressure started clicking upward when she went to the fridge reaching above it for one of ivys brimstone cookies god i hated those things and i lived in worry that one day the is would have an excuse to search my kitchen and id be dragged off why dont we make it a real meal the vampire said clearly aware i was upset but determined to forge ahead ivy has a run tonight and ive got to get back to work it wont take much to make it a sitdown lunch right now if my pasta isnt enough for you then why did you say yes i thought nastily but i stifled my first reaction since i knew that the offer had been made out of a genuine attempt at camaraderie i glanced at the clock deciding there was plenty of time before ceri came over and when ivy shrugged i nodded sure i said why not skimmer smiled it was obvious she wasnt used to having anyone dislike her and it wasnt that i hated her but every time she came over she did something that rubbed me the wrong way through no fault of her own ill make garlic bread she said brightly hair swinging as she tugged open the cupboard door to the spices rachels allergic to garlic ivy prompted and the living vampire hesitated her eyes went to mine and i could almost hear her berate herself oh herb toast then with a forced cheerfulness she went to wash her hands i wasnt really allergic just sensitive to it thanks to that same genetic aberration that would have killed me had trents father not intervened ivy slid off the counter and after snapping the box of pasta shut started gathering salad stuff she was right next to skimmer and when their heads almost touched i thought i heard soft encouragement standing at the stove with my pasta i found i was beginning to feel bad for the woman she was really trying recognizing that i was important to ivy and making an effort to be gracious skimmer knew that ivy had once set her sights on me dropping her play for my blood after shed finally gotten it the encounters ending bad enough to scare her into never doing it again and it was no secret that i didnt give a flying flip that the two of them were sharing blood and a pillow both i think that that had a lot to do with skimmers attitude i was one of ivys few friends and skimmer knew that the quickest way to tick ivy off was to be mean to me vampires i thought shaking the pasta into the white sauce id never understand them how about some wine skimmer asked standing at the open fridge with a stick of butter in her hand red goes with pasta i brought some over today i couldnt drink red wine without risking migraines and ivy didnt drink muchnot at all before a run i opened my mouth to simply say none for me but ivy blurted rachel cant tolerate red wine shes sensitive to sulfur oh god skimmers pretty face was creased when she came out from behind the door im sorry i didnt know is there anything else you cant tolerate just you you know what i said dropping the lid on the finished pasta and turning the flame off im going to get some ice cream anyone else want ice cream not waiting for an answer i snatched up my shoulder bag and one of ivys canvas sacks and walked out of the kitchen ill be back before the breads done i called over my shoulder the echo of my sandals was different in the sanctuary and i slowed to see the cozy area ivy and skimmer had arranged in a front corner as temporary living room the tv would be lame since we didnt have cable out here but all i needed was the stereo skimmer mustve brought the floor plants since i hadnt seen them before damn vampire was just moving in and im having a problem with that irritated at myself now i shoved one of the thick doors open slipping out onto the wide stoop and shutting it hard the light over the sign was onto make the damp pavement shine rainsoft air caressed my bare shoulder but it didnt soothe me was i bothered because id begun to think of the church as mine or was it because skimmer was taking some of ivys attention do i really want to answer that my mood worsened when i passed my car in the carport couldnt drive my stupid car to the stupid corner store because of the stupid is i scanned the street for my packhopeful not finding brett maybe the rain had chased him off the man did have to work sometime the thump of the churchs front door shutting cut through the damp air and i turned with an apologetic look on my face but it wasnt ivy im coming with you skimmer said shrugging her lightweight creamcolored jacket and taking the steps two at a time swell i turned and started walking silent skimmer held her purse tight to herself as she matched me step for step a shade too close since the sidewalk wasnt that wide our feet splashed through a puddle and i glanced at her white boots though inappropriate for a runner to work in they looked great on her showing off her little feet what in hell does she want skimmer took a slow breath ivy and i met the day she moved into my dorm room whoa this is not what i had expected skimmer the cadence of her boots never slowed let me finish she said her cheeks spotted red in the occasional streetlight my old roommate was expelled and ivy moved in piscary had screwed her mind royally and her parents managed to get her out from under him for a few years so she could find an identity that didnt hinge on him i think it saved her life it damn well made her stronger she needed someone and i was there my pulse quickened and my pace slowed maybe i should hear this skimmers posture eased at my response her slight shoulders losing much of their tension we hit it off she said the black in her eyes swelling she was away from her master and parents with a year of mastervampire techniques at her fangtips i was looking for trouble my god it was fantastic but she scared me into settling down and i gave her something to believe in skimmer fixed her eyes on me she was straight until she met me apart from a few latent tendencies it took me two semesters to convince her that she could love me and kisten both without betraying him my light steps seemed to jar me to my bones and that was a good thing our pace had slowed becoming less angry skimmer was at the top of her class and i knew that anything she said would be slanted to scare me whatever she couldnt scare me any more than ivy had it was a private school skimmer said everyone lived on campus it was expected that as roommates ivy and i would share blood as a matter of convenience but it wasnt insisted on that we became lovers only meant thats the way we were i needed her to balance me out and she needed me to feel good about herself after piscary screwed her over the anger in her voice was shockingly hard you dont like him i said skimmer jerked the strap of her purse back up her shoulder as we walked i hate him but ill do whatever he asks if it means i can stay with ivy her eyes met mine the light from a nearby streetlamp glowing on her im going to get him out so i can stay with ivy if he kills you afterward its not my problem the threat was obvious but we kept moving her steps meeting mine solidly thats why she was being nice to me why risk getting on ivys bad side if piscary would take care of it i was shaking inside but skimmer wasnt done yet her pretty features knotted in an inner turmoil as she added bitterly she loves you i know shes using me to try and make you jealous i dont care flushed her eyes dilated she wants to share everything with you and youre kicking it in the dirt why do you live with her if you dont want her to touch you suddenly it was making a lot more sense skimmer youve got it wrong i said softly the night silent but for the wet hush of traffic a street over i want to find a blood balance with ivy shes the one balking not me her white boots scuffed to a halt and i stopped skimmer stared at me she always mixes sex with her blood she said uses it to keep control you wont do that ivy said so i wont have sex with her yeah but that doesnt mean we cant i hesitated why am i telling her this shock was clear on skimmers pale face and her outline came into sharp relief as a car passed us its lights throwing her into a stark reality that left the night darker when it passed you love her skimmer stammered my face flamed okay i loved ivy but that didnt mean i wanted to sleep with her skimmer hunched becoming almost ugly stay away from her she hissed ivys making the decisions here not me i said quickly shes mine skimmer shouted lashing out i moved instinctively without fear blocking and stepping forward to land a side kick in her middle she was a dancer not a martial artist and the kick landed it wasnt much but the vampire sat down hard on the wet sidewalk eyes watering as she caught her breath oh god i apologized reaching to help her up im so sorry skimmer gripped it yanking me off balance yelping i fell rolling across the wet grass and getting soaked the living vampire beat me to my feet but she was crying tears silently slipping down her face stay away from her she shouted shes mine nearby a dog barked frightened i tugged my shirt straight she isnt anyones i said not caring if the neighbors were listening i dont care if you two are sleeping together or sharing blood or whatever but im not leaving you selfish bitch she seethed and i backed up as she came forward staying without letting her touch you is cruel why do you live with her if you dont want her to touch you curtains were being pulled aside in the neighboring houses and i started to worry that someone might call the is because im her friend i said beginning to get mad shes just scared okay and a friend doesnt walk away when another friend is scared im willing to wait until she isnt god knows she waited for me she needs me and i need herso back off skimmer stopped her advance pulling herself up to look possessed calm and pissed you let her taste your blood what could you do that would scare her i was wet from hitting the grass and i looked up from my damp legs i trusted her so much that i wouldve let her kill me if jenks hadnt stopped her skimmer went even whiter skimmer im sorry i said gesturing helplessly i didnt plan this but youre sleeping with kisten she protested i can smell him all over you this was as embarrassing as all hell youre the one who taught her she could love two people at the same time not me with an abrupt motion skimmer turned on a heel and started back the way we came blond hair swinging and steps sharp actually that i was sleeping with kisten while wanting ivy to bite me was a twinge on my conscience but i figured between ivys fear and the vampiric mentality that multiple blood and bed partners were the norm i could deal with the issue when it became an issue i loved kisten i wanted ivy to bite me it made sense if i didnt think about it too hard depressed i scooped up my shoulder bag and ivys canvas sack if you jump me again ill freaking break your damn arm i muttered as i trailed behind her knowing she could hear me i didnt know where we stood but ice cream now sounded as appealing as eating a hot dog in the snow perhaps the encounter had been inevitable it could have been worse ivy could have heard us you okay i asked when i caught up to skimmer on the church steps the lights in the sanctuary making yellow swaths on the wet concrete giving me a sideways glance she felt her middle her expression a mix of sullen mistrust and anger i love ivy and ill do anything to protect her you understand me my eyes narrowed at the implication that i was a threat to ivy im not endangering her yes you are the womans narrow chin lifted as she stood a step above me if she kills you by mistake because you goad her into something she will never forgive herself i know her shell end it all to escape the pain i love ivy and im not going to let her kill herself neither am i i said hotly skimmers face emptied of emotion chilling me a quiet vampire was a plotting vampire yanking the door open she slipped in ahead of me great i think i had just put myself on skimmers hit list while i leaned against the wall and wedged off my sandals skimmer muttered something about the bathroom wiping her boots she clattered into ivys bathroom making an obvious amount of noise and slammed the door i followed the scent of warm bread into the kitchen my steps silent from being barefoot i found ivy at her computer buying music what flavor did you get she asked ah it started to rain i adlibbed and we decided it wasnt worth the effort it wasnt really a lie just looking at it from an expanded point of view ivy nodded eyes on the screen i had expected some sort of reaction but then i noticed that her boots were wet and i slumped crap shed seen the entire thing i took a breath to explain but her brown eyes flicked to mine halting me skimmer came in her cell phone in hand hey the office called she said the lie coming from her as easily as breathing they want me back early so im going to cut out on you you two go ahead and have lunch ill take a rain check ivy sat straighter youre headed into cincy skimmer nodded and ivy rose stretching mind if i get a ride from you she asked thats where my run is ivy glanced at me you dont mind do you rachel like i could really say anything go on i told her moving to the stove and stirring the cooling pasta my eyes drifted to the opened bottle of white wine ill give ceri a call maybe shell come over early ten to one they were both going to see piscary why didnt they just come out with it see you later rachel skimmer said tightly then headed to the front her boots loud ivy pulled her purse across the table my gaze dropped to her boots and when i brought them back up i saw a wisp of guilt i wont do it she said if i bite you itll blow everything we have into the everafter i shrugged thinking she was right but only if we were stupid about it if she had been listening then she also knew i was willing to wait besides to think that i could satisfy all of her blood lust was insane i didnt even want to try i only wanted to prove that i accepted her the way she was id just have to wait until she was ready to believe that youd better get going i said not wanting her to be here when minias showed up ivy hesitated in the threshold lunch was a good idea i shrugged without looking up and after a moments hesitation she walked out my eyes followed her wet prints and i frowned when i heard ivy say defensively i told you she did youre lucky she didnt hit you with anything other than her foot tired i slipped into my chair the scent of cooked pasta vinegar dressing and grilled bread heavy in the air i knew that ivy wasnt going to move out of the church which meant the only way skimmer was going to get ivy all to herself was if i was dead how nice was that six i thunked the sauce off the spoon when i heard the front door open and ceris voice soft in conversation jenks had gone to get her having come in when ivy and skimmer left he didnt like the thin blond vampire and had made himself scarce it was after sunset and time to call minias i didnt like the idea of kicking sleeping demons but i needed to reduce the confusion in my life and calling him was the easiest way to do that damn it what am i doing calling a demon and what kind of a life do i have when calling one is at the top of my todo list ceris steps were soft in the hallway and i turned to her smile when her pleasant laughter at something jenks said filled the kitchen she was wearing a summery linen dress in three shades of purple a matching ribbon holding her long almosttransparent hair up off her neck against the moist heat jenks was on her shoulder to look like he belonged there and rex jenkss cat was in her arms the orange kitten was purring her eyes closed and her paws wet with rain hello rachel the youngseeming woman said her voice carrying the slow relaxation of a damp summer night jenks said you needed some company mmmm is that herb bread ivy and skimmer were going to have lunch with me i said turning to get two wineglasses ah i hedged suddenly embarrassed and wondering if she had heard skimmer and me discussing things it fell through and now ive got a ton of food with only me to eat it ceris green eyes pinched in worry telling me she had nothing serious i shook my head thinking it could turn real serious real fast if skimmer worked at it at that the lithe elf smiled sashaying to the cupboard for two plates as if it were her kitchen id love to eat lunch with you keasley would be happy with fish sandwiches every night but honestly the man wouldnt know fine food if i put it on his tongue and chewed it for him the chatter about nothing lured me into a better mood and relaxing i fixed two plates of pasta in white sauce while ceri made herself tea with the special leaf she kept over here jenks sat on her shoulder the entire time and watching them together i remembered how jih his eldest daughter had taken to ceri i couldnt help but wonder if elves and pixies had a history of coexistence id always thought it odd that trent went to such great lengths to keep pixies and fairies out of his personal gardens almost like an addict removing the source of temptation rather than my first guess that he simply feared they might literally smell him out as an elf it was with a restored calm that i followed ceri to the sanctuary with my wineglass and plate to take advantage of the cooler space her tea was already on the coffee table between the suede couch and matching pair of armchairs in the corner i didnt know how she could stand the stuff when it was hot but seeing her in her lightweight dress i had to admit she looked cooler than i was in my shorts and chemise even though i had more skin showing must be an elf thing the cold didnt seem to bother her either i was starting to think it grossly unfair set to the side was my scrying mirror to etch the calling pentagram on my last stick of magnetic chalk more of that yew a ceremonial knife my silver snips a little white bag of sea salt and a rude sketch ceri had earlier drawn using ivys colored pencils ceri had brought out the bucket from the pantry too i didnt want to know i really didnt want to know the circle was going to be different from the one she had drawn on the floor just this morning a permanent connection i wouldnt have to invoke with my blood every time i wanted to answer it most of the stuff on the table was meant to get the curse to stick to the glass the soft clatter of our plates was pleasant as we arranged ourselves and i collapsed into one of the cushy chairs wanting to pretend for a few moments longer that this was just three friends getting together for lunch on a rainy summers night minias could wait i slid my plate onto my lap and picked up my fork enjoying the quiet setting the entire bottle of untouched red wine on the table beside her ceri took her teacup in her bandaged fingers and sipped graciously nervousness started to tickle and wind its way through my spine ruining my appetite jenks was heading to the honey ceri had put in her tea and the woman capped it putting it firmly out of his reach grumbling jenks flitted to the plants on my desk to sulk you sure this is safe i asked gaze flicking to the paraphernalia i didnt understand ley line magic and therefore distrusted it ceris eyebrows rose as she tore a chunk from her herbed breada strand of her hair drifting in the breeze from the open transom windows above the fixed stained glass dark with night its never safe to ask for a demons attention but you dont want this unsettled my head bobbed and i wrangled another blob of pasta on my fork it tasted flat and i set my fork down you think newt will come with him a soft flush showed on her no in all likelihood she doesnt remember you and minias wont allow anyone to remind her hes reprimanded when she strays i wondered what newt knew that was so terrible she had to forget it to stay halfway sane she took your circle i didnt think that was possible ceri delicately dabbed the corner of her mouth with a napkin to hide her fear newt does what she wants because no one is strong enough to hold her accountable she said my anxiety must have shown for she added its skill in this case newt knows everything its just a matter of her remembering it long enough to teach someone maybe that was why minias stuck with her despite the dangers he was picking things up bit by bit ceri reached for the remote and pointed it at the stereo it was a very modern gesture for such an old personality and i smiled if you didnt know shed spent a thousand years imaging as a demons familiar you might think she was a setinherways thirtysomething the soft jazz lifting through the air cut off the sun is down you should rescribe the calling circle before midnight she said brightly and my stomach twisted do you remember the figures from this morning they are the same i stared at her trying not to look stupid uh no ceri nodded then made five distinct motions with her right hand remember uh no i repeated having no idea what the connection was between the sketched figures and her hand motions and i thought you would do it scribe it i mean ceris breath escaped her in a long sound of exasperation its mostly leyline magic she said heavy on symbolism and intent if you dont draw it from start to finish then ill be the one who gets all the incoming callsand rachel i like you but im not going to do that i winced sorry she smiled but i caught a grimace when she didnt realize i was watching ceri was the nicest person i knew giving treats to children and squirrels and being polite to doortodoor solicitors but she had little patience when it came to teaching her abrupt temper didnt mix well with my scattered concentration and haphazard study habits flushing i set my plate aside and slid the cool sinkingintomylegs feeling of my scrying mirror onto my lap i wasnt hungry anymore and ceris impatience was making me feel stupid i reached for my magnetic chalk nervous im not very good at this i muttered which is why youre doing it in chalk then etching it in she said go on lets see it i hesitated looking at the big blank expanse of glass crap come on rache jenks coaxed dropping down to land on the mirror just follow me wings going full tilt he started to pace in a wide circle i arranged myself to follow his lead and ceri said pentagram first i jerked my hand from the glass right jenks looked up at me as if in direction and i felt a sinking sensation ceri set her plate down her disgust obvious you dont know a thing about this do you jeez ceri i complained watching jenks flit furtively to steal the smear of honey on ceris spoon i havent actually finished any leyline classes i know my pentagrams suck dishwater and i have no idea what those symbols mean or how to draw them feeling dumb i grabbed my wineglassthe white wine not the red ceri had brought outand took a sip you shouldnt drink when you work magic ceri said frustrated i set the glass down almost hard enough to spill then why is it out here i said a shade too loudly jenks eyed me in warning and i puffed my air out i didnt like feeling stupid rachel the woman said softly and i grimaced at the chagrin in her voice im sorry i shouldnt expect you to have the skills of a master when youre only starting out its just a stupid pentagram i finished for her trying to find the humor in it she reddened actually its merely that i wanted to get this done tonight oh embarrassed i looked at the blank mirror my reflection a gray shadow peering back at me it was going to look like crap i knew it the wine is a carrier for the invocation blood also washing the salt off the mirror when youre done ceri said and my gaze went to the bucket now understanding why shed brought it out the salt acts as a leveler removing the excess intent in the lines you scribe in the glass as well as bringing the acidic content of the yew back to a neutral state yew is toxic not acidic i said and she nodded apologetically but it will etch the glass once you coat it in your aura euwie it was one of those curses great im sorry for barking at you i said softly my gaze flicking to her and away i dont know what im doing and i dont like it she smiled and leaned across the table between us would you like to know the meaning behind the symbols i nodded feeling my tension ease if i was going to do this i really ought to they are pictorial representations of ley line gestures she said her hand moving as if signing in american sign language see she made a fist her thumb tight to her curled index finger angling her hand so that her thumb pointed to the ceiling this is the first one she added then pointed to the first symbol on the cheat sheet lying on the table it was a circle bisected by a vertical line the thumbs position is indicated by the line she added i looked from the figure to my fist turning my hand until they matched okay this is the second one she said making the okay sign angling her hand so the back of it was parallel with the floor i mimicked her feeling a stirring of understanding as i looked at the circle with three lines coming out the right side my thumb and index finger made a circle my three fingers stretching out like the lines fanned out from the figures right side i glanced at the next figure of a circle with a horizontal line and before she could shift her fingers i made a fist turning my hand so my thumb was parallel to the floor yes ceri said following the gesture with her own and the next would be thinking i compressed my lips and stared at the symbol it looked like the previous one with a finger coming out one side index finger i guessed and when she nodded i stuck a finger out earning a smile exactly try making the gesture with your pinkie and you can see how wrong it feels i tucked my index finger back and stuck out my pinkie it did feel wrong so i went back to the proper gesture and this one i asked as i looked at the figure in the last space there was a circle so i knew that something was touching my thumb but which finger middle one ceri offered and i made the gesture grinning she leaned back still smiling lets see them more confident now i made the five gestures reading them as i traveled around the pentagram clockwise this wasnt so hard and this middle figure i asked looking at the long baseline with three rays coming up from the center equidistant from each other it was where my hand had been when i contacted minias earlier and by the looks of it my fingertips would hit the ends of the lines thats the symbol for an open connection she said as if an open hand the inner circle touching the pentagram is our reality and the outer circle is the everafter youre bridging the gap with your open hand there is an alternate pattern with a series of symbols scribed between the two circles that will hide your location and identity but its more difficult jenks snickered still trying to scrape honey off ceris spoon i bet its harder too he said and we do want to finish before the sun comes up i ignored him feeling like i might be starting to understand this and the pentagram is simply to give structure to the curse ceri added trashing my good mood oh yeah i forgot it was a curse mmmm goody seeing my grimace ceri leaned over the table and touched my arm it is a very small curse she said her attempt to console me making things worse its not evil youre disturbing reality and it leaves a mark but truly rachel this is a small thing its going to lead to worse i thought then forced a smile ceri didnt have to help me with this i should be thankful okay pentagram first wings clattering jenks landed on the glass shivering once before he put his hands on his hips and peered up at me start here he said walking away and just follow me i looked at ceri to see if this was allowed and she nodded my shoulders eased then tightened the chalk felt almost slippery as it skated over the mirror like a wax pencil on hot stone i held my breath waiting for a tingling of rising power but there was nothing now over here jenks said when he lifted into the air and dropped down at a new spot i played connect the dots my lip finding its way between my teeth until a pentagram took up nearly the entire mirror my back was feeling the strain and i straightened thanks jenks i said and he lifted up his complexion red no prob he said as he went to sit on ceris shoulder now the symbols ceri prompted and i reached for the top triangle being careful not to smear my other lines not that one she exclaimed before the chalk could touch the glass and i jumped the lower left she added smiling to soften her voice when you scribe you want to rise clockwise she made a fist her eyes going to the cheat sheet this one first i glanced at the diagram then the pentagram taking a breath i held the chalk tighter just draw it rache jenks complained and as the hush of cars shushing against wet pavement soothed me i sketched them all my hand becoming more sure with each figure as good as i ceri praised and i leaned back and let my breath slip from me setting the chalk down i shook out my hand it was only a few figures but my hand was starting to ache i glanced at the yew and ceri nodded once it should etch the glass if you tap aline and let your aura slip into the glass she said and my face scrunched up do i have to i asked remembering the sinking uncomfortable feeling of my aura stripping away then i looked over the church shouldnt i be in a circle ceris hair floated when she leaned to stack our plates up no the mirror isnt going to take it all just a slip of it no harm in that she seemed confident but still i didnt like losing any of my aura and what if minias showed up or called in the meantime oh for the love of little green apples ceri said darkly if it will make this any faster i winced feeling like a chicken then jumped when she tapped the line out back and with a word of muttered latin set a loose circle jenkss wings hit a stillhigher pitch when the large bubble of blackcoated everafter shimmered into existence around us ceri was at the exact center as was the way with undrawn circles and i could feel the pressure of everafter against my back i scooted forward and jenkss wings hit a stillhigher pitch he finally settled himself on the table by the salt i knew he didnt like being trapped but after seeing ceris impatience i decided jenks was a big boy and could ask to be let out himself if it bothered him that much ceris circle was held with only her will completely undrawn and entirely from her imagination it wouldnt hold a demon but all i wanted was something to keep nebulous influences out while my aura was not protecting my soul why ask for trouble and with that in mind i earned a huff of indignation when i picked up the phone and took out the batteries an incoming call could open an opportunistic path youre not going to lose all your aura she said moving our stacked plates aside yeah well i felt better and as much as i liked ceri and respected her knowledge i was going to fall back on my dads admonishment never to practice high magic without a protection circle around you demon curses probably fell under that umbrella so it was with a lot more confidence that i plucked the makeshift stylus of yew from the table and tapped a line through ceris circle the energy spilled inwarm comforting and a little too fast for my liking and i tilted my head and cracked my neck to hide my unease my chi seemed to hum and my fingers about the yew cramped briefly i flexed them and a tingling ran from my center to my fingertips id never felt anything like it before while spelling but then i was drawing a curse you okay jenks asked and i blinked brushing my hair from my eyes and nodding the line seems warm tonight i said and ceris face went empty warm she questioned and i shrugged her eyes grew distant in thought for a moment and then she gestured to the chalkmarked scrying mirror my eyes fixed on the chalklines and with no hesitation i reached for the pentagram the stick of yew touched the glass resting on my lap and with a shudder my aura pooled out of me like icy water i gasped at the sensation my head jerking up finding ceris ceri jenks shouted shes losing it the damn thing just left her the elf caught her alarm fast but not so fast i didnt see it shes fine she said getting up and fumbling for the chalk on the table rachel youre fine just sit tight dont move frightened i did exactly that listening to my heart pound as she drew a circle inside her original one and invoked the more secure barrier immediately my smutdamaged aura had colored my reflection and i tried not to look at it the click of the chalk hitting the table was loud and ceri sat across from me her legs tucked under her and her back straight continue she said and i hesitated that wasnt supposed to happen i said and she met my eyes a hint of shame in them youre fine she said looking away when i did this so i might screen als calls i wasnt making such a deep connection i erred in not making a secure circle im sorry it was hard for the proud elf to apologize and knowing that i accepted it with no lingering feelings of i told you so i didnt know what in hell i was doing so it wasnt as if i could expect her to get it all right but i was glad i had insisted on a circle very glad i turned my gaze back to the mirror trying to keep my focus shallow so i wouldnt look at my reflection i felt dizzy without my aura unreal and my stomach was knotting the scent of burnt amber rose to tickle my nose as i drew the lines of containment and i squinted seeing the faint haze of smoke on both sides of the glass where the yew was burning the mirror its supposed to do that right i asked and ceri murmured something positivesounding the red curtain of my loose hair blocked my view but i heard her whisper something to jenks and the pixy flew to her i shivered feeling naked without my aura i kept trying not to glance into the mirror as i scribed the haze of my aura looking like a mist or glow around my dark shadow of a reflection the oncecheerful pure gold color of my aura had been tainted with an overlaying black of demon smut actually i thought as i finished the pentagram and started on the first of the symbols the black gives it more depth almost like an aged patina yeah sure a rising of tingles cramped my hand as i finished the last symbol exhaling i started on the inner circle relying on the points of the pentagram to guide me the haze of burning glass grew thicker distorting my vision but i knew the instant my starting point and ending point met my shoulders twisted when i felt a vibration chime through me first in my extended aura in the mirror and then in me the inner circle had been set and it seemed to have been etched onto my aura by way of marking the glass pulse quickening i started on the second circle this one too resonated upon completion and i shivered when my aura started to leave the scrying mirror pulling the entire figure into me and carrying the curse with it salt it rachel before it burns you ceri said urgently and the white drawstring bag of my sea salt edged into my tunnel vision my fingers fumbled at the ties and i finally closed my eyes to make better progress that way i felt disconnected my aura was coming back painfully slowly seeming to crawl over my skin and soak in layer by layer burning i had a feeling that if i didnt finish this before my aura came entirely back it was really going to hurt the salt made a soft hush as it hit the glass and i flinched at the feeling of unseen cold sand rasping against my skin not bothering to tracing the patterns i dumped it all my heart pounding as the weight of it hitting the mirror seemed to make my chest heavy the bucket appeared at my feet and the wine at my kneesilently unobtrusively hands shaking i scrabbled for my bigass symbolic knife pricking my thumb and dropping three plops of red into the wine as ceris voice hovered at the edge of my awareness and told me what to do whispering guiding instructing me how to move my hands how to finish this thing before i passed out from the sensations the wine cascaded over the mirror and a moan of relief slipped from me it was as if i could feel the salt dissolve into the glass bonding to it sealing the power of the curse and quieting it my entire body hummed the salt in my blood echoing with the power settling into new channels and going somnolent my fingers and soul were cold from the wine and i shifted them feeling the last of the gritty salt wash away ita prorsus i said repeating the words of invocation as ceri gave them to me but it wasnt until i touched my winewet finger to my tongue that it actually invoked the wave of demon smut rose from my work hell i could see it looking like a black haze bowing my head i took iti didnt fight it i took itaccepting it with a feeling of inevitability it was as if a part of me had died accepting that i couldnt be who i wanted so i had to work at making who i was someone i could live with my pulse jumped then settled the air pressure shifted and i felt ceris bubbles go down from above us came the hint of a bell resonating in the belfry the unheard vibrations pressed against my skin and it was as if i could feel the curse imprinting itself on me in smaller gentler waves pushed by sound waves so low they could only be felt and then it was done and the sensation was gone inhaling i focused on the winedamp mirror in my hands a glistening drop of red hung then fell to echo in the salted wine inside the bucket the mirror now reflected the world in a dark winered hue but that paled next to the doublecircled pentagram before me etched in a stunning crystalline perfection it was absolutely beautiful catching and reflecting the light in shades of crimson and silver all glittery and faceted i did this i said in surprise and looked up i blanched ceri was staring at me with her hands on her lap jenks on her shoulder it wasnt that she looked scared just really really worried i shifted my shoulders feeling a light connection from my mind to my aura that hadnt been there before or perhaps i was more sensitive to it does it get better i said concerned by ceris lack of response what she asked and jenkss wings blurred sending a strand of her hair flying i glanced at the bucket of salted wine next to mehardly remembering pouring it on the mirrorthen set the glass on the table my fingers parted from it but it was as if i still felt it with me the feeling of connection i said uncomfortably you can feel it jenks squeaked and ceri shushed him her eyebrows knitting together i shouldnt i asked as i wiped my hands on a napkin and ceri looked away i dont know she said softly clearly thinking of something else al never said i was starting to feel more like myself jenks came forward and i kept wiping my hands dabbing the damp off you okay he asked and i nodded discarding the napkin and pulling my legs up to sit crosslegged i tugged the mirror to sit atop my lap it made me feel like i was in high school playing with a ouija board in someones basement im fine i said trying to ignore the fact that i thought the white crystalline pattern i had made on the glass was absolutely beautiful lets do this i want to be able to sleep tonight ceri stirred drawing my attention to her her angular features were drawn and she looked frightened by a sudden thought ah rachel she stammered standing up would you mind if we waited just until tomorrow oh god i did it wrong what did i do i blurted reddening nothing she rushed reaching out but not touching me youre fine but you just readjusted your aura and you probably ought to go through an entire sun cycle to settle yourself before trying to use it the calling circle i mean i looked at the mirror then her ceris face was unreadable she was hiding her emotions and doing a damn fine job of it id done it wrong and she was mad she hadnt expected all my aura to slid off but it had crap i said disgusted i did it wrong didnt i she shook her head but she was gathering her stuff up to leave you did it correctly i have to go i have to check on something i hurried to get up knocking the table and almost spilling my glass of white wine when i set the mirror down ceri ill do better next time really im getting better at this youve helped me so much already i said but she stepped out of my reach disguising it as swooping forward for her slippers i froze scared she didnt want me to touch her what did i do slowly she halted still not looking at me jenks hovered between us outside i could hear the neighbors yelling friendly goodbyes and a horn beeping reluctantly her eyes met mine nothing she said im sure the reason your aura all spilled out was because your blood invoked it and not another demons as was in my case when i was bound to als account to field his calls for him you need to let your aura settle in firmly before using the curse is all a day at least tomorrow night i took in jenkss worry he had heard the lie in her voice too either she was making up the reason my aura pooled out or she was lying about the need to wait to call minias one scared the crap out of me and the other was just bewildering she doesnt want to touch me she turned to go and i glanced at the calling circle beautiful and innocentlooking on my coffee table reflecting the world in a winestained hue wait ceri what if he calls tonight ceri stopped head bowed she came back put her hand atop the middle figure with fingers spread wide and murmured a word of latin there she said glancing hesitantly at me ive put a do not disturb notation on it it will expire at sunup she took a deep breath seeming to make a decision this was necessary she said as if convincing herself but when i nodded agreement her features pinched in what looked like fear thank you ceri i said bewildered and she slipped out the front door and closed it without a sound i heard her feet slap the wet pavement as she ran then nothing i turned to jenks still hovering what was that all about i asked feeling very unsure maybe she cant admit she doesnt know why your aura pooled out he said coming to sit on my knee when i flopped back into the couch and propped my arches on the edge of the table or maybe shes mad at herself for almost exposing you without your aura he hesitated then said you didnt get a hug goodbye i reached for my glass and took a sip feeling a tingling rise up through my winestained aura almost as if responding to what id just drank slowly the sensation faded i thought back to ceris circle dropping and the feeling of the bell resonating through me when the curse had invoked it had felt good satisfying that was okay wasnt it jenks i said wearily i wish someone would tell me what in hell is going on seven the afternoon sun was warm on my shoulders bare but for the straps of my chemise last nights rain had left the ground soft and the moist heat hovering an inch or so over the disturbed earth was comforting i was taking advantage of it by tending my yew plant having an idea that i might make up some forget potions in case newt showed again all i needed now was the fermented lilac pressings it wasnt illegal to make forget charms just use them and who would fault me for using one on a demon the soft plunk of a cut tip dropping into one of my smaller spell pots was loud and with my face turned to the earth i knelt before the tombstone it was growing out of and sent my fingers lightly among the branches harvesting the ones growing inward to the center of the plant ceris reaction to my auras pooling out last night had left me very uneasy but the sun felt good and i took strength from that i might have made a strong connection to the everafter but nothing had changed and ceri was right i needed a way for minias to contact me without having to show up this was safer easier a grimace crossed my face and i turned my attention from pruning to pulling weeds to widen the circle of cleared earth easy like a wish and wishes always came back to bite you glancing at the angle of the sun i decided i ought to call it good and get cleaned up before kisten came over to take me to my driversed class i stood slapping the dirt from my jeans and gathering my tools my gaze expanded from the singular vision of the pollutionstained grave marker to the wider expanse of my walled graveyard the domestic hollows beyond that and even farther the tallest buildings of cincinnati across the river i loved it here a spot of stillness surrounded by life humming like a thousand bees i headed for the church smiling and touching the stones as i passed recognizing them like old friends and wondering what the people they guarded had been like there was a small flurry of pixies by the back door to the church and i picked my way to it curious as to what was up my faint smile widened when the snap of dragonfly wings turned into jenks the pixy circled me looking good in his casual gardening clothes hey rachel are you done over there he said by way of greeting my kids are dying to check out your gardening skirting the circle of blasphemed ground encompassing the grave marker of a weeping angel i squinted at him sure just tell them to watch the oozing tips that stuff is toxic he nodded his wings a gossamer blur as he went to my other side so i wasnt looking into the sun they know he hesitated then with a quickness that said he was embarrassed blurted are you going to need me today i looked up from my uneven footing then back down no whats up a smile full of parental pride came over him and a faint sparkle of gold fell as he let some dust slip its jih he said in satisfaction my pace faltered jih was his eldest daughter now living across the street with ceri to build up a garden to support her and a future family seeing my worry jenks laughed shes fine but shes got three pixy bucks circling her and her garden and wants me to build something with them so she can see how they work then make her decision from that three i adjusted my grip on my spell pot good lord matalina must be tickled jenks dropped to my shoulder i suppose he grumbled jih is beside herself she likes them all i just stole matalina and didnt bother with the traditional seasonlong supervised courtship jih wants to make a dragonfly hut poor guy who wins is going to need it i wanted to look at him but he was too close you stole matalina yup if we had jumped through all the hoops we never would have gotten the front entry way gardens or the flower boxes my eyes went to my feet and i picked my path so i wouldnt jar him he had dropped tradition to gain a sixbyeight swath of garden and some flower boxes now he had a walled garden of four city lots jenks was doing well well enough that his children could take time from their life for the rituals that marked it its nice that jih has you to help her i said i suppose he muttered but i could tell he was eager for the chance to guide his daughter in making a good decision in whom to spend her life with maybe thats why i keep making such stellar decisions in my own love life i thought smirking at the idea of jenks coming out on a first date with me and grilling the poor guy then i blinked he had warned kisten to behave himself when i went out with him that first time damn had kisten gotten jenkss stamp of approval the gust from jenkss wings cooled the sweat on my neck hey i gotta go shes waiting ill see you tonight sure i said and he rose up tell her i said congrats he gave me a salute and darted off i watched him for a moment then continued to the back door imaging the grief he was going to put the three young pixy bucks through the heavenly scent of baking muffins was slipping out the kitchen window and breathing deeply i climbed up the few stairs i checked the bottoms of my sneakers stomped my feet and entered the tornapart living room three guys and a toolbox had yet to show up and the smell of splintered wood mixed with the scent of baking my stomach rumbled so i headed into the kitchen it was empty but for the muffins cooling on the stove and after dropping my cuttings by the sink i washed my hands and eyed the cooling bread apparently ivy was up and in the mood to bake unusual but i was going to take advantage of it juggling a muffin and the fish food i fed myself and mr fish both then pulled a dark green tshirt on over my chemise and collapsed into my chair happy with the world i startled at the sudden skittering of claws and an orange ball of feline terror streaked into the kitchen and under my chair pixies spilled in a swirling storm of highpitched screeching and whistles that made my skull hurt out i shouted standing get out the church is her safe place so get out pixy dust thickened to make my eyes water but after the loud complaints and muttered disappointment the disney nightmare subsided as quickly as it had come smirking i peered under my chair rex was huddled her eyes black and her tail fluffed the picture of fear incarnate jenks must already be at jihs since his kids knew hed bend their wings backward till they slipped dust if he caught them teasing his cat whats the matter sweet pea i crooned knowing better than to try to pet her did those nasty pixies bother you eyes averted she hunched down content to stay where she was snorting i carefully settled back feeling like the great protector rex never sought me out for attention but when danger threatened i was where she ended up ivy said it was a cat thing whatever i reached for my nail polish taking careful bites of breakfast between touchup swipes a soft scuffing in the hallway brought my attention up as ivy came in and i smiled she was dressed in her exercise tights and had a light sheen of sweat on her what was all that about she asked going to the stove and wedging a muffin out of the tin mouth full i pointed under my chair oh poor kitty she said sitting in her spot and dropping her hand to the floor disgust puckered my brow when the stupid cat padded to her head up and tail smoothed my annoyance deepened when rex jumped into her lap settling down to stare at me the cat suddenly turned to the hallway and a sharp rapping of heels grew loud eyes wide i looked at ivy but my question was answered when skimmer breezed in brushed tidied and looking as perfect as an uncut wedding cake in her stark white shirt and black slacks when did she get here i thought then flushed she never left last night i glanced at ivy deciding i was right when my roommate dumped rex out of her lap and found great interest in her emails opening them up and throwing out the spamavoiding me hell i didnt care what they did together but apparently ivy did hi rachel the slight vampire said then before i could answer she bent to give ivy a kiss ivy stiffened in surprise and i blinked when ivy pulled away before it could turn passionatewhich was clearly where skimmer had intended it to go recovering smoothly skimmer headed for the muffins ill be done with work about ten tonight she said putting one on a plate and sitting carefully between us do you want to meet for an early dinner ivys face was creased in annoyance at the attempted kiss skimmer was doing it to bother me maybe scare me off and ivy knew it no she said not looking from her monitor ive got something planned like what i thought deciding that skimmers and my relationship was probably going to nosedive like a brick with wings this was really really not anything i was prepared for skimmer carefully broke her muffin in two then got to her feet to find a knife and the butter leaving them by her plate she moseyed to the coffeemaker her steps carrying the presence and power of the courtroom damn im in trouble coffee ivy she asked the sun blinding on her shirt crisp and pressed for the office sure thanks feeling the tension rex slunk out wish i could here you go sweets the vamp said bringing ivy a cup it wasnt the oversize mug with our vampiric charms logo on it that ivy liked but maybe she used them because i did ivy jerked back when skimmer tried to steal another kiss instead of being upset the woman confidently sat down again to meticulously butter her muffin she was pulling both ivys and my strings fully in charge though ivy was the more dominant of the two i wasnt going to leave because she was trying to make me uncomfortable feeling my blood pressure rise i settled myself firmly in my chair it was my kitchen damn it youre up early the blond blueeyed vamp said to me as if it meant something i fought to keep my eyes from narrowing did you make these i asked raising what was left of my muffin skimmer smiled to show her sharp canine teeth yes i did theyre good youre welcome i didnt say thank you i shot back and ivys hand on her mouse paused skimmer ate her muffin watching me with unblinking eyes and slowly widening pupils my scar started tingling and i stood im going to shower i said irate that she was giving me the creeps but i did need to get cleaned up ill alert the media skimmer said licking the butter suggestively from her finger i went to tell her to shove it up her ass and lay an egg with it but the front doorbell rang and my manners stayed intact thats kisten i said then grabbed my shoulder bag i was clean enough and the last thing i wanted was three vampires in my kitchen and me naked in the shower im outta here ivy broke from her computer clearly surprised where are you going i glanced at skimmer feeling a blush rise drivers ed kistens taking me oh how sweet skimmer said and i gritted my teeth refusing to respond i headed for the hallway and the door dirty knees or not a sharp snap jerked me to a stop and i turned catching a blur of motion skimmer was red clearly shocked and chagrined but ivy was smug something had happened and ivy arched an eyebrow at me in a dry amusement the front doorbell clanked again but i wasnt a good enough person to walk out of here now without saying something you going to be around tonight for dinner ivy i asked cocking my hip maybe it was mean but i was mean ivy took a bite of her muffin crossing her legs and leaning forward ill be in and out she said wiping the corner of her mouth with a pinkie but ill be here about midnight okay i said lightly ill see you later i beamed at skimmer now sitting primly but obviously torn between seething and sulking bye skimmer thanks for breakfast youre welcome translation choke on it bitch the doorbell rang a third time and i hustled down the hallway my good mood restored coming i shouted fussing with my hair i looked okay it was only a bunch of teenagers i plucked jenkss aviator jacket from the post in the foyer and shrugged into it just for looks the coat was a remnant from his stint at being peoplesize id gotten his jacket ivy had gotten his silk robe and wed thrown out his two dozen toothbrushes shoving the door open i found kisten waiting his corvette at the curb he didnt work much until after sunset and his usual trendy suit had been replaced with jeans and a black tshirt tucked in to show off his waist smiling with his mouth closed to hide his sharp canines he rocked from heel to toe in his boots with his fingers jammed in his front pockets tossing his dyedblond hair out of his blue eyes with a practiced motion that said he was most assuredly all that what made it work was that he was you look good i said my free hand slipping between his trim waist and his arm using him for balance as i leaned up and in for an earlyafternoon kiss hello right there at the threshold eyes closing i breathed deeply as his lips met mine intentionally bringing in the scent of leather and the incense that clung to vampires as if it were a second skin he was like a drug throwing off pheromones to relax and soothe potential blood sources we werent sharing blood but who was i to not take advantage of a thousand years of evolution you look dirty he said when our lips parted i fell back to my heels my smile growing to meet his when he added i like dirty youve been in the garden eyebrows rising he tugged me back into him angling us into the darker foyer am i early he said the richness of his voice under my ear sending a shiver through me yes thank god i replied enjoying the mild rush i liked kissing vampires in the dark the only thing better was being in an elevator descending to certain death i was blocking his way into the sanctuary and when he realized i wasnt going to invite him in his grip on my upper arms hesitated your class isnt until onethirty you have time to take a shower he said clearly wanting to know why i was rushing out the door maybe if you help me i thought wickedly unable to stop my grin he caught my look and as a spark of titillation zinged through me his nostrils widened to take in my mood he couldnt hear my thought but he could read my pulse my temperature and considering the randy look i knew i had it wasnt hard to figure out what was on my mind his fingers tightened and from the hallway came ivys voice hi kist not dropping his gaze kisten answered morning love not bothering to take out the heat rebounding between us she snorted the soft sound of her bathroom door closing a clear indication that she was all right with the relationship kisten and i had despite their old boyfriendgirlfriend status if he touched my blood things would get nasty which was why kisten wore caps on his teeth when we slept together but if i was going to be sharing my body with someone other than ivy shed rather it be with kisten and thats where we were ivy and kistens relationship was more platonic these days with a little blood thrown in to keep things close our situation had become a balancing act since she had tasted my blood and swore never to touch it again but she didnt want kisten touching it either unable to give up the hope we could find a way to make it work even as she denied it was possible defying his usual submissive role kisten had told ivy hed risk it i succumbed to temptation and let him break my skin but until then we could all pretend that everything was normal or whatever passed for normal these days lets just go i said my ardor cooling at the reminder that this screwedup situation would hold steady as long as the status quo didnt change chuckling he let me push him to the door but skimmers obvious throat clearing turned him from pliable vampire to immovable rock and i slumped in defeat when her sultry voice echoed in the sanctuary good morning kisten kistens smile widened as his gaze flicked between the two of us clearly sensing my exasperation can we go i whispered eyebrows high he turned me to the door hi dorothy you look nice today dont call me that you sob she said her voice scathing across my back as i slipped out before kisten apparently skimmer felt about kisten the same way she did about me i wasnt surprised we were both threats to her subordinate claim on ivy neither of us was a true obstacleme stymied by ivy and kist because of their pastbut try telling her that multiple blood and bed partners were the norm for vampires but so was jealousy i took a deep breath as the door shut behind us squinting in the sun and feeling my shoulders ease it lasted all of three seconds until kisten asked skimmer sleep over i dont want to talk about it i grumbled that bad eh he added taking the steps lightly beside me i glanced longingly at my convertible then back to his corvette shes not being nice anymore i complained and kisten picked up his pace to gallantly open the door before i could reach for the handle giving him a smile of thanks i slipped in settling myself in the familiar confines of his leatherscented incenserich car god it smelled good in here and i closed my eyes and leaned back while kisten went around to his side i kept them shut even as he buckled himself in and started his car willing myself to relax talk to me he said when he started into motion and i was still silent a hundred thoughts sifted through me but what came out was skimmer i hesitated she found out that ivys the one not allowing a blood balance between us not me his soft sigh drew my attention the sun glinted on his stubble and i stifled an urge to touch it i watched his gaze flick behind us to the church through the rearview mirror depressed i rolled my window down and let the morning breeze shift my hair and he prompted as he gunned it pulling out ahead of a blue buick trailing smoke holding my hair away from my eyes i frowned shes gotten nasty trying to drive me away i told her ivys just scared and that im waiting until she isnt so skimmers gone from i want to be your friend because ivys your friend to suck my toes and die kistens grip on the wheel tightened and he hit the brakes a little too hard at the stoplight realizing what id said i flushed i knew hed rather have me lusting after a bite from him but if i let him bite me ivy would snap im sorry kisten i whispered he was silent staring at the red light reaching out i touched his hand i love you i whispered but letting you bite me would tear everything apart ivy couldnt take it jenks would say that my saying no to kisten had more to do with the threat of his biting me being a bigger turnon than the actual bite might be whatever but if kisten found a closer relationship with me when ivy couldnt it would hurt her and he loved her too with the fanatical loyalty shared abuse often engenders piscary had warped them both from my bag came the trill of my phone but i let it ring this was more important the light changed and kisten pulled into traffic his grip more relaxed ivy had always been the dominant one in their relationship but he was willing to fight for me if i was ever tempted enough to give him my blood trouble was saying no had never been my strong suit i courted disaster every time i slept with him but it made for great sex and i never said i was smart actually it was pretty stupid but wed been over that before depressed i let my arm hang out the window and watched the hollows turn from homes to businesses the sun glinted dully on my bracelet and its distinctive pattern of links ivy had an anklet in the same pattern id seen a few others around cincy here and there earning shrugs and smiles when i tried to hide mine i knew they were probably kistens way to show the world his conquests but i wore it nevertheless so did ivy skimmer wont hurt you kisten said softly and i turned to him not physically i agreed relieved he was handling this as well as he was but you can be sure shes going to put extra love in her petition to get piscary out he sobered at that and quiet filled the car at the thought of what might happen if she succeeded wed both be up shit creek kisten had been piscarys scion betraying the master vampire the night id beaten piscary into submission piscary was ignoring that right now but if he got out i was sure hed have a thing or two to say to his exscion even if kisten had been the one keeping piscarys business ventures intact since ivy wouldnt her scion status aside my phone rang again digging it out i looked to see that it was an unfamiliar number before i set it to vibrate i was with kisten and taking the call would be rude you arent mad i offered hesitantly watching the emotion on his face shift from worry about his physical being to that of worry for his emotional state mad that youre attracted to ivy he said the sun flashing over him as we crossed the bridge my face warmed and he pulled his hand from mine to manage the thicker traffic no he said his eyes slightly dilating i love you but ivy since leaving the is and you moving in with her shes never been happier more stable besides he said settling himself suggestively if this keeps up i might have a chance at one hell of a threesome my mouth dropped open and i swatted him no way hey he said laughing though his eyes were firmly on the traffic dont knock it until youve tried it i crossed my arms before me and looked straight out the window not going to happen kisten but when i met his eyes i could tell he had only been teasing me i think dont make plans this friday he said as we stopped at yet another light i stifled a huge smile but inside i was singing he remembered why i asked feigning ignorance he smiled and i lost my battle to remain unmoved im taking you out for your birthday he said ive got reservations for the carew tower restaurant get out i exclaimed my eyes darting to the top of the building in question ive never been up there to eat i squirmed gaze going distant as i started to plan i dont know what to wear something that comes off easy he suggested a horn blew behind us and not looking kisten accelerated all ive got is stuff with lots of snaps and buckles i teased he went to say something but his phone rang i frowned when he reached to take it i never took calls when we were together not that i got that many to begin with but i wasnt trying to run cincys underworld for my boss either snaps and buckles he said as he flipped open the top that might work too smile fading he said into his phone this is felps i settled back feeling good just thinking about it hey ivy whats up kisten said and i straightened then remembering my phone i pulled it out and looked crap id missed four calls but i didnt recognize the number right beside me kisten said glancing at me and a flicker of concern rose sure he added then handed the phone to me oh god now what feeling like id heard a shoe fall i said is it jenks no ivys irate voice said and i relaxed its your were david i stammered and kisten pulled into the driving schools parking lot hes been trying to reach you ivy said her tone both bothered and concerned he saysare you ready for thishe says hes killing women and he doesnt remember look will you call him hes called here twice in the last three minutes i wanted to laugh but couldnt the were murder the is was covering up the demon tearing my living room apart for the focus shit okay i said softly thanks bye rachel her voice had changed i was upset and she knew it i took a breath trying to find a glimmer of calm yes i could tell by her hesitation that she wasnt fooled but she knew that whatever it was i wasnt running scared yet watch yourself she said tightly call me if you need me my tension eased it was good to have friends thanks i will i hung up glanced at kistens expressive eyes waiting for an explanation then jumped when my phone sitting in my lap vibrated taking a breath i picked it up and looked at the number it was davids i recognized it now you going to take that kisten asked his hands on the wheel though we were parked in the next spot over i watched a girl slam the door to her mothers minivan ponytail bobbing and mouth going nonstop she chatted as she headed to class with a friend they disappeared past the glass doors and the woman behind the wheel wiped at her eye and watched through her rearview mirror kisten leaned forward to get into my line of sight the phone vibrated again and a sour smile lifted the corners of my mouth as i flipped the phone open somehow i didnt think i was going to make my class eight davids hand trembled almost imperceptibly as he accepted the glass of cold tap water he held it to his forehead for a moment as he gathered his calm then sipped it and set it on the solid ash coffee table before us thank you the small man said then put his elbows on his knees and dropped his head into his hands i patted his shoulder and eased farther from him on his couch kisten was standing next to the tv back to us as he looked over davids collection of civil war sabers in a lighted locked cabinet the faint scent of were tickled my nose not unpleasant at all david was a wreck and i alternated my attention between the shaken man dressed in his suit for the office and his tidy clearly bachelor town house it was the usual two stories the entire complex about five to ten years old the carpet probably hadnt ever been replaced and i wondered if david rented or owned we were in the living room to one side past the landscaped buffer was the parking lot to the other through the kitchen and dining area was a large common courtyard the other apartments far enough away that it granted a measure of privacy by pure distance the walls were thick hence the silence and the classy wallpaper done in browns and tans said he had decorated it himself owned i decided remembering that as a field adjustor for were insurance he was paid very well for getting the true story from reluctant policy owners trying to hide the reason their christmas tree had spontaneously combusted and took out their living room though his apartment was a calm spot of peace the were himself looked ragged david was a loner having the personal power and charisma of an alpha without the responsibilities technically speaking i was his pack a mutually beneficial agreement on paper that helped prevent david from being fired and gave me the opportunity to get my insurance at a devastatingly cheap rate that was the extent of our relationship but i knew he used me to keep were women from insinuating themselves into his life my gaze landed on the fat little black book beside his phone apparently that didnt slow him down when it came to dating dang he needed a rubber band to keep the thing shut better i said and david looked up his beautifully deep brown eyes were wide with a slow fear looking wrong on him he had a wonderfully trim body made for running disguised under the comfortable suit clearly he had been on his way to the office when whatever threw him into such a tizzy happened and it worried me that something could shake him like this david was the most stable person i knew his shoes under the coffee table shone and he was cleanshaven not even a hint of black stubble marring his sundarkened somewhat rough skin id seen him in a floorlength duster and dilapidated hat once while he had been stalking me and he had looked like van helsing his luscious black hair was long and wavy and his thick eyebrows made a nice statement he had about the same amount of confidence of the fictional character too but right now it was tempered with worry and distraction no he said his low voice penetrating i think im killing my girlfriends kisten turned and i held up a hand to forestall the vampire from saying anything stupid david was nothing if not levelheaded and as an insurance adjustor he was quick savvy and hard to surprise if he thought he was killing his girlfriends then there was a reason for it im listening i said from beside him and david took a slow breath forcing himself to sit upright if still on the edge of the couch i was trying to find a date for this weekend he started glancing at kisten for the full moon kisten interrupted earning both my and davids annoyance the full moon isnt until monday the were said and im not a college werejockey high on bane crashing your bar i have as much control over myself on a full moon as you do obviously it was a sore spot and kisten raised a placating hand sorry the tension in the room eased and davids haunted eyes went to his address book by the phone serena called me last night asking me if i had the flu he looked up at me then away which i thought strange since its summer but then i called kally to see if she was free and she asked me the same thing kisten chuckled you dated two women in one weekend davids brow creased no they were a week apart so i called a few other women seeing as i hadnt heard from any of them in almost a month in high demand are you mr peabody kisten i muttered not liking the reference to the old cartoon stop it davids cat was peering at me from the top of the stairway i didnt even try to coax it down depressed david wasnt cowed at all by the living vampire not here in his own apartment yes he said belligerently i am actually you want to wait on the veranda kisten raised a hand in a gesture of whatever but i had no trouble believing that the attractive midthirties were had women calling him for dates david and i were comfortable leaving our relationship at the business level though i found it mildly irksome that he had issues with the differentspecies thing but as long as he respected me as a person i was willing to let him miss out on a good slice of the female population his loss apart from serena and kally i couldnt reach one his eyes went to his black book as if it were possessed none of them so you think theyre dead i questioned not seeing the reason for the jump of thought davids eyes were haunted ive been having really weird dreams about them he said my girlfriends i mean im waking up in my own bed clean and rested not mudcaked and naked in the park so i never gave them much thought but now kisten chuckled and i started wishing id left him in the car theyre avoiding you wolfman the vampire said and david pulled himself straight ire giving him strength theyre gone he muttered i watched warily knowing that kisten was too savvy to push him too far but david was erratic right now either they dont answer their phone or their roommates dont know where they are his eyes slipped to mine haunted those are the ones that im worried about the ones i couldnt reach six women kisten said now standing at the window wall that looked out on a small patio thats not bad half of them probably moved in a month and a half david said caustically then as if galvanized by the admission he went to the kitchen his pace fast with nervous energy my eyebrows rose david dated six women in as many weeks weres werent any more randy than the rest of the population but remembering his reluctance to settle down and start a pack i decided it probably wasnt that he couldnt keep a girlfriend but rather that he was content playing the field playing the pro field jeez david theyre missing he said standing in his kitchen as if having forgotten why he went in there i think i think im blanking out and killing them my gut clenched at the lost sound of his voice he really believed he was killing these women well there you go kisten said someone found out youre a player and called the rest youve been stung mr peabody he chuckled time to start a new black book david looked insulted and i thought kisten was being unusually insensitive maybe he was jealous you know what i said spinning to kisten you need to shut up hey im just saying david jerked as if remembering why he had gone into the kitchen popping open a tin of cat food and shaking it onto a plate before setting it on the floor rachel would you refuse to talk to a man youd slept with even if you were mad at him my eyebrows rose he hadnt just dated six women in six weeks hed slept with them too uh i stammered no id want to give him a piece of my mind at the very least head lowered david nodded theyre missing he said im killing them i know it david i protested seeing a hint of concern on kistens face weres dont black out and kill people if they did they wouldve been hunted into extinction hundreds of years ago by the rest of inderland theres got to be another reason they arent talking to you because i killed them david whispered hunched over the counter my gaze drifted to the ticking wall clock twofifteen id missed my class it doesnt add up i said coming to sit at a barstool do you want me to have ivy track them down shes good at finding people looking relieved he nodded ivy could find anyone given time she had been retrieving abducted vamps and humans from illegal blood houses and jealous exes since leaving the is it made my familiar rescues look vapid but we each had our own talents my motions shifting the stiff barstool back and forth slowed since i was here i ought to see about taking the focus home with me anyone who cared to look it up would know that i belonged to davids pack being a loner and trained to react to violence david was a hard target anyone he worked with though oh shit i said then put a hand to my mouth realizing id said it aloud both kisten and david stared at me uh david did you tell your dates about the focus his confusion turned to a soft anger no he said forcefully kisten glowered at the smaller man you mean to tell me you nipped six women in six weeks and you never showed them the focus to impress them davids jaw clenched i dont need to lure women to my bed i ask them and if theyre willing they come showing them wouldnt have impressed them anyway theyre human i pulled my elbows off the counter my face warming in indignation you date humans you wont date a witch because you dont believe in mixedspecies parings but youll sleep around with humans you big fat hypocrite david pleaded with me with his eyes if i dated a were woman shed want to be a part of my pack weve been over this before and since weres originally came from humans my eyes narrowed yeah i got it i said not liking it weres came from humans same as vamps but unlike becoming a vamp the only way to become a were was to be born one usually my thoughts zinged back to yesterday morning and being woken by a demon tearing my church apart looking for the focus ohhhh shit i thought remembering to keep my mouth shut this time missing girlfriends three unidentified bodies in the morgue athletic professional and all with a similar look they were brought in as weres but if what i thought happened had happened they wouldnt be in the were database but the human suicides from last months full moon david im so sorry i whispered and kisten and david stared at me what david said wary not distraught i looked helplessly at him it wasnt your fault it was mine i shouldnt have given it to you i didnt know all you had to do was have it in your possession i never would have given it to you if i did he looked blank at me and feeling nauseous i added i think i know where your girlfriends are its my fault not yours david shook his head give me what the focus i said my face wrinkled in pity i think it turned your girlfriends his face went ashen and he put a hand to the counter where are they he breathed i swallowed hard the city morgue nine two trips to the morgue in as many days i thought hoping i wasnt starting a pattern my gardening sneakers were silent on the cement davids steps beside and a little behind me were heavy with a deep depression kisten was behind him and the vampires obvious unease would have been funny if we werent trooping down here to identify three jane wolfs the focus was in my bag now silent and quiescent this far from the full moon it still held the chill from davids freezer and made a cold spot against me experience said that next monday it would have shifted from a bone statue of a womans face to a silversheened wolfs muzzle dripping saliva and making a highpitched squeal only pixies could hear i have to get rid of this thing maybe i could use it to pay off one of my demon marks but if newt or al sold it in turn to someone else and it started an inderland power struggle id feel responsible we reached the end of the stairway and with the two men trailing behind me i turned smartly to the right and followed the arrows to the double doors hi iceman i said smacking the left side of the swinging door open and striding in as if i owned the place the young man sat up pulling his feet from his desk ms morgan he said holy cow you gave me a start kisten slunk in after me eyes darting everywhere come here often he asked when the kid behind the desk put down his handheld game and stood all the time i quipped extending my hand to meet icemans grip dont you no icemans attention flicked from me to kisten finally lingering on david standing with his hands at his sides his enthusiasm to see me dimmed as he realized we were here to identify someone oh uh hey he said his hand slipping from mine its great to see you but i cant let you in there unless you have someone from the is or the fib with you he winced sorry detective glenn is on his way i said feeling bouncy for some reason sure i was here to identify a corpse or three but i knew someone kisten didnt and that didnt happen often relief turned him back into a young kid who should be serving smoothies at the mall not morgue minding good he said youre welcome to sit on a gurney while you wait i glanced at the empty gurney against the wall ah i think ill stand i said this is kisten felps i added then turned to david and david hue david pulled himself together and finding a professional air came forward with his hand extended pleasure to meet you he said rocking back as soon as their handshake ended how how many jane wolfs do you get on average a month his voice carried a hint of panic and iceman went closed sitting back behind his desk im sorry mr hue i really shouldnt david held up a hand and turned away head bowed in worry my good mood vanished a sharp cadence of hardsoled shoes in the outer hallway brought our attentions up and i puffed in relief when glenns powerfully built frame came through the door his thick hand holding the heavy metal easy and his dark skin and pink fingernails standing out against the stark whiteness of the chipped paint he was in his usual coat and tie the butt of a pistol showing past his jacket angling himself he slipped in almost sideways so he wouldnt have to open the door entirely rachel he said as the door swung shut his gaze lit on david and kisten eyebrows settling into a closed cast of fib officialness davids confidence had degraded into depression and kisten was nervous i was getting the distinct impression he didnt like it down here hi glenn i said conscious of my lessthanprofessional appearance in sneakers faded green tshirt and dirtmarked jeans thanks for letting me get you out from behind your desk you said it was about the jane wolfs how could i refuse davids jaw tightened the reaction wasnt missed by glenn and his gaze softened now that he understood why david was here i could feel kisten behind me and i turned to him glenn this is kisten felps i said but kisten had already pushed forward smiling with his lips closed weve met kisten said grasping glenns hand and giving it a firm shake well in a manner of speaking you were the one that downed the waitstaff at piscarys last year using rachels splat gun glenn said suddenly nervous i didnt kisten released his hand and stepped away no you didnt tag me but i saw you during the wrapup good shooting accuracy is hard to find when your life is on the line glenn smiled to show his flat even teeth he was the only fib guy i knew besides his dad who could talk to a vamp without fear and knew to bring breakfast when knocking on a witchs door at noon no hard feelings glenn asked shrugging kisten turned to the double doors leading to the hallway we all do what we have to do its only on our days off we get to be ourselves you arent kidding i thought wondering what kind of a mess kisten was going to find himself in if piscary got out i wasnt the only one the master vampire had unfinished business with and while piscary could hurt kisten while he was still in prison i had a feeling that the undead vampire enjoyed drawing out the fear of the unknown he might forgive kisten for giving me egyptian embalming fluid to incapacitate him seeing the betrayal as the act of an unruly rebellious child maybe me he was just ticked at his shoes scuffing david came forward david david hue he said eyes pinched can we please get this over with glenn shook his hand his expressive face turning to a professional detachment i knew he used so he could sleep at night of course mr hue he said the fib detective glanced at iceman and the college kid tossed him the bitemebetty doll with the key catching it the rims of the upright meticulous fib officers ears darkened in embarrassment rachel kisten murmured as we all headed that way ah if you can get a ride home with david i need to fly on out of here i stopped glenn turned from holding the door open for me through it i could see the comfortable seating arrangement and icemans work partner puttering around with a clipboard peering over his glasses at us kisten is afraid of the dead kisten i coaxed not believing it i had wanted to stop at the big cherry on the way home to pick up glenns tomato fix at a charm shop for the lilac wine and just about anywhere for a box of birthday candles for me in the hopes that a cake might be in my future but kisten backed up a step really he said i have to go theres some rare cheese coming in today and if im not there to sign for it ill have to go to the post office and pick it up rare cheese my ass and i hate not having my own car hip cocked i took a breath to complain but david interrupted with an easy ill get you home rachel kistens eyes were pleading giving up i muttered go on ill call you later he jiggled on his feet his usual poise gone to make him look charmingly vulnerable leaning in he gave me a quick kiss on my neck thanks love he whispered his hand on my shoulder tightened and with a quick hint of teeth he sent a spike of desire to my core stop that i whispered gently pushing him away and feeling myself flush grinning he retreated with a selfassured nod to the rest of the men he stuck his hands into his pockets and sauntered out lord help me i thought pulling my hand down from my neck i had the feeling hed just used me to restore his confidence sure he was afraid of the dead but i was his girlfriend and apparently proving it in front of three other guys had reaffirmed his masculinity whatever my face was still warm when glenn cleared his throat what i muttered as i entered before him hes my boyfriend mmmmhmm he murmured back shaking the bitemebetty doll to make the key jingle the living vamp intern checking tags left at glenns look it was just us and whatever newly dead vamps were cooling their heels until dark david was cracking his knuckles when glenn stopped beside a drawer eyeing the were you think you know these women he said and i bristled there had been more than a hint of distrust his need to have someone to blame for their deaths coming to the fore yes i interjected before david could open his mouth he has a couple of girlfriends he cant reach and since he was holding something for me that the right person would kill to get we thought it better to check it out so we could sleep at night david seemed relieved at my explanation but glenn wasnt happy rachel he said as his short fingers worked the key but he didnt open the drawer they are weres technically this isnt a fib matter if someone calls foul i could be in a lot of trouble i could sense davids rising fear and anticipation and i wondered if that was why kisten had left though not directed at him it would have pushed his buttons just open the drawer i said starting to get mad you really think i should bring denon into this hed have david in the tower and under a spotlight and besides i said praying i was wrong if im right then this is a fib matter glenns brown eyes narrowed and with davids brow pinched the fib detective opened the drawer i glanced down at the harsh sound of the bag opening seeing the pretty woman in a new light imagining her fear and the pain of turning into a wolf and not having a clue god she must have thought shed been dying thats elaine david breathed and i took his arm as his balance wobbled glenn tripped into detective mode his gaze bright and his stance stiffer more threatening i told him to be quiet with my eyes his questions could wait we had two more pandora boxes to open god im sorry david i said softly wishing glenn would shut the drawer as if hearing my unspoken request he slowly slid elaine away davids face was pale and i had to remind myself that though he could take care of himself and was no slouch when it came to confidence these were women he had known intimately show me the next one he said the thickening scent of musk in the closed air glenn ripped a jotted note from his daily planner and tucked it in behind the id card before going to the next my stomach was in knots this wasnt looking good not only was there the problem that david was involved in the accidental deaths of three women but now i was going to have to explain to the fib why they had human birth certificates crap on toast how in hell was i going to handle this every master vamp in the country every alpha with delusions of grandeur was going to be after me the former to destroy the focus the latter to possess it pretending to throw it off the mackinac bridge wasnt going to work a second time maybe maybe it had been a fluke maybe elaine had been a were and shed only told david she was human knowing he wouldnt date a bitch glenn unlocked the second drawer and when we were arranged he unzipped the bag i watched david instead of glenn i knew the answer when his eyes closed and his hand trembled felicia he whispered felicia borden he reached to touch her his trembling fingers brushing her brown hair im sorry felicia i didnt know im so sorry what what did you do to yourself his voice cracked and i darted a glance at glenn the fib officer nodded david was ready to lose it we had better get the hard part over fast come on david i soothed taking his arm and pulling him a step back one more david broke his gaze from her and glenn swiftly shut the drawer with the sound of scraping metal the only one left was the woman who had been hit by a train it probably hadnt been a suicide most likely she had snapped under the strain of a first transformation without pain relief or understanding blindly fleeing in search of an answer or perhaps she had been lost in the glories of her newfound freedom and had misjudged her new capabilities i almost hoped it was the latter tragic though it would be i didnt like the idea that she had gone insane it would only mean that much more guilt for david i stood with david to the right of the last drawer realizing he was holding his breath i slipped my hand into his it was cool and dry i think he was starting to go into shock glenn opened the last drawer reluctantly clearly not eager to show david the ruin of the womans body oh god david moaned turning away my eyes pricking with tears and feeling helpless i put my arm over his shoulder and led him to the informal seating area where relatives waited for their kin to awaken his back was hunched and he moved without thought grasping the back of a chair before falling into it he slipped out from under me and i stood over him as he put his elbows on his knees and dropped his head in to his hands i didnt mean it to happen he said his voice sounding dead its not supposed to happen its not supposed to happen glenn had shut the last drawer and was making his way to us with an aggressive fib swagger back off i warned him i see where youre going but he didnt kill those women then why is he convincing himself he didnt david is an insurance adjustor not a killer you said it yourself they were suicides david made a harsh sound of inner pain turning to him i touched on his shoulder ah hell im sorry i didnt mean it like that he didnt lookup as he said flatly they were all alone they had no one to help them to tell them what to expect that the pain would go away his head rose and he had tears in his eyes they went through that alone and it was my fault i could have helped them they would have survived if i had been there david i started but his face abruptly lost its expression and he rose i have to go he stammered i have to call serena and kally a moment mr hue glenn said firmly and i gave him a dirty look davids face was white and his small but powerful build was tense i have to call serena and kally he exclaimed and iceman peeked in past the door my hands out in placation i insinuated myself between glenn and the distressed were david i soothed gently resting my hand on his arm theyll be okay its a week before the full moon i turned to glenn my voice hardening and i told you to back off his eyes narrowed at my harsh tone but though he was the fibs inderland specialist i was an inderlander back off i insisted then lowered my voice lest i wake someone up this is my friend and you will cut him some slack or so help me glenn ill show you what a mean mad witch is capable of glenn clenched his jaw i glared right back at him id never pulled my magic on him before but we had come down here to answer the question of whether the focus was turning humans into weres not submit to a homicide charge david i said eyes on glenn sit down detective glenn has a few questions god i hope i have some answers both men relaxed and after iceman let the door shut behind him i sat as well and crossed my legs as if i were the hostess of this nice little party david resumed his seat but glenn continued to stand and glower down at me fine they were his wrinkles then i started thinking crap i wasnt smart enough to come up with a convincing lie id have to tell him the truth i hated that wincing i pulled my gaze to glenns hey uh i stammered can you keep a secret i thought of the sleeping vamps glad the drawers were soundproof too bad they werent smellproof glenn exhaled as if deflating his attitude changing from that of an aggressive stymied fib officer to the neighborhood cop on the corner since its you rachel ill listen for awhile okay that was fair since i had threatened to bop him with my magic i glanced at david and seeing him leaving it all to me i clasped my hands in my lap the reason you cant find those women in the database is because they arent in the inderland files glenns eyebrows rose theyre in the human files i said almost able to hear the bolts slidingmy life shifting to a new probably shorter path the fabric of glenns suit made a soft sound as he turned human but they came in as weres yes i finished i pulled my shoulder bag to my front to sit on my lap but i wasnt going to tell him i had the focus hed probably insist on taking it and when i refused hed get all testosteroneladen and then id get all witchy best to avoid it i liked glenn and every time i flexed my magic i usually lost a friend from beside me came davids emotionless voice i turned them i didnt mean to his head came back up believe me i didnt want this to happen i didnt think it could happen it cant glenn said anger coloring his confusion if this is your idea of a joke he didnt believe me dont you think i could come up with a better story if i was jerking your chain i said i have rent to make and im not going to waste my day down here in the morgue i glanced over the sterile surroundings as nice as it is down here the large man frowned humans cant be turned into weres its a fact and forty years ago humans believed it was a fact that there were no vampires or pixies what about fairy tales i said in the old ones a bite could make a were well theyre true and the proof is that you will find those women in the human database but glenns face said he wasnt buying it head drooping i said to the floor see theres this demoncursed statue god it sounds so lame i gave it to david to hold for me because hes a were and jenks said it was giving him a headache its bad magic glenn whoever has it has the ability to turn a human into a were the weres want it and the vamps will kill anyone to destroy it to maintain the balance of inderland power i brought my gaze up and though he was listening i could tell he wasnt ready to give up his secure belief i had assumed there was some sort of additional ritual needed to turn a human feeing guilty i touched davids arm apparently not you bit them glenn accused i slept with them davids voice had a defensive edge i have to go i have to call serena and kally glenns hand fell to rest on the butt of his weapon i would have taken offense but i didnt think he realized it look i said exasperated remember this may when the riots broke out in the mall between the vamps and the weres glenn nodded and i scooted to the front of my chair not liking his hand on his weapon well it was because three were packs thought i had this were artifact and they were trying to flush me out his eyes widened he was starting to believe and if it gets out that it didnt go over the mackinac bridge but is in cincinnati turning women into weres im going to be a dead witch walking i hesitated again the fib officer exhaled long and slow but i couldnt tell what he was thinking thats why mr rays secretary was murdered isnt it he said gesturing behind him to the drawers probably i said in a small voice but david didnt do it damn it denon was right her demise was sort of my fault miserable i pulled my gaze from the drawer it landed on david slumped and struggling to come to grips with the deaths of three women if this got out we both were dead my attention rose to glenn youre not going to tell anyone right i asked you have to keep this quiet tell the next of kin they died in an accident glenn shook his head ill keep it as quiet as i can he said coming forward to stand in front of david but im going to get this on paper mr hue he said respectfully would you come down with me to the office so we can fill out some paperwork crap i slumped into the cushy chair making a puff of incensescented air billow around me you arent arresting him are you i asked and david went whiter no just taking a statement for his protection if youve told me the truthhe stressed it as if i hadntyou dont have anything to worry about you or mr hue id told the truth but somehow i wasnt reassured i knew i wore a sour expression as i rose to stand beside david you want me to come with you i asked wondering if i might trade my moving out of the church and away from ivy for some pro bono lawyer work from skimmer the were nodded looking shaken but okay in his suit and tie its all right rachel i know all about forms grimacing with a tired acceptance he looked to glenn if we stop at my house i can give you the names and addresses of everyone ive slept with since taking possession of that thing thick lips pursed glenn ran a hand over his closely cut hair just how many women have you had sex with in the last two months mr hue david reddened six i think i need my address book to be sure glenn made a small noise and i could almost see him grant the attractive man more respect god men are pigs im going to take the bus home i said wanting to be alonenot to mention avoid a trip to the fib jeez and they were just starting to like me too its no problem to drop you off glenn offered i can take the artifact into custody too no reason for you to be in danger my eyebrows rose and i kept my eyes off my shoulder bag its in the mail system i lied not wanting to go into why i wasnt going to give it to him soon as it hits my mailbox ill call you lie lie liiiiie he he glenns brown eyes narrowed and i felt myself warm david said nothing knowing where it was and apparently agreeing with my decision gathering myself i adjusted the strap to my shoulder bag and headed for the door this hadnt gone well at all maybe i could sell it online and donate the proceeds to the war relief fund cause there was going to be a war thank you for your cooperation mr hue glenn was saying behind me i know this is hard but the families of those women will be grateful to know what has happened dont tell them i turned their daughters david whispered ill do it give me that i glanced behind me as i pushed open the swinging doors glenn was hunched in sympathy as he walked beside the smaller man i searched my feelings and decided it wasnt an act ill do the best i can glenn said his gaze rising to mine for a moment yeah id heard that before what it meant was hed do his best as long as it didnt mean bending his ruleruphisass rules stupidass upright uptight fib detective i thought what hurt would it do to bury this from the public then i blew out my frustration i was starting to think like trent this was a potential inderland power struggle though not an illegal genetic lab but women had died and i wanted him to lie to their families about how and why we slowed when glenn went to talk to iceman and david halted beside me his few wrinkles were deepened by stress and he looked terrible im so sorry david i whispered its not your fault he said but i felt like it was glenn joined us and gestured david to walk out before us the fib officer took hold of my upper arm keeping my steps slow until david was several paces ahead of us who did you get the statue from he asked as we started up the stairway i looked at his dark fingers encircling my arm remembering that thick folder he had given me listing nicks crimes shaky i reached for the filthy banister and gripped it as i rose tell me youll do your damnedest to keep this locked in a drawer i asked all of it tell me rachel he threatened not giving an inch exhaling i watched davids slumped back nick i said seeing no point in not telling him the thief was playing dead so there was no reason for glenn to go looking for him his entire posture easing glenn nodded okay he said now i believe you ten it was hot at the bus stop and i stood breathing in air flavored by pavement gas fumes and the nearby skyline chili it was probably the only chain restaurant serving a tomatobased food that had survived the turn and the tomato boycott that half the worlds surviving population had adopted i was hungry and tempted to get myself a cardboard bowl to go but i knew that the moment i left the stop the bus would show and id be waiting another half hour so i stood there in my jeans and green tshirt sweating in the sun beating down and watching the heavy traffic the tidy were beside me smelled nice and the two warlocks monopolizing the shade of a newly planted tree chatted about nothing i could tell they were warlocks because their characteristic redwood scent was almost hidden beneath the overdone perfume that was making the weres eyes tear the more magic you practiced the stronger your scent though usually only another inderlander could pick it up the same went for vampires the ones who indulged themselves the most having a more obvious incense smell jenks said i reeked of magic and ivy stank of vampire and we all lived together in a little stinky church i sang in my head uneasy i ran a finger between me and the strap of my bag warlock was a designation of skill not sex warlocks simply being witches who hadnt gone through the trouble of learning how to stir a spell by heart they could invoke them all right but stirring them safely was out of their skill level and as soon as humanity got their head wrapped around that the entire demographic slice of educated male witches could take the chip off their shoulder and relax i had a twoyear degree plus enough life experience to get the license to use my charms in my work it wasnt skill holding me back from getting the license to sell my charms but capital which might explain the incongruity of my riding the bus with an artifact that could start an inderland power struggle with my luck id get mugged on the way home a sigh shifted me and i plucked at my tshirt wondering if i should take it off and wear the chemise i had on under it home it would be fun to watch the guy next to me react when i started stripping a private grin curled up the corners of my mouth maybe id take off my sneakers and go barefoot muggers usually left dirty people with no shoes alone the were next to me made a long whistle of appreciation and i lifted my gaze up from my nasty sneakers blinking at the gray ghost limo edging out of traffic and into the bus pulloff my first reaction of surprise melted into annoyance it had to be trent and here i was waiting for the bus with filthy knees and sweating just peachy damn keen i peered over my sunglasses when the tinted back window rolled down yup it was trent the wealthy bastard looking good in his creamcolored linen suit and white shirt his tan had deepened with summer leading me to think he got out into his prizewinning gardens and nationally renowned stables more often than he let on smiling a confident somewhat expectant smile the elf in hiding arched his thin eyebrows at the dirt on my knees i didnt say a word looking through his lowered window to the front seat to find quen his head of security driving instead of his chief bootlicker jonathan my pulse eased at the absence of the tall sadistic man i liked quen even if he occasionally tested my magic and martialarts skills he was honest at least unlike his employer hand on my hip i said snidely wheres jon and the were behind me had a conniption fit that i knew trent well enough to be nasty to him the two warlocks were busy taking photos with their phones giggling and whispering maybe i ought to be nice lest i find my ugly scene plastered all over the internet and i relaxed my posture a smidgen trent leaned to the window green eyes squinting at the sun his fair neatly translucent hair moved in the breeze from the street marring its carefully styled perfection much as i hated to admit it his windmused hair pegged my attraction meter though his business prowess expressed through his pristinely legal kalamack industries was esteemed his lean wellproportioned body would look as good in a tight swimsuit perched on a lifeguard chair as it did in a suit in the boardroom jonathan is occupied he said his practiced voice catching my attention and the hint of annoyance in it taking nothing from its mesmerizing grace with ellasbeth i mocked and the were beside me choked what like i have to be nice to him because he supplied the east coasts brimstone trade and had half the worlds leaders in his pocket through his illegal biomedicines after failing to buy my lifetime services he had tried to scare me into it it was a nice bit of blackmail that kept him off my back but he refused to take the message that i wasnt going to work for him course that might be my fault since i seemed unable to say no when he waved enough money at me trent sighed visibly bothered at my admittedly childish behavior but i was hot damn it and needed money and therefore i was vulnerable to his bribes and his airconditioned car get in he said and then smiling and waving to the two warlocks he slid back from the door and into the shadows i glanced at the were beside me guessing trent wanted to talk to me about the rsvp i hadnt rsvped to think i should i said and the man nodded like a bobblehead doll trent leaned into the light get in ms morgan ill drop you wherever you want i want to go to vegas and win a car i thought but i stepped forward do you have the air on in that thing i asked and he arched his eyebrows okay that was probably a dumb question i could use a ride home i added trent beckoned and the two warlocks behind me almost swooned by the sound of it all i want is fifteen minutes he said his perfectly political smile starting to look forced he slid himself over so i could get in and in a surge of defiance i grabbed the handle of the front passengerside door and yanked it open quen jerked in surprise as i slipped in slammed the door shut and reached for the lap belt ah ms morgan trent said from the backseat the air was on but not nearly high enough and after i put my shoulder bag at my feet i started fiddling with the vent im not riding in the back i said angling my half of the vents to me and opening them full bore god trent i feel like a kid back there i know what you mean he muttered and quen behind the wheel smiled that our dads had been friends and worked together to resurrect trents species didnt mean pigeon spots to me after they had died a week apart trent was raised in privilege and i learned how to fight off teenage scumbuckets who saw me as an easy markbeing raised by a mother so thrown by her husbands death she almost forgot about my brother and me maybe i was jealous but i wasnt going to let him think id sit beside him like we were friends from behind us an industrialsize horn blew the city bus trying to get into the pulloff we were breaking the law by standing here but who was going to give trent kalamack a ticket at trents gesture quen accelerated into the empty lane of traffic caused by the stopped bus i felt like id won a few points and i took off my glasses before settling into the plush leather to enjoy the cool air shifting the sweatheavy curls hanging in my eyes this is nice the idea trent drawled speaking louder than he clearly liked was that wed talk i want to talk to quen i turned to the heavily scarred man and smiled he looked as old as my father would be if he were still alive his dark skin marked by the damage with which the turn had left even some inderlanders quen was an elf too which made four that id ever met not bad for a species that was playing extinct he must have a portion of human genes in him or the t angel virus that had offed a sizable portion of humanity wouldnt have affected him at all though small quen was wiry and powerful both in ley line magic and martial arts id seen him use a black ley line charm once though trent probably didnt know he knew it sometimes it was better not to know how the people protecting you did their job he was wearing black his outfit suggesting a uniform but its design supple enough for ease of motion and comfort he looked good in a lateforties way and if i ever needed a role model quen would do nicely if he hadnt been working for trent that is so how you doin i asked quen and the usually stoic man let slip a glimmer of a smirk trent wouldnt be able to see it from his angle and i wondered if quen had a sense of humor i hadnt guessed at im fine ms morgan he said calmly his voice as rough as his pockmarked skin youre looking he hesitated taking a long glance at me as he slowed in bridge traffic what have you done to yourself you look glowing with health i flushed he had noticed id lost my freckles along with every imperfection my soontobetwentyfive years of living had bestowed on me an unexpected benefit of shifting forms by way of a demon curse its a long story i said not wanting to go into it id be interested to hear he prompted his rough voice taking on a hint of accusation from the back came trents calculated sigh thinking id pushed him enoughand not wanting to continue this conversation with queni pulled a dirtstained knee up and twisted around so i could see trent look trent i said dryly i know you want me to work security during your wedding and the answer is no i appreciate the ride home but youre nuts if you think thats going to soften me up enough to get stupid im not one of your fawning debutantes i never said you were he interrupted it was a soft protest as if he liked the fact and im not going to be a freaking bridesmaid in your wedding you couldnt pay me enough i hesitated cursing my fate that he always seemed to show up when i needed large sums of money is it luck or does he wait until im short ah it is a paying position right i mean the dresses are generally godawful but you usually dont have to pay the bridesmaids to put them on trent reclined in the back of the limo relaxed and sure of himself knees crossed and looking like he was at the top of his game it would be if you took it my jaw ached and i worked to ease my tension as my thoughts returned to my church and the cost of resanctifying it trent had pockets so deep he wouldnt blink an eye it wasnt fair to ask ivy to shoulder so much of the financial burden when it had been my fault a smug smile thoroughly irritating came over trent when he realized i wanted something badly enough to be tempted this was one of the reasons i was in the front the elf was a master at reading people and we were enough alike that he had me down im asking you to reconsider he said and then his face losing all its smugness he said please i could really use your help on this i blinked scrambling to hide my shock please since when does trent say please since id started treating him like a person i mused answering my own question and why was that emotions sinking i remembered not two months ago begging a suicidal vampire to consider drugs to ease his pain as an alternative to firstdeath illegal drugs to which only trent had access god it had been a mere twenty minutes ago that id asked glenn to cover up how those women had died because it would make my life easier ticked at myself i started to see the reason behind trents murder and blackmail i wasnt saying his methods were justified just that i understood them he was lazy like a wish taking the easy way not necessarily the lawful harder way but asking glenn to hide information in order to prevent an inderland power struggle wasnt on a par with killing your head geneticist to keep him from going to the authorities and turning you in was it delaying my answer i took off my tshirt the cool air hitting my flush hard as i shoved the soft cotton into my bag to help hide the focus why i said flatly quens better than three of me angular face showing a hint of strain trent handed me a returned invitation i glanced at it seeing the yes checked and a handwritten note under that saying whoever it was was looking forward to being his best man yeah so i said handing it back look at who its from he said extending it over the seats to me again gut tightening i gaped at the harmless obscenely expensive linen paper between trents sundarkened fingers the rumble of going over a railroad track jarred me and i took it turning it over for an address oh crap i whispered thats nearly what i said trent muttered his gaze on the small businesses and homes we were passing by mouth dry i looked from trent to quen but they were silent reading my reaction slowly i handed the invitation back it was from saladan and it was dated four weeks ago lee cant be on this side of the ley lines i said then turned the air down trents fear of demons was well hidden but clear to me apparently he is he said wryly my head moved back and forth hes als familiar he cant be this side of the lines its his handwriting trent tossed the invitation with a soft hush it landed on the rich leather where i would have been sitting things started to click and i stiffened okay now i knew why trent wanted me not only at the wedding but working up front standing next to him every single stinking moment oh hell no i said loudly im not standing up at your wedding if theres the chance that al is going to show up as lees guest i do not deal with demons i do not like demons and i wont put myself in a position where i have to defend myself or anyone else against one no absolutely not the wedding and rehearsal dinner are after sunset trent was saying his voice far too calm thats where the most risk is but id like you to come to the rehearsal as well seeing that youre posing as a bridesmaid the rehearsal and dinner are on friday this friday i said scrambling for an excuse thats my birthday no way trents expression shifted you are responsible for lees being abducted ms morgan he said coldly im sure the demon has an ulterior motive for allowing lee to cross the lines for something as frivolous as a wedding the least you can do is try to get him back a rescue i yelped spinning to see him faceon do you know how hard it is to survive a demon much less trick ones familiar from him no trent said his dislike for me coming through very clearly do you well i did but i wasnt going to tell trent that there was another elf of pure descent living across the street from me hed use her badly in his biolabs pulse fast i braced myself when quen stopped short at a light we were almost to my neighborhood thank god why should i help lee i said angrily i dont know what you heard but he took me into the everafter not the other way around i tried to get us both out of there but your friend wanted to give me to al and since i like where i live i fought back i warned him and after lee beat me to a pulp al took him insteadthe better witch i will not take the blame for that trying to give me to al to pay off his debt was inhuman trents face lost none of its hard accusation isnt that what you did to lee teeth gritted i held my arm out palm up so he could see the demon scar on my wrist no i said flatly shaking for showing it to him so plainly im sorry trent he was going to give me to al and i fought back i didnt give him to al lee did that to himself through his own mistaken beliefs i didnt gain anything but my freedom trents breath came out softly the sound seeming to wash away all his tension he believed me how about that freedom he said thats all anyone wants isnt it i looked at quen to figure out what he felt about all of this but his expression gave no clue as he drove through the citys quiet residential area eyes ranging over the small houses and tidy yards with blowup pools in back and fallen bikes in front most humans were surprised at how normal an inderland neighborhood was old habits of hiding die hard im not judging you rachel trent said pulling my attention back to him id be lying if i said i wasnt hoping you could free lee from the demon there isnt enough money in the world for that i muttered i want you to be in my wedding in case theres an attack against me or my fiancee i flopped back around feeling the cushions enfold me rachel the elf started stop your car and let me off right here i said tightly i can walk the rest of the way the car kept going after a moment trent said slyly it would really grill ellasbeths tomatoes if she was forced to make you one of her bridesmaids a smile flickered over me as i remembered the tall icily beautiful professional woman seething when she found trent treating me to breakfast in his robe after i had pulled his freaking elfass out of the frozen ohio river they didnt even pretend to be in love and their marriage was happening only because she was probably the purestblooded elf out there for trent to marry and have little baby elves with i wondered if theyd been born with pointy ears and had them docked it would cheese her off no end wouldnt it i said my mood lightening five thousand for two evenings i laughed and beside me quens grip on the wheel tightened not even if it was ten thousand for one event i said and besides its too late to get the dress theyre in the trunk trent said quickly and i cursed myself for even bringing it up as an excuse since it implied that all he needed was to find my price then i did a double take turning to look at him they i questioned trent shrugged to shift from powerful drug lord to frustrated fiance she hasnt decided between the two of them youre an eight tall right long in the sleeves i was and it was flattering he remembered but then so was ellasbeth what color are they i asked curious ah shes narrowed it down to a modest black shift and a fulllength sea green he said unflattering flat black and cucumberpuke green greaaaaat no quen gently applied the brakes and put the car in park we were at the church i grabbed my bag to look into it and make sure i still had the focus they were elves i didnt know what they could do thanks for the ride trent the tension rose as i unbuckled myself it was nice seeing you quen i said then hesitated meeting his green eyes as he sat with his hands on the wheel and waited you ah arent going to show up tonight to convince me are you breaking his stoic expression he met my gaze levelly no ms morgan the danger is real this time so i respect your decision trent cleared his throat in a nonverbal rebuke and i gave quen a thankful nod the security expert had enough clout to defy trent if his reasonings were sound and it made me feel good that someone could say no to himthough i doubted that it happened very often thanks i said but instead of feeling relieved i only found myself more worried the danger is real this time like it wasnt last time i worked for trent the moist heat and the sound of cicadas hit me when i got out the old trees that blocked the sun serving to trap the moisture as well i glanced across the street to keasleys house hoping trent and quen would just leave i didnt like them being this close to ceri i didnt know anything about elves hell they might be able to smell each other if they got close enough i pulled my attention back to trent as i hitched my bag higher and started for the church there was a van at the curb and i frowned at the sign proudly proclaiming we specialize in exorcism great juuuuust great now the entire street knew we had a problem i spun when the sound of a car door closing thumped through the muggy air trent was out and was circling to the limos back my blood pressure spiked i said no i repeated loudly having a problem with your church he asked lifting the trunk when it popped open my lips pressed together and i stood so i could see him and ceris house both i didnt like this at all we had an incident look im not doing it so just leave okay i felt like i was talking to a dog who had followed me home bad dog go home i boldly turned my back on him and feeling the hair on the back of my neck prickle strode to the stairs not wanting him to follow me in i paused two steps down from the landing ten thousand for two nights trent said pulling two garment bags from the trunk your rehearsal is on my birthday i have plans reservations at carew tower a thrill went through me at the admission it was going to be a date to remember but trent squinted looking as if the heat couldnt touch him bring your date along he gently pushed the trunks lid down the motor engaged and the trunk whined shut adjusting the garment bags over his arm he came forward the closer he got the more nervous i became you may have breakfast in the carew tower every tuesday i said but ive never been up there and im looking forward to it im not asking my date to change it thirty thousand and ill get your reservations changed to whatever night you want he was a step down and his eyes were even with mine everything is so easy for you isnt it i said disgusted a tired haunted look showed in his green eyes and his hair shifted in the breeze to ruin his professional carriage no it only looks that way poor baby i muttered and his jaw tightened carefully arranging his hair he returned to his callous self rachel i need your help he said with an irritated acceptance therere going to be too many people and i dont want an ugly scene your being there might be enough to stop any trouble before it starts you wont be doing this alone quen has his entire staff i dont work under anyones direction i said my gut tightening as i looked past him to ceris house i wanted him gone if she came out everything would go to hell theyd work around you he persuaded youre there if something slips by them i dont play well with others and i run with loaded guns i said taking a backward step up to distance myself from him besides quen is better than me i said shortly as the wind mussed his hair again theres no reason for me to be there his free hand smoothed his bangs as he saw me look at it you sat in the front why because i knew it would bother you the sound of unfamiliar voices in the sanctuary came out through the transom windows along the side of the church i took another step up and trent stayed where he was confident though i was now taller than him thats why i want you there he said youre unpredictable and that can be the difference between success and failure most people make decisions in anger fear love or obligation you make decisions to irritate people youre just chalking up the points here trent i need that unpredictability he continued as if i hadnt said anything agitated i focused on him forty thousand for a night of unpredictability is expensive his face shifted and with sly delight he echoed forty thousand i cringed inside as i told him my price then decided to go with it or whatever it takes to get my church resanctified i countered trent took his eyes from me for the first time sending his gaze up the length of the steeple squinting at it your church lost its sanctification what happened i took a breath backing up on the landing we had an incident i said sharply i gave you my terms take it and leave or just leave eyes gleaming trent countered ill pay five thousand if all three functions are incidentfree and forty thousand if youre required to intervene fine ill do it i muttered glancing across the street just get your elf ass off my walk before i change my mind then i froze shocked when trent lightly ascended the steps between us the relief and genuine appreciation turning him from a successful confident businessman into a normal everyday guy a little worried and unsure of his future thank you rachel he said while handing me the garment bags jonathan will call when she finally chooses a dress the garment bags settled over my arm with the scent of perfume crap they were made from silk and i wondered what the dresses looked like i felt odd having trent thank me he wasnt moving though and i prompted well goodbye he hesitated eyeing me as he found the sidewalk he went to say something then turned away quen had the door for him and his steps quick despite the heat trent headed for the limo and slid in with a practiced grace quen gently shut the door watching me he went to the front of the car and got in guilt pricked at me was i doing ceri an injustice by not introducing her to trent i didnt want him using her but she could take care of herself and if nothing more she could find others of her kind trent probably had a christmas card list i exhaled in relief when they pulled from the curb and accelerated down the street thank god i muttered then frowned i was going to be in trents wedding swell i turned to the door and ivys voice echoed out thats not what your ad says she exclaimed shortly followed by jenkss voice too faint to understand its not that i dont want to an unfamiliar masculine voice protested becoming louder i dont have the equipment or skill to fix it i hesitated hand on the latch the man had sounded embarrassed the door swung open and i jumped back stumbling to catch my balance a young man almost walked right into me jerking to a halt at the last moment his cleanshaven face reddened and the purple sash of his faith draped around his neck and flowing down his front looked funny with his jeans and the casual polo shirt embroidered with his business name an expensivelooking cell phone was clipped to his belt and he carried a locked toolbox excuse me he said in annoyance jiggling on his feet he tried to get around me i took a step to get into his way and his eyes rose to meet mine ivy was glowering behind him jenks hovering at head height with his wings clattering in anger her eyebrows went up when she saw the silk garment bags then catching her thought she said dryly rachel this is dr williams he says he cant resanctify the church dr williams this is my partner rachel morgan almost hiding his irritation the man moved his toolbox to his left hand and extended his right i shifted my garment bags and shook it i felt a rise of stored leyline energy try to slip between us to equal out our balances and i snatched the force back before it could make the jump god how embarrassing hi i said thinking he looked cute and had a nice grip the heady scent of redwood flowed from him stronger than id winded in a long time he was a witch and an educated one and when his brown eyes widened i knew he knew i was the same whats the problem i said letting go of his hand if its the financing i just took care of it i can have cash for you by monday next it felt damn good saying that but jenks dropped three inches and groaned and ivy glanced at the garment bags in understanding rachel you didnt she said and i flushed im working a wedding and a reception i said tightly how bad could it be really bad really really bad but dr williams was squinting at his van and shaking his head your financing came through fine i simply cant do it im sorry if youll excuse me crap the first guy to come out here hadnt been able to either the man tried to leave but ivy moved with a vampire quickness surprising all of us giving me a tightlipped look she muttered to me were going to talk about this and then to dr williams blinking at her suddenly before him your ad says i know what the ad says he interrupted i wrote it i told you we dont have the experience for your situation he got another step down before ivy was in front of him again a dangerous thinning of brown around her pupil he stopped angry as he took off his purple ribbon his disregard for the danger she represented surprised me until i decided that if he could sanctify ground he could probably take care of himself i ran my eyes over him again new thoughts sifting through me look he said dropping his head when it came back up there was an expression of warning in his gaze if it was just resanctifying it i could do it but your church has been blasphemed my lips parted and ivy crossed her arms over her chest in an unusual show of worry i twisted a demon curse on blasphemed ground without the protection of my aura great blasphemed jenks exclaimed silver sparkles sifting from him in the bushes there was a highpitched call from a winged eavesdropper quickly hushed the man looked from the bush to me from the bedrooms up to the front door he said clearly resigned he wasnt leaving until i was satisfied the entire church is contaminated id have to get the demon smut off first and i dont know how to do that his lack of fear seemed to give ivy something to tie her emotions to and bring them back under control but jenks clattered his wings aggressively he was getting ready to pix the man and their attitudes were starting to tick me off if dr williams couldnt do it he couldnt do it jenks i admonished backoff if he cant do it its not his fault the doctors grip on his tackle box tightened his pride clearly feeling the sting its usually the coroner who is called in to cleanup failed demon summonings not me ivy stiffened and before she could get all vampy i interjected i didnt call the demon she showed up on her own he laughed bitterly as if he had caught me in a lie she he mocked female demons cant cross the lines cant or wont that made him pause his expression taking on a hint of respect then he shook his head and his expression became hard demon practitioners have a life expectancy of months ms morgan i suggest you change your profession before your stateofaliveness does it for you dr williams took a step down and i shot after him i dont deal in demons she showed up on her own thats my point his feet were on the sidewalk and he stopped and turned im very sorry ms tamwood jenks his gaze lifted to me ms morgan but this is outside my current abilities if the ground hadnt been cursed there would be no problem but as it is shaking his head again he headed for his van i shifted my garment bags to my other arm what if we got the ground cleaned he stopped at the back of his van to open it and set his toolbox in it he slammed it shut his purple ribbon still in his grip it would be cheaper to move the bodies out of the cemetery and build a new church on hallowed ground he hesitated his attention flitting to the copper sign above the church door proudly stating vampiric charms im sorry but you should count yourself lucky you even survived shoes scuffing the pavement he disappeared around the side of the van the sound of his driversside door shutting seemed loud in the quiet street drawing attention to the tinkling of an ice cream truck as his van drove away ivy sat on the second step down saying nothing i sat beside her draping the bags over my knees after a moment of hesitation jenks landed on my shoulder together we watched the ice cream truck trundle closer its merry tune sounding especially irritating in an eyeballhurting shrill cloud jenkss kids flocked over to it diving in and out of the mans windows until he stopped he had been coming down here every day since the first of july to sell a twodollar snow cone to a family of pixies jenkss wings shifted my hair in the breeze as he lifted off hey ivy he said confidently can you float me a couple of bucks it was an old pattern by now and shoulders hunched she got to her feet grumbling under her breath she slipped into the church for her purse i knew i should be worried about the church and sleeping on blasphemed ground but i was ticked about working for trent for no reasonseeing as we couldnt resanctify the church and on my birthday too while jenks yelled at his kids to decide on a flavor and get it over with i dug my phone out of my bag and hit the speed dial i had to call kisten eleven the sound of heavy plastic was soothing as i hung up my new outfit beside my two bridesmaid dresses on the back of my closet door the black plastic with the poison heart logo looked garish next to the silk garment bags and i touched their smoothness just to prove that someone had actually spent money on something so extravagant shaking my head i ripped the plastic off my new purchase wadded it up and tossed it into a corner where it slowly unfurled the sound of it clear in the silence that held the church i had just come from the mall by way of the bus and i was eager to show somebody what id bought for trents wedding rehearsal and dinner but ivy was out and jenks was in the garden the poison heart was an exclusive shop and i had thoroughly enjoyed my afternoon of guiltfree shopping i needed this outfit for my run it was taxdeductible the night was humid my chemise was sticking to me and since our centralair funds had become our resanctifythegrounds funds it looked as if the most wed be doing this year would be a window unit somewhere all the windows were open and the shush of an occasional passing car mixed comfortably with the sound of jenkss kids playing junebug croquet it was as bad as it sounded and ivy and i had spent a hilarious evening last week watching his kids divide into two teams and by the light of the porch lamp take turns whacking the hapless beetles to very fat toads the team whose toad hopped away firststuffed to the gillswon my smile widened at the memory and i brushed nonexistent lint from the snappy short black jacket the beads sewn into it glinting in the overhead light smile fading i looked the outfit over againnow that i was free of the clerks enthusiasm maybe the beads were a little over the top but they went well with the glitter on the stockings and the shortness of the hiphugger skirt was offset by its subdued black it had come with a nice top that would show my midriff and i had the jacket in case it got cold shuffling in my closet i pulled out a pair of flat sandals i could run in ellasbeth wouldnt be wearing jeans and a tshirt why should i slum it to make her look good i dropped the sandals and stepped back in thought some jewelry would finish it nicely but ivy could help me with that hey jenks i shouted knowing if he didnt hear me his kids would and go get him come and see what i bought almost immediately there was a clatter of wings at my window i had sewn up the pixy hole in the screen a few days previous and i stifled my smile when jenks ran into it hey he shouted hovering with his hands on his hips and a soft glow of gold sifting from him what the hell is this a little privacy i said fluffing the lace about the skirts hem use the door thats what its for you know what he snarled i oughta oh for the love of tink i turned at his wonderstruck tone but he was gone in an instant he was in the hall laughing as he drifted backward is that it he said is that the dress you bought to wear to trents wedding rehearsal and dinner damn woman you need some serious help following his gaze i looked at my outfit what i said warming my nose tickled and i muffled a sneeze the heat and humidity starting to get to me jenks was still laughing its a dinner rache not a dance club worried i touched the jackets sleeve you think its too much i asked working hard to keep my tone noncombative id had this conversation with exroommates before jenks landed on the hanger not if youre going to play the part of the town whore you know what i said starting to get ticked being sexy doesnt come naturally and sometimes you have to go out on a limb limb he choked rache if thats the way you dress for a wedding rehearsal its no wonder you spent high school fighting off bad boyfriends image girl its all about image who do you want to be i went to flick him away and he darted to the ceiling a trail of silver dust drifting down like a ribbon of thought hed left behind at the window a cluster of his kids were giggling flustered i closed my curtains rex drawn by the sound of jenkss voice padded in from who knew where settling herself in my threshold with her tail curled about her feet and her eyes on jenks the pixy had landed on nicks file now shoved in among my perfume bottles and i hoped the idiotic cat wouldnt jump up there after him i felt a slow buildup of a tickle in my nose and i scrambled for a tissue startling rex into skittering out to the hall when i sneezed looking over my tissue i watched jenkss head go back and forth its a nice outfit i protested and i didnt buy it for trent i bought it for my birthday date with kisten i touched the beaded sleeve again feeling melancholy so i liked to dress up so what but maybe maybe my image could use a little more class and a little less party girl snorting jenks gave me a long knowing look sure you did rache bothered i turned off the light and headed into the kitchen scooping up the two bags of tomato stuff for glenn that i had left in the hall still laughing jenks followed landing on my shoulder in a show of apology you know he said and i could hear the smile on his face in his tone i think you should wear that dress to the rehearsal it will cheese off that witch of a woman sure i said starting to get depressed id wait until ivy came home then ask her what did jenks know he was a pixy for gods sake i elbowed the rocker switch as i entered the kitchen all but tripping on rex when she darted between my feet the ungraceful motion turned into a sneeze i felt it coming but didnt have time to warn jenks he was catapulted off and swearing he went to the window sorry i said when he lit next to his sea monkeys according to my mother it was bad luck to sneeze between rooms but it was jenkss questioning look that had me worried wincing i looked at rex her cute little kitten face turned up as she sat before the sink and gazed lovingly up at her fourinch master jenks followed my attention to her and when i set the bags down to wipe my nose his wings stilled in understanding i had been sneezing off and on since yesterday crap there are charms for it but i dont want to be allergic to cats im not allergic to cats i said wrapping one arm around my middle rex has been here for the past two months and this is the first time its been a problem okay he said softly but his wings werent moving when he turned his back on me to wrestle with the vial of seamonkey food it was too quiet in here i wanted to turn on some music but the stereo was in the sanctuary and to crank it loud enough to be able to enjoy it in the kitchen would bother the neighbors working up a really good pity party i pulled out one of my newest spell books and set it thumping on the center island counter sneezing i thought hunched as i thumbed through the index i wasnt allergic to cats my dad had been but i wasnt the only spell in the book that had to do with sneezing was one for cat allergies and as i debated trying it i felt a tickle start eyes watering i held my breath it didnt do any good i sneezed accidentally tearing the page damn it i swore looking up to see that i had startled jenks into the air im not allergic to cats its a summer cold thats all i felt the urge again exasperated i closed my eyes and tried to stop it making an ugly noise when i couldnt i knew i had seen a spell for sneezing that didnt revolve around cats where the devil was it oh yeah i said softly crouching down to get my old ley line textbook out from between the big cookie cookbook and my copy of real witches eat quiche rache jenks said coming to stand on the counter when i opened it up to the index what i snapped you need any help i stopped what i was doing and looked to find him standing miserably before me with his wings drooping rex was twining about my ankles and if i knew it was anything other than misplaced affection i would have been charmed slowly i exhaled i dont think so i said flipping to page fortynine ley line charms are pretty easy im getting better at them and if it does the trick then were all set he nodded and flitted up to the ladle his favorite spot in the kitchen where he could see me the door and a good slice of the garden i quickly read over the instructions to grow more confident i didnt particularly like ley line magic having been classically trained in slower but no less powerful earth magic earth magic used potions and amulets finding the energy to perform the spell in plants who ultimately pulled it from the ley lines themselves the energy was filtered and softened making earth magic more forgiving and slower than ley line magic but ultimately more farreachingthe changes wrought with earth magic were generally real rather than illusion as much of ley line magic was i wouldnt just look shorter under the right earth charm i would be shorter ley line magic used incantation and ritual to pull the energy to change reality right off the line it made this branch of magic faster and flashier but there were ten times more black ley line witches than black earth witches apart from hitting someone with a hunk of everafter to short out his or her neural network changes were illusion and could be surmounted with willpower before dying my father had taken steps to direct me into earth magic it was a decision i totally agreed with but i had some skill in the ley line arts and if it would stop me sneezing where was the harm and while going over the white charm before me i decided the fivehundredlevel spell was well within my grasp pleased i started to gather what id need white candle i murmured briefly considering the pack of birthday candles in my shoulder bag that id picked up along with the lilac wine but then i pulled out a nicked taper from my silverware drawer where i kept it it was blessed and that was all the better dandelion i questioned looking up at jenks got it he said cheerfully vaulting from the ladle and through the pixy hole in the kitchen window screen i had dried dandelions from last year but i knew hed appreciate the chance to harvest something for me he was back almost immediately with a dewwet closed flower and after shooing his kids from the window he set it next to the lopsided pentagram i had sketched on my mobile chalkboard it was the size of a laptop and had a cover to protect a design in transit thanks i said and he nodded lifting briefly into the air to land on the textbook you going to set a circle he asked looking slightly nervous and when i nodded he added ill um watch from the windowsill hiding my smile i moved all my stuff to the other side of the island counter so i could both work and see him its a medicinal spell i explained why take chances jenks gave me a mild ummm i knew he didnt like seeing me under the influence of a line he said it was because there was a shadow on my aura that wasnt there the rest of the time i didnt like it because my hair got staticky moving in the wind that always seemed to be blowing in the everafter my pulse quickened in anticipation and i glanced at the clock it was way before midnightlots of time you could work white magic after midnight but why push your luck grabbing a handful of salt i sprinkled it over the line etched in the linoleum jenkss wings shifted fitfully when i stretched out my awareness to touch the small underused ley line running through the graveyard out back my breath came in fast but by the time i had exhaled the energy flow was balanced a faint tingling in my fingertips and a heavy sensation in my middle told me my chi was full and i didnt pull more off the line to spindle in my head i wouldnt need more than this to work the spell uncomfortable i wiggled my shoulders as if trying to fit into a new skin it used to be that it took several moments for the strength to equalize practice had shaved it to almost nothing my hair was floating already i tried to flatten it and my skin prickled where my muscles flexed if i cared to i could open my second sight and actually see the everafter superimposed on reality but it gave me the creeps whoops i said remembering i didnt have my candle lit yet and went to the gas stove to get a burner going using a bamboo skewer i lit the vanillascented candle i cleared the air with when i burned something i shook the stick out and carefully carried the candle to the center counter where it flickered in the muggy breeze coming in the window a last look at the instructions to be sure i had everything at the counter and i kicked off a sandal wheres your cat jenks i said not wanting to trap her in with me he took to the air here kitty kitty kittyhe called and with a chirping trill her orange face appeared at the hall archway she was licking her lips but jenks wasnt troubled rhombus i said softly touching my toe to the salt circle the single word of latin invoked a hardwon series of mental exercises that condensed the fiveminute prep and invocation of setting a circle into an instant i stifled a jerk as the circle closed with a snap jenkss wings whirled as a moleculethin sheet of everafter rose up between us to keep any influences out while i worked the medicinalclass ley line charm i was impulsive not stupid rex padded in rubbing against the barrier as if it were covered in catnip id take that as a sign that she might want to be my familiarif she didnt run every time i tried to pick her up i grimaced at the ugly black sheen of demon smut crawling over my bubble discoloring the usual cheerful gold of my aura it was a visual display of the imbalance i carried on my soul a reminder of the debt i owed for having twisted reality so far out of alignment that i could become a wolf and jenks grew to human size the discoloration was nothing compared to the thousand years of demoncurse imbalance that ceri carried but it bothered me all but the smallest amount of everafter energy i had tapped had gone into maintaining the circle but there was the tingle of a new buildup of force filtering in it would continue to grow until i let go of the line completely many witches were said to have gone insane from trying to stretch what their chi could hold by allowing the pressure to build beyond what they could safely contain but when my chi overflowed i could spindle the line energy in my head demons could do the same and their familiars ceri and i were the only two people this side of the lines who could spindle line energy that we had survived al with the knowledge intact hadnt been the demons intent ceri had taught me the basics but al was the one whod stretched my tolerances and made the skill second natureby way of an excruciating amount of pain ah rachel jenks said greentinted sparkles slipping from him to pool in the sink its worse than usual my good mood vanished and i frowned at the demon smut yeah well im trying to get rid of it i muttered then pulled my sketched pentagram forward taking up a stone crucible i had bought at a ley line shop up in mackinaw i set it in the lowest space between the bottom of the pentagram and the circle surrounding it fingers still touching it i murmured adaequo to set it in place and give its presence meaning i felt a small surge from the line and twitched oh it was one of those spells great my nose tickled i stiffened realizing i hadnt brought any tissue in with me oh no i said my voice rising jenks looked panicked and i sneezed he was laughing when i brought my head up looking frantically for something to wipe my nose with i settled on a scratchy paper towel managing to tear off twice what i needed and getting it to my face just in time for the followup sneeze crap i had to finish this spell fast the bigass symbolic knife i had gotten at findley market from a cheerful woman went in the center space with the words me auctore and a feather was given meaning when i placed it with the strength of lenio in the lower lefthand leg of the star my nose was starting to tickle again and i hurriedly checked the textbook iracundia i said holding my breath as i set jenkss dandelion in the other leg of the star all that was left was the candle the force in me had been building with every word and with my eye twitching i set the blessed candle carefully in the topmost section of the star hoping it wouldnt fall over and spill wax on my chalkboard so id be spending tomorrow cleaning it with toluene this one wouldnt be set with a placename until i lit it and with that in mind i plucked the bamboo skewer from where i had left it setting it aflame again from the vanilla candle wiping my free hand on my jeans i shifted from foot to foot and transferred the flame to the blessed candle evulgo i whispered wincing as a surge came in from the line my eyes widened oh god i was going to sneeze again i didnt want to know what it might do to my spell if it wasnt cast yet i moved fast grabbing the feather i dropped it into the crucible i snatched up the knife and before i could get uptight about the ugly symbolism i pricked my thumb and squeezed out three drops of blood i would rather have used one of my finger sticks but ley line magic was based on symbolism and it made a difference the knife went back into its little spot and i peered at the text thumb in my mouth so i didnt get blood all over the place non sum qualis eram i said remembering it from another spell must be a generic phrase for invocation my urge to sneeze vanished and i jerked in surprise when the crucible was engulfed in flame there was a whoosh accompanied by twang through me the cheerful redandorange flames flashed to a weird gold and black that matched my damaged auraand went out wideeyed i pulled my gaze from the sootblackened crucible to jenks hovering over the sink there wasnt anything in the bowl but a smear of ash stinking of burnt vegetation was that what was supposed to happen he asked like i know uh yeah i said pretending to look at the text see im not sneezing i took a careful breath through my nose then another more relaxed one my shoulders eased and i let myself smile i loved it when i learned something new good jenks grumbled taking to the air to hover before the bubble still up and running cause im not getting rid of my cat with a small thought i broke my connection with the ley line the circle vanished and jenks flew in to land next to the crucible his tiny features wrinkled in distaste content i closed the textbook and started to clean up my mess before ivy got home i told you i wasnt my words cut off as my nose started to tickle im not i started again feeing my eyes widen jenks stared at me horror in his expression eyes watering i waved helplessly achoo i exclaimed hunching over my hair falling to hide my face it was followed by another then another ah crap id made things worse the turn take it i gasped between sneezes i know i did it right ivys got some pills jenks said i could hear his wings but i was too busy try ing to catch my breath to look at him he sounded worried i knew i was in her bathroom he added maybe theyll help i bobbed my head then sneezed again ivy had caught a cold last spring when wed come back from michigan she had moped around the church for three days coughing and blowing her nosesnarling at me every time i suggested making her a charm she had taken pills with her orange juice every afternoon my breath came in little pants and my nose tickled crap lurching to the hallway i sneezed again im not allergic to cats i said while i groped to turn the light on my reflection looked terrible my hair all over the place and my nose running i opened the cupboard uncomfortable rummaging in her things this one jenks said tugging at a thin amber vial i sneezed three more times while i fumbled to get the stupid thing open trying to read that i was to take two pills every four hours why in hell had i tried to use ley line magic i should have known better than to selfadminister a medicinal charm the aides in emergency were going to laugh their asses off if i had to go in for a counterspell i stared at jenks my eyes widened another sneeze was coming and it felt like a big one not using water i took two pills looking at the ceiling and trying to swallow them water rache jenks said hovering over the tap you gotta take them with water waving him out of my way i swallowed them down dry grimacing and like magic the urge to sneeze vanished not believing it i took a breath then another jenks was having a fit over the wax cups so i filled one dutifully swallowing the lukewarm water to feel the pills slide down damn i swore in admiration those are great caught it midsneeze i set the cup down to pick up the vial turning it over to read the label how much are these anyway jenkss wings clattered he and his reflection slowly falling they dont work that fast i glanced at him really he looked worried his feet gently touching the counter and his wings stilled he took a breath to say something but a soft pop jerked both our heads up my pulse went into overdrive and i felt someone tap the line out back it startled me and gasping i fell into ivys black porcelain toilet slipping i went down with a little shriek and my butt met the tile ow i said holding my elbow where it hit something witch a resonant voice echoed and i tossed my hair aside taking in the robed figure in the threshold why by cormels gonads does my coffee taste like dandelions ah crap it was minias twelve get out jenks i shrieked scrambling up minias swooped into ivys bathroom his smooth face creased in irritation panicking i pressed into a fluffy black towel hanging between the commode and the tub dont touch me i shouted then flung the contents of ivys pill vial at him with a twang i felt him set a circle jenks was at the ceiling shouting something and the little white pills bounced harmlessly against miniass black sheet of everafter i had to get out there were too many pipes and wires in here to set a demonproof circle what the hell minias said his goatslitted eyes confused as he picked up a pill and looked at it he had broken his circle to do it and scrambling i grabbed ivys hairspray get out of my church i shouted spraying him orangescented detangler hit minias square in the eyes yelping he stumbled backward into the hall to hit the dark walls arms and legs askew he slipped to the floor i didnt wait to see if he was down id seen enough movies to know better pulse hammering i lurched out over him he grunted as my foot hit something and i gasped when he went misty and my foot slipped through him and found the floor my hands touched the walls to pull me forward and i ran for the kitchen i had a circle there still set with salt jenks was a blur of gold dust ahead of me look out he shouted and i went down my feet pulled from under me memories of al poured through me i couldnt go back there i couldnt be someones plaything i silently fought kicking at anything my years of martial arts forgotten what is wrong with you minias said then grunted when my sandal hit something tender he went misty his grip falling away i pulled myself forward almost crawling across the kitchen until the expanse of my circle was between us minias was close behind rhombus i shouted tapping the line and slapping my hand on the line etched in the linoleum everafter coursed in fear caused my control to slip and more power than i liked raced through me hurting the circle went up and minias ran smack into the interior wall of it ow the demon exclaimed purple robes furling as he fell back against the island counter hand over his nose he looked at the smut crawling over my bubble his hat had fallen off and he glared at me from under his curls turning almost choleric when he realized that his nose was bleeding you broke my nose he exclaimed bright red demon blood pouring forth so fix it i said shaking he was in a circle he was in my circle i took a breath then another slowly i pulled my legs under me and stood cold despite the warmth of the night what the hell is wrong with you he asked again clearly furious as a sheet of everafter slithered over him he took his hand from his nose to show that the blood was gone me i said burning off some angst you said youd call first not just barge in i did call minias roughly adjusted his robes you never answered and then he shouted flicking a finger under my expensive chalkboard to make it hit the floor instead of a simple im busy could you call back again later you slam the door in my face i want this mark between us settled you are rude illmannered and as ignorant as a toad hey face warming i leaned to look around the counter to find that my board had cracked you broke my chalkboard then i hesitated drawing back with my arms over my chest you were the one making me sneeze i said and he nodded im not allergic to cats i looked at jenks elated jenks im not allergic to cats minias crossed his arms and leaned against the counter ignorant as a toad rude as an unwanted guest al is a saint for putting up with you the novelty of your blood aside jenks was shooing his kids from the window assuring them we were all right and to not tell their mother me rude i stammered tugging my shirt back down where it belonged when miniass gaze slid to my midriff im not the one just showing up i said i would call first his demon eyes narrowed i didnt promise it and im not the one flinging pills and mace he added scooping up his hat and jamming it on his head his curls were sticking out all over and damn me to hell if he didnt look good like that immediately i sobered no no rachel bad girl and remembering what ivy had told me this spring about my needing the threat of death to prove to myself that i was alive i quickly shoved aside any idea that minias was attractive but he was minias saw my anger fizzle and clearly used to dealing with volatile females he dropped his gaze when it returned to me he was visibly calmer though no less angry i apologize for startling you he said formally obviously you thought you had something to fear and grabbing you probably wasnt the best idea damn right it wasnt i said jumping when jenks landed on my shoulder and dont try to sell me any crap about the kindly demon i know three of you now and you are all evil insane or just plain nasty minias smiled but it didnt make me feel any better his eyes drifted over the inside of my bubble im not kindly and if i could get away with it ill drag you into the everafter and have someone broker you offbut newt would get involved he shifted his eyes to focus on me she doesnt remember you right now i would like to keep it that way tinks little red thong jenks whispered grabbing my ear for balance stomach clenched i retreated until i found the fridge the stainless steel cold through my thin chemise with this debt standing between us without even a mark to keep things tidy taking you would be in bad taste minias tugged his sleeves down over his wrists once i grant whatever stupid wish you want i wont have to restrain myself but until then youre relatively safe my chin lifted bastard he had scared me on purpose i didnt feel bad now at all for burning his eyes or stomping on his privates or for him running into my bubble and i wasnt going to trust that until we settled this i was immune to him jenks i said softly as minias looked over my kitchen will you send one of your kids to get ceri she was likely over her pique at my sorryass ley line skills and i didnt want to do this without her ill go he said they arent allowed to leave the garden my neck went cold in the breeze on his wings and he hovered his angular features pinched youll be okay i watched minias touch the herbs drying on the overhanging rack wanting to tell him to get his fingers off them ill be fine i said hes in a good circle miniass eyes followed jenks zipping out with an unusual amount of interest looking mildly annoyed he scuffed his bare feet against the linoleum and a pair of embroidered slippers appeared on them slowly his brow smoothed under his brown curls i fixed on the alienness of his eyes trying to see the sideways pupil beside the dark iris his back against the counter he crossed his ankles and waited beside him was my spell to stop sneezing and i didnt like the patronizing look he had favored me with after giving the pentagram a cursory glance youre vastly deficient in line etiquette he said dryly but ill admit that this is better than the moldy basements im always hearing about i didnt know you were making me sneeze i huffed you cant know what you havent been told minias brought his attention from the dark garden one eyebrow rose yes you can turning he started messing in the remnants of my ley line spell so whats it going to be he said holding the crucible in one hand and running a finger through the soot with the other eternal life untold wealth unlimited knowledge i didnt like the way he was rubbing his thumb and finger together smelling the ash as if it had meaning stop that i said eyeing me from under his brown curls he set the crucible down the sight of his elegantly robed figure doing something as mundane as tearing a paper towel and cleaning his finger looked odd i frowned my tension rising when he crouched to see my spell books leave those alone i muttered wishing ceri would hurry swearing in latin minias took his fingers off my books when he rose he had my nested set of copper spell pots my splat gun sitting nice as could be in the smallest i had a moment of worry that the charms in it though expired might have enough of my aura to break the circle minias though gave it only a quick glance turning his attention to the largest pot it was the one i had dented against ivys head and i didnt like it when he held it up in disdainful disgust you dont actually use this he asked would you knock it off i protested god what was it with him he was worse than jenks when it came to inquisitiveness his eyebrows high in amusement minias set the spell pot down and picked up the open spell book on the counter my jaw clenched but i said nothing this time his lips curled up in amusement minias held the book splayed open in a single hand and after adjusting his hat levered himself up to sit on the counter beside my ley line charm his curly head was almost among the pots and herbs exhaling slowly i took a step forward look i said and he drew his alienseem gaze to mine im sorry i didnt know you were trying to reach me can we just get this mark thing settled so we can all move on with our lives eyes returning to the book minias took off his hat and murmured thats what im here for youve had time to think up a wish its been almost five hundred years since i dealt with temporals and i dont want to start it up again now so lets hear it my head dropped and suddenly nervous i hiked myself up onto the counter beside the sink temporals huh arms wrapped around knees drawn up to my chin i thought of jenkss shorter life span and how wishes always came back to bite you sure the one i had made to get out of the i s had worked but i was still trying to get out from under the demon marks that had come from it if i wished for a longer life for jenks he might be in a state where he couldnt do anything or maybe hed be the first vampire pixy or something equally unpleasant i dont want a wish i whispered feeling like a coward no clearly surprised the demon shifted his legs letting them drape down the counter to hide my spell books you want a curse his cleanshaven features turned sour ive never taught a witch but i could probably wedge something past your thick skull interesting i dont want to know how to do a curse i said not from you anyway minias brought his wandering gaze from my yew cuttings drying in the corner cocking his head he looked at me as if id only now caught his attention no he repeated with one hand he made a gesture of question what do you want then nervous i slid from the counter i didnt want to do anything without ceri but saying no seemed harmless enough i dont want anything miniass smile went patronizing and ill believe that when the two worlds collide well yeah i want stuff i said bitterly not fond of being offered everything when getting it would cause more trouble than not having it to begin with i want my partner to live longer than a stinking twenty years i want my friend to find some peace in her life and her choices i want my stinking church i slammed my hand on the counter to make my palm sting resanctified so i dont have to worry about the undead while i sleep and i want to get rid of that thing in my freezer before it a starts an inderland power struggle or b brings newt knocking on my door for a cup of sugar again but you i pointed would give me what i want in such a way that it would ruin any joy i found in it so forget it angry and wondering if i was making a mistake i crossed my arms and sulked minias closed the book with a snap i jumped and his red eyes fixed on me with an unsettling intensity he slipped from the counter and came two steps forward you know what she was here for you have it my pulse quickened and i pulled myself straight in worry i think so minias stood stockstill only the hem of his robe moving give it to me ill make sure newt never bothers you again my mouth was dry seeing him want it so badly i knew that giving it to him would be a very big mistake he didnt even know what it was right i said like how you kept track of her the other night you cant control her and you know it he took a breath to protest and i arched my eyebrows head bowing in thought minias dropped back a step you dont have anything i want demon i said youre going to have to owe me you think im going to wear your mark he said and my head came up at the incredulousness in his tone i am not going to wear your mark his cheeks were pale but there was a deep anger in his eyes why not i said liking the idea if only because he didnt i recalled trent saying i made decisions on the basis of how much i could irritate people and i frowned minias though didnt see it since he had made a huff of noise and turned his back to me his shoulders were very broad and with the robe and hat he looked regal and elegant next to me in my sandals jeans and chemise i was still connected to the line and i could feel my hair starting to snarl i ran a hand over my curls thinking i was really stupid to be worrying about my hair when i had a demon in my kitchen miniass head came up and i heard the front door shut ceri finally ceris light steps were soft in the hallway her pleasant voice tight with worry when she called for me she halted in the threshold her wide eyes darting from minias in my circle to me she was still wearing the same summery lightweight linen dress shed had on earlier and her toes were wet telling me she had walked through the dewwet grass barefoot jenks was sitting on her shoulder to look as if he belonged there and i wasnt surprised to see rex jenkss cat in her arms the orange kitten was purring her eyes closed and her paws damp as well god protect us she said in relief jenks flew up in a sparkling of gold and she let the cat slip to the floor are you all right she asked coming forward but not taking my hands as she used to so far i said wondering if she was still mad about last night despite her assurances i had set the calling circle properlyi just hadnt known it was ringing ceri was a hard taskmistress but she wouldnt stay angry because i was slow on the uptake would she rex stood in the middle of the kitchen her tail twitching in bother as she found herself on the linoleum she wouldnt let me touch her but a demon standing three feet away didnt seem to bother her at all stupid cat good evening ceri minias said pleasantly but she ignored him the slight tightening of her lips and her fingers going to her crucifix the only sign she had heard him have you come to an agreement she asked me worry obvious in her pinched features jenks darted from the window where he had been checking on his kids we were waiting for you my chest clenched we he said we it was a small thing but knowing he hadnt turned his back on me for dealing with demons meant a lot damn it i didnt ask for this good ceris thin shoulders relaxed only now did she turn to stand side by side with me and face minias ill help you make a contract that will be untwistable miniass bark of laugher caught me off guard and i frowned when he put his hands behind his back to make himself look immovable no he said simply i heard what you did to al i bargain with her his slitted eyes narrowed and his gaze slid over me to make my skin crawl i do not bargain with you nor will i allow you to act as her liaison red spots appearing on her cheeks ceri stiffened you cant stipulate anything you sophomoric leviter i didnt know what a leviter was but minias frowned jenks landed on my shoulder she just told him he was a newbie at bargaining he whispered and i made a hmmmm of understanding then wondered how he had known minias looked positively ticked and i didnt like the way he was tapping his slippers against the bottom of the circle as if looking for a way out both of you knock it off i said to get their attention it doesnt matter ceri i dont want anything from him so hes going to have to wear my mark that didnt sit well with minias at all and he smacked his hand into the barrier with a pained grunt the scent of burnt amber became obvious and my nose wrinkled the demon turned his back on me his robes furling as he inspected his fist and rex sauntered out i heard the cat door squeak and from the garden came a highpitched cheer rex streaked in her nails skittering in the hall as she ran to hideunder ivys bed probably jenks flitted to me hovering so close my eyes almost crossed you can do that he seems to think so i waved him away only to find ceri watching me in worry im not going to do this minias interjected and my gaze darted to him then the clock damn it ivy would be home soon and having those two meet was a really bad idea you will i said hands on my hips and coming closer there is nothing you can give me nothing you can teach me either you take als or newts mark off me in exchange for your own or you take my mark and get the hell out of my kitchen easy ceri cautioned and i jumped when her hand touched my arm my skin was tingling and i felt a surge of incoming force from the line my control of it slipping as my anger grew i took a quick breath and narrowed the inflow before my chi overflowed and id have to spindle it im okay im okay i said pushing her hand off me i felt uncomfortable and even her light touch was too much she backed up uneasily and jenks landed on her shoulder i turned from their twin worried looks i was fine damn it ready to push the issue i rounded on minias but the demon had dropped back to the center counter his smooth face placid and a new glint in his goatlike eyes as he looked at me in speculation fear struck through me and my anger vanished seeing it minias smiled ill take your mark witch he said ill even teach you how to give one for free he added and my breath hissed in rache jenks chimed this is a bad idea but minias had pushed himself into motion his robes hem shifting to a halt as he came to stand within inches of the circles barrier he smiled and i shivered he had absolutely perfect teeth and his skin was flawless just like mine ceri was suddenly at my elbow i dont like this oh ceridwen merriam dulciate doesnt like it minias arched his eyebrows and smirked shell do it someday shes going to want something shes going to want it bad and im going to be the one she calls he put his round hat back on i can hardly wait i was sure there were demons more dangerous than minias but his owing me a favor sounded like the back door into trouble not the front door out of the same my eyes went to the clock again fine lets do this ceri made a small noise and jenkss wings clattered the two of them looked alone and unhappy minias though was pleased stepping back from the circles edge he gestured in invitation we cant do this through a circle he said inclining his head i cringed and i wondered if i should just have made a stupid wish like for a box of cookies or something my thoughts went to al and how he had given me my marks and then newt newt didnt touch me i said feeling the mark heavy on the bottom of my foot you know this how he said making me feel even better oh god my stomach tightened at the idea of letting minias out ceri could hold a circle bigger than my kitchen circle she could make an airlock of sorts ceri i can hold him but to trust his word he wont hurt you i i dont like this it had been hardly a whisper and i pulled my gaze from miniass satisfied stance her eyes were worried and she looked frightened there is nothing else i can do i said and he wont hurt me sandals squeaking i turned to him will you flowing into a relaxed stance he actually bowed i promise i wont hurt you until i leave that is promise youll go the instant the mark is made i countered alone and leaving me untouched he straightened and touched his hat to be sure it was in the right spot as you say yeah right i glanced at ceri who nodded though she had yet to regain her color her motions subdued and unhappy she took a piece of magnetic chalk from her waistband and with a single unbroken line sketched a circle a foot outside of mine jenkss wings hummed in agitation and steadying myself i stepped over it the demon watched it all in a bored satisfaction why am i doing this again im going in with you jenks said his wings cooling my neck as he hovered beside me no you arent i didnt have time for this like you can stop me jenks but it was too late and i gave ceri a nasty look when her circle went up trapping him with me you need someone to watch your back she said not at all apologetic oh man i thought eyeing her through the sheet of everafter between us once she got that hard slant to her eyes arguments were useless jenks landed on my shoulder with a smug harrumph i smelled the oil he used to clean his garden sword and i wasnt surprised he had bared the lethal blade lets kick this pig he said trying to lighten the mood kick the pig how about kick the witch she apparently needs some sense knocked into her i turned to minias you got any problems with this taking a symbolic step backward minias gestured for me to come through steadying myself i reached to touch the inner bubble breaking it i stiffened as the energy needed to hold the barrier suddenly flowed into me filling my chi before slipping back to the line out back i didnt let go of the line wanting it in case i had to do something fast but it was a relief to bring the levels coursing through me to a more reasonable level jenkss wings fanned my neck and my hair ticked me minias breathed deep as if cataloging my scent now that it wasnt tainted by a sheet of everafter and my stomach knotted its a pleasure rachel mariana morgan he said my blood quickened at the new sound of his voice deeper almost just rachel okay i said hoping i wasnt making as big a mistake as i thought i was minias smiled great another charming demon i sort of prefer the insane ones my eyes darted to the clock i had to get this done before ivy got back i jerked when he moved but all minias did was pick up the knife id left on the counter behind him oh god im going to be sick jenks took flight when minias extended the blade to me hilt first cut me with it while saying abyssus abyssum invocat and it should trigger the curse my hand shook as i took the dagger from his long fingers it was a curse well duh i thought recalling that my demon marks had transformed along with me when id been a wolf swallowing i pulled my gaze up to his curly hair and his eyes so very wrong thats it he nodded with no expression and my tension rose another notch its a public curse to do it longhand would require some time and be pointless i accepted the dagger it felt heavy and smooth in my grip the ornate carvings obvious against my fingers who gets the imbalance i asked at that minias started you know about the cost of course she knows about that jenks said you think youre dealing with a sophomoric leviter he scowled and i smiled admittedly a sour one ceri moved so i could see her she was smug pleased her student was holding her own who gets the smut i asked again minias ran a finger down the embroidered edge of his sleeve the wearer of it but unlike most curses the smut vanishes along with the mark unless the wearer dies before paying it ceri nodded saying he was telling the truth my legs were shaking i had to get rid of my demon marks i didnt know how much longer i could keep my body and soul together if demons kept showing up in my church dagger in my grip i stared at him i was going to have to cut him demon magic sucked tell me where you want it i said minias drew back his purple robes shifting about his ankles youre asking me well unless you want a big r on your forehead it almost looked like he wanted to smile behind my ear if you would i ran my gaze up his formidable height youre going to have to bend over jenks snickered you want some lubricant rachels going to screw you over good jenks i exclaimed then stifled a shriek when minias swooped forward and before jenks could react grabbed me about the waist twisting he plunked my butt on the counter can you reach me now he said his eyes happy that he had scared me damn it i wasnt safe in here i dont care what hed agreed to ceri paced outside the circle and jenks was shedding whitehot sparkles dont touch me i said my voice high as i sat frozen on the counter shaking as i gripped my knife you touch me again and ill ill do something this is the most backward bargain ive ever made minias muttered sulkily not impressed with my threat he glanced at jenks hovering out of his reach with his sword bared then moved his attention to me well my hand was still shaking he was at the right height and nervous i reached out with my free hand and brushed his curly hair aside to show the pale skin behind it i could smell the everafter on him but combined with the herbs around me it sort of smelled nice i let his soft hair slip through my fingers then pulled his curls back once more enjoying the sensation touch me like that again minias said in a low voice and ill rip your fingers off i glanced at ceri and remembered her twisted affections for her demon captor sorry immediately i strengthened my hold on the line steeling myself i felt my grip on the knife go slick with sweat im really sorry i said then made a quick downward cut normallooking blood flowed and jenkss wings hummed in agitation minias stiffened invoke the curse you idiot he snapped ceri was standing helplessly outside her circle and before i lost my nerve i said the words a curious sensation pulled through me like when i had called minias the first time i was tapping in to a communal spell and it gave me the willies my lips parted and jenks swore as the cut mended right before me a line of scar tissue showing when the smear of everafter vanished holy crap jenks blurted and minias jerked away three steps from me he felt the skin behind his ear and frowned remembering the knife in my hand i dropped it the clatter of it hitting the counter was loud you promised youd leave i reminded him now his goatslitted eyes fixed on me and though i knew it was impossible i felt as if he were seeing my past or maybe my future face unreadable minias leaned close the cloying odor of burnt amber mixed with the dry scent of his silk robes and i refused to shrink away i can change my eyes if i work at it he murmured and i jerked back it could be you didnt hear my voice because youre an unregistered user he added as if not having said his previous words you need to change that ceri was pale and feeling ill i said i dont want to be in a demon registry go minias touched the crucible his fingers coming away with ash its too late you put yourself on it when you called me the first time either update your information so i can reach you or i have every right to pop over here anytime i think i have a way to remove my mark my head came up and i stared sick with dread damn was that why he had agreed to wear the mark in the first place miniass eyes glittered with success and i dropped my head into my cupped hand double damn how do i register i said flatly and he snickered you need a password connect to your calling circle as if youre going to contact me and while connected to aline think your given name and then follow it with your password qed simple enough get a password i said feeling weary okay i can do that minias was eyeing me from under some curls that had escaped from his hat he was silent for a moment and then as if he didnt really want to he crossed his arms over his chest and said you have a common name that everyone calls you and a password that you keep to yourself pick it carefully thats how people pull demons over the lines horrified i looked from jenks to ceri who was now holding her stomach a summoning name i stammered figuring it out your password is a summoning name the demon grimaced if it gets out yes it can be used to force someone across the lines thats why you pick a password that no one can piece together i backed up until i bumped into ceris circle i dont want a password fine with me minias said snidely but if i cant contact you im going to come over when its convenient for me not you and seeing as i dont care its going to be right before sunrise when youre trying to sleep or making dinner or screwing your boyfriend his eyes drifted over the kitchen or is it girlfriend shut up i exclaimed worried and embarrassed but i was stuck and stuck tight make it impossible to guess minias said nonsense syllables my mouth opened in an of realization thats why demon names are so weird i said and from behind him ceri nodded her face was white and she looked as shaky as i felt demon names arent weird minias said indignantly they serve a purpose jenks landed on my shoulder how about your name backward nagromanairamlehcar i felt my face twist it sounded like a demon name terrible minias said and i moved back when he picked up my chalkboard and set it on the counter your names backward will be the first one al tries and if he figures it out he can do untold mischief under your name and nix on the birthdates hobbies favorite ice cream movie stars or old boyfriends no numbers or weird characters that cant be pronounced stay away from the backward theme its too easy to run through the dictionary and find you that would take forever i scoffed then blanched when minias set his red eyes on me forever is just about what we have i felt something shift and i watched him ready to move if he did but he turned away glancing at my kitchen clock above the sink you need to leave i said hearing my voice shake and jenkss wings clattered as he took flight to hover between us mmmm minias inclined his head i agree were done now but with this mark between us to settle up i will be talking to you its my godgiven right to try to pay it off touching the side of his hat he vanished in a cascading sheet of everafter i tightened my grip on my line as i felt him use it to cross into the everafter numb i stared at where he had been what in hell have i just done immediately ceri broke her circle almost knocking me over as she gave me a hug to be sure i was still alive rachel crap what have i done rachel ceri was shaking me and i blearily looked at her seeing my awareness return she sighed in relief and her hands fell from my shoulders rachel she said again softer i dont think you should do demon magic anymore jenks lit on her shoulder where he could see me he was scared you think i said bitterly wiping a hand under my eye it came away wet but i wasnt crying not really actually ceri dropped her head clearly worried i dont think you should do any ley line magic either sliding down from the counter i looked past ceri to the dark garden lit with the occasional flicker of pixy dust my dad hadnt wanted me to have anything to do with ley line magic maybe maybe i should have a talk with trent as to why thirteen rachel hand me the hammer will you ivy said her voice raised so she could be heard over the pixies yammering in the corner loud enough to make my eyeballs ache ive got another popped nail she added as i puffed to blow a curl that had escaped my ponytail out of my eyes jamming the rolled insulation back between the twobyfour studs i turned the afternoon sun came in the high windows in the living room to make dusty beams that the pixies were playing in they had just woken from their afternoon nap and jenks had them in here so matalina could get a few extra winks shed been feeling poorly lately but jenks had assured us that she was doing fine his kids were a bloody nuisance but i wasnt going to suggest they leave matalina could get all the sleep she wanted fumbling i pulled the hammer from the sill i had borrowed it from my mom this morning having dodged her questions with the excuse that i was putting up a birdhouse not fixing the damage of an insane demon whod trashed our living room that it was july and too late for nests had never occurred to her here i said smacking the ash handle into ivys bare hand with a soft and certain pop she smiled before turning to pound in a nail that had pulled through the paneling newt had ripped down pixies squealed and jenkss attention shot to them as he sat on a far sill with his youngest set of sextuplets teaching them to tie their shoes immediately his blurring wings stilled and he resumed his lesson it was a nice piece of pixy life we didnt get a chance to see often a reminder that jenks had an entire life outside of ivy and me ivy looked like a construction workers calendar girl in her worn hiphugger jeans and black tshirt her straight hair covered with one of those paper hats you get at paint stores body moving with a controlled grace she pounded the stray nail into the paneling soon as she backed up three pixies were there to inspect it all helpfully pointing out the tear she had made in the paper veneer saying nothing ivy glued it back down and continued on smiling i turned away ivy wasnt pleased she had missed another one of my encounters with a demon it was probably why she was hanging so tight today needing to reassure herself that i was okay and i could use her help after seeing the estimate to replace a few sheets of paneling and carpet we had decided to do it ourselves so far it had been easy just tidy the studs newt had pulled the paneling off and put up new there was no wall behind the thin sheets and the insulation was the roll type not the blownin stuff we had put in the churchs ceilings last fall it didnt really look up to code but thats what you get when you do it yourself as for the carpet it could stay out on the curb there had been an oak floor under it all it needed was a nice coat of shine thanks ivy said handing the hammer back and i slid it onto the mantel no problem i straightened my shortsleeved shirt to cover my midriff and pulled a handful of thin nails from the box beside the hammer and arranged them between my lips you wanna old is for ee well i ammer it i asked as i tried to maneuver an unwieldy piece of paneling into place bending ivy took it by the one edge and wedged it tight against the old paneling her vampire strength making it look like she was holding a sheet of cardboard with a few quick whacks i put a nail in the upper left corner moved around her to put another in the lower right then a third in the upper right the rich scent of vampire incense mixed with the sawdust and my latest perfume in a pleasant fragrance of contentment thanks i said after i took the nails out of my mouth i can get it now her smooth oval face showing nothing she backed up her hands rubbing against each other as if soothing herself it was the first time we had done anything together since she had bitten me and it felt good like we were back to normal hey rache jenks said loudly as the kids before him rose up and joined the others in a dusty sunbeam ive got one for you how about rumpelstiltskin i didnt bother to write that one down on the legal pad sitting on the dusty mantel simply lifting my eyebrows at him as he laughed at me id been trying to think up a password since coming back from my moms with the toolbox and i wasnt having any luck id go with an acronym ivy suggested one that isnt in the dictionary or your names backward her eyes fixed on mine with an odd intensity as she intoned nagromanairamlehcar that both jenks and she had thought of the same thing proved minias was right about the nobackward theme no i said before jenks did minias nixed it he said its too easy to run through the dictionary backward and find you no numbers no spaces no real words and nothing backward grabbing a few more nails i stretched to reach the top of the panel ivy dropped back and watched me for a moment before starting to move quietly about and put the tools away i could feel her attention on me as i worked down the stud line aware she was there but not uncomfortable about it it was noon for criminys sake and she had probably slaked her blood lust with skimmer last night and does that bother me i asked myself smacking a nail with an extra amount of force not at all not one bit but i couldnt stop the memory of her biting me swim up from my unconscious a soft tingle grew at my old demon scar and i stayed still simply tasting the feeling that warmed me from my skin inward and trying to decide if it had been born from my thoughts and ivys pheromonesor my desire for her to be happy did it matter jenks flew up from the sill and moved to the mantel his wings clearing the dust from where he landed how about something in latin he said as he walked to my list and stared down at it like kickass witch or royally screwed raptus regaliter i said thinking it sounded too much like rumpelstiltskin they all know latin i think that comes under using words in the dictionary his expression sly jenks glanced at ivy as she put the drill away how about iaasw he said which means i am a stupid witchor heres one grinning he stood on my list with his hands on his hips nuacsiepasn thats a great name ivy shook the thick contractor garbage bag down and dropped her paper hat in it whats that stand for never under any circumstances should i ever pick a summoning name i pressed my lips together and hammered a nail ivy snickered and took a sip of bottled water she had on the sill i think we should call her spam because her ass is going to be in a tin if shes not careful ticked i turned hammer in hand you know what i said waving it in a weak threat you can all just shut up you can all shut up right now capping her water ivy frowned i dont even know why youre doing this ivy i started tired of it its asking for trouble she said setting the empty bottle back on the sill jenks stood on my list staring down at it with his hands on his hips shes doing it for the thrill he said distantly i am not i protested they both looked at me in disbelief yes you are jenks said as if it didnt bother him its textbook rachel coming close to something lethal but not quite there he smiled and we looooove you for it he crooned shut up i muttered turning my back on him and hammering im doing this so minias doesnt have to pop over here to get that mark resolved leaning into the sun i grabbed another handful of nails you liked minias showing up that way i said his eyes on his kids clustered on the windowsill jenks shrugged i agree with what youre doing but not why i just told you why nervous i tucked a wayward strand of hair behind my ear look if you dont want to help me pick out a password thats fine i can do it myself ivy and jenks glanced questioningly at each otheras if i were incapable of doing this on my ownand my blood pressure spiked dad came a highpitched shriek from a desperate pixy dad jariath and jumoke glued my wings shut surprised i felt my anger ping to nothing and i turned to the window four streaks of gray raced out of the living room there was a metallic crash from the kitchen and i wondered what had hit the floor jenks stood frozen his face a mix of fear of what would happen if matalina found out and embarrassment that he had taken his eyes off them long enough for them to glue someones wings together instantly he recovered and was airborne darting to the shelf he tucked the hysterical child under his arm and took off after the others in a swirl of silk and dismay the entire clan whirled into motion jariathjackjunisjumoke jenks shouted from the kitchen and then even that was gone to leave only a shimmering sifting of dust and an echo of memory in our thoughts damn ivy said to break the silence then started to laugh quietly taking up the glue she glanced at the label and tossed it to me water soluble i thought then dropped it into the toolbox i smiled ruefully and though i hoped jenks got his kids wings unglued i thought i had my summoning name right there jariathjackjunisjumoke if i ever forgot it all id have to do was ask any pixy kid who had gotten their backsides tanned for glueing someones wings shut oh hey ivy said after bending to the portable radio and clicking it on have you heard takatas latest yup glad the pixies were gone i grabbed more nails as the song in question belted out i cant wait until the winter solstice think hell ask us to work security again god i hope so she turned it up to sing with the refrainher voice soft but clear when i finished hammering in the last nail in the row ivy maneuvered the final piece of paneling in place and i tacked in the corners without pause we worked well together we always had the sound of pixies laughing in the garden assured me everything was fine relaxing i breathed in the distinctive scent of raw wood and insulation it was a bright day the heat wave had finally snapped jenks was doing dad stuff ivy and i were getting back to normal and she was singing it couldnt get much better than that my expression softened when i realized she was singing words to a verse that i couldnt hear it was the vamp track that takata put in his music something special that only the undead and their scions could hear well trent had a pair of spelled headphones that let him hear it but that didnt count he had offered me a set once i had turned him down because of what he would have attached to his gift even so while hearing ivy harmonize to takatas voice both rough and smooth i wished i had a pair the one time i had listened in with trents headphones the womans tortured pure voice had been exquisite ivy grabbed the broom and started sweeping i finished one line of nails bent upside down for the last few then started on the next column intent on trying to catch what ivy was singing i missed a nail grazing my thumb i jerked yelping when the sharp pain zinged through me my thumb was in my mouth almost before i knew i had nicked it you okay ivy asked and i nodded eyeing the red mark on my thumb then checked out the wall crap i had dented the paneling dont worry about it ivy said we can put the couch there tired i whacked the nail one more time tossing the hammer into the toolbox i sat on the hearth stretched out my legs and eyed my thumbnail it was going to turn purple i knew it ivy resumed sweeping her motions slow and evenhypnotic almost the music changed from takata to an obnoxious man screaming about cars and i leaned to turn it off my shoulders eased in the new silence the hush of the broom was soothing and the garden had gone silent the pixies off doing pixy things at the far end of the graveyard no doubt bending sharply ivy swept the splinters and dust into the pan her black hair flashing silver when it hit the sun the rattle of plastic was soft as she dropped it into the contractor garbage bag a wry smile came over my face when she began sweeping the entire floor again i lurched to my feet and started rearranging the tools in the box so i could get the thing shut id return them to my mom this sunday when i went over for my postbirthday dinner there was no getting out of it i just hoped she hadnt invited anyone else with the intent to play matchmaker maybe i should call and tell her ivy was coming that would put the curl in her eyelashes and then she would set an extra place for ivy just glad i was with someone hows your thumb ivy asked into the silence and i started fine i glanced at it as i came up from snapping the latches on the toolbox i hate it when i do stuff like that ivy propped the broom against the wall by the door and came closer let me see eager for some sympathy i held it out and she took my hand a shiver went through me and feeling it ivy glanced from under her short bangs iced in gold stop it she said darkly pissed almost why i said pulling my hand away you did bite me i know how it feels and how it makes you feel i want to find a blood balance why dont you ivys face turned to a shocked surprise hell i had surprised myself and a stirring of adrenaline tingled under my skin as my pulse quickened i bit you she said anger coloring her words you practically seduced me played on every instinct i had well you gave me the book i shot back you expect me to believe you didnt want me to for a moment she said nothing eyes slowly dilating as she stood in the sun i held my breath not knowing what might happen if she had to be mad to talk to me then she had to be mad but instead of coming back with more anger she retreated a step i dont want to talk about it she said i started to protest and she turned vanishing past the archway hey i exclaimed knowing it was a bad idea to follow a fleeing vampire but when had i ever done the smart thing ivy i complained finding her at the kitchen sink scrubbing furiously the sharp scent of cleanser was thick and a cloud of it hung over her glittering in the sun she must have dumped half the canister i want to talk about it i said and she shot me a look that struck me cold i know what to expect now i added doggedly from the hallway it wont be as bad you dont know what bad is she said then turned on the tap her motions were rough edging into a vampire quickness realizing i was blocking her exit i sidled into the kitchen and pretended to get a bottle of water my pulse was fast and i shut the fridge door cracking the cap and taking a swig how often do you need blood i asked then jumped when she whipped around her hands tangled in a dish towel thats putting it ugly rachel she accused hurt showing in the slant of her eyebrows its not ugly i protested thats the point you need blood to feel good about yourself hell i need sex at least once a week if im dating someone i care about or im plagued with delusions that the guy doesnt love me or hes cheating on me or any number of stupid groundless ideas it doesnt make sense but there it is why should you be any different so how often do you need to share blood to feel secure and happy her face was scarlet beside her black hair how about that under it all ivy was shy two or three times a week she muttered its not that i need a lot at any one time its the act not the result then her roving eyes fixed on me striking me to my core i can do that i said heart pounding i can right ivy stared abruptly she shifted into motion and i was looking at an empty room ivy i exclaimed setting the bottle on the table and following her out im not asking you to bite me i simply want to talk i glanced into her room and bathroom in passing then heard her footsteps in the sanctuary she was leaving typical ivy i cajoled then caught my breath in a tiny gasp when i entered the sanctuary and she was suddenly before me i stumbled to a stop taking in her wiretight posture and her black eyes i was pushing it and we both knew it my demon scar was tingling from the pheromones she was kicking out and the memory of jenks telling me i was an adrenaline junkie surfaced but damn it this was the most id gotten her to open up in months youre following me she said the threat behind her voice making me stifle a shudder i want to talk i said just talk i know youre afraid hey i yelped when her arm shot out and pushed my shoulder my back touched the wall and i looked up ivy was right in front of me eyes black as sinand alive as the sun i have good reason to be afraid she said her breath shifting my hair you think i dont want to bite you you think i dont want to fill myself with you again you love me rachel whether you know what to do about it or not and love without demands comes so seldom to a vampire it drives me insane knowing youre right there and i cant have you i stared pulse racing knees going weak maybe following her had been a mistake i want it so bad that i hurt people to keep you safe and almost criminally innocent ivy said so if i dont bite you trust me theres a reason she pushed hard on my shoulder and turned around shocked i watched her walk away the sun coining in through the stainedglass windows made spots of color on her as her arms swung stiffly my resolve strengthened i took a step after her this pattern of her fleeing my questions was getting old talk to me i demanded why wont you at least try to find a way to make this work you could be so happy ivy ivy halted just before the foyer hand on her hip as she faced the door for three heartbeats she stood before she slowly spun slim and tense she made a picture of collected frustration you cant stop me she said simply and i took a protesting step forward youre too wrapped up in the ecstasy to keep conscious enough to stop me if things go wrong and rachel unless i mix sex with it things will go wrong its how piscary made me a glimmer of her selfdisgust her hatred of who she was showed and my heart ached to prove to her she was wrong my breath came fast and i held it i know what to expect now i said softly it was the surprise i can do better hip cocked she looked to her left as if searching for strength or maybe answers better wont keep you alive she said and i went cold at the caustic sound you dont have it in you you said yourself you dont want to hurt me if i take your blood again without letting my feelings for you shackle my hunger youre going to have to hurt me because the hunger will take control and im not capable of stopping then think you can do that my mouth went dry and my first words came out in a croak i i stammered i dont have to hurt you to stop you is that so she said and as i stood frozen with my eyes wide she dropped her purse lets find out i jerked back as she leapt gasping i dove toward her pushing off the wall my intent was to get past her if she got a hold on me i was dead meat this wasnt passion this was anger anger at herself perhaps but anger the thump of her hitting the wall where i had been brought my heart into my throat i spun where i landed she was coming back and i grabbed her arm wrenching it to lever her into falling she twisted from me rolled by the sound of it and i spun but i was too slow and i bit back a yelp when a white arm slipped around my neck her fingers pinched my hand bending my wrist backward until it hurt i went slack in her grip caught and unable to best her vampire reactions it was over that quickly she had me hurt me rachel she whispered stirring my hair show me you arent afraid to hurt me if you arent brought up that its the norm its harder than you think she wasnt masochistic she was a realist trying to get me to understand frightened i struggled pain ripping through my shoulder her grip was confining without being painful it was my trying to get away that hurt i went still eyes wide and focused on the wall i felt her warm against my back and tension pulled my muscles tight one by one as the tingling started high in my neck and trickled lower we can share blood without love if you hurt me ivy breathed her breath brushing my ear we can share blood without hurt if you love me there is no middle ground i dont want to hurt you i said knowing that my magic was like a ball bat i had no finesse it would hurt her and hurt her bad let go i demanded shifting she tightened her grip and a thread of heat coiled in my center as my motion ended with more of our bodies touching this had started as an object lesson to get me to leave her alone but now oh god what if she bites me again right now youre the one stopping us from finding a blood balance she said love is pain rachel figure it out get over it it wasnt at least it didnt have to be i wiggled again ow ow i said feet scuffling i was starting to sweat her scent poured over me soothing enticing bringing the memory of her teeth sliding into me to the forefront of my thoughts as evolution had intended and when my eyes closed at a surge of adrenaline pooling in me to set my blood rushing i realized just what kind of trouble we were in i didnt want her to let go uh ivy damn it she whispered and the heat in her voice hit me hard we were six kinds of stupid i had only wanted to talk and she had only wanted to prove how dangerous finding a blood balance would be and now it was too late for thinking her grip tightened and i relaxed into it god you smell good she said and my pulse thrummed i shouldnt have touched you feeling unreal i tried to move finding shed let me turn to face her my heart jumped into my throat and i swallowed as i gazed into her perfect face flushed with the danger of where we were her eyes were black as absolute night reflecting my image lips parted eyes wild the darkness was colored by the blood lust shimmering in her eyes and below that deeper under it all was her fragile vulnerability i cant hurt you i said fear a faint whisper in me my neck throbbed with the memory of her lips on me the glorious feeling of her pulling drawing what she needed to fill the hurting chasm in her soul her eyes closed and breathing deeply i felt myself relax against her as her forehead touched my shoulder im not going to bite you she said her teeth inches from me and a pulse of need shocked though me im not going to bite you my soul seemed to darken with her words the question of what she would do had been answered she was going to walk away she was going to let go drop back and walk away a feeling of loss rose to wind around my lungs crushing my air from me but i want to she said and the chained desire in her whisper sent a pulse through me i gasped as the unexpected sensation dove to my middle and set me alight twice as potent since i had given up on it it was followed by fear and ivys grip clenched i froze when she tilted her head her lips brushing just shy of my scar either bite me or let me go i breathed dizzy with need how did this happen how did it happen so fast close your eyes she said her gray voice holding the emotion she was trying to control my pulse hammered and lids fluttering i felt her pull back in my imagination i could see her black eyes see the heat in them and the way she got off on selfdenial followed by a savage fulfillment when it became too much for her to contain the guilt coating her soul dont move she said and i trembled at her breath against my cheek she was going to bite me oh god id do better this time i wouldnt let her lose control i could do this promise me she said running a finger across my neck to make my breath catch that this wont change anything that you know its a taste for you to try and that i will do nothing to encourage you i wont ever do it again unless you come to me if you come to me and dont come to me unless you want it all rachel i cant do it any other way a taste i had already tasted this but i nodded my eyelids closed my breath came in a pant and i held it waiting aching for the feel of her teeth in me i promise keep your eyes shut she breathed and i almost moaned when her light touch upon my scar lit a path through me to my groin i gasped feeling the wall against my back and her grip on me tighten my heart pounded and anticipation coiled deeper tighter the softness of her small lips on mine went almost unnoticed until her hand left my scar and crept to the back of my neck to hold me unmoving i froze shes kissing me my first reaction to jerk away rose and fell everything confusing as my body still resonated with the wash of endorphins that her playing on my scar had started a taste she had said and adrenaline pounded she felt the lack of a violent response and with her lips the barest whisper on mine she shifted her hand finding my scar again a groan escaped me she had let up enough to be sure i knew what she was doing and now she was going to let me have it all oh god ivy i moaned the conflict between knowledge and emotion making me helpless and she pressed me into the wall her lips upon mine again becoming more sure aggressive the hint of her tongue brought a gasp from me and i froze not knowing what to do it was too much i couldnt think her light touch retreated and with a suddenness that shocked through me she pulled away panting i leaned against the wall my eyes open and my hand pressing the throbbing pulse of my neck ivy stood four feet away her eyes utterly black and her body clearly hurting from the effort she had exerted to let go all or nothing rachel she said stumbling backward looking afraid im not going to be the one to leave and i wont ever kiss you again unless you start it but if you try to manipulate me into biting you again im going to assume youre taking me up on my offer and ill meet you her eyes went frightened with all of me my pulse hammered and my knees wobbled this was going to make our mornings alone a little more uncomfortableor a hell of a lot more interesting you promised you wouldnt leave she said her voice becoming vulnerable and then she was gone her steps sharp as she picked up her purse and fled the church and the confusion she had left me in my hand dropped and i held myself as if trying to keep from falling apart what in hell have i done just stood there and let her do i should have pushed her away but i hadnt i had started it and she had used my scar to manipulate me into seeing what she offered without fear and holding all the passion it might entail all or nothing she had said and now that i had tasted it all without fear i knew what that meant the rumble of ivys cycle echoed in through the open transom windows fading into the distant sound of traffic i slowly let myself slide down the wall until i hit the floor knees scrunched and trying to breathe okay i thought still feeling the promise of her resonating in me now what the hell am i going to do fourteen the dry sifting of wings coming in the high windows drew my attention and i stood wiping the sweat from my neck jenks where had he been five minutes ago and what in hell was i going to do now ivy had said she wouldnt do anything again unless i started it but could i stay in the church with that kiss resonating between us every time she looked at me id be wondering what she was thinking maybe that was her intent hey rache jenks called cheerfully as he dropped from the ceiling wheres ivy going i dont know numb i headed to the kitchen before he could see my state clearly his kids wings were okay arent you supposed to be sleeping i said rubbing my sore wrist crap if it bruised it would look great with my bridesmaids dress at least i didnt have a new bite mark to go with it ah hell jenks said and i dropped my eyes when i saw his disapproving gaze it stinks in here you pushed her again didnt you it wasnt a question and i walked without pause into the kitchen you stupidass witch he said shedding silver sparkles as he followed is she coming back you scare her off for good this time whats wrong with you cant you leave it alone jenks shut up i said flatly grabbing my forgotten bottled water and heading into the living room the radio was in there if i turned it high enough i wouldnt be able to hear him we talked is all and she kissed me i got a few questions answered and with her messing with my scar at the same time it felt really good shit how was i supposed to figure this out i thought i was straight i was wasnt i or did i have latent tendencies and if i did were they really a convenient excuse for thinking with my gspot was that what i was all about had i no depth at all he followed me into the empty living room and i sat on the raised hearth trying to remember how to think i clicked on the radio to find happy bouncy music and i turned it off well jenks landed on my knee looking almost hopeful but then his wings stilled and drooped when i sighed i asked about a blood balance and she set some rules i said looking out the high windows at the undersides of the oak trees leaves shes not going to make a move to touch my blood but if i even hint that i want her to its with the understanding that i want everything he looked at me blankly and i added she kissed me jenks his eyes widened and a small part of me was reassured that he hadnt seen the entire thing and was hiding the fact did you like it he asked bluntly and i frowned shifting my knee until he took off to land right where he had been she was playing on my scar at the time i muttered blushing i got a real good idea what it would be like to let my hair down and go with it but i dont know where the feelings are coming from anymore she mixed them all up then walked out the door so jenks hedged what are you going to do i gave him a mirthless smile his unconditional acceptance was a balm and the tension eased he didnt care what ivy and i did as long as we stayed together and didnt kill each other how should i know i said as i stood can we talk about something else hell yes jenks said rising up with me you just keep thinking whatever you need to think as long as you dont leave setting my water on the sill i took up the broom and started to sweep our brandnew floor again i wasnt going to leave because ivy had kissed me shed said she wasnt going to do it again and i believed her knowing how shed wanted this since our moving in together and me being as dumb as a stone because of her ability to hide her desires the way she could it had been a taste to show me what might be then a return to the distance we kept to give me the time i needed to think about it figure things out the turn take it jenks hovered for a moment then landed on the sill and in the sun this is better he said scanning the bare walls i dont know why you didnt let the guys do it it wasnt that much and the amount you saved wont make a dent in what we need to resanctify the church his face grew worried and we are going to resanctify it right i mean we cant move rising from sweeping the dust into the pan i turned to him hearing the worry he was trying to hide it didnt matter how uncomfortable things got between ivy and me if the firm fell apart jenks would probably lose control of the garden he had way too many kids and matalina wasnt up to staking out new territory jenks said she was okay but i worried we arent moving i said flatly and i dumped the pan in the black contractor bag well find a way to get the church resanctified ivy and i will deal with the uncomfortable situation like we always have by ignoring it it was something we were both good at reassured jenks glanced into the garden the sun glinting on his shock of bright yellow hair i still say you shouldve let the guys fix the walls he said what did you save a hundred bucks tinks knickers thats nothing i set the broom aside and shook the trash down in the bag looking for a twisttie ill have a big chunk after trents wedding unless nothing happens but what are the chances of that jenks snickered with your luck nothing will i scanned the living room and tried to decide how to pick up the bag of trash without getting poked by a stray nail or jagged sliver though the space was empty and echoing the walls were back together and the newly uncovered floor was clean a quick trip to the store for a new piece of baseboard and we could move everything back actually there was no reason to wait for the baseboard i could move everything back in now and finish it later if i hustled i could get it back before ivy returned it might be easier to do it myself than our doing it together phones going to ring jenks said from atop the brooms handle and i froze jumping when it did god jenks thats creepy i muttered as i dropped the bag and went to the hearth i knew he probably heard the electronics click over but it was still unnerving he was grinning as i plucked up the receiver vampiric charms i said adopting my most professional voice i stuck my tongue out at jenks and he merrily flipped me off this is morgan we can help day or night dead or alive where are the freaking pen and paper rachel its glenn my breath puffed out and i relaxed hi glenn i said looking for something to sit on and finally moving to the kitchen whats up you got another job for me maybe want to arrest another one of my friends i didnt arrest mr hue and its the same job he sounded tense and since the chance to get money out of the fib didnt come very often i dropped into my chair at the table my gaze flicked to jenks the pixy having followed me in and clearly listening to both ends of the conversation theres been another were murder made up to look like a suicide glenn said around the noise of fib scanners and birds and i wondered if he was on site id like you and jenks to give me your inderlander opinion before they move the body how soon can you get here i glanced at my constructiondusty jeans and tshirt wondering just what he thought i could do that he couldnt i wasnt a detective i was a hired spell casterbounty hunter jenks took to the air darting out the pixy hole in the kitchen screen ah i hedged cant i just come to the morgue and look at the body you have something better to do i thought about the living room and how i wanted our stuff back in it before ivy got back well actually theyre going to try to jerk it out from under me again glenn said drawing my attention back to him and i want you to see it before the is has a chance to doctor the body rachel his voice took on a hard edge its mrs sarongs accountant you know the howlers he was high in the pack and no one is happy my eyebrows rose mrs sarong was the owner of cincinnatis allinderland baseball team the howlers it was their fish i had tried to recover from mr raythe same mr ray whose secretary was already in the morgue i had forced the woman to pay me for my time actually meeting her in the process that there had been two suicides from two of cincinnatis most prominent packs in as many days was not good it was obvious someone knew that the focus was in cincinnati and was trying to find out who had it i had to get rid of it the chaos would be astounding if an entire pack could turn humans vampires would start culling them my fingers started to tap the table maybe thats what was already happening piscary was in jail but that wouldnt stop him the sound of wings was a relief and jenks came back in dressed for work a sword and belt in one hand a red bandanna in the other the murdered were is mrs sarongs accountant i said to him as i stood and looked for my shoulder bag oh jenks dropped several inches a guilty look coming over him aaaah that might explain the message on the machine i covered the phone receiver unable to hide my exasperation jenks he made a face leaking silver sparkles i forgot okay rachel came glenns tiny voice pulling me back to him yeah i held a hand to my forehead yes glenn i can come out there i hesitated where are you glenn cleared his throat spring grove he muttered a cemetery oooooh how nice okay i said standing up straight and scuffing into my sandals see you in a bit great thanks he sounded preoccupied as if he were trying to do two things at once i took a breath to say goodbye but glenn had hung up eyeing jenks i thumbed the phone off and cocked my hip i have a message i said dryly jenks looked uncomfortable as he put the bandanna on to look like an innercity gang member in his black working clothes mr ray wants to talk to you he said softly i thought about his secretary having been murdered and the i s not only looking the other way but trying to cover it up ill bet grabbing my bag i looked to make sure i had all my usual spells the thought occurred to me that mr ray might be the one killing the weres but why would he kill his own secretary first maybe mrs sarong had murdered the woman and the second killing had been in retaliation i was getting a headache remembering my suspended license i hesitated but what kind of image would i have if i arrived on a crime scene by bus and i pulled out my keys my gaze went to the shelves under the center island counter leaning i smiled when the smooth heavy weight of my splatball gun filled my palm the metal parts clicked comfortingly as i checked the reservoir spells stored in amulets were good for a year but unstored invoked potions lasted only a week these were three weeks old and useless but waving my gun around made me feel good and ticked glenn off i dropped it into my bag as jenks finished writing a note for ivy ready i asked him he flew to my shoulder bringing the delicate scent of the soap matalina washed his clothes in you want to take his ketchup he asked oh yeah i strode into the pantry coming out with the gallon jar of superduper bellybuster hot jalapeño salsa and the big red tomato i had gotten him as a surprise pulse fast i headed for the hall a gallon of salsa on my hip a tomato in my hand and a pixy on my shoulder yeah we bad fifteen the afternoon sun was hot and easing my car door shut i gave it a bump with my hip to latch it my fingers were sticky from the pastry id eaten en route and i scanned the sparrownoisy grounds while i dug a tissue out of my bag wiping my fingers clean i wondered if i should have taken five minutes to change into a more professional outfit than shorts and a topprofessionalism being something i desperately needed seeing as i was skulking around the mausoleum that id parked my car behind jenks had run vanguard for me as i took the back roads to spring grove if i had driven the interstate the is would have nailed my butt to a broomstick it had made for slow traveldriving three blocks parking waiting for jenks to do some recon then moving forward another three blocksbut i couldnt stomach the idea of taking a cab and as i hiked my shoulder bag higher and headed across the grass i again thanked god i had friends thanks jenks i said stumbling when my sandals hit a dip the mower had hidden his wings tickled my neck and i added i appreciate you running rabbit for me with the is hey its my job there was more than a hint of annoyance to it and feeling guilty for having asked him to fly twice what i had driven i said its not your job to make sure my butt stays out of traffic court then added softly ill go to driversed class tonight i promise jenks laughed the tinkling sound brought out three pixies from the nearby bank of evergreens but upon seeing jenkss red bandana they vanished the obvious color was his first line of defense against territorial pixies and fairies a sign of good intentions and a promise not to poach theyd watch us but wouldnt start catapulting thorns unless jenks sampled the meager pollen or nectar sources id rather have pixies watching me than fairies though and i liked the idea that pixies had spring grove they must be well structured since the grounds were huge the sprawling cemetery was said to have been originally developed to tastefully rehouse cholera victims in the late s it was one of the first garden cemeteries in the unites states the undead liked their parks as much as the next person did it had been hard to keep your newly undead relatives out of the ground back then and being unearthed in such peaceful settings must have been a small favor i had to wonder if the large hidden vampire population cincy had in those days had much to do with how the queen city gained the dubious distinction of being known for grave robbing it wasnt so much that they were supplying the multitudes of teaching hospitals with cadavers but pulling their relatives out of the ground and back where they belonged scanning the quiet parklike grounds i wiped my mouth of the last of the frosting the feel of my fingers across my lips brought ivy to mind for obvious reasons and i warmed god i should have done something but nooooo i stood there like an idiot too surprised to move i hadnt reacted and now i was going to have to think about how to handle this instead of settling it right then stupidass witch you okay jenks asked and i pulled my hand down peachy i said sourly and he laughed youre thinking of ivy he needled and my flush deepened well duh i said stumbling on a marker set even with the ground you have your roommate kiss you and you see if you can just forget it hell jenks said flying just out of my reach with a grin on his face if one of you kissed me i wouldnt have to think matalina would kill me relax it was only a kiss i plodded over the grounds following the sound of radios this was just what i needed as if an insane demon tearing apart my church werent enough i now had a fourinch man telling me to lighten up go with the flow live lifedont analyze it jenkss wing clatter softened and he lit on my shoulder dont worry about it rache he said his voice unusually solemn youre you and ivy is ivy nothing has changed yeah i muttered not seeing it that clearly angle to the left he said cheerfully i can smell dead were down there thats nice i answered continuing on past a marker and cutting a soft left downslope and through the trees were the flashing amber and blue lights of a multispecies ambulance im not too late i thought arms swinging as we passed a huge stone marked weil beyond a row of cedars was an artificial pond and between that and the evergreens was a cluster of people rache jenks said his voice introspective you think this has anything to do with the bushes have ears i warned the thing i picked up for matalina on our last vacation he amended and my lips twitched in amusement i had twisted a demon curse to move the curse in the focus to a knickknack that it had slowly changed form to look like the original statue was just plain creepy eyes on my feet i murmured mmmmhmm id be surprised if it wasnt you think this is trent looking for it i dont think trent knows it exists i said id be more inclined to think its mr ray or mrs sarong and theyre killing each other as they try to find it jenkss wings sent a cool breeze across my neck what about piscary maybe but he wouldnt be having this much trouble covering it up i said glancing up when the mens tone of voice shifted indicating that id been seen i slowed at the hushed mutter of my name but since everyone was looking at me i didnt know whod said it there were two fib vehicles a black is van an is cruiser and an ambulance parked in the turnaround counting the third fib vehicle at the cemeterys back entrance the fib presence was stronger than the iss and i wondered if glenn was pushing his luck it had been a were suicide the cluster of men surrounded a dark shadow at the foot of the cedars and a tall tombstone and a second group in fib uniforms and suits waited like cubs at a lions kill glenn was with them and while catching my eye he said a few words to the man next to him touched the hilt of his weapon for reassurance and headed over people turned away and i relaxed my feet scuffed the grass and i cringed upon realizing id walked right on one of those markers set flush with the ground nervousness struck deep when a familiar bulk beside the tombstone straightened and denons brown eyes met mine he was wearing a suit today instead of his usual slacks and polo shirt and i wondered if he was trying to keep up with glenn who looked great in his suit im not afraid of denon i thought then gave in and sneered at him denons jaw clenched ignoring the slight man in jeans and a lightweight shortsleeved shirt who had stepped forward to talk to him i thought of my car and got worried hey jenks i said lips barely moving why dont you flit around and see what you can overhear let me know if they find my car huh you got it he said and with a sparkling of pixy dust he was gone trying to look as if id been doing a reconnaissance of the surrounding area instead of hiking my way in i angled to meet glenn he looked frustrated the fib was probably being pushed out of the investigation i knew how bad that felt but had little sympathy since hed been the one pushing me out last time i took off my sunglasses as i stepped under the shade of the massive tree tucking them to hang from the waistband of my shorts whats the matter glenn i said in greeting when he took my elbow and led me to an abandoned fib cruiser wont that nasty wasty vampire let you play in the sandbox thanks for coming out rachel he grumbled wheres jenks around i said and he sourly gave me my temp tag i pinned it on before i leaned against the fib cruiser crossed my arms over my stomach and waited for the good news running a hand across his smooth chin glenn sighed turning so he could see me and the crime scene both his dark eyes were tired and there were faint worry lines at the corners making him seem older than he was his trim stature looked powerful even beside denon and his military background mixed well with his suit and loosened tie glenn had come a long way in a year as far as understanding inderlanders and while i knew he respected denons position he didnt respect the man he didnt mind telegraphing that either which might be a problem i had two big men with something to prove at a crime scene lucky me how did you get out here he asked softly his eyes envious as the is collected their data i sent a car for you but youd left i put my arms to my side and fidgeted glenn slowly turned you drove he accused and i flushed you promised me you wouldnt no i didnt i only said i wouldnt not promised i didnt know you were sending a car and they dont have a bus run to the cemetery there arent enough pickups to warrant it he snorted and both our postures eased glenns weary gaze went to the body at the foot of the cedars and i crossed my arms over my chest again you want to bull your way in there or wait until after they contaminate everything i asked glenn rocked into motion and i followed its too late he said i was waiting for you seeing as hes an inderlander im only going to get one look at him unless i can link him hard and fast to the murder of mr rays secretary i nodded watching my feet so i wouldnt walk on any more markers i talked to mr ray on the way over i offered and glenn looked askance at me i have an appointment with him later today at his office my hand went up when he took a breath you arent coming with me so dont askbut i will tell you what we talked about if it touches on this i couldnt bring a fib detective to a client meeting how lame was that glenn looked ready to protest but then dropped his gaze thank you the easing of my tension didnt last and my blood pressure went higher the closer we got to the body my nose started working and over the scent of musk gone rank and excited vampire was the smell of redwood i smoothed my expression into nothing my gaze going to the tidylooking guy in jeans and dress shirt standing a little apart from everyone they have a witch out here interesting the circle of inderlanders parted to show a were corpse sprawled dramatically at the base of a large tombstone the grass stained with black blood a dead wolf the size of a pony was a lot less disturbing than a naked man even one that had blood matting his fur and the eyes rolled back so far the whites showed a hind leg had a clean tear to the bone slicing the femoral artery open the scent of blood was strong and my gut tightened suicide i thought averting my gaze i doubted it denon was smiling at me with his lips closed to hide his human teeth beside him the witchs nostrils widened as he took in my scent hidden behind the orange spice perfume i used to muddle ivys instincts his mouth quirked and he touched his cleanshaven chin with the back of his hand my skin prickled when he tapped a line and i didnt know whether to be insulted or flattered that he thought i was a threat what did he think i was going to do curse everyone but upon remembering he could see my aura as easy as sneezing and that it was covered in black demon smut i couldnt blame him two men stood from their crouch over the corpse leaving one to take core samples to determine how far the blood had soaked into the ground i felt like we had interrupted punks tormenting a dog to death and i forced myself not to back up when they turned their attention to us glenn looked cool and casual in his suit and with his gun on his hip but i knew by the strong scent of cologne coming off of him that he was wired for action eyes fixed on denons he said evenly ms morgan and my team would like a moment with the body before you move it someone snickered and my face warmed whoring for the fib morgan denon said ignoring glenn i see the bus is picking you up again or did you need to use a disguise to get them to stop for you i frowned sensing glenns rising anger denons honeysmooth voice made him sound like he should be hawking negligees on the womens channel my god it was beautiful and i wondered if it was what had attracted his vampire master in the first place that and his deliciously dark skin now marked and scarred beyond belief it hadnt been that way when he was my boss clearly things had changed you seem upset denon i taunted i bet you had some splainin to do about almost releasing that murder victim i smiled sweetly be a prince and run the updated coroners report over to me this afternoon id be interested to see what you almost burned in the kilns the witch snickered and the last were rose his gaze darting nervously denons pupils widened to shrink the rim of brown about them it wasnt as obvious as last year he was losing status with whoever had promised to turn him when he died a few more years like this and denon wouldnt be much more than a shadow and given his anger i think he blamed me the weres flanking him fell back at denons thick casually moving fingers the man eased closer with the same grace as before but it lacked the threat it once had that i wasnt trapped in a fivebyfive cubicle probably helped leave he said his words smelling of baking soda toothpaste this is an is matter glenn stiffened his hand nowhere near his gun is that a refusal to let us examine the body denon moved his hardmuscled bulk gracefully in undeniable threat whoa whoa whoa i cried then lurched back when denons arm shot out his hand reaching for my raised arm glenn moved his squat stature stepping smoothly in front of me to grab denons hand in a motion as sweet and smooth as melted chocolate he twisted denons arm levering the larger musclebound man into submission i blinked watching with wide eyes it was over already bent at the waist the living vampire shifted his weight glenns grip tightened and his feet scuffed for better traction the weres retreated tense as denons neck reddened facing the ground and his arm held straight behind him he was like a kitten being held by the scruff of his neck something popped and denon grunted glenn leaned closer while holding the bigger man helpless you the fib detective said softly are a disgrace he pushed on denons arm and the man grunted again sweat beading up on his shaved head either crap or get off the pot but this halfway nothing is giving the rest of us a bad name shoving him away glenn set his hand comfortably near the butt of his weapon denon caught his balance and spun to face us hatred that glenn had shown him up in front of his peons radiated from him it was obvious his shoulder hurt but he didnt touch it i can handle my own battles glenn i said dryly to distract denon i might survive one of denons retaliations but glenn was vulnerable without his gun and the element of surprise glenn frowned he wasnt going to fight you fair he said handing me one of those zipstrips with a charmed core of silver that the is used to keep ley line witches in custody my eyes went from the innocuousseeming strip of plastic to the witch then to denon scowling you little pissant i said loudly whats the matter with you all i want to do is look at the body you got something to hide i took a step forward and glenn caught my arm if youve got a beef with me lets do coffee and ill explain things to you in little words i said jerking from glenn otherwise get out of my way so we can do our job until murder has been ruled out the fib has as much right to look at the body as you do the little vein in denons forehead had popped and the lowblood vamp gestured for everyone to fall back to the van they moved slowly hands in their pockets or fiddling with equipment from out of sight i heard the rustling of the fib guys the tension grew not lessened and i pressed my weight into the earth in case i had to move fast ceris advice to avoid ley line magic flitted through me but i sent a thought out for the nearest line anyway youre a fool morgan denon said his resonant voice vibrating in me though he stood ten feet away beside a tall tombstone your search for the truth is going to kill you that sounded more like a threat than before but he was walking away is personnel trailing behind him at a loss i tucked the zipstrip into my bag and looked for jenks while glenn organized the fib personnel jenks was staying out of sight though im sure he had seen the encounter slowly my pulse eased soothed by the sounds of the insects and lapping water glenn would have a hissy fit if i tried to look at the body before he was ready and seeing the witch standing by himself i smiled it had been ages since id talked shop with anyone and i missed it he stared at me and with that stellar response i checked my impulse to go over were done here denon said loudly to the subordinate weres leave the cleanup for the fib it was condescending but glenn made a pleased sound making me think he didnt want to share his separate findings denon must have heard him for when the officers headed for their vehicles the living vampire grabbed the witchs arm and pulled him aside i want you to stay he said and the mans eyes narrowed the sun peeking through the leaves to make eerie shadows on him i want a report as to what the fib does and finds im not your lackey the witch said eyeing denons grip if you want my findings submit a request at the arcanes front desk like everyone else get your hand off me my eyebrows rose he works in the arcane division my dad worked in the arcane i looked him over with a new interest then i caught myself cursing my idiotic attraction to the dangerous god i was a fool denon let go of the witchs arm stiff and prideful the big man headed for the van gesturing to make the were in the front passengers seat move to the back the door slammed shut and shifting back and forth the van worked its way onto the thin strip of pavement the other is vehicle followed leaving us the ambulance and the witchthe latter having no way to get back to the i s tower that i could see man i knew how he felt sympathy rose high gathering my resolve i headed over im being nice not looking for a date i told myself but he did have pretty blue eyes and his hair was that soft curly brown that would feel oh so nice between my fingers from behind me came glenns hushed but impatient words and the guys in lab coats descended on the were like birds jenks dropped out of the oak tree startling me with his harsh wing clatter when he landed on my shoulder ah rache can it wait i muttered i want to talk to this guy you have a boyfriend he warned and a girlfriend he added making me frown i know you dont overcompensate because of one lousy kiss im just going to say hi i said stifling a swat at him and it hadnt been a lousy kiss it had been a pulsepounding hellofakiss that had shocked me and left me breathless i only had to figure out if the thrill had been an honest emotion stemming from ivy or my shallowly reveling in the wicked thrill of being someone i really wasnt my eyes dropped it matters one will lead to hard questions about myself the other will hurt ivy leading her on just so i can find a thrill is really really wrong and im not going to do it forcing a smile i halted before the guy his is badge said tom bansen and he used to have long hair according to his picture im rachel i started extending my hand i know excuse me it was terse and pushing past my extended hand he went to stand over the fib personnel and watch them take their data jenks snickered and i stood there with my mouth hanging open my eyes fell to my outfit it wasnt that unprofessional i just wanted to say hi i said hurt he doesnt smell as witchy as you do jenks said smugly but before your head swells up if he works in the arcane hes classically trained and would flatten you remember lee my breath came and went and i felt a stab of worry about this friday i had devoted my life to earth magic and while not any less strong than ley line it was slower ley line was flashy and dramatic with a quick invocation and wider application demon magic mixed them both into something very fast very powerful and everlasting only a handful of people knew i could invoke demon magic but the smut on my soul was easy to see perhaps that along with my growing reputation that i dealt in demons had him on edge i couldnt let the misunderstanding stand so ignoring jenkss muttered dire predictions of hell and snowflakes i sidled up alongside tom look maybe we got off on the wrong foot i said against the murmuring backdrop of the fib conversation do you need a ride anywhere when this is done no the denial was downright hostile and the fib guys crouched over the body looked up eyes wide tom turned and walked away pulse pounding i took a step after him i dont deal with demons i said loudly not caring what the fib thought the young man retrieved a long coat hanging over a tombstone draping it over his arm and you got that demon to testify how that mark on your wrist is from what i took a breath then let it out what could i say looking justified he walked off leaving me surrounded by fib personnel trying not to meet my eyes damn it i thought my jaw clenched and my stomach churning i was used to fear and mistrust from humans but from my own kind mood sour i hitched up my shoulder bag tom had a cell phone pressed to his ear hed get a ride why had i even bothered jenks cleared his throat and i started having forgotten he had been sitting on my shoulder the entire time dont worry about it rache he said in a small voice he was just scared thanks i said while i appreciated the thought somehow it didnt make me feel much better tom hadnt looked scared he had looked hostile from across the way glenn finished giving instructions to a young officer clapping him on the shoulder he headed in my direction the gleam back in his eyes and his posture holding a repressed excitement ready to take a look he said his thick hands rubbing together i glanced at the dead were nose wrinkling what about the footies i said dryly remembering the last time i was at one of his precious crime scenes he shook his head eyes on the body they fouled the site he said his disgust at the iss techniques clear apart from throwing up on the victim you cant make it any worse gee thanks i said jumping when his hand hit my shoulder companionably i smiled at him so he knew it wasnt unwelcome just surprising and he squinted dont let it get to you the fib detective said softly his dark expressive eyes going to the witchs distant silhouette among the tombstones we know youre a good woman thanks i said exhaling to let the hurt go what do i care what one witch thinks anyway even if he is cute from my ear jenks snickered awwww you two are so sweet i could fart fairy balls tossing my hair to make him fly away i turned my attention downward the men at the body had finished their preliminary look and moved off loudly discussing how long the corpse had been here it couldnt have been more than since morning the smell wasnt bad and there was no tissue damage from decay or flies yet and yesterday had been hot my thoughts flashed back to a gutted deer carcass id found in the woods this spring and steadying myself i crouched beside glenn i was glad that my nose wasnt as sensitive as jenkss the pixy looked positively green after letting him hover uncertainly for a moment i swung my hair out of the way in invitation and he immediately landed on my shoulder his warm hands gripped my ear and he took dramatic breath after noisy breath complaining about the reek of alcohol that my perfume used to carry the orange scent glenn glanced at us as if wondering what the hell we were on about i turned my attention downward mrs sarongs personal aide made a very powerful wolf and to think that the person in fur before me had committed suicide was ludicrous he had the silky black hair most weres did his lips pulled back to show teeth whiter than a show dogs now stained with his own blood that his bowels had released somewhere else was proof to me that the body had been dumped a bad feeling rose as denons words echoed in my memory the is was covering something up and with me helping the fib it was coming out someone wasnt going to be happy about that maybe i should just walk away he didnt die here i said softly settling in more firmly where i crouched i agree glenn shifted uncomfortably he was identified from an ear tattoo and its only been about twelve hours that hes not been accounted for the first victim had been missing for twice that damn i thought feeling a chill someone was getting serious glenn picked up a foreleg and rubbed a thumb against the hair this has been cleaned jenks flitted down his tiny feet hovering just above the dull nails almost as long as he was tall it smells like alcohol he said hands on his hips as he slowly rose id bet my back acres that he had medical tape on him like that secretary my eyes met glenns and he set the weres foot down without finding the tape this speculation didnt mean squat from the blood on his teeth it looked likely that the leg wound hed bled himself out from was selfinflicted but now i wondered if looked was the key word it had been given more succinctly than in mrs sarongs secretarys case as if someone were gaining experience blood matted his hindquarters and soaked the ground it was probably were blood but i doubted the blood on his fur and the blood on the ground was from the same person jenks any needle marks i questioned and his wings hummed to life he hovered over the ruined leg for a moment then landed on glenns offered hand i cant say theres too much hair i can go with you to the morgue if you want he offered to glenn and the man grunted an affirmative okay its only a matter of time before the two crimes are linked think its worth flossing his teeth i asked remembering the medical tape in the womans teeth it was glenns turn to shake his head no im guessing the body was cleaned before it was dumped a heavy sigh came from him and he stood jenks took flight to land on the tombstone behind the were i tried to memorize the name on it wondering if it might be important crap i wasnt a detective how would i know what was important or not proving hes been moved isnt a problem glenn said from above me its tying this one to mr rays secretary thats the problem maybe after we get him turned back he might have pressure or needle marks i rose as well noticing that whoever had dumped the body had taken the time to press the weres paws into the grass to get them dirty but it was obviously surface dirt his nails were as clean as if hed been working at a desk the last twelve hours or strapped to a medical gurney at the very least you can get a proper necropsy i offered the body has been moved the is has to admit that murder is a possibility youll find a link to mr rays secretary and it might give the is time to fabricate whatever evidence they want glenn said bitterly pulling a pack of wipes out from a breast pocket and handing me one i hadnt touched the body but i took it since glenn obviously felt i should hell have needle marks someone killed him i mean how do you tear yourself up enough to kill yourself but leave your feet clean and smelling of alcohol glenns eyes were on the were i have to prove it rachel i shrugged wanting to get home and shower before my meeting with mr ray prove it shmove it that wasnt my job just point me at someone to bring in and im there if we can find out who is doing it well have a better idea how to find the proof i said but i wouldnt meet his eyes i had a bad feeling the why theyd been killed was sitting in my freezer and the who was a short list of cincys finest piscary trent mr ray and mrs sarong i think i could cross newt off the list she wouldnt bother to cover anything up do you need me anymore i said handing the used wipe back to him glenns eyes had lost their sparkle and were tired again no thank you why did you have me come out here then i chided him i didnt to a flipping thing his dark neck reddened and i followed him to the fib vehicle behind us was the chatter of the ambulance guys getting to their feet to move the body to the city morgue i wanted to see denons reaction to you he muttered you got me out here because you wanted to see denons reaction i exclaimed and several heads turned the fib officers were smiling like it was a jokeand i was the butt of it inclining his head in amusement glenn took my arm cut me some slack rachel he said you saw him in the morgue he didnt want you there and was afraid youd see something us poor humans would miss that points to obstruction of justice someone is looking for that statue you have and youre damned lucky they arent looking at you is it still in the mail system i nodded thinking it would be a mistake to do otherwise glenns grip tightened as he walked us forward i could force you to give it to me he said ticked i jerked away from him and stopped i brought that jar of salsa you wanted i said almost loud enough for the surrounding fib officers to hear and the man went gray it wasnt my threat of withholding it but that id make public he liked tomatoes yeah it was that bad thats low glenn said his eyes coming back to mine then find someone else to pimp your ketchup i said guilt making me flush jenks dropped from the trees startling the fib officer rache the pixy said giving no indication of what he thought of my blackmail ill get you home then go to the morgue i want to see if the body has needle marks i can be back before you go to talk to mr ray i might have to be at the church alone with ivy was my first thought sounds good i said then feeling bad i whispered to glenn i was serious about the salsa you want it now he tightened his jaw clearly angry and jenks laughed give it up you lousy cookie the pixy cajoled you have no right to the focus and you know it its jalapeño i coaxed burn your freaking eyeballs out of their sockets glenns irate look faltered and when jenks nodded in encouragement glenn licked his lips jalapeño he murmured his focus blurring a gallon i said feeling the thrill of the deal do you find any zipstrips glenns awareness abruptly cleared im working on them but its going to take some time do you want a pair of cuffs in the meanwhile sure i said though they wouldnt stop a ley line witch i lost the first pair you gave me in the everafter man i missed my old cuffs with the charms and everything maybe i could put the right spells into the decorative charms kisten had given me with my bracelet id have to ask what kind of metal they were glenn looked guilty as he scanned the people behind me collecting data i need a few days he said his lips barely moving as he slipped me his cuffs can you hold on to it for me i nodded as i tucked the sliding metal in my bag then turned my attention to jenks ready the pixy rose up see you at the car his wings blurred and then he was gone heading across the cemetery at head height dodging tombstones like a hummingbird on a mission glenns lips pressed and seeing a coming argument i warmed jenks is running vanguard for me i said tossing my hair behind my shoulder we got it covered i have to get to that class this is really getting old rachel i halted my motion to leave turning to arch my eyebrows at him take it easy he said a hand in the air in surrender call me if you need bail my smile deepened thanks glenn i said glad the ugly scene about the focus had been averted im going to class tonight really do that he said then turned back to his team calling for some guy named parker i felt funny walking across the grass between the grave markers to the car plodding in jenkss lightningfast wake my steps were small as i trudged up the hill my head down to look for those flat markers i swung my bag around and dug for my zebrastriped car key but when i came around the corner of the large marker my car was behind i stopped dead in my tracks someone was messing with my backseat sixteen hey i said belligerently and the jeansclad man looked up from where hed been leaning into the backseat messing with glenns salsa it was tom and my jaw dropped what are you doing i came forward wobbling on one of those flush grave markers tom stepped from the car and i halted before him puffing there was a hint of anger and a lot of distain in his blue eyes i was looking into the sun to see him and it ticked me off ive been asked to talk to you he said and i snickered now he wants to talk he was standing before my car though and didnt look like he was going to move without a little encouragement but when i saw jenks unconscious on the dash with his dragonfly wings splayed out in the sun i was more than ready to apply said encouragement my pulse leapt fueled by anger and fear what did you do to jenks the man started at the threat in my voice moving back a step he almost got out of the way i didnt want him to overhear our conversation my stomach clenched in fear you knocked him out you knocked jenks out to get rid of him i took a step forward and tom retreated you son of a bastard yeah i was mixing my phrases but i was really mad eyes wide in surprise tom took another step back hes a person you know i said my face hot he would have left if you asked worried i leaned into my car and carefully edged jenks into my palm before his wings burned from the hot dash his small body was limp and felt far too light i remembered him carrying me when id been weak from blood loss and a panicked fear slid through me horror joined it when i saw that he was bleeding what did you do i exclaimed hes bleeding from his ears the ley line witch stood before me three feet back with his hands behind him rachel morgan i would like to ask tension pulling tight through me i held jenks close what did you do to jenks do you know how dangerous it is for a pixy to lose blood ms morgan tom interrupted this is more important than your backup i couldnt seem to get enough air he is my friend i exclaimed hes not a tissue i stepped forward and tom retreated dont touch me he warned but i got in his face shouting i care more about this pixys hangnail than your whole stinking life you sanctimonious little prick what did you do to him stay back he said backing away even farther with his hands in front of him ill touch my foot to your face if you dont take off that spell with jenks held carefully to my middle in my cupped hand i took another threatening step the hair on my arms pricked when tom tapped a line and before he could say or do anything i lunged forward betting he was setting a circle a circle cant form through a person coated in an aura but will slide to either the front or the back of him or her i had a fiftyfifty chance i would either make it into his circle or crack my nose open running into it as minias had i jolted the electric taste of tinfoil stabbing through my teeth gasping i hunched over jenks toms power iced through me and for an instant the world went black my chi filled from him to me in an eerie sensation of wrongness it overflowed the excess running to spindle in my mind rolling the power of the line into storage i jerked tying to break the connection it snapped with a twang that felt so sharp it had to be audible i opened my eyes finding tom staring at me i was inside his circle it wasnt that big either the witchs eyes narrowed his fingers moved and i shot my fist out smacking him in the gut good going rachel i thought seeing the breath explode from him as he fell his butt landing on the grass and his back hitting the wall of the circle hed probably file charges for assault now but he had threatened me with ley line magic first you can tell denon he can shove his falsies up his ass i said feeling that something was wrong but unable to stop and think about it he cant scare me off this case i remembered my splat gun in my bagsomehow still on my shoulderbut it would look really stupid if i hit him with blanks besides it was hard to do anything with jenks in my hand not denon the witch gasped his face red as he tried to catch his breath i drew back the strength of his circle humming over my head he wasnt speaking for the is what in hell is going on i tugged my shirt to cover my middle suddenly wary tom looked at me from the ground with his back pushed against the circle his pained grimace making me retreat a step so he could stand looking shaken stirred and ticked the witch got to his feet and brushed the grass clippings off but then his face went still and he looked at the arch of everafter over him that sensation of wrongness in me strengthened and i followed his gaze to the ugly blackness his circle hadnt fallen when i pushed him into it that wasnt right you took it tom whispered his eyes tracking the comeandgo knifelike slices of gold glimmering through the demon smut you took my circle my gaze jerked to the arc of power over our heads in fearful recognition it was my aura reflected there not his i took his circle newt had taken ceris but it had required some effort id simply walked into this one that was it i mused it had been still forming and vulnerable frightened he backed up until he hit the slice of everafter they told me you were an earth witch damn it you took my circle i never would have he stammered his cheeks pale i mean god you must think im an idiot for trying to best you scared at how fast he had gone from cocky to frightened i said dont worry about it toms attention ran over the inside of the bubble i didnt mean to hurt your pixy he said watching jenks still cupped in my hand hes fine i stunned him with a high frequency hell wake up in an hour i didnt know he was important to you my pulse had yet to settle and i didnt like how fast his attitude had changed id be lying if i didnt admit that it was sort of flattering though at the very least it had calmed my anger i mean how can you be angry at someone who thinks youre a stronger witch then he is i didnt mean to take your circle okay i said uneasy i touched the circle i hadnt invoked shivering when it broke and the energy someone else had tapped flowed through me and away i was too distracted to unspindle the excess in my head so i let it stay tom swayed to catch his balance when the circle fell he was clearly glad to be out of the circle but he was still white under his brown hair what did you want anyway i said feeling jenkss weight light in my palm i hesitating he took a deep breath you have experience in summoning demons he said and i cringed my superiors would like me to extend an invitation to you disgusted i let my bag fall from my shoulder catching the strap in my hand i threw it into the backseat he had said he wasnt working under denon but i didnt want to be contracted out to the arcane either reaching for the doorhandle i muttered i dont work for the is in any capacity so forget it this isnt from the isthis is a private group my fingers slipped from the handle and i stood with my back to himthinking the sun was hotit would probably melt the birthday candles still in my shoulder bagand i turned to put jenks in the shade hip cocked i sent my eyes over toms comfortablelooking shoes his new jeans his tuckedin dress shirt and his hair drifting in the slight breeze he was young but not inexperienced powerful but i had surprised him he was working in the is arcane division yet was speaking for someone else that didnt sound good this is about summoning demons isnt it i said and he nodded too freshfaced to look sage but trying for it anyway i leaned against my car amazed at how the brightestlooking people did the dumbest things despite what youve heard i dont summon demons they just show up to irritate the hell out of me i dont twist demon curses anymore you couldnt pay me enough to twist one for you so whatever problem your friends have you can take it somewhere else its not illegal to summon demons tom said belligerently no but its stupid i reached for the door again pulling when tom stepped forward and put his hand on mine i yanked out of his reach ticked damn it he was a demon practitioner rachel morgan wait i cant tell them you didnt even listen i wasnt going to hit him again but a yelling redhead could usually drive the most persistent person away i took a breath then hesitated this wasnt about the focus was it exhaling i eyed him my gaze fell to jenks my hand starting to ache from holding that same stiff position then back to tom are you the ones killing the weres i asked flat out toms mouth dropped open in a surprise so genuine i had to believe it was real we thought you were he said and i didnt know which was more disturbing that they thought i was capable of murder or that they thought i was capable of murder and wanted me to join them me i said shifting my weight to my other foot what for ive never killed anyone in my life let a demon take them instead of me but never killed them ah except for peter but he wanted to die feeling guilty i searched the horizon the tips of toms ears went red in embarrassment the inner circle has extended an invitation he said struggling to regain my attention they request that you join them ill just bet excuse me i said angrily get your hand off my car tom removed his hand and i tugged the handle up he backed when i got in and settled into the sunwarmed leather seats this was great just freaking great a wacko fringe organization wanted me as a new recruit slamming the door shut i held jenks in my cupped palm and dug the box of tissues out of the console i set it on my lap and carefully laid him in it seeing him there motionless a feeling of panic slid through me and was gone if he wasnt okay matalina would be devastated and i would be really pissed the powerful practitioner of black ley line magic in jeans and sunglasses who could probably turn my blood to sludge wanted me in his little group even worse he seemed to be an underling anger cresting i looked at tom squinting in the sun then with a small thought willed my second sight into focus to check his aura it was edged in a faint shimmer of black your aura is dirty i said my motions sharp as i buckled myself in and let my second sight drop before i saw something i didnt want to i was in a graveyard face red he boldly said my position in the is prohibits me from working with demons as much as id like but im committed to the cause and am contributing in other ways oh my god hes apologizing for not having more smut on his soul tom misread my expression his smooth brow tightening in anger my cloak may be light but it serves a purpose i can move unseen where those more versed in the dark arts cant he stepped closer thats why we want you rachel morgan you openly consort with demons your cloak is as black as anyones in the inner circle and yet youre not afraid to walk proud and unrepentant even the is cant touch you stretching i reached between the seats and got my bag right and thats why i dont have a license and because of that your little club thinks im worthy of them i said digging for my keys my fingers touched my splat gun and i toyed with the idea of plugging him with a few defunct earth charms just to see him run away its not a club tom said clearly insulted its a tradition of witches that stretches back to the beginning of the crossing of the ley lines a glorious lineage of secrecy and power pushing the frontiers of our existence yadayadayada it had taken on the cadence of empty rhetoric wondering if the is knew they had a cultist on their payroll i jammed the key into the ignition you summon demons toms stance became defensive we explore options that other witches are too timid to venture and we think you are let me guess ive been found worthy to join your cause and be privy to the innersanctum secrets that have been passed down from master to student for two millennia okay maybe that had been a little sarcastic but jenks wasnt moving and i was worried tom was trying to come up with something and i started my car the engine rumbled to life under me the sound of security hot i fiddled with the air conditioner though the top was open the breeze from the vents turned cool and i relished the tickling of the curls against my face done with him i jammed the car into first tom put his hand on the car his fingers going white in their grip as his words stumbled over themselves rachel morgan you have done great things survived multiple demon attacks but no one gives you your due with us you can find the honor and respect you have earned his flattery meant nothing and i angled a vent until jenkss hair shifted i survived by luck and my friends i shouldnt be honored i ought to be committed for uncommon idiocy i reached for the gearshift and he pressed closer you took my circle he stated because i stepped into it while it was forming it was a oneinamillion shot of timing worry pinched his eyes that i was leaving and i hesitated do yourself and your mother a favor i said run away tell your boss that i put a spell on you to make you unable to continue your great work forget you ever heard of them or me and run as fast and far away as you can because if you play with demons they will either kill you or take you as their familiar and believe me you want the former and get your hands off my car tom took his hand away but there was a new determination in his eyes you wont survive on your own he warned dont be greedy share what youve learned along with sharing the danger of summoning them it takes a quorum of witches to control a demon then its a good thing im not trying to rachel morgan a sound of exasperation came from me no i shouted and stop calling me rachel morgan im rachel or ms morgan only demons use every single damned name that a person is known by my answer is no no lifelines no calling my best friend thats my final answer i do not deal with demons i do not want to deal with demons go back and tell your architect that i am flattered for the offer but that i work alone his eyes slid to jenks in my lap and i scowled jenks is family i said darkly and if you ever hurt my family again you and your little sorryass circle will find out there are worse things than demons to piss off the is wont help you he said backing up when i revved the engine and threatened to run over his foot theyre a vamprun institution controlled by selfminded individuals not those seeking to elevate a closed mind pulse pounding i said for once we agree but i wasnt talking about the is i was talking about me foot letting up on the clutch i pulled forward i wanted to tear out of there like ivys last blind date but in respect for the dead i had to be content with a slow careful crawl i glanced at jenks to be sure the jostling hadnt shifted him to snap a wing with his body weight eyes flicking from him to the narrow road i stewed not just about jenks but about toms offer it was never good to be offered a place in a wacko organization especially when you tell them to shove their high ideals and their glorious work there was a soft pull on my chi and my gaze hit the rearview mirror my breath caught and i almost drove right off the pavement when tom turned his back on me and vanished holy crap he jumped to a line worried i adjusted my grip on the wheel alternating my focus from the road to where he had been as if it had been a mistake he was good enough to use the lines to travel and he was only a minor member damn who exactly had i just insulted seventeen davids car windows were down and the cool damp of the late afternoon felt good lifting through my hair the complex scent of were mixed with the smell of the riverfront and i snuck a glance at david across the short width of his sports car he had on his long leather duster and matching hat and though he would probably be more comfortable with the air on he hadnt suggested itjenks was on my big hoop earring and quick temperature changes wreaked havoc with his small body mass it was easier to sweat a little than listen to jenks bitch about being cold we were almost to piscarys anyway upon coming home from spring grove id found a second message on the machine the red light blinking like a ticking bomb my first thought that it might be ivy proved false it was mrs sarongs new aide the owner of the howlers wanted to meet with me too and seeing that the is was blowing off the murder of her aide as a suicide it was likely she wanted me to find out who had done it liking the idea of catching three paychecks with one job i changed the location of my meeting with mr simon ray to a neutral place then agreed to meet mrs sarong at the same time if nothing else id find out if they were killing each other the tension in davids hands on the wheel increased as he made a right turn into the almostdeserted lot at piscarys the twostory bar tavern was closed until five when it opened for the inderland lunch hour and i thought it made the perfect neutral ground kisten had set new hours shortly after theyd lost their mixed public licensempl for shortand went to an allvamp clientele the bar would be empty but for kisten and a few waitstaff prepping for the day besides doing this where kisten could step in if needed was just good planning nervous i checked to see that i had my bag with my charms and splat gun a fresh batch of sleepytime potions in the hopper david parked smoothly in an outer spot where he wouldnt have to back up to leave saying nothing he popped the trunk and got out while i sat in the car and turned my phone to vibrate it had been a very quiet ride over here davids mind was clearly on his girlfriends both living and dead i hadnt been keen on his coming with me but he did have a car and i was meeting with two alphas of cincys more prominent packs jenks said david had a right to be there as my alpha and i trusted his judgment besides i had worked with david before though distracted he was better at reacting to violence than his easygoing looks would indicate ready jenks i whispered as david thunked the trunk shut soon as you get your lilywhite witch ass outta this car jenks said sarcastically ignoring that i dropped my phone into my bag and got out i scanned the lot enjoying the cooler air off the river that set a few strands of my hair to drift kistens boat was at the quay and i started to the front door with a slow pace david fell into step beside me his eyes seeing everything from under his worn brown leather hat what was in the trunk i asked and my eyes widened when he opened his coat and let me glimpse a bigass rifle i know these people he said his expression going hard we handle their insurance okaaaay i thought hoping i wouldnt have to pull the little red splat gun tucked in my bag theyd laugh themselves silly until the first of them dropped that is there was an unfamiliar black jag and an h pulled up to the front clearly not belonging to the waitstaff someone had beaten us here despite my efforts to be the first and take the high ground mr ray id be willing to bet as i credited mrs sarong with more class than to cart her people around in a yellow hummeras cool as that appeared to be i glanced back at davids sports car missing the freedom to jump into my red convertible and go a sigh moved through me whatsa matter rache jenks asked still on my shoulder and remarkably quiet i need to work on my image i muttered pulling up the waistband of my leather pants and trying to keep up with davids long strides leather was my fabric of choice when i was on a run if i went sliding on the pavement i didnt want to leave a skin graft i had on a matching bikers cap with the harley logo and my vampmade boots that kept my steps silent my black leather jacket was too hot and though it ruined the look i removed it to leave only my chemise david had been asked to take a few days off from work to sort himself out and had opted for jeans and a cotton tuckin shirt instead of his business suit the duster the worn hat pulled over his brooding eyes and his wavy black hair in a ponytail made him look like van helsing his mood bordered on depressedhis few wrinkles deep and his brow etched with lines his pace slow his legs took almost a step and a half of mine to make it appear he was floating he was cleanshaven and his squinting eased when the sun turned to the cool shadow of the restaurants canopy maybe my image is just fine i reached for the door handle ignoring the city ordinance warning that the establishment had no mpl it was before business hours and even so i didnt have to worry id been over here lots of times with kisten no one had bothered me yet davids suntanned hand settled on mine atop the handle a female alpha doesnt open doors he said and realizing he was going to play this to the hilt i let go effortlessly he opened the door and held it for me past him the bar was quiet the house lights down and everything gray and soothing i took my glasses off as i entered and dropped them into my bag ms morgan a familiar voice called the instant my feet passed the threshold it was steve kistens numberone guy who ran the bar when he was out and i smiled when the bear of a man did a singlearmed vault over the bar to come and give me his traditional hug jenks took off with a yelp but my eyes closed as i returned steves embrace pulling his luscious scent of incense and vamp pheromones deep into me god he smelled good almost as good as kisten hi steve i said feeling tingles at my vamp scar and putting space between us how ticked is kisten that i asked to borrow the bar for a few hours kistens assistant managerbouncer gave me a final squeeze and let go not at all he said a devious glint in his eyes they were dilated more than the low light warranted and his toothy smile probably owed to the fact that he knew i was enjoying breathing him in hes looking forward to taking the rental fee for the back room out of your hide ill bet i said dryly my hands falling to my sides ah this is david my alpha i said remembering the man behind me and you know jenks david leaned forward his hand extended and the hem of his duster furling hue david said his face melancholy david hue its good to meet you steves gaze flicked from him to me and back again silently remarking on davids depression its a pleasure to meet you mr hue the vampire said earnestly i heard that rachel had taken up a pack its the rare man who can get her to let him put a claim on her hey i exclaimed swatting steves shoulder with the back of my hand but steve caught it his eyes flashing black as he kissed the tips of my fingers i forgot what i was going to yell at him when the hard coolness of his teeth grazed my skin a shiver lifted through me and i blinked his eyes fixed on me from under his lowered brow stop that i said and drew away steve smiled at me like i was his little sister and david pulled out of his funk to stare at me mr ray is here already the vamp said hes in the back with six men waiting for you six then why did he bring that many he doesnt know mrs sarong is coming does he thanks i said setting my coat on the bar when steve started drifting away you mind if we wait here until mrs sarong arrives not at all he pulled a stool out from the bar for me what can i get you and mr hue he glanced at the melancholy were i wont tell the is if you dont david leaned against the bar his brown eyes were everywhere and he looked like a gunslinger coming in from the prairie water please he said not aware i was watching him it must be tearing him apart having caused those womens deaths even if indirectly iced tea i said hot in all my leather then immediately regretted it i was going to meet with two of cincys most powerful individuals and i would be sucking down an iced tea when i did it god no wonder no one took me seriously i started to change it to a glass of wine a beer anything but steve was gone the clatter of pixy wings brought my hand up in invitation and jenks landed on it his wings shimmering with exertion the bar looks good he said tossing his bangs out of the way no charms but for the usual im going to listen in on mr ray if thats okay with you my head bobbed thanks jenks thatd be great jenks touched his red cap in salute you got it ill be back when you need me the draft from his wings was a brief flash of cool and he was gone from the far end of the bar steve headed our way the two drinks in his big hands he set them before us then slipped into the kitchen the double doors silently swinging closed david encircled his glass of water with one hand not drinking he hunched over the bar and brooded a murmur of conversation came from the kitchen and my gaze went over the cool dusky room taking in the changes since kisten had assumed a closer management the downstairs was now tight with a multitude of smaller tables where patrons could get a quick bite rather than a meal ah no pun intended shortly after piscary had been incarcerated the kitchen made a shift from the gourmet cuisine for which pizza piscarys was known to bar food but pizza was still served there was a large round table between the foot of the wide stairway and the kitchen that was where kisten spent most nights when he was working somewhere he could keep an eye on everything without appearing to the upstairs was a dance floor now complete with a dj nest disco ball and light display i didnt go up there when they were in full swing the pheromones of several hundred vampires would hit me as pleasantly and as fast as chugging a sixpack against the odds kisten had turned losing their mpl into an asset piscarys was the only reputable place in cincy where a vampire could relax without having to live up to anyone elses ideas of reserved behavior and vampiric standards even shadows werent allowed i was the only nonvamp let past the doorseeing as i had downed piscary then let the bastard liveand i was honored they let me see them as they wanted to be the living ones partied with frightening abandon trying to forget that they were destined to lose their souls and the undead tried to remember what it was like to have one almost seeming to find it while surrounded by such an outpouring of energy anyone coming in looking for a quick blood fix was escorted out blood didnt have a place in the fantasy they sought my gaze ran over the pictures lining the walls just under the ceiling and i started when i found the blurry shot of me nick and ivy on her bike it was fuzzy but you could still tell there were a rat and a mink standing on the gas tank warming i lifted my iced tea to sprinkle some salt on my napkin is that a spell david asked eyes going to the kitchen doors when someone laughed i shook my head its so the paper doesnt stick to the bottom of the glass and make me look like more of a dork than i already am the were pulled his head up from his melancholy hunch rachel youre wearing leather and sitting at a vamp bar you could have a pink slushy with an umbrella in your hand and still impress the hell out of most people my exhalation was long and slow yeah but alphas arent most people youll be fine youre the female for my pack remember his gaze went behind me afternoon kisten he said and i turned smiling when i recognized the scent of incense and leather thanks mr peabody the vampire said sourly his attempt to startle me clearly ruined hi kist i said curving an arm about his waist and drawing him closer he was wearing dark pants and a red silk shirthis usual casual clothes thanks for letting me borrow your club i added tugging at him suggestively damn i could really have used some alone time with him this friday the memory of ivys kiss intruded then vanished his eyes dilated and my pulse increased despite my efforts a smile hovered over his features and his look became more intent you can borrow a back room anytime he said his hand finding my waist with a comfortable familiarity before he leaned in for a quick kiss hello he was aiming at my lips but conscious of david i turned and he got the corner of my mouth instead his low growl of bother sent a spike of desire unexpectedly through me he wasnt truly upsetmore like amusedand i wondered if playing hard to get one night might be extremely fun or deadly im ah sorry for postponing our date i said when he leaned back becoming flustered when hed lingered a moment too long let me know when you have another night free and ill get the reservation changed david gave kisten an upanddown look then took his drink and moseyed down the bar to stare at the pictures blue eyes gazing up at the ceiling kisten ran a hand through his hair to leave it attractively tousled oh he teased leaning against the bar to look alluring and in control my witch has enough clout to snag a reservation at the tower whenever she wants he held a hand to his chest my masculine pride is wounded i had to make mine three months ago its not me i said pushing at his shoulder but not hard enough to move him trent is doing it it was part of the deal that i work his wedding doesnt matter he said the point is that its done and it was donefor you not knowing what to say i drank my tea the melting ice shifted and i almost got a lapful of it im really sorry i said again shaking the glass to get the ice to move i wouldnt have said yes to trent but he waved enough money at me to get the church resanctified i finished sourly my gaze went distant as i wondered if i should tell him about our encounter this morning then decided against it maybe later when we had more time kisten bent to reach over the bar and realizing i was ogling him i put my attention back on my drink and off his tight butt crap the man knew how to dress to showcase himself forget it he said when he settled himself on the stool beside me a bowl of almonds in his hands someday im going to have to cancel on you because of business and then he popped a nut into his mouth and crunched through it youre going to have to take it gracefully and not be a spastic girlfriend spastic girlfriend i huffed realizing that his quick acceptance came from selfpreservation not understanding mildly ticked i swiveled my stool my fingers on my cold glass with a little hop as if having decided something kisten put a hand on my knee to stop my motion you want to come over tonight for dinner he said as he leaned closer his hair brushed against mine ive got to work tonight but steve can handle everything and we can eat on my boat no one will bother us unless it involves blood his shoulder was touching mine as i sat facing the bar and his hand had curved around my back his fingers playing with the hair over my left ear my pulse quickened and i was having a hard time remembering what i was upset about his hand dropped lower and his breath came and went upon my neck the scar there didnt show anymorelost under my perfect skinbut the vamp saliva the demon had pumped into me was still there ive got something im dying to give you for your birthday he said his low voice heavy with intent if im not going to see you friday i want to give it to you now the last word was almost a demand and i shivered at the tension that pinged through me straightening i licked my lips turning to tuck my head beside his i couldnt help but remember ivys kiss and then i quashed the thought god that feels good i whispered mmmm kistens touch on my neck took on the hints of massage promising more than dinner my breath grew fast and i intentionally pulled in his scent i didnt care that he was throwing off pheromones to lure me into making myself vulnerable it felt too damn good and i trusted him to not break my skin substituting sex in place of his need for blood fingertips playing with the hair above his neck my shoulders relaxed and my gut tightened in anticipation my unclaimed scars were both a pleasure and a pain making me vulnerable to any vampire who knew how to stimulate them but when in the hands of an expert it made for insanely good bedroom play and kisten knew it all thoroughly lost i went to swing my left leg over his to pull him to me then stopped remembering where i was gathering my will i pushed back from him and kisten chuckled desire heady in his gaze damn it look what you did to me i said my face was warm and my hand rested atop my neck hiding it dont you have napkins to fold or something his grin was cocky as he leaned back and ate another almond my fluster worsened when he glanced at david with an infuriating satisfiedmale look on his face so he had gotten me hot and bothered it wasnt hard to do when you knew what buttons to push and my demon bite was a huge button easy to hit and hard to miss plus i loved him see you tonight he had the nerve to ask yes i snapped but i was looking forward to it already despite my embarrassment that david had seen the entire incident okay i was a witch with a vampire boyfriend what did he think we did on our dates play tiddledywinks the hum of jenkss wings caught my attention and the pixy landed lightly atop the dessert menu whats up rache he asked angular features concerned youre all red nothing i sipped my tea the ice sliding down the glass and smacking my nose again you want some sugar water or peanut butter i asked as i set it down kisten subtly moved himself farther onto his stool and away from me jenkss wings increased their hum you sure youre okay youre not sick are you youre throwing off heat like youve got a fever let me feel your forehead he said rising into the air im fine i said waving him off its all this leather whats mr ray doing jenks saw kisten smirking as he ate his almonds then my hand covering my scar the pixys attention went to david who now had his back to us oh jenks sang out laughing kisten got you worked up you tell him about ivy kissing you and he had to prove himself jenks i shouted and kisten flinched his face going white from the end of the bar david grunted turning to look at me questioningly ivy kissed you kisten said and i could have just died look it wasnt a big deal i said shooting evil glares at jenks who was now staring at me as if wondering why i was mad she was trying to prove to me that i couldnt control her when she lost herself to her blood lust and things got out of hand can we talk about something else jenks was spilling dust to make a sunbeam on the counter jenks what is mr ray doing i said flicking an almond at him damn it i dont have time to deal with this right now jenks stayed where he was as if nailed to the air and the nut passed over his head to clatter behind the bar bitchin he said smirking hes been here for twenty minutes and dont let her fool you kisten shes been thinking about that kiss all afternoon i made a snatch at him missing when he darted back it surprised me is all i snuck glances at kisten as he tried to hide his worry behind him david frowned and turned away remembering why i was here i took kistens wrist and tilted it so i could see what time it was i want to go in with mrs sarong seeing as neither one of them know the other will be here where is she anyway she ought to be here by now by the end of the bar david turned his attention to the door and tugged his coat straight kisten too sat up speak of the devil he said at least three cars by the sound of it his steps slow but seeming to eat the distance like magic david came back and i felt a wash of angst crap i had magicked mrs sarongs baseball field to convince her to pay me for my time when id stolen mr rays fish thinking it had been hers yes shed asked for this meeting and though it seemed likely she wanted to talk to me about her murdered aide the possibility that she might still be on about that fish had me nervous ill be in the kitchen folding napkins kisten said softly his hand trailing along my shoulder as he rose and slipped away the look on his face when jenks told him ivy had kissed me flashed before me im a coward i said softly to jenks as he landed on my earring no you arent he started its just yes i am i interrupted as i stood and made sure i didnt have spots of iced tea marring my pants i pick a place where i know someone will save my butt if i get in over my head david harrumphed and stood beside me and i was thankful he didnt seem to think anything less of me for whatever reason thats not being a coward he said as the front door opened and light spilled in thats thinking ahead i said nothing nervous i forced my features to find a confident slant as the light was eclipsed by what looked like eight people mrs sarong was first a young woman close behind her her replacement aide perhaps five men in identical suits flowed in after them to make a semicircle clearly protective in nature mrs sarong ignored them the very small woman smiled with her lips closed taking off her gloves and handing them to her aide eyes on me she reached up and removed her white hat handing it and her white leather clutch purse to the woman as well heels clacking on the hardwood floor she came forward she was wearing a tasteful white suit that looked businesslike without hiding the curves of her small but wellproportioned body her feet were tiny though in her midfifties i guessed she clearly took care of herself being trim and poised styled short and off her face her blond hair had streaks of gray but that only added to her professionalism a string of pearls was about her neck and she wore a diamond ring with enough sparkle to dance the hustle by ms morgan she said as she approached her entourage fanning out to make me wary its good to see you again but honestly dear we could have met at my office or perhaps carew tower if you felt more comfortable in a neutral setting she glanced quickly over the room her nose wrinkling though this has a certain rustic charm i didnt think she meant it as a slur so i didnt take it that way with david at my shoulder and jenks sitting on it i came forward to take her extended hand my arm had been in a sling the last time wed met and i shook her hand pleased to find her grip firm and sincere mrs sarong i said feeling tall and awkward in my leather since i stood almost eight inches over her id like you to meet david hue my alpha her smile widened pleasure she said inclining her head to david who did the same in return taking a witch as your alpha to start a pack with her eyebrows went up and her eyes untouched by age glinted wonderful way to play the rules mr hue i have since plugged that particular gap in my employee handbook but wonderful nonetheless thank you he said gracefully taking a step back and removing himself from the conversation but not the meeting mrs sarong held out her hand to her aide and the woman took it letting herself be drawn forward this is my daughter patricia the older woman said surprising me since the unfortunate demise of my aide she will be shadowing me for the next year to gain a better understanding of whom i deal with on a daily basis my eyebrows rose and i stifled my surprise aide the young woman before me wasnt mrs sarongs aide but her freaking heir it is a true pleasure i said earnestly shaking her hand likewise she said firmly her brown eyes giving away her intelligence her voice was high but determined and she was dressed with as much class as her mother though admittedly showing a lot more skin now that i knew their relationship the resemblance was obvious but where mrs sarong was aging beautifully her daughter patricia was just simply beautiful long black hair softly curving about her face and her small delicate hands possessing a hard strength instead of pearls she had on a chain of gold a brown stone at the nadir point her pack tattoo a vine twining about barbed wire circled her ankle stumbling i pulled david forward this is david i said suddenly feeling like my mom trying to hook me up with her friends son david started but then with a rueful smile that made him ten times more attractive he shook her hand hello ms sarong he said its a pleasure to meet you mr hue the young woman said her brown eyes amused mrs sarong looked at me her face questioning at my impertinence would you like something to drink i asked thinking my rusty host skills were going to get a workout this afternoon while dealing with a woman so clearly raised on etiquette and form and what in hell am i doing introducing david to her daughter like he was on the market my lips tightened at jenkss snort from my earring we can go to a private room i added not knowing if it would be easier to take her to mr ray or bring him out here but she interrupted with a wave of her hand no she said lightly her businesslike air returning what i want will take only a moment she looked at her daughter pointedly and the young woman gestured for the men to back out of earshot they went sullen yet obedient but when mrs sarong glanced at david i sent my gaze to her daughter standing at her side fine the older woman said in concession i simply want to contract your services expecting this i nodded but a surge of morality tugged at me and i found myself saying im already working with the fib to find out who murdered your aide i gestured for her to sit at one of the small tables theres no need for you to contract me as well she settled herself gracefully and i took the seat across from her david and patricia remained standing splendid mrs sarong said clearly making an effort not to touch the top of the table but i want to contract your other services confused i stared at her blankly your older profession dear she added from my shoulder came a tinkling of pixy laughter and my eyes widened mrs sarong i stammered feeling my face flash red oh for cerberuss sake the woman said in exasperation i want you to kill mr ray for murdering my aide and im prepared to pay handsomely shock zinged through me as i finally got it i dont kill people i protested trying to keep my voice soft but with a bar full of vampires and weres i was sure someone else heard me im a runner not an assassin has she heard about peter mrs sarong patted my hand its okay dear i understand shall we say seventyfive thousand place the appropriate bet the next game and let me know ill take it from there seventyfive i couldnt find enough air you dont understand i said starting to sweat i cant what if david finds out peters death had been insurance fraud the womans eyes narrowed and she pursed her lips her gaze going to her daughter has simon ray already hired you she asked her voice vehement a hundred thousand then damn hes a bastard i looked at david but he seemed as shocked as i was you misunderstand i stammered what i meant is i dont do that kind of thing and yet she said each syllable clear and precise people who annoy you seem to die they do not i objected leaning until my back hit the chair francis percy she began ticking names off on her fingers stanley saladan that mouse of a man ah nicholas sparagmos i believe her spread fingers closed elegantly and alarm hit me i didnt kill francis i said he managed that all by himself and lee was dragged off by a demon he summoned nick went over a bridge mrs sarongs smile widened and she patted my hand again very well done on the last one she said glancing at her daughter leaving an old boyfriend to clutter future relationships is investing in trouble for a moment i stared she wanted me to kill simon ray i didnt kill them i protested really but they are nevertheless gone mrs sarong gave me a perfect smile as if i had done a fabulous trick she suddenly straightened the comfortable companionability that had wreathed her expression shifting to blank questioning the hair on the back of my neck prickled and i watched her pull the air deep into her simon she barked rising to her feet i jumped up when her entourage dived into motion heading right for us she knew she knew mr ray was here rache jenks shrilled leaving my shoulder in a sparkle of gold dust i backed into david but mrs sarongs pack wasnt concerned with me a shout quickly followed by a muffled thump shook the air kisten lunged in from the kitchen his steps holding that eerie vampire quickness he was headed for the back room but before he could get there mr ray stormed in great i thought when the rest of his thugs spilled out behind him with drawn weapons pointed at us just freaking great eighteen you pompous little bitch the infuriated were shouted redfaced and with his thugs backing him what are you doing here mrs sarong pushed past the men who had put themselves in front of her arranging your removal she said her voice sharp and her eyes glaring removal as if he were an overgrown tree clogging the sewer line the short businessman seemed to choke on his own breath becoming choleric mouth gaping to look like one of his prize fish he struggled to respond like hell you are he finally managed thats what i wanted to talk to her about from my shoulder came a small holy crap rache how did you become cincys assassin of choice i stared at the two packs separated by little round tables mr raywants to contract me to take mrs sarong out the clicks of cocking weapons startled me from my shock grab some air jenks i shouted kicking over a table and filling the space it had been in jenks left me in a dazzling burst of gold sparkles a whiff of musk and david had my back that freaking bigass rifle in his grip making him look like a gunslinger out for revenge kisten leapt forward blond hair swinging he stepped between the two packs his arms up in placation but his expression hard the air pressure shifted and suddenly steve was there too everyone froze my pulse hammered and my knees went watery it was too much like the time i had stormed in here looking for piscary after he had bloodraped ivy except this time there were a lot of pointed guns sweating i watched kisten force the visible tension from his face and stance until he was the casual confident bar manager on the surface i dont give a rats ass if you kill each other he said his voice carrying well but youll take it out of my bar and into the lot like everyone else david pressed into my back and with his warmth grounding me i took a deep breath no one is going to kill anyone i said i called you here and you are all going to sit down so we can settle this like inderlanders not animals got it mr ray took a step forward a short finger pointing at mrs sarong im going to rip a burst of angst lit through me i said shut up i shouted what is wrong with you my bag was heavy on my shoulder and though i could bring out my splat gun i didnt know whom id aim it at at this point no one was aiming at me i think and to tap a line and make a circle might just set them all off no one was shootingid work from there im not going to kill mrs sarong i said to mr ray to my left mrs sarong stiffened but she looked pissed not afraid and im not going to go after mr ray for you i added mr ray harrumphed wiping his brow with a white handkerchief i dont need your help to pin the whiny bitch he said and the men surrounding him tensed as if to rush her that just ticked me off this was my party damn it werent they listening hey hey i shouted excuse me but im the one you both wanted to contract to kill each other i suggest i said sarcastically that we all sit at that big table over there just you and you and me i looked at the weapons still cocked and pointed alone mrs sarong nodded in a show of acquiescence but mr ray sneered you can say anything in front of my pack he stated belligerently fine i stepped from david and he uncocked his weapon ill talk to mrs sarong the collected woman smiled cattily at the flustered man and turned to give her daughter a word of instruction she was just as stymied as mr ray but by calmly capitulating rather than insisting we do it her way she looked more in control intrigued i filed the wisdom away for more thought later if i have a later you got this okay i murmured to david i could smell the musk coming off him thick and heady from his tension the depression was gone leaving only a capablelooking man with a rifle that could blow a hole in an elephant it was a vampire killer it would work on weres easy no problem rachel he said his brown eyes everywhere but on me ill keep them right where they are thanks i touched his upper arm he flicked his gaze to mine then backed up a step his duster furling about the tops of his boots my breath came out in a long exhalation pulse slowing i stepped between the two were factions and those guns headed for the table at the foot of the stairs kisten was still standing in the middle of the room and he was pulled into my wake as i passed him the hair on the back of my neck prickled but it was from the weres not him ive got this under control i said softly my lips barely moving why dont you go fold more of those napkins i can see that he said smiling despite the tension in his soft voice jenks joined us from the ceiling and under their twin scrutiny i rubbed my fingertips into my forehead crap i was getting a headache this wasnt the way i had planned it but how was i supposed to know they both wanted to contract me to kill each other i think shes doing great jenks said there are eighteen weapons in this place and not one has gone off yet nineteen if you count the one in patricias thigh holster exhausted i glanced behind me to the slight were yeah with that slit skirt a thigh holster would work really well kisten touched my elbow im not leaving this room he said his blue eyes almost fully dilated but this is your run where do you want steve and me i slowed my steps pleased to see that mr ray had seated himself opposite mrs saronga good five feet between them the door i asked one of them probably called in more people and i dont want this to become a population contest you got it he said and with a soft smile he slipped away he spoke to steve and the large vampire went out to the parking lot a cell phone in his thick hand and his fingers busy satisfied i headed to the table nineteen guns i thought gut clenching nice maybe i should put myself in a bubble and say go call whoevers still standing in five minutes the winner jenks i said as i neared the table stay back will you work communication between us its only supposed to be me and them no seconds still hovering he put his hands on his hips his angular features seemed pinched making him look older than he really was no one counts pixies as people he protested i met his eyes squarely i count you and it wouldnt be fair his wings flashed a pleased embarrassment and a sprinkling of dust slipped from him nodding he zipped away in a clatter of dragonfly wings alone i took the chair with my back to the kitchen door confident no one would be coming in that way with steve outside i could smell the odor of dough rising for pizza and the tang of tomatoes pizza sounded really good for tonight forcing the thought from me i settled myself opening my bag as i set it on my lap the heavy weight of my splat gun was comfortable and i tried not to think about the weapons mr ray and mrs sarong probably had on them first i said trembling inside from the adrenaline id like to extend my condolences to both of you on the loss of your pack members on my right mr ray pointed rudely at mrs sarong i wont tolerate you harassing my pack he stated cheeks quivering the death of my secretary was an outandout declaration of war something im prepared to see through mrs sarong sniffed looking down her nose at him murdering my aide is intolerable i will not pretend that it wasnt you god they were at it again both of you stop it i exclaimed ignoring me mr ray leaned across the table to mrs sarong you dont have the balls to warn me off of whats mine by right we will find the statue and you will sit at my feet like the bitch you are whoa i thought and a sudden wash of cold reasoning shocked through me this was about the focus not their respective dead i glanced at david and his lips pressed together case solved they were murdering each other but mrs sarong was inching her hand to her waistband and the onebullet gun she probably had there i didnt kill your secretary she said keeping rays attention on her face and not her hands but id like to thank whoever did killing my aide to feign that you dont have the focus makes you a coward if you cant hold it by strength and must rely on stealth you dont deserve it i have more control over cincinnati than you do anyway me the incensed were shouted bringing steve in for a quick look around i dont have it but i damn well will get it i havent so much as sniffed the footprints of your doginfested pack but i will take every last member of it if you keep up this farce from the corner of my sight i watched david take a threatening grip on his vamp killer of a weapon the two factions were getting antsy thats enough i said feeling like a playground monitor both of you shut up mr ray turned to me youre a thieving mewling bitch the pudgy were exclaimed his supremacy firmly entrenched in his mind david hefted his rifle and the weres brought for muscle started to shift on their feet from my other side mrs sarong smiled like the devil and crossed her legs saying the same thing as mr ray without uttering a word i was losing control i had to do something pissed i drew myself up and tapped a line immediately my hair started to float and from the middle of the room came an uneasy murmur i focused on the two of them unable to break eye contact after i took it i think you mean witch i said softly my fingers moving in nonsense as i pretended to set a ley line spell but they didnt know that i suggest you relax and that fish was a rescue not a theft i added my face warming okay maybe my conscience was still smarting youre both idiots i added staring at mr ray killing each other for a stupidass statue when neither one of you has it how lame is that mrs sarong cleared her throat you know he doesnt have it how she drawled a good dozen answers fell through my brain but the only one that they would believe would be the one that was the most impossible because i have it i said praying it was the answer that would keep me breathing for another day silence greeted my claim then mr ray laughed i jumped when his hand slapped down onto the table but mrs sarongs gaze was fixed on the weres behind me her face paling you the heavy were said between guffaws if you have the focus ill eat my shorts my lips pressed together but mrs sarong spoke next you take ketchup with your silk simon she said sourly i think shes got it mr ray stopped laughing his brown eyes noted her ashen hue and then he looked to me her he said in disbelief my pulse quickened and i wondered if i had made a mistake and theyd band together to take it from me before turning against each other once more look at her alpha the slight woman said pointing with her eyes we all looked david was sitting half on a table with one foot on the floor the other draped down and hanging his duster was open to show his trim body and his rifle was in his hands yes it was a big gun but there wereas jenks saidnineteen other weapons in the place yet there he was holding two aggressive packs still and silent david had always been an impressive individual having the standing of an alpha and the mystique of a loner but even i could see the new expectation in his manner he wasnt just capable of dominating another were he expected it to happen without a complaint it was the focuss magic trickling through him he had gained the power of creation and though it had resulted in the deaths of innocents it didnt lesson the magnitude of what that meant my god mr ray said eyes wide he turned to me you have it he swallowed you really have it mrs sarong had taken her hands from the threat of her weapon and set them on the table it was a submissive move and a chill took me what have i done will i survive it you were there at the bridge werent you when the mackinaw weres found it she said coolly i leaned back to distance myself what i wanted to do was run away i had it before that actually i admitted i was up there rescuing my boyfriend i fixed on her eyes wondering if they were a shade chagrined the one you think i killed i added my pulse hammered when she dropped her eyes for an instant then returned them to me god help me what have i become mr ray wasnt convinced give it to me he demanded you cant hold it youre a witch one down one to go i thought scared but to back down now would end my life more quickly than publicly claiming the stupid thing im his alpha i said nodding to david i say that says i can the mans eyes narrowed looking as if he had cracked a rotten egg he said ill make you part of my pack thats my best offer take it take it or what i allowed a touch of sarcasm into my voice i have a pack thank you and why does everyone keep telling me i cant do things ive got it you dont im not giving it to you end of story so you can stop killing each other trying to find out where it is simon mrs sarong said caustically shut your yap she has it deal with it i would have tried to find a compliment in that but figured her support would only last until she found a way to kill me mr ray met her gaze and something i didnt understand passed between them david felt it so did every were in the place like a wave they all relaxed i felt ill when both packs shifted and every weapon was put away my worry tightened damn and double damn i cant afford to trust this i didnt target your aide mr ray said his thick arms going to rest atop the table i didnt touch your secretary the woman said taking out a compact and checking her makeup it snapped shut and she met his eyes squarely no one in my pack did either just peachy damn keen they were talking but i didnt think i was in control fine i said nobody is killing anybody but we still have two murdered weres the two of them had given me their full attention and my stomach knotted look i said very uncomfortable someone besides us knows the focus is in cincinnati and is looking for it it might be the island weres has either of you heard of a new pack in town as i thought of brett they both shook their heads okay swell back to square one i wanted them to leave so i leaned back as if in dismissal id seen trent do it a couple of times and it seemed to work for him ill keep looking for the murderer then i said glancing at their thugs until i figure out whos doing this will you two let go of each others throats mr ray sniffed loudly i will if she does mrs sarongs smile was stilted and clearly false i can do the same i need to make a few calls before sunset a pointed look at her daughter and the young woman excused herself cell phone in hand as she went outside mr ray gestured and one of his men followed her i wondered what mrs sarong had planned for sunset then dismissed it i didnt like the two of them fighting but i liked this cooperation even less perhaps it was time for a little personal cya the focus is hidden i said sort of its in the everafter i continued and they stared at me mr rays fingers twitching liar i thought not feeling a twinge of guilt neither of you can find it much less get it lie lie liiiie if i go missing neither of you gets it if any of my friends or family go missing im going to destroy it ever the one to test the limits in as crass a manner as possible mr ray harrumphed and i should take you seriously because i stood wanting them to leave because you were ready to hire me to do something you couldnt kill mrs sarong mrs sarong smiled at him and shrugged just a bit more i thought and maybe i can sleep tonight and because i have a demon who owes me a favor i added my pulse quickening no a small part of my mind whispered and i stifled a surge of fear for what i was doing i was accepting that minias owed me i was accepting his bargain i was dealing with demons but the thought of these two people descending upon my life setting fire to my church and burning it to the ground in search of that stupid statue filled me with a more immediate fear fear for myself i could deal with fear for others i couldnt if something happens i dont like i said hes going to come looking for you and you know what my pulse pounded and i held the table for balance as vertigo took me he likes killing things so he might be a little overzealous about it it wouldnt surprise me if he took you both out to be sure he gets the right person mr rays eyes dropped to my wrist my demon mark clearly visible make your calls i said ready to dissolve into the shakes calm your people and keep your mouths shut if the word gets out ive got it it will decrease your chances that youll find a way around my demon and get it yourself i took a moment and captured their eyes do we have an understanding mrs sarong stood her purse in her tight grip before her thank you for the drink ms morgan it was a most enlightening conversation kisten came out from behind the bar as she headed for the door her entire entourage flowing into her wake the sun entered in a flash as the door opened and i squinted feeling like i had been at the bottom of a hole for three weeks mr ray looked me up and down his fleshy cheeks slack and unmoving giving me a nod he made a gesture to his people and followed her out their pace slow and provocative weapons tucked away as they filed through the door i stood where i was until the last of them passed the threshold i waited a bit longer until the door slipped shut and put me back in darkness only now did i give in and let my knees buckle i could hear kisten crossing the room and i put my head on the table and sighed i had a reputation for dealing with demons i didnt want it but if it would keep those i loved safe then i was going to use it nineteen kistens boat was big enough that the wake from the tourist steamers just smacked into it never making the sleek cruiser move id been on it before even spent a couple of weekends learning how well voices carry over dark still water and to take my shoes off at the dock it was three decks if you counted the highest where the controls were big enough to party on as kisten said but small enough that he didnt feel like he had extended his reach well its beyond my reach i thought as i sopped up the last of the spaghetti sauce off the lightweight china with a corner of grilled bread but if you were a vampire whose boss ran the uglier parts of cincinnatis underground appearances mattered the bread had been swiped from piscarys kitchen nearby i had a feeling the sauce had been too i didnt care if kisten was trying to pass it off as his own cooking by warming it up on his tiny stove the point was we were having a relaxing dinner instead of arguing that i had put my job before his plans to take me out for my birthday i looked up and across the candlelit sunken living room my plate balanced on my lap we could have eaten in the kitchen or out on the spacious veranda but the kitchen was claustrophobic and the veranda too exposed my encounter with mr ray and mrs sarong had me uneasy add on toms shunned invitation and you could color me paranoid being surrounded by four walls was much better the luxuriously appointed living room stretched from one side of the boat to the other looking like a movie set with wide windows showing the city lights and moon shining on water to one side curtains closed on the other so i didnt have to look at piscarys parking lot technically kisten was workingwhich was why we were here and not at a real restaurantbut when we had slipped into the kitchen to snatch a bottle of wine and the bread id heard him tell steve that he didnt want to be bothered unless blood was in someones mouth it felt nice to sit that high in his priorities and with my face still holding the pleasure from that thought i lifted my eyes finding kisten watching me from across the low coffee table between us the candlelight giving his blue eyes an artificial dangerous darkness what i asked flushing since he obviously had been watching me for some time his contented smile deepened and a thrill of emotion lifted through me nothing his voice was soft every thought you have crosses your face i like watching mmmm embarrassed i set my plate atop his empty one and leaned into the couch wineglass in hand he stood and in a hunched motion shifted to sit beside me easing back he exhaled in satisfaction when our shoulders touched the stereo changed tracks and light jazz came on i wasnt going to say anything about the incongruity of mixing vampires and a soprano saxophone but sighed enjoying the scent of leather and silk blending with his scent of incense and the lingering odor of pasta sauce but my smile vanished when my nose started to tickle crap minias i dont have my scrying mirror in a panic i sat up and out of kistens arms my wineglass hit the coffee table just in time for a sneeze bless you kisten said softly his hand curving about my waist to draw me back but when i stiffened he leaned forward you okay he added real concern in his voice ill let you know in a minute i took a careful breath then another my shoulders eased not wanting to worry ivy or jenks i had shut myself in my room before sunset and set my password damn it i should have scribed the glyph on a compact mirror kisten was peering at me and i said im fine deciding it was only a sneeze exhaling slowly i slumped into his warmth his arm went behind my neck and i pressed into him glad he was here and i was here and neither of us had to be anywhere youve been quiet tonight kisten said are you sure youre okay his fingers began tracing a path along my neck hunting for my demon scar hidden under my perfect skin and the light touch tickled he was asking after me but i knew his thoughts were on ivys kiss and with his fingers bringing my scar alight to mix the memory of it with the sensations he was pulling from me i stifled a shudder of adrenaline ive a lot on my mind i said not liking how his touch and the memory of ivys kiss combined i was confused enough already turning in his arms to face him i drew out of his reach scrambling for something else to focus on im thinking ive gotten in over my head this time is all with the weres kistens blue eyes went soft after watching you curb two of cincinnatis more influential packs i would say that no you arent over your head his smile widened taking on a tinge of pride it was great watching you work rachel youre good at this a puff of disbelief escaped me it wasnt the weres that had me worried but how id gotten them to back off exasperated i threw my head back against the top of the couch and closed my eyes couldnt you see me shaking my eyes flew open when kistens weight shifted and i slid into him our hair mingled and with his lips brushing my ear he said no his breath came and went on my shoulder and i didnt move but for sending my fingers to play with his torn earlobe i like a woman who can take care of herself he added watching you got me all hot i couldnt help my smile but it faded distressingly fast kisten i said feeling vulnerable despite having his arms around me really im scared but not about the weres kistens searching fingers stopped removing his encircling arm he leaned back and took my hands in his what is it he said concern heavy in his gaze embarrassed i looked at our twined fingers and saw the differences i had to use the threat of a demon to get them to back off i lifted my gaze seeing the worry etching his brow it makes me feel like a demon practitioner i finished im an idiot for using a demon as a bluff or a coward maybe love kisten drew my head to rest against his chest you arent a coward or a practitioner its a bluff and a damned good one but what if it isnt a bluff i said into his shirt thinking of all the people i had tagged for practicing black magic they hadnt intended to become the fanatical crazed people i threw in the back of a cab and hauled off to the is some guy talked to me today i said fiddling with the top button of his shirt he invited me to join their demon cult mmmm his voice rumbled through me and what did my badass runner tell him that he could take his club and shove it kisten said nothing and i added what if they call my bluff if they hurt ivy or jenks shhhh he hushed his hand gentle against my hair no one is going to hurt ivy shes a tamwood vampire and piscarys scion and why would anyone hurt jenks because they know hes important to me i lifted my head taking a breath of the fresher air i might do it i said frightened if anyone hurts jenks or his family i might call minias and trade in my mark minias kistens surprise showed i thought you were supposed to keep their names secret there had been more than a hint of jealousy in it and i felt the beginnings of a smile thats his casual name he has red goatslitted eyes a funny purple hat and a crazy girlfriend mmmm kisten pulled me closer and settled his arms around me maybe i should call this guy take him bowling so we can compare crazygirlfriend notes stop it i chided him but he had managed to shift my mood youre jealous hell yes im jealous he was silent for a moment then leaned forward i want to give you your present early he said reaching around the arm of the couch and to the floor twisting i put my back against the arm of the couch more firmly kisten set the obviously storewrapped package in my hands and i beamed the ribbon about it was imprinted with valerias crypt an exclusive supplier of clothing where the less fabric there was the bigger the dent it would make in your checking account what is it i asked giving the shirtsize box a shake and something thunked open it and see he said his eyes flicking from me to the box there was something odd in his behavior sort of an embarrassed eagerness not one to save paper i ripped it off and tossed it running a fingernail under the single piece of tape holding the box shut black tissue paper rustled and i warmed when i saw what was under it oh this is nice i said lifting the teddy up just in time for summer nights its edible kisten said his eyes glinting whoa i exclaimed hefting its lightweight and wondering how we might explore this new option remembering the thing thunking around i set the teddy aside what else is inhere i questioned rummaging my fingers found a small fuzzy box and when i recognized its shape my face lost all expression it was a ring box oh my god kisten i breathed eyes wide open it he prompted scooting closer hands trembling i turned it to find the opening i didnt know what to do i loved kist but i wasnt ready to be engaged hell i was hardly ready to be anyones girlfriend what with two were packs after my hide demons showing up whenever a master vampire itching to have at me not to mention a roommate who wanted to be more and me not knowing what to do about it and how could i embark on a permanent relationship when i wouldnt let him bite me but kisten i stammered pulse racing just open it he urged impatiently holding my breath i wedged it open i blinked it wasnt a ring it was a pair of caps i questioned relief spilled through me i looked up to see his fluster they werent his caps no these were sharp and pointy and theyre for me if you dont like them ill take them back he said his usual confidence gone i thought it might be fun sometime if you wanted to my eyes closed it wasnt a ring it was a toy i should have known after the edible teddy you bought me caps well yes what did you think they were i went to tell him then closed my mouth flushing i set the box aside and looked at the caps in their velvet cushion okay it wasnt a ring but where was this leading kisten i cant let you bite me closing the lid with a snap i extended them to him i cant accept these but kisten was smiling rachel he coaxed thats not why i bought them why then i said thinking he had put me in a very awkward position i couldnt help but wonder if this had been a reaction to ivys kiss placing the box back in my hands he curved my fingers around it this isnt a backward way to wiggle my teeth into your neck im not even looking for you to bite me though that would be he took a breath nice i could tell it was the truth and my agitation eased kisten dropped his gaze i wanted to see you with little pointy teeth he said softly its bedroom play like wearing a teddy sort of like window dressing you dont like my teeth i said unhappy damn it i wasnt a vampire and he wanted more this sucked royally but kisten pulled me to him with a rueful chuckle rachel i adore your teeth he said his silk shirt against my cheek they nibble and pinch and that you cant easily break my skin drives me fu he caught the next word sensitive to my disaproval crazy he finished but with you wearing those caps and me knowing you could break my skin a sigh lifted through him i dont care if you bite me or not its the thought that you could thats exciting his hand against my hair was soothing and the last of my confusion vanished this i understood i found a thrill in the same way knowing that kisten could bite me but held back because of respect will and perhaps ivy was enough to get my rush going full tilt that someday his will might not be strong enough or he might be willing to stand down ivy was the attraction you ah want me to try them on i said his eyes were dilating if you want to smiling i shifted my body and opened the box again you just slip them on he nodded theyre coated with some miracle polymer put them on and clench your teeth and theyll mold right to them theyll come off with a little prying cool his eyes were on them and i set the box on the table the unfamiliar smoothness of bone under my fingers as i picked them up feeling like i was putting on contacts i fumbled until i figured out which one went where and slipped the molded bone over my teeth they felt odd as i gritted my teeth lips parted i ran my tongue across the inside kisten inhaled and my attention went to him damn woman the rim of blue about his pupils shrank my smile widened and seeing it his eyes flashed to black what do they look like i said jumping up where are you going he said his voice holding a sudden urgency i want to see what they look like laughing i pulled away from him and headed for the bathroom down the hall are you sure i wont cut my lip i asked when i found it the overhead light flicked on yellow and dim from the low voltage you cant kisten said his voice raised against the distance theyre designed not to he added from right behind me and i jumped smacking my elbow into the wall in the tight confines god i hate it when you do that i exclaimed i want to see too he said an arm curving around my waist and his head tucking into the hollow between my neck and shoulder his eyes werent on my reflection trying to ignore the tingles his lips were creating i looked in the mirror my tongue feeling the backs of the caps they had a delicate curve and the backs were angular i smiled and turned my head to get a good look seeing how they fit into the concave space between my lower teeth the memory of wearing wax fangs for halloween when i was eight flitted through me and was gone stop flashing your teeth kisten growled i turned to face him his hands tracing a delicious path about my waist why i bumped into him suggestively does it bother you no his voice was terse and his grip on me grew tight there wasnt much room in here but when i tried to push him out he stood firm he was warm and solid and i stayed where i was putting my arms about his neck and using him to keep my balance do you like them i whispered inches from his ear yes his lips traced a path across my collarbone and i shivered feeling the stirrings of desire me too i said pulse hammering i aggressively nuzzled his head away so he couldnt reach my neck pulling myself up to run my newteeth teasingly across an old scar kisten shuddered against me oh god this is going to kill me he whispered his breath warm against my shoulder my blood pounded as i felt the new power i had kisten had gone still under my teeth submissive without being docile his hands drifted down to trace my curves tugging my shirt from my jeans as they came up again fingertips roughened from work traced lightly over me rising until they cupped my breast his other hand was at the small of my back pressing me into him breath quickening i gently bit an old scar at the base of his neck sensations rising almost too fast to appreciate i turned my attention to a tiny scar i knew was sensitive i breathed in his scent a relaxed tension filling me i hadnt come here looking for this but why not a small voice in my head wondered if i was letting kisten sway my thoughts so easily on the teeth issue to reaffirm that he and i had something real alreadyand that accepting ivys offer the surprise of it aside would be cheating on him if so i would be the only one it would bother vampires considered multiple bed and blood partners the norm and monogamy the exception and though i wasnt a vampire to accept polyamorous relationships without a lot of soulsearching all i could think right now was this felt damn good i grazed my teeth the length of his neck feeling his muscles tighten kistens hands trembled and i wondered why i was trying to figure this out right now his sigh flashed adrenaline through me and it was all i could do not to bear down and dent his skin a wicked feeling was beginning to grow and i relished it i could bite him i could sink my teeth and i knew exactly what it would do to him i wasnt a vamp to set his scars alight but he was and one vampire was all it took his hands moved against me under my chemise and in the gap between us i sent one of my hands downward wanting to undo just one button just one fingers awkward from the tight fabric i managed it unable to resist i fumbled for his zipper kisten shifted his weight pressing me into the narrow slice of wall his blue eyes were lost in black and he pinned my hands above my head you assume a lot witch he growled and a spike of desire shot through me you want me to stop i said leaning forward and forcing a kiss oh god his lips pushed aggressively against mine tasting of wine the thought of my teeth so close to his lips was thrilling i knew kisten could feel my need to find all of him building and he played upon it but as long as he had my hands pinned over my head he couldnt stop me from tasting what i could reach a small shift forward and my lips found his neck kisten exhaled slowly enjoying being able to pull such a response from him i explored finding new reactions from old scars i should have done this before i thought hooking one foot behind his leg and pulling him closer as soon as i got home i would have to see what cormels guide to dating vampires said about this my arms dropped to encircle kistens neck lightly as he let go of my hands and a sliver of thrill hit when he moved us into the unlit hallway my back went up against the thin paneling with a thump and he slid my camisole strap down my shoulder bending to kiss the newly exposed flawless skin that i knew was irresistible to vampires the smoothness of his capped teeth across my unmarked skin sent a tremor through me if his phone rang i was going to kill somebody my eyes slipped shut in pure enjoyment and i worked by feel to undo the buttons of his shirt jazz played and the sound of a boat echoed over the flat water i couldnt get the last of the buttonskisten kept nipping at my skin to send jolts that didnt have the chance to ebb before he added to them giving up i gripped his shirt and pulled until the buttons snapped kisten mmmed in annoyance he shifted his weight pinning me eyes flashing open i reached for his belt give me what i want i whispered feeling my new teeth and i wont have to get rough vamp boy thats my line he said his voice carrying a new edge to it the words were laced with blood hunger and fear lanced through me quickly stifled kistens hands hesitated for an instant to regain control and then he continued his restraint far stronger than mine he took my shoulders holding me unmoving as he found the base of my neck wanting my blood but not taking it as he worked my old scar oh god i breathed unable to stop i hoisted myself up wrapping my legs around his waist and tightening my grip on his neck he shifted again adjusting for my weight i could feel him heavy through his slacks and my pulse quickened sensing it his touch became aggressive and silver threads of anticipation tightened to a hard ball in the pit of my being this wasnt good it was too much i wasnt thinking anymore it was too damn good i clutched at him wanting the rush of feeling of his teeth sink into me if he knew how badly he might ask and i wouldnt be able to say no ivy will kill him as if sensing my confusion his lips became gentle tracing a coolwarm sensation from the base of my neck to rise slowly to behind my ear where he stayed pulling with a gentle pressurehinting at more can you stay through the morning he asked mmmm i managed making sure my willingness was obvious by sending my nails to trace the back of his neck good carrying me he headed down the hall to the nightdarkened bedroom the lights from cincinnati were a soft glow reflecting off the water and i spared a thought that i wasnt going to have the chance to wear that teddy at least not tonight his bed was under the bank of windows but he set me atop the dresser my legs still wrapped around him i was at an excellent height that lent itself to all sorts of possibilities and feeling surged when his hand sketched a heavy path to my breast his thumb teasingly caressing kistens lips left me and with a deliberate slowness he pulled back the motions of his fingers against me stopped almost panting i met his eyes they were black with a familiar collected blood lust glinting in the reflected light adrenaline zinged through me to mix anticipation and fear something was changingi had become more with my sharp teeth they werent just bits of bone they were a source of power giving me control over him through the sensations i could invoke and kisten knew it that had been his intention in giving them to me with his teeth capped and mine sharp he had elevated me above him the thought was a definite turnon for both of us eyes never leaving mine he took my hand that had slipped between his open shirt and his back he breathed deeply of my wrist lids closing as he scented my blood you smell like my two favorite people all mixed up his words sent a tremor rippling through me ivys scent coated me a soft memory of what they once had the two of them had banded together in their vulnerable youth to survive and i knew he missed their past closeness he ached with his need to find it again his pain pulled on me making me want to give him what he needed soothing both his body and mind i wasnt coming in second behind ivy but first i could give him something she couldnteverything he had found with ivy but ignorant of what piscary had put them both through i knew that was why ivy had left him she couldnt live with the reminder the draw to submit and give him everything strengthened and when he felt me lean into him his grip tightened body meeting his suggestively i pulled his scent deep into me it swirled through my body the pheromones flipping switches until i ached with need my hands slipped to his back feeling the tension there and wanting so badly to get lost in him i exhaled my breath shaking do me here i whispered tilting his head kisten held my shoulders and kissed my lower neck gently hesitantly as if he had never touched me before i lost my breath at the rush of feeling the burning tracings of desire settling deep and low i exhaled into it calling it to me the pause to gather our breath was over oh god i have to do something fingers fumbling i reached for his slacks the top button was undone and i unzipped them pushing them down enough to give him freedom his hands were at my lower back and i clasped my arms around his neck lowering myself off the dresser so he could pull my jeans down my feet touched the floor long enough to shake off first one pant leg then the other impatient i tightened my grip around his neck lifting myself back up against him until i was on the dresser again his hands ran over my curves to my waist then higher a groan of anticipation slipped from me when he bowed his head massaging my breast with one hand and sending his lips over the other he tugged and teasedthe hint of teeth telling me what he could do if i let him almost promising if he hadnt had his caps he would have bitten me adrenaline flashed deep and i sent my hands down to find his taut smooth skin his motion against me grew rougher and i responded with a sharp tug he leaned to find the base of my neck with his lips his repressed need making him savage feeling poured from my scar i would have collapsed if he hadnt held me my heart pounded as he eased up and i could breathe again beneath my moving fingers he was smooth and warm a shocking contrast to his rough touch on my neck his breathing deepened and his teeth teased the skin about my scar leaving me aching for him to find me fully i squeezed my eyes shut sensing the hint of coming ecstasy i gasped startled when he gave up his teasing and bit me without breaking the skin hard and strong only his capped teeth stopped him tension spiked through me and i moaned it hit kisten like fear his fingers gripping my shoulders tightened with a vamp quickness he jerked me closer i gasped again then with my arms again about his neck i shifted my body to make it easier for him leaving the dresser entirely he slid into me with an exquisite slowness that replaced reason with desperate need i took a faltering breath lips parting i brought the scent of him deep into me as he filled my mind and body both with him supporting my weight we moved together my arms were about his neck to keep myself to him and i realized that apart from the obvious i couldnt touch him with anything but my lips the selfimposed restraint hit me and with a frustrated desperation i went for his neck tracing old scars and feeling a want grow headier with each shift of weight kistens breathing was fast and he held me to him with a fervent need moving toward climax his mouth was on me pulling the thought of ivy sinking her teeth flashed through me fear of the unknown dove to my groin and kisten moaned sensing it i wanted ivy to bite me i wanted that feeling of utter bliss mixing with knowing the act was an affirmation of her being worth sacrificing for all layered with the heady emotion of risk i craved even so i trusted her to not bind me to her but kisten deep in my heart he was still an unknown the lure of the thrill of adrenaline driving me to risk everything ivys protection was a crutch that allowed me to make myself vulnerable without risking his binding me to him he couldnt bite me but maybe maybe i could bite him adrenaline flared at the thought and my hands upon him clenched even as i forced his lips to find mine oh god i want to bite him i realized i didnt want to bleed him or taste his blood but i could fill him with that mindshocking wave of ecstasy that waited just below his skin the feeling of power over him was a rush almost as strong as fear and i wasnt used to telling myself no kisten i panted as i pulled away do you promise not to bite me if i bite you his hands supporting me were shaking i promise he whispered youve asked and ive said yes oh god rachel you might you might pick up an echo of my hunger but its not yours dont be afraid a surge of sensation struck through both of us i felt the strength and satisfaction of power fear for tomorrow flashed through me and was gone my hands went around the back of his neck and i moved against him feeling a new stirring of domination and desire my pulse thrummed the scent of leather and wine drew on memories pulling me to him his lips parted and with his drive singing in me to bring every cell awake i silenced the part of me that rebelled against tasting anothers blood and met his lips with my own kisten exhaled in pained exhilaration i eased into the kiss tentatively tracing my tongue against his teeth as we moved together doubly joined my heart pounded and i didnt care what might happen anymore i couldnt move my hands to touch him or id fall and i wanted to stay where i was gripping him with my legs feeling him inside me wild with need our mouths moved together and in an instant of abandonment i found his lip it didnt take much blood flowed my body shook in a spasm oh god it was all it was everything scintillating and alive i tasted vampire blood it struck through me and i clutched at kisten unable to breathe unable to pull away in sheer ecstasy in a flash hunger poured into me and i knew what ivy and kisten fought to contain every day and how good it felt to sate it it was kistens hunger echoing in me without fear this is not wrong i thought as kistens hands clutched at me the hunger demanded more and i deepened the kiss we shared there was only this this was all it was the spark of existence pooled and collected distilled to a feeling and with kistens hunger echoing through me i pulled his blood from him taking it as my own vampire blood wouldnt make me stronger or faster or live forever but it was a rush a high like no other and i could feel his aura mixing with mine sharing the same space as i took him into me a surge of whitehot need ached spinning from his blood he moaned and as i drew his blood into me again i tightened my grip on him and wouldnt let go i could feel us reaching for climax it was there dancing just out of my reach his arms shook i breathed heavily struggling for air a savage sound came from him and he clutched me close his blood was liquid thought racing to set me alight i could feel him inside me and i pressed into him desperate and then we found it eyes clamped shut i flung my head back i could do nothing as a wash of sensation spilled into me into us every cell sang with the release leaving a high so deep there was no thought but for its continued existence kistens grip shook and he staggered unaware of anything we hung poised in the rapture that suffused us my god he groaned both satisfied and desperate as he reached out for the feeling and with his words it slipped away it was gone i took a gasping breath slumping my muscles wouldnt hold me and i started to fall oh god he said again this time in worry as he caught me and brought me to the bed i felt myself ease down and he peered close rachel he said his hands holding my head im okay i panted trembling as i felt for the bed and put out an arm to keep myself upright i shuddered cold as my body tried to recover and kisten pulled me to him vampire blood and sex holy crap they werent kidding it was good enough to kill a person shifting himself back to the headboard we found an almostupright stance with his arms warm around me are you okay he asked fine i couldnt stand but i was fine i was better than fine i had been afraid of this my hand was on his chest where his shirt hung open pulse slowing i shifted my fingers across his skin feeling the smoothness i looked for my pants finding them puddled before the dresser kisten was still in his mostly contentment rose high in me and i smiled worn out and exhausted i could hear his heartbeat and i listened to it as it slowed kisten mmmmhmm the sound rumbled up through his chest and into me i could hear the peace in it and i snuggled closer fingers fumbling kisten pulled the lightweight coverlet over us that was incredible i said shivering at the comforters smooth silk backing how do you how do you go to work and live a normal life knowing thats there to find kistens arms about me tightened his one hand rose to find mine stilling my motion against his skin you just do he said softly and youre a good bite innocent and eager stop i moaned you make me sound like a a i didnt know what to call myself and slut sounded so nasty blood slut shut up i exclaimed and he grunted as my elbow jabbed him when i moved be still he said wrapping his arms around me keeping me where i was against him youre not forgiving him i slumped back into his warmth his hand moved against my hair gentling me and i watched the lights from the city reflected onto the low ceiling as a deep lassitude drifted into me i ran my tongue across the insides of my caps to find the taste of him all the way to the back of my throat and i couldnt concentrate well enough to decide if i liked finding it there or not my pulse was slowing taking my thoughts with it i knew i should be worried about ivy but all i could manage was a sleepy ivy shhhh he whispered his hand ever moving soothing me its okay ill make sure she understands im not leaving you kisten i said but it sounded like i was trying to convince myself i know and in his silence that followed i heard the echoes of the women before me who had said the same thing it wasnt a mistake i whispered eyes closing i knew i was bloodsugared his pheromones probably hitting me especially hard from my having taken his blood i didnt make a mistake his hand moving atop my head never slowed never sped up not a mistake he agreed reassured i lay against him and inhaled his scent to find comfort i wasnt going to abandon that feeling no matter what so what do we do now i breathed as i started to fall into sleep whatever the hell we want he answered shhhh go to sleep the last of my tension eased and i wondered if i should take my caps off anything i whispered surprised at how natural they felt id forgotten i had them on yeah anything he said go to sleep you havent had a good sleep in days safe in kistens arms i closed my eyes feeling more secure than i had since my dad had died only now did i feel the gentle movement of the boat rocking me into oblivion i was sated in mind and body and soul kistens arm was over me it was like the warmest comforter on the coldest morning i exhaled finding a peace i hadnt known id been missing and as i hovered in a curious mix of waking and sleep i heard kisten sigh his fingers still gentling the hair about my forehead dont leave us rachel he whispered clearly not aware i was still awake i dont think ivy or i could survive it twenty standing at the churchs door in the earlyafternoon sun i shifted the shiny paper sack of threedollar pastries and wedged the foam container of brewed gourmet coffee into the crook of my elbow one hand free i managed the latch and pushed on the heavy door the strap to my shoulder bag slipped to my elbow to throw me off balance but my held breath eased out when it opened thank god it wasnt bolted ivy would hear me for sure if i had to come in the back listening i pushed the door wider my stomach was upset id like to say it was from lack of sleep but i knew it was from how the next hour was going to play out kisten hadnt broken my skin but ivy was going to be pissed especially after being so clear yesterday one way or another my life was going to changein the next sixty minutes letting kisten face the fallout wasnt going to happen either ivy was my roommate it had been my decision and after i had quelled my minor panic attack in kistens bathroom this morning id convinced him to let me tell her she wanted a relationship with me and if i came in unrepentant and matteroffact shed hide her feelings until she could deal with them if he came to her meek and guilty shed get mad and do who knew what besides ivy had shown me what she could offer then walked out the door what did she expect me to do be celibate with kisten while i figured it all out kisten had been my boyfriend first but she was my friend and her feelings mattered the sack of godiva chocolate and the thimblesize jar of dogwoodblossom honey that had set me back ten bucks swung from a pinkie as i eased the door shut and in the darkness of the foyer kicked off my shoes so i wasnt above bribery so sue me a thick silence gave me pause it was eerie and i padded in my sock feet through the sanctuary ivy had moved her stereo out though the furniture was still clustered in the corner i wondered if she was waiting for me to finish the living room together the church felt different the blasphemy seeming to grate heavily on my aura head down i hustled past her closed bedroom door not wanting the scent of coffee to wake her until i was ready i wasnt a fool to believe that coffee pastries chocolate and honey would be enough to soothe ivys hurt emotions and jenkss worry but it might buy me time to explain before the shit hit the fan kisten wanted me to tell her id bitten him to understand her hunger better but it would be a lie id bitten him because i had known hed enjoy it that it had felt good to me had been an unexpected surprisewhich i was embarrassed about now safe in the kitchen i set the pastries by the sink wincing at the ninebythirteen pan of unfrosted chocolate cake and tub of white frosting she made me a cake while i was sleeping with kisten great the nice plate i said quashing my guilt and rummaging for the plate ivy had bought at a garage sale this spring after id said i liked the violets on the openweave rim not finding it i slid the top everyday black plate out glancing at the empty hallway when the ceramic clinked the sack crackled as i took out and arranged the pastries the coffee was next and my frown deepened when ivys vampiric charms mug wasnt in the cupboard it wasnt like her to put it in the dishwasher but the door creaked so i poured the brew into a set of smaller cups now for jenks i muttered getting a matching dessert plate and setting the single square of fudge on it strategically placing the honey beside it this was going to work id talk to them both together and it was going to be all right it wasnt as if i had let him bite me ready i spun to the table my face went cold ivys computer was gone my thoughts flew to the sanctuary and her missing stereo please let us have been robbed i whispered scared out of my mind i hustled into the hallway had she found out and left damn it i wanted to be the one to tell her pulse pounding i stopped before ivys door i felt hot then cold hesitating i tapped the thick wood ivy no answer i took a deep breath knocked again and turned the handle ivy are you awake heart in my throat i looked in her bed was made and her room looked normal but then i saw that her book was gone from her nightstand and the closet was empty oh crap i breathed my eyes darted to the wall with her informal collage of pictures they were all there from what i could tell but then i wondered the picture of jenks and me standing before the mackinac bridge had there been an empty spot on the fridge feeling unreal i paced to the kitchen my stomach caving as i entered it was gone ah shit i swore and a tiny harrumph pulled my attention to the sink shit jenks said standing on the windowsill between his sea monkeys and mr fish shit he shrilled coming to hover before me his face was tight in anger and black pixy dust spilled from him is that all you have to say what did you do rachel mouth open i took a stumbling step back jenks shes gone he said hands clenching packed up and left what did you do jenks i was she leaves and you come home with bribes where were you i was with kisten i shouted then fell back two steps when he flew at me i can smell him in you rachel the pixy shouted he bit you you let him bite you when you knew ivy couldnt what the hell is wrong with you jenks its not like that you stupid witch if its not one of you its the other you women are all damned fools she makes a pass at you and you screw everything up by letting kisten bite you so you can feel secure in your own sexual drives he darted at me and i put the center island counter between us but seeing as he could fly over it that was kind of useless and then you try to buy me off with fudge and honey you can stick my dragonflys turds on a stick and roast them because i cant take you two women screwing my life up anymore hey i shouted hands on my hips and leaning to put my nose inches from him he didnt bite me she never said i couldnt bite him she only said he couldnt bite me jenks pointed a finger at me he took a breath then hesitated he didnt bite you no i shouted burning off some adrenaline you think im stupid he raised a hand and i added dont answer that he landed on the counter arms crossed over his chest and his wings a blur of agitation that doesnt make it right he said sounding sullen you knew it would bother her pissed i slammed my hand on the counter to make him jump into the air i cant live my life by what bothers ivy kist is my boyfriend ivy making a pass at me didnt change that and ill have sex with who i want and how i want damn it his feet touched the counter and his wings went still guilt hit me hard as i looked at him standing there i wished he were bigger so i could give him a hug and tell him it was going to be all right anything to get that terrible look of betrayal and anger off him but he just stared sighing i swung a chair around i sat on it backward and put my folded arms on the counter slumping to get my eyes on the same level as his he wouldnt look at me jenks i said softly and he sneered wings coming alive its going to be okay ill find her and explain i reached out letting my hand fall to curve protectively around him shell understand i said gazing at the cake and hearing the guilt in my voice she has to he looked at me his arms uncrossing but she left said plaintively my hand beside him moved in a motion of exasperation you know how she can be she just needs to cool off maybe she went to spend the weekend at skimmers she took her computer glancing at the empty space i winced she couldnt have found out that fast what time did she leave right before midnight he stopped pacing and looked at me sideways it was really weird like that movie where the guy gets a call and it triggers a set of actions programmed into him years ago whats the name of that movie i dont know i muttered glad he wasnt yelling at me anymore she couldnt have left because of this kisten and i hadnt even had dinner yet by midnight she wouldnt answer me he said he resumed pacing and i watched wondering how much of his outburst had been worry for ivy finding an easy outlet in anger at me she just packed her clothes and her computer and her music and left my eyes went to the fridge and the empty tomato magnet she took our picture yeah i pulled myself up something had happened but it was unlikely she knew about kisten and me and there was no way for her to find out until she got back jenks was the only one who knew i had taken the bus home so even steve wouldnt smell kistens blood in me who called skimmer i asked wondering if it had simply been an emergency run an emergency run she hadnt taken jenks on or even told him what it was i dont know jenks said i came in when i heard the whine of her computer shut off lips pressed together i thought about that why rachel jenks asked his voice tired i didnt move anything but my eyes my biting kisten is not why she left his angular face pinched in distress maybe someone found out and called her the thought of what ivy was capable of in a fit of rage passed through me and i reached for my shoulder bag the timing was wrong but still maybe i should call kisten he nodded in worry coming closer as i punched the right buttons i held the phone from my ear and we both listened to it ring until it shunted me into voice mail hey kisten i said eyes on jenks give me a call when you get this ivy wasnt here when i got home she took her computer and music i dont think she knows but im worried i wanted to say more but there wasnt more to say bye i whispered and hit the end button bye god i sounded like a little lost girl jenks peered up at me the color returning to his wings call ivy he demanded but i was already ahead of him this time i was dumped right into voice mail and i left a guiltysounding message that i had to talk to her and not to do anything until i talked to her i wanted to say i was sorry but i closed the phone and looked at it sitting alone on the counter suddenly the pastries arranged on their plate looked trite i was an ass jenks the coaxing in my voice turned his worry into a cold anger i dont want to hear about it you screwed everything up for one moment of blood passion even if thats not why she left she will when she finds out whats wrong with you cant you leave things alone no i cant i exclaimed and it wasnt just a moment of blood passion it was an affirmation of what i feel for kisten so you can shove it you little twit i know what im doing i said he opened his mouth to protest and i threw my hand up in the air okay maybe i dont but im trying to figure this out its all mixed up the blood the passion its all mixed up and i dont know what to do he was clearly taken aback and i surged ahead almost panicked i want ivy to bite me i said it feels too damn good and it would do both of us good but the only way to do it safely is to sleep with her and im not going to sleep with her just for the blood passion until i know whats going on in my head i never thought id like a girli mean im straight right is it the vamp scar thats turning me on or her do i love ivy or just the way she can make me feel theres a difference jenks and im not going to cheapen it if its only about the blood i knew my face was red but he deserved to hear it all ivy made a pass at me because she knows i make decisions by doing stuff and then thinking about it not the other way around well im doing different stuff and look how messed up everything got isnt this nice i said sarcastically gesturing behind me at ivys empty place jenkss wings went still and he sat down on edge of the fudge plate maybe you should try it he said and a spike of adrenaline shot through me and was gone just once he coaxed sometimes the quickest way to find out who you are is to be that person for a while id thought of that already and it scared me slowly i brought my eyes to his then why are you upset that i bit kisten i said thats me trying to be someone new you think i wouldve done that a year ago why is it wrong when i try things with kisten and not ivy his gaze went to her empty spot at the table because ivy loves you my gut tightened so does kisten jenks brought his knees to his chin and clasped his hands around his shins ivy would die for you rachel kisten wont put your emotions where they will keep you alive it was a hard truth ugly i didnt want to choose who i loved by who could keep me alive i wanted to make decisions on who i loved by who completed me made me feel good about myself who i could love freely and help make a better person by just being there god i was confused tired i pillowed my head on my folded arms and stared at the table inches from my nose i heard the soft sound of wings and the draft from jenks stirred my hair its all right rachel he said close and concerned she knows you love her my throat closed and i sighed maybe i should try it ivys way at least as far as i could without becoming uncomfortable or freaked out just once a moment of embarrassment would be better than all this confusion and awkwardness and misery the small dinner bell at the front door rang and i jumped jenkss face was full of hope when i brought my head up then fear if something had happened to ivy i wouldnt get a phone call but a stonefaced is agent on my doorstep telling me my roommate was in the city morgue i got it i said the chair scraping as i rose i hustled into the sanctuary hoping it was ivy with her stuff and needing someone to open the door for her im right behind you jenks said sounding grim as he joined me in the hall twentyone my stomach was in knots when i pushed open the heavy oak doors to find ceri forcing a smile i felt both relief and disappointment when i saw her beaming in the sun her long fair hair floating and a squishy wrapped present in her hands she was wearing a summery anklelength linen dress and was barefootas usual i wasnt surprised to see rex jenkss cat at her feet the orange kitten was purring rubbing her ankles happy birthday the youngseeming woman said cheerfully jenks dropped three feet crap is that today he stammered then zipped off my distress that it wasnt ivy faded hi ceri i said flattered she had remembered you didnt have to get me anything she came inside and handed me the package its from keasley and me she said in explanation eager and flustered ive never gotten anyone a birthday present are you going to have a party her face went solemn i wanted to have a party for keasley but he wont tell me when his birthday is and i dont know what day i was born my smile went bemused you forgot my kin never celebrated a persons years so the day i was born never meant anything it was in the winter though i found myself nodding as i followed her in she was from the dark ages they didnt celebrate birthdays then i seemed to remember that from a class ivy made a cake i said feeling depressed but its not frosted yet do you want some coffee and pastries instead may as well ivy isnt going to eat them with me stopping in the middle of the sanctuary she turned anticipation brightening her expression so youre going to have a party later she asked probably not i said and when her shoulders slumped i laughed not everyone has a party ceri unless they have stock in a card company her lips pursed now youre making fun of me go on open your present i could tell she wasnt really upset so i opened the squishy package tossing the paper into the trash basket under my desk oh thank you i exclaimed as i found a soft casual shirt made from brushed cotton it was a vibrant red almost glowing and i could tell without trying it on that it would fit me perfectly jenks said you needed a new shirt she said shyly do you like it is it suitable its beautiful thank you i said feeling the richness of the fabric it was a simple style but the cloth was scrumptious and the neckline would flatter my small chest she must have spent a fortune i love it i said as i gave her a quick hug then rocked into motion i should hang it up do you want some coffee ill make tea she said her gaze going to the empty spot where ivys stereo had been her steps soft behind mine she hesitated at the door to my room upon catching sight of trents bridesmaid dresses and my newest party dress hanging from the back of the closet oh she exclaimed when did you get that i beamed finding an empty hanger and wrangling her shirt onto it yesterday i needed something for a run and since its a party i bought something appropriate jenkss laugh rang out even before he was in sight rache he said as he landed on ceris shoulder you have some odd ideas of dress codes what i fingered the stiff black lace at the hem of the skirt its a nice dress for a wedding rehearsal its in a church right he screwed his face up in a pious look spank me father for i have sinned he said in a falsetto my eyes narrowed and i hung up ceris gift it was in the basilica actually the hollows cathedral its the party afterward i want to look nice for jenks snickered and ceri frowned her eyes were crinkled at the corners but she didnt move since rex was twining about her feet meowing for jenks thats a nice dress she said and worry filled me at her forced tone it looks as if it will keep you cool and comfortable even if you are outside and its probably easy to run in tinks knickers i hope it doesnt rain jenks said sarcastically everything you got will be on display hush ceri admonished its not going to rain crap i should have waited until kisten could shop with me suddenly worried i unzipped the two silk garment bags these are the bridesmaids dresses i offered wanting to get jenkss attention off my new outfit before he saw the cherries painted on the jackets snaps she hasnt picked which one yet i said touching the split skirt of the black lace dress i hope its this one the other is just ugly and you knows ugly when yous sees ugly dont ya sweet thang i glared at jenks shut up what are you wearing tonight pixy jenkss wings shifted into motion and he rose from ceris shoulder my usual holy crap tell me those arent cherries i snatched up the hanger and shoved it into my closet why was i worried about what i was going to wear i should be worried about the focus and who was killing weres to find it i wasnt ready to believe that mr ray and mrs sarong werent responsible and realistically it was only a matter of time before they called my bluff and came after me ceri was frowning at jenks when i turned seeing my attention on her she changed her severe wordless admonishment to him to a worried smile for me i think it suits you she said you will look unique and you are a unique person shes going to look like a fortydollar hooker jenks ceri exclaimed and he darted out of her reach to sit atop my dresser mirror depressed i looked at my closet you know what im going to wear the shirt you just gave me with some jeans and if im underdressed ill just add some jewelry to it really you want to wear the shirt i chose ceri said so brightly that i wondered if jenks had coached her on what to buy to fit this situation he looked far too smug and ceris ears were as red as the shirt my eyes narrowed in suspicion and the slight woman turned her attention to the black lace bridesmaid gown touching the fine fabric this is beautiful she said do you get to keep it after the wedding probably i trailed my hands down the lace sleeves theyd drape dramatically over my fingertips and the builtin bodice would show off my waist id never go to another function where i could wear anything so elegant but just having it would be nice it was slit up the side but cut so that it wouldnt give anything except brief glimpses the bitch hasnt decided which dress yet i said sourly if she picks the other im going to double my fee call it hazard pay look at it i gestured disparagingly at the lacehemmed collar that dipped so low it would make my small chest look nonexistent there are no curves at all just a straight tube all the way from my shoulders to the floor i wont be able to run if i need to much less dance unless i hike the thing up past my knees and the lace i touched the outer covering trying to hide the ugly color of pea soup as if in shame feeling the rough edges of the secondgrade lace catch on my fingers its going to catch on everything ill look like a freaking sea cucumber that didnt get the expected smile and when i met jenkss eyes he glanced at ceris softly creased brow and shrugged rex sat at her feet as though she might get some attention if she stared hard enough hes marrying a were woman ceri said her voice unusually soft no i was being rude i shoved the green dress away not wanting to talk about it jenks moved to the closets shelf ive never met ellasbeth but she sounds more prickly than a porcupines scab though icky it was a pretty good description nice visual jenks i muttered ceris thin fingers were tracing the tiny stitches on the black sleeve i dont think she had even heard me so enamored of the dress was she this one would be a pleasure to dance in if she chooses the other she is either an idiot or a sadist sadist jenks said his feet swinging i wish they made cameras i could carry i know the hollows observer would pay good money for a shot of rachel and trent dancing ha i barked gently taking the pretty dress and putting it in my closet newly organized thanks to newt that will be the day you have to jenks said the sparkles sifting from him turning silver its the rules i sighed yes i was probably going to have to dance with him if i was in the wedding party ceri had a wicked smile on her face well im not going to enjoy it i said trying not to think about his tight ass and how he showed off a tux my height looked good against his class and it would be fun to get ellasbeths knickers in a knot i shut my closet door smiling do you know how hard it is to slowdance with a gun strapped to your thigh no jenks followed me out to the kitchen ceri and the cat trailing behind wheres ivys computer ceri asked when we entered and i cringed i dont know my stomach tightened as i looked at her empty corner i spent the night at kistens and she wasnt here when i came home face still and empty the elf looked up from the sink from where she was filling the copper kettle her gaze went from the pastries arranged on the plate to the storebought coffee to the square of fudge but it wasnt until she saw the honey that she figured it out shes gone ceri said turning off the tap with excessive force what happened nothing i said feeling guilty and defensive well sort of nothing i amended god ceri this isnt any of your business i added crossing my arms over my chest she bit kisten this morning jenks said helpfully while bumping uglies hey i said embarrassed that is not why she left we hadnt even finished dinner before she walked out taking a breath i faced ceri surprised to find her jaw set in disapproval hes my boyfriend i exclaimed and he didnt bite me and why in hell does everyone think i should live my life by what ivy wants because she loves you ceri said standing beside the lit stove and you love her as a friend if nothing else shes afraid and youre not youre the stronger person in this situation and need to exert some restraint you cant live your life by her wishes she added holding up a hand to forestall my protest but you know this is something she is aching to share with you miserable i glanced at ivys empty spot and then back to ceri she cant separate blood passion from sex and i dont think i can either i whispered wondering how my personal life had become everyones favorite topic and why i was being so open about it apart from my being completely lost and trying to find anyone to help me then you have a problem ceri said turning her back on me to open a cupboard i couldnt read her mood at all i never said i was good at this i muttered getting up i pulled a mug from the cupboard but when i dropped a tea bag into it her eyes narrowed go sit and drink your foul coffee she said her voice harsh ill make my own tea jenks snickered and after i moved the plate with the honey and fudge to the table i sat with my cold gourmet coffee it had lost much of its appeal ceris silent disapproval was obvious but what was i supposed to do i didnt like the idea that ivy had left to move in with skimmer without telling me but it was the best explanation i had right now ceri brought the ceramic teapot out from under the counter throwing my tea bag away she measured out two spoonfuls of loose tea jenks flitted to his honey and wrestled with the top until i opened it for him some birthday this was turning out to be jenks i warned my eyes going to rex the orange cat was sitting in the threshold of the kitchen watching me with those creepy kitten eyes id seen jenks on honey it got him drunker faster than a frat boy avoiding finals and rex liked little winged things too much for my comfort what he said belligerently you bought it for me yes but i was hoping youd be sober this afternoon for our run snorting jenks settled himself before the jar brimming with the sticky amber like ive ever been drunk for longer than five minutes clearly eager he pulled what looked like a set of chopsticks from his back pocket manipulating them expertly he spindled a wad of the honey into his mouth his wings drooped and stilled when he swallowed and a giggle slipped from him crap this is good stuff he said around a gooey mouthful five minutes that was about right but i was worried about rex ceri stood at the sink and warmed the teapot with hot tap water i thought it a useless step that only served to make more dirty dishes but ceri was the expert when it came to tea her gaze went to jenks now holding the sticks high over his uptilted head and letting the honey dribble into him it was going exactly where he wanted even if he was starting to cant to one side can you take that into the overhead rack i said worried stiffening jenks gave me a wideeyed unfocused look i can fly woman i can fly better honeydrunk than you can fly stone sober to prove his point he lifted into the air making a whoop of exclamation he lost altitude ceris hand was under him in a flash and he started giggling listen listen he coaxed while he slumped on her hand then belched the first two lines to you are my sunshine jenks i protested get off ceri thats disgusting sorry sorry he slurred almost falling damn thats good honey gotta take some of this to matalina matalina would like it maybe help her sleep a little clearly concentrating he had sparkles sifting from him thick and furious as he wobbled down to the table i sighed apologetically and ceri smiled snagging rex as the cat padded past her headed for jenks the cat settled herself in ceris arm purring kitty kitty kitty jenks slurred as he landed next to me and his honey kitty wants some honey s good huhoney yeah my life was weird but it had its moments ceri leaned against the counter while she waited for her water to warm how have you been sleeping lately she asked as if she were my doctor any more sneezing i smiled flattered she cared no i didnt sleep much this morning but that wasnt miniass fault her eyebrows rose and i added do you think newt will show up again she shook her head solemnly no he will watch her carefully for a time fingers gripping my warm coffee i thought that if newt did show up there wasnt much i could do about it seeing as she had taken control of ceris triple circle with the ease of opening a letter remembering me taking toms circle i went to ask her about it then didnt it had to be because id walked into its construction thats all i was sure id read somewhere that that was possible and i didnt want to risk hearing her say it was unusual singing the rolling stones satisfaction jenks sat crosslegged before his oneounce jar ladling honey into himself i will protect you rache he said cutting his music short ill give that demon a labeotomy boobotomay lob lob lobotomy if he shows up again i made a wry face watching him fall over laughing merrily at himself then sitting up with a loud ow depressed i pulled a ribbon of dough from the pastry it was dry but i ate it anyway ceris water started to steam managing to fill her teapot with rex still in her arms she brought her brew it to sit on the table jenks staggered to the teapot wings a blur for balance as he put his back to it and slid down with a heavy sigh may i ask you something ceri asked her eyes on her empty cup i didnt have anything to do until about six when i would start getting ready for my run so after putting the top back on jenkss honey i pulled a foot up onto my chair and clasped an arm around a knee sure what a faint hint of pink on her cheeks she asked did it hurt when ivy bit you i stiffened and jenkshis eyes closedstarted mumbling no no no damn vampire made it feel good ah crap im tired swallowing i met her eyes no why her lower lip turned in and biting it to look charming ceri grew solemn you should never be ashamed of loving someone my blood pressure spiked im not i said defensively i was belligerent because i was afraid but instead of responding with an equal amount of ire she unexpectedly dropped her eyes im not finding fault with you she said softly i envy you and you need to know that my fingers laced about my knee tightened me she envies my screwedup life you say you dont trust people ceri rushed to explain her vivid green eyes pleading for understanding but you do trust you trust too much you give everything even when youre afraid and i envy that i dont think i could ever love anyone without fear now jenks hiccupped aw ceri its okay i love you thank you jenks ceri said sitting primly in her chair but it would never work your body is not as big as your heart and much as id like to think i am a soul and mind i have a body that needs to be satisfied as well the hell im not big enough he protested lurching up only one wing was working and it almost knocked him over you just ask matalina the pixy went pale never mind ceri poured out some tea the amber liquid gurgling with the sound of contentment to stand at contrast with my unease i slowly pulled my second knee up to my first jenks sit down i murmured when his staggering path toward the honey went off track and he angled for the tables edge glad for the distraction my thoughts drifted to trent and ellasbeths marriage i was reaching for jenks when he collapsed into the napkins and pulled one over his head why hadnt i told trent about ceri or ceri about trent i was a lousy judge of character but even i could tell that the two seemed made for each other trent wasnt that bad though he had kept me caged as a mink and put me in the fights and tricked me into trying to take piscary down by myself though some of that stupidity was my fault i pulled another ribbon of pastry from a roll trent had treated me with respect the night id been his paid bodyguard then kept me alive during the aftermath hed trusted me to take care of lee on my own instead of killing him like he wanted to though if i had let trent kill his friend i wouldnt be playing bodyguard at his wedding probably this is a mess i thought washing the pastry down with a swallow of cold coffee ceri could decide what she wanted to do and if trent used her id freaking kill him and because i was gaining his trust i could probably get close enough to do it which was a terrifying thought my heart beat faster and i wiped my fingers on a napkin ceri i said and she looked up expectantly rex was still on her lap and her fingers were gentling the animal taking a steadying breath i said ive got someone i want you to meet her green eyes met mine and a smile grew who i looked at jenks but he was out of it sleeping under the napkins uh trent my chest clenched and i prayed i was doing the right thing see hes an elf beaming ceri pushed rex to the floor so she could lean across the table the cat stalked out of the room and the scent of wine and cinnamon filled me when ceri gave me a quick hug i know she said as she leaned back and smiled at me thank you rachel you knew i said warm from embarrassment god she must think me an insensitive boob but she settled herself in her chair and smiled as if i had just given her a pony and a puppy and then the freaking moon kalamack right i stammered were talking about the same trent why didnt you say anything you gave me back my soul she said her hair drifting and with it the chance to redeem my sins i look to you for guidance until you approved of him it would have caused problems you made no attempt to hide that you dont like him she smiled shyly and i stared you knew he was an elf i asked still not believing it how he doesnt know about you at least i dont think he does embarrassed she pulled her feet up under her to sit crosslegged looking both wise and innocent i saw him in a magazine last winter but you didnt like him her eyes flicked to mine and then back down i knew he had hurt you keasley told me he controls the brimstone trade and like anything in excess its damaging but rachel how can you condemn all the good for a little bad she said not a hint of pleading in her voice its been illegal for thirtytwo years out of five thousand and is a blatant way for humans to try to control inderland when you put it like that trent almost sounded respectable bothered i leaned back did keasley tell you he blackmails people using illegal genetic research that his makeawish camps are underground genetic labs where he helps children in order to blackmail their parents yes he also told me that trents father cured your blood disease because your father was his friend dont you think you owe him a debt of gratitude whoa my breath caught and i felt cold not about the debtofgratitude thing but that keasley knew something i hadnt until last solstice keasley told you that ceri watched me over her teacup her head went up and down nodding sharply my worried gaze went to the bluecurtained window above the sink and the sunlit garden beyond i was going to have to have a talk with keasley trents father saved my life i admitted bringing my attention back to her my dad and his were friends and work partners and they both died because of it so i think that rubs out any gratitude i might have stupidass elf thinks the world owes him everything but ceri only sipped at her tea maybe trent put you in the rat fights because he blames your father for his fathers death i took a breath to protest then slowly let it out crap is trent as insecure as the rest of us smug ceri topped off her cup didnt you blame him for the loss of your father she asked unnecessarily i might add yes i said realizing that her putting it in past tense worked i didnt blame him anymore piscary had killed himin a roundabout way somehow maybe and if i was a good little witch and kept trents little elf ass above the green green grass during his wedding he just might tell me the details giving myself a mental shake i filed that away to think about later do you want to meet him i asked tiredly sounding oh so thrilled at the prospect her remaining ire vanished and she smiled from across the table yes please yes please as if she needed my okay you dont need my permission my tone was almost sullen but she dropped her eyes demurely i want it she set her cup on the saucer with a clink i was raised with the expectation that someone would guide me in matters of the heart a guardian and confidant my mother and father are deceased my kin has been diluted by time you rescued my body freed my soul you are my sahan i straightened in my chair as if ice had washed over me whoa wait up ceri im not your guardian you dont need one youre your own person is she nuts ceri set her feet on the floor and leaned forward her eyes asking for understanding please rachel she begged i need this being als familiar tore everything from me give this piece of my life back to me i need to resume ties to my old life before i can cut them and move into this one i felt panicky im the last person you should seek advice from i stammered look at me im a mess smiling softly ceri dropped her eyes youre the most caring person i know consistently risking your life for those who cant fight on their own i see this in the people you love ivy who is afraid she cant fight her battle alone anymore kisten who struggles to stand in a system where he knows hes too weak jenks who has the courage but not the strength to make a difference in a world that doesnt even see him aw thanks ceri the pixy mumbled from under his napkin you often see the worst in people she said but you always see the best eventually i gaped at her noting my unease she hesitated do you trust trent no i blurted then paused but here i was broaching the subject of introducing ceri to him maybe in some things i amended i trust your judgment though apparently it was the right thing to say since ceri smiled and put a cool hand upon mine you believe in him more than you realize and i though i may not know him i trust your judgment slow as it is in coming her smile turned wicked and im not a silly girl to be blinded by a tidy posterior and expansive landholdings tidy posterior and expansive landholdings was that the dark ages equivalent of a tight ass and a lot of money i chuckled and her hand slipped away hes devious i warned i dont want you to be taken advantage of i know hes going to want a sample for his labs ceri sipped her tea her eyes focused on the sunlit garden he can have it i want my species to recover as much as he does i only wish id predated the curse so the damage could be fixed completely instead of the bandage he has been slapping on our children my fingers curled around the cool porcelain but i didnt bring the cup to my lips trent owed me big time ceri was giving him one hell of a better bandage hes manipulative i added and she raised one eyebrow and im not do you think i couldnt wind this man about my finger if i wanted i looked away worried yeah she could ceri laughed i dont want a husband she said green eyes twinkling i have to reinvent myself before i can share my life with anyone besides hes getting married i couldnt help my snort to a really nasty woman i muttered starting to relax i did not want trent marrying ceri even if trent werent such a dirtbag id probably never see her again after she found his garden i do believe ceri said wryly you think this wedding is just punishment for past sins nodding i glanced into the garden following a flash of motion i stood up and went to the window to see that it was just jenkss kids driving a hummingbird out of the yard you havent met her i said marveling at their teamwork ceri came to stand beside me the rich scent of cinnamon drifting off her to tickle my nose shes a terrible woman i added softly ceris gaze followed mine into the garden so am i she said more softly still twentytwo slumped in the back of the cab i watched the passing buildings and imagined ellasbeths distain for the clearly lowerclass shops though the hollows cathedral was worldrenowned it was in a somewhat depressed area of town unease trickled through me and i straightened pulling my bag with its charms and splat gun onto my lap i should have worn something else i was going to look like a slob in jeans jenks was on my shoulder rapping my hoop earring in time with the calypso beat on the cabbies radio it was way past annoying and though i knew it would likely only encourage him i murmured stop it my neck went cold as he lifted off to land on my knee relax rache he said standing with his legs spread wide for balance and his wings a blur this is a cakewalk how many people five counting her parents and quen will be there so its not like youre alone its the wedding youre going to have to worry about i took a deep breath cracking the window to set my hair drifting looking down i picked at the engineered hole in my knee maybe i should have worn a dress suit its a wedding rehearsal for tinks panties jenks burst out dont you watch the soaps the richer you are the more you dress down trent will probably be in a swimsuit my eyebrows rose picturing his trim physique wrapped in spandex mmmm wings stilling jenks adopted a bored expression you look great now if you had worn that little thang you picked out i shifted my knee and he took to the air we were only a block away and early excuse me i said leaning forward and into the cabbies enthusiastic rendition of madonnas material girl id never heard it done calypso before could you circle the block he met my gaze through the rearview mirror and though clearly thinking i was crazy lunched into the leftturn lane and waited for the light i rolled the window down all the way and jenks landed on the sill why dont you check it out i said softly already ahead of you babe he said reaching to see that his red bandanna was in place by the time you get around the block ill have met the locals and get the sitch babe i said tartly but he had darted out and was among the gargoyles i rolled up the window before the street breeze could make a mess of the intricate french braid his kids had put my hair in i didnt let them go at my hair very often their work was fantastic but they chatted like fifteenyearolds at a concertall at once and a hundred decibels louder than necessary the light changed and the driver made the turn carefully probably thinking i was a tourist getting an eyeful the sharpcornered tidily mortared stones rose up as high as perhaps an eightstory building to look massive and permanent compared to the low shops that surrounded it the cathedral sat tight to the curb on two sides shading the street there were shadeloving plants tucked into the moist shelter of the flying buttresses expansive stainedglass windows were everywhere shadowed and dull from the outside i squinted as i took it all in surprised at the lack of welcome that i found in my church it was like visiting your greataunt who disapproved of dogs loud music and cookies before dinner she was still family but you had to be on your best behavior and you never felt at ease after a quick scan of the side of the cathedral i dug in my bag for my cell phone and tried to call ivy again still no answer kisten wasnt answering either and there had been no response when i called piscarys earlier today id be worried but that it wasnt unusual they didnt open until five and no one manned the phone when they were closed the back of the cathedral was narrow walled garden and cracked parking lot at the corner i set my phone to vibrate and tucked it into my front jeans pocket where i would know if it rang more parking was on the third side empty but for a dusty latemodel black saturn in the shade and a basketball court the hoop bolted onto a light pole at nba regulation height across the way was another much taller one mixing species on the court wasnt a good idea i braced myself when the cabbie pulled up running his left wheel over the low curb of the oneway street shoving the car into park he started messing with a clipboard you want me to wait he asked glancing at the dingy storefront across the street i dug a twenty out of my purse and handed it to him no theres going to be a dinner afterward and ill bum a ride from someone can i have a receipt at that he looked at me over his paperwork his deeply tanned face showing surprise you know someone whos getting married here jenks was hovering impatiently outside but i hesitated beaming yes im in the kalamack wedding you kidding me his brown eyes widened to show that the whites were almost yellow the faint scent of musk tickled my nose he was a were most cabbies were i had no idea why hey he fumbled for a card handing it to me along with my blank receipt i have my limo license if they need anyone im available i took it admiring his moxie you bet thanks for the ride anytime he said as i got out he leaned out after me through the window ive got access to a car and everything this is only my day job until i finish getting my pilots license smiling i nodded and turned to the multiple doors pilots license thats a new one the cab merged into the light traffic and jenks dropped down from wherever he had been i leave you alone for five minutes he complained and you get hit on he just wanted a job i said admiring the four strands of sculptured vines arching over the twin set of wooden doors absolutelygorgeous thats what im saying he grumbled why are we here this early anyway because its a demon i eyed the gargoyles and wished i could talk to them but trying to wake a gargoyle before the sun was down was like trying to talk to a pet rock there were a lot of them though so the cathedral was probably secure i winced at the potted flowers on the sidewalk wondering if i could get them moved it would be too easy for fairy assassins to hide in them bringing my attention to jenks i added and as much as id like to see trent taken down by a past jealous lover or a disgruntled demon i want my forty thousand for babysitting he bobbed his head before landing on my shoulder speak of the devil i followed his attention to the street crap they were early too and now doubly glad for having gotten here when i had i tucked in my new shirt and waited as two shiny cars approached looking out of place among the flatbed trucks and saltrusted fords i had to jerk myself up and onto the shallow steps when the first one pulled out of traffic and up entirely onto the wide sidewalk a gray jaguar was behind it also parking on the walk youve got to be crapping in my daisies jenks said from my earring and i took my sunglasses off to get a better look ellasbeth was in the first car in the front seat and while she collected herself the uniformed driver opened the door for a pair of older people in the back mr and mrs withon i assumed since they were tall and elegant darkly tanned and having the trendy look of the west coast they were in their sixties id guess but wellpreserved sixties hell they were elvesthey could be three hundred for all i knew although they were dressed in casual slacks and tops one could still tell that their shoes cost more than most peoples car payments they stood and smiled in the sun as if looking into the past and seeing the land without the buildings cars or urban apathy ellasbeth stoically waited for the driver to open her door swooping out she tugged the short jacket covering her white shirt straight and draped a matching purse over her shoulder sandals clicking she rounded the back of the car her ankles bare below trim capri pants she was in hues of peach and cream her yellow hair back in a braid similar to mine with green ribbons woven in with red lips and shades firmly in place she never looked at the church clearly not pleased to be here seeing her class i was embarrassingly thankful that jenks and ceri had stepped in and bought me a clue putting on my happy face i came down the steps isnt this such a sweet little church mother the tall woman said twining her arm in her moms and gesturing at the basilica trenton was right this is the perfect place for an understated wedding understated jenks muttered from my earring its a friggin cathedral hush i said liking her parents for some reason they looked content together and i found myself wanting to keep them that way so when i woke at night alone id know that somewhere there was someone who had found love and made it last no wonder ellasbeth was ticked at being asked to marry someone she didnt love when she had grownup seeing her parents contentment id be mad too the hair on my arms prickled and i turned to see quen already out of the gleaming jaguar he was dressed in his usual black pants and shirt a pair of soft shoes on his feet a leather belt with a silver buckle was his only decoration i wondered if it was charmed the poxscarred man raised his eyebrows at me in greeting and i decided it probably was quen was headed for trents door but before he could get there trent had opened it himself blinking in the strong afternoon sun he gazed at the sky his eyes moving as he traced the lines of the front tower outlined against it his jeans fit him nicely properly faded and hitting his boots just right a silk shirt of a deep green that matched ellasbeths ribbons gave him some flash going well with his tan and fair hair he looked good but not happy seeing the five elves together i wondered at the differences ellasbeths mother had trents same wispy hair but her fathers was closer to ellasbethsrougher almost looking like a poor attempt to match it beside them quens dark features and ebony hair looked like the other side of the coin but no less elven ellasbeth brought her gaze from the scrollwork above the big doors when trent and quen approached her gaze lit upon me and her expression froze i smiled as she realized we had our hair up in the same way her face under her perfect makeup went stiff hello ellasbeth i said having been introduced to her by her first name the night shed walked in on me soaking in her tub long story but innocent enough ms morgan she said extending a pale hand how are you fine thank you i took her hand in mine surprised that it was warm im honored to be in the wedding party have you decided which dress yet the womans expression went even stiffer behind her shades mother father she said not answering me this is the woman trenton arranged to work additional security as if they cant tell im not one of her friends i thought taking their hands as they were offered pleasure to meet you i said to each of them in turn this is jenks my partner hell be working the perimeter and communication jenkss wings clattered to life but before he could charm them with his sparkling personality ellasbeths mother gasped hes real she stammered i thought he was a decoration on your earring ellasbeths father tensed a pixy he said taking a wary step back trent a burst of dust spilled from jenks to light my shoulder and i all but snapped this is my team i may be bringing on a vamp if i think it necessary if you have a complaint take it up with trent my backup can keep his mouth shut about your precious secret identities but if you show up for the wedding dressed like extras for some ridiculous movie it wont be my fault if someone figures it out ellasbeths mother was staring at jenks in fascination and the pixy had noticed redfaced he zipped from one side of me to the next in agitation finally landing on a shoulder clearly the pixy paranoia went from coast to coast and she hadnt seen one in a while i cant keep your butts above the grass without him i continued darting increasingly nervous glances at ellasbeths mom whose green eyes were bright and captivated and this overdone media circus is likely going to bring the weirdos out of the woodwork i stopped seeing as no one was listening mrs withon had blushed to look ten years younger one hand on her husbands shoulder as she failed to hide her desire to talk to jenks oh the hell with it i muttered under my breath then louder jenks why dont you escort the ladies into the church where its safer rache he whined mr withon pulled himself straighter ellie he warned and i reddened trent cleared his throat stepping forward he took my elbow in restraint disguising it as a companionable motion ms morgans commitment to her job is as obvious and upfront as her opinions he said dryly ive used her in the past and i trust her and her partners implicitly in sensitive matters used me thats about right i can keep a secret jenks muttered his fitfully moving wings shifting my hair mrs elf beamed at him and again i wondered at the possible species relationship elves and pixies might have had broken when the elves went underground jenkss kids loved ceri course they loved glenn too and i knew he was a human ellasbeth caught her fathers wary look her red lips compressing at her mothers charmed smile trenton dear the nasty woman said looping her arm back into her mothers im going to show my parents the interior of the cathedral while you instruct the help on their duties its such a quaint little church i honestly didnt know they made cathedrals this size i bit back my ire proud of the hollows basilica and i wasnt the help i was the person who was going to keep the rabble from taking potshots at them as they paraded their rich elf asses down main street that sounds equitable love trent said from beside me ill meet you inside ellasbeth leaned to give him a peck on the cheek and though he trailed a hand along her cheek as she moved away he didnt kiss her back heels clacking on the sidewalk she led her parents to the side door since the front was clearly locked send caroline in when she arrives she said over her shoulder effectively telling us to stay outside until the maid of honor got here that was fine with me ill do that trent called after them and the three elves turned the corner ellasbeth loudly telling her mother about the lovely little baptism pool her father was bent in conversation with her mother clearly berating her for her interest in jenks she wasnt listening almost walking sideways in her attempt to get a last look at jenks jenks was silent clearly embarrassed i though it odd since he charmed humans all the time why was it different when an elf liked him hey uh rachel he said the hum of his wings loud as he lifted to hover before my eyes im going to take a look around back in five thanks jenks but he was already gone his tiny body a speck darting over the spires i brought my eyes back to find quen waiting for me you expect me to believe a pixy is an effective backup he asked eyebrows high why do you have him out here are you trying to make the situation difficult somehow quens attitude didnt surprise me stifling my pique i headed to the side parking lot hell have the lowdown on the entire block in thirty seconds i told you youre doing yourself a disservice by keeping pixies out of your garden you should be begging for a clan to move in not lacing sticky web in your canopy theyre better sentries than geese the older elfs wrinkles slid into each other as he frowned he had come up on my left and with trent on my right i felt surrounded and you trust jenks quen asked i think it was the first time quen had called jenks by his name and i glanced at him as we rounded the corner and the traffic noise dulled implicitly no one said anything and embarrassed i blurted i cant protect you if you arent together or is this just a way to have someone pretty on your arm when you walk into a room no ms morgan trent said softly his bangs drifting in the slight breeze but seeing as the sun is up how much danger can we be in from a demon i dont expect lee to show and if he does it wont be until after dark he hesitated with a demon pulling his strings we couldnt very well go in after ellasbeth had told us to stay out and i wasnt eager to spend more time than i had to with her it seemed trent wasnt either so we drifted to a stop by the side stairs and the lessimposing secondary entrance off the parking lot my sandals scuffed against the white lines of the paintedon basketball court but quen was silent in his soft shoes i wanted a pair despite that they would leave me that much shorter you ah trust me in sensitive matters i said to trent what does that mean trent tracked a flock of pigeons blinking as they crossed the sun it means i trust you to keep your mouth shut but not to keep your fingers out of my desk quen shifted to stand almost out of my sight i turned to keep him in it that bothered you didnt it that i could sneak into your office i asked ears reddening trent glanced at me yes pleased i shifted my shoulders casual looked good on him and i wondered what hed look like in a burger joint with his elbows on the table and his hands wrapped around a half pound of beef he wasnt much older than me forced to grow up fast when his parents died i wanted to ask him if his kids would have pointed ears when they were born but i didnt i wont do it again i said suddenly not knowing why at that trent turned to face me break into my home is that a promise no but i wont quen cleared his throat to cover a chuckle green eyes fixed on mine trent nodded he didnt look happy and i was feeling sorry for him that he said ill believe quen stiffened but his attention was on the sky not me i put my hand up when i recognized jenkss wings rache he panted landing on my hand and grasping my thumb when he nearly fell off we got a problem coming down the road in a chevy better than a trip wire i said dryly to quen wondering if i should move my new cuffs from my shoulder bag to my hip then i asked jenks who is it denon the car in question came around the corner a powder blue convertible with the top open engine racing it pulled into the far end of the lot quen shifted from casual to protective pulse pounding i tapped a line the rush of power took me by surprise and i staggered im fine i said pushing trents arm off me stay behind me its lee trent said his face alight my god lee my mouth dropped open the car lurched to a halt parked ten feet away and cantwise to the lines trent stepped forward and i yanked him back lee escaped al the man turned off the car and pulled his head up smiling at the three of us and squinting from the sun leaving the keys in the ignition he opened the door and got out lee i stammered not believing it a rush of guilt swept me though i had tried to prevent it i had been there when al took lee as his familiar instead of me that he had escaped was impossible but here he was angling his trim surferboy body out of the car with an unconscious grace his small nose and thin lips gave him casual good looks and his asian heritage was obvious in the straight severely black hair cut short above his ears looking confident and cocky in a faintly frumpy black suit he strode forward with hands outstretched its not lee jenks said having moved himself to my shoulder he doesnt smell right and thats not a witchs aura rache that isnt lee shock became mistrust stay back i said jerking trent behind me when he moved he stumbled then caught his balance scowling he tugged his shirt straight the sun is up morgan i know a few rules about demons and that one you cant break lee escaped what did you expect hes an expert at ley line magic deal with the jealousy jealous i barked not believing this you want to bet your life on it lee was still coming forward and putting out a hand i shouted stop right there im telling you to stop lee obediently halted ten feet away his black hair gleaming in the light he drew a pair of round sunglasses from a pocket and perched them on his small nose hiding his brown eyes hands spread wide in innocence wronged he almost bowed good afternoon rachel mariana morgan you look eminently ravishable with the sun in your hair love the blood drained from my face and i took a faltering step backward it wasnt lee it was al the voice had been lees but the cadence and pronunciation were algaliarepts how holy crap its al jenks squeaked and his grip on my ear tightened get him in the church i hissed at quen feeling betrayed i almost panicked the sun was up this wasnt fair there was scuffling behind me and trents indignant complaint damn it i thought this isnt a committee decision get him out of here i yelled als smile widened he stepped toward us there wasnt time i lunged forward my forearms hitting the pavement my fingers brushing the white marking of the basketball court and my toes taking the rest of my body weight rhombus i shouted tears sprang up at the gravel cutting the soft part of my arms but with a welcoming drop of power through me the amber wash of everafter flowed up from the earth arching to a close over our heads hurt i let my knees touch the pavement and i slowly got up brushing my arms and palms free of grit damn it i had ruined ceris present i glanced first at alwho looked mildly insultedthen trent and quen safe inside my circle with me the older elf was stiff clearly not liking being in my bubblelarge as it was face tight he eyed the black smears of demon smut crawling over my ambertinted enclosure it looked particularly ugly in the sun and since quen was skilled in ley line magic he knew that the black was a reflection of what i had done to my souland the only way i could have gotten it that fast was by playing with demon magic angry i backed up still rubbing my arms i got it twisting a demon curse to save my boyfriends life i said in explanation i didnt kill anything i didnt hurt anyone quens face was empty of emotion you hurt yourself he said yeah i guess i did trent scuffed his feet thats not lee he whispered his face ashen jenks landed on my shoulderhaving flown off when i hit the ground good god the man is dumber than tinks dildo didnt i say it wasnt him did my lips not move and say it wasnt him im small not blind recovering his earlier aplomb al smiled trent retreated into quens protection away from me and al both al had mauled trent the same night the demon had first attacked me trent had a right to be afraid but the sun was up this could not be happening we all jumped when al poked a finger at my bubble and the black seemed to pool in the ripple he made no not lee the demon said yet it is him one hundred percent how i stammered had we been spelled into thinking it was daylight when it was really after sunset the sun al looked up taking off his glasses and basking in it it is splendidly pretty without the red sheen i quite like it his gaze fell to me and i shivered think about it one hundred percent lee but not lee that left only one possibility and whereas if someone had asked me monday i would have said it was impossible i now found it remarkably easy to believe after having shoved a demon out of my thoughts just three days ago youre possessing him i said feeling my stomach clench lee clapped his hands he was wearing white gloves and it looked wrong so very wrong you cant do that trent said from my elbow its a fairy tale al brushed a piece of nonexistent dust from himself no just very expensive and normally impossible its not supposed to last past sunup either but your father al looked from trent to me and back to trent he made lee special it had been mockingly sincere and i went cold lees blood could kindle demon magic so could mine ah swell just peachy damn keen but lee was smarter than this he knew that al couldnt hurt me and get away with it there was more we hadnt heard it all i could smell the clean scent of crushed green leaves and i realized trent was sweating you tricked him trent said the distress clear in his voice i didnt think it was fear for himself i think he was truly distressed that his childhood friend was alive and trapped in his own head by a demon al put his shades on i got the better end of the deal yes but im following it to the letter he wanted out i gave him his freedom in a manner of speaking lee trent said moving forward fight it he encouraged al laughed and i drew trent back lees gone i said feeling ill forget him yes listen to the witch al wiped his eye with an elegant hankie drawn from a pocket he wasnt using the everafter his sunglasses had been in a pocket too his abilities were diminished to lees it went along with what ceri had said about demons being no more powerful than a witch apart from several thousand years of storing charms and curses inside themselves if he was truly in lees body then he was limited to what lee could do until he brewed himself back to omnipotence very expensive normally impossible it added up to one person one crazy person newt did this didnt she jenks swore softly and al spun his anger looking wrong on lees face you are getting annoyingly perceptive he said i could have figured it out on my own then why didnt you i said fear tightening all my muscles you cant twist a curse complex enough to best the sun youre a hack i prodded and jenkss wings hummed rachel shut up he pleaded when al reddened but i forged ahead wanting to know why he was here my life might depend upon it you had to buy a curse from her i goaded how much did it cost al what do you want that youre too dumb to get on your own he stared at me through the shifting bands of color of my bubble and i stifled a shudder you the demon said chilling me if it gives me a shot at you then its worth my everlasting soul he intoned his voice sliding through me to leave the taste of lightning on my tongue i refused to back up almost numb my breath came and went and quens presence seemed to grow stronger you cant i said voice quavering you made a deal you or your agents cant hurt me this side of the lines lee knows that hed never agree als smile widened and when he tapped his dress shoes against the pavement in delight i saw he had lace on his socks which is why i will free him the instant before you expire so he is the one actually doing it he has reason enough on his own to want you dead so the agent clause wont come into play but killing you is the last thing i want to do gazing past me to where the sky met the basilicas towers he breathed deeply the moment i leave lee i am susceptible to summonings and such and much as i hate to miss the fall parties this is soooo much more fun dont think that makes you safe though he brought his gaze down and i shivered at the alienness hidden behind the normal brown orbs i can keep you alive through a tremendous amount of pain i swallowed yeah and you cant go misty to avoid my foot hitting your crotch either tilting his head al stepped back there is that who is newt trent said reminding me i wasnt alone and i jumped when he touched my elbow morgan i want to know right now if you practice demonology jenks darted from my shoulder anger hard on his tiny features rachel is not a practitioner he said hotly easily dodging quens attempts to get him away from trent quen dropped his hand probably only now realizing how dangerous a small flying thing with a sword could be trents eyes had never left mine trusting that jenks wouldnt hurt him his question had been laced with an iron demand for an answer fear lay under it but stronger than that was anger at me for dabbling in demons my eyes returned to al newt is a very old crazy demon i bought a trip home from her when your friend dumped me there her trent stammered panic sliding behind his green eyes there are no more female demons we killed the last few before leaving the everafter well you missed one i said but trent wasnt listening having been pulled aside by quen the older elf was very distressed and i wondered what was bothering him al being trapped in my circle the threat of jenks ellasbeths wedding being crashed by a demon all of the above but then my own fear started to tighten about my spine i had shoved newt out of my thoughts a few days ago shed been looking for the focus shit what if al wants it to pay off his new debt to her he had said the curse to do this was expensive was he the one killing the weres trying to find out who had it why are you really here i breathed if he was after the focus there wasnt much i could do to stop him once he realized i had it my question seemed to delight al and he simpered adjusting the cuffs of his gloves im here for my best friends wedding i would have thought that was obvious damn it it was the focus i had to call minias id rather get a mark removed for it not hang on to it until the school bully took it from me and i got nothing but if al got it it would hit the streets as soon as the sun went down sold to the highest bidder and there we would be with an inderland power struggle courtesy of me my pulse was fast but standing in this circle wasnt doing anyone any good ready jenks i said and the pixy dropped to hover beside me he nodded features tight as he shifted his grip upon his sword eyes narrowing i reached my hand out and broke the circle quen exploded into motion jerking trent behind him morgan he shouted and i rounded on him relax i snapped releasing some tension he isnt going to do anything hes here for a wedding i glanced at al seeming eminently controlled and still standing right where he had been if al wanted us dead wed be in the ground a week ago hes been here since the invitation hit lees mailbox pulse hammering i turned to al am i right eyes hidden behind his glasses the demon nodded hes harmless i continued as much to convince myself as trent and quen well not as lethal maybe if hes in lees body he doesnt have access to all the curses hes stored in himself over the past millennia hes only as good as lee iswas until he spends some time in the kitchen anyway and hes going to follow the rules of our society or hes going to end up in jail which wont be any fun forcing my jaw to relax i arched my eyebrows wishing i could do the oneeyebrow thingy will it i said al inclined his head and quen almost jumped him catching his movement in a sharp motion how fast you learn the demon said scowling at quens mistrust we must sit together at dinner we have so much to chat about go to hell i said softly this was a crappy birthday forty thousand notwithstanding not until i kill you and though i will its not going to happen today i like your yellow sun tugging up the sleeve to his jacket he glanced at his watch ill see you inside i do so want to meet your darling littlewomantobe trenton congratulations it is an honor to stand up with you his smile widened to show perfect simply dazzling teeth fitting he drawled i felt a chill as i remembered ceri oh man i had to call her al was loose steps jaunty al headed up the stairs to the door oohing and aahing at the architecture and detail work his body language looked wrong on lees body and with the strength of the ley line running through me i felt like i was going to throw up quen trent said clearly alarmed he cant go in there can he i pulled out my phone then put it away since keasley didnt have a phone and ivy wasnt home to relay a message to them he can i said remembering how newt had controlled me while i was on holy ground besides only the stage and altar are sanctified remember the basilica hadnt been fully sanctified since the turn to allow cincys more important denizens to partake of lifes little ceremonies the altars were still blessed just not the entryway and the pews we all watched al open the door turning he waved to us then passed the threshold the door shut behind them i waited for something to happen nothing did this isnt good quen said i choked back my burst of laughter knowing it would come out sounding hysterical we ah had better get in there before he does something to ellasbeth i said wondering if we might all go out for a beer first or a sixpack in the bahamas trent rocked into motion an instant before quen and with jenks on my shoulder again i fell into step beside him trent dropped his head for an instant then pulled it up to me you arent a demon practitioner he asked as we took the first steps up i put a hand to my stomach wondering if this day could get any worse no but they seem to practice me twentythree the twentyfourpiece band ellasbeth had hired was taking a break leaving the muted intensity of a single classical guitar as a pleasant background to the selfcongratulatory conversation at the far end of the table having long since lost my upright posture i had an elbow on the pristine linen tablecloth my fingers rolling the stem of my wineglass back and forth wondering if i could bill trent for the forty thousand even if al didnt do anything the rehearsal dinner had been way over the top i could have lived for a week on what had been put in front of me and the waste bothered me but that paled in comparison to my discomfort during the dinner conversation ellasbeth had shoved me quen and al as far from herself as she could i was sure if she could have gotten away with it the prickly woman would have put us in a different room al had earned his spot because of fear i out of spite and quen to keep an eye on both of us everyone at our end of the table was long gone the ring bearer and his parents the three flower girls and their folks the ushers and the woman who was going to sing were all laughing in a fawning circle about ellasbeth trent was sitting by her he looked tired maybe he should have taken more interest in the wedding arrangements and made sure that some of his friends were invited to balance out ellasbeths maybe he didnt have any friends right now als chair was vacant he having excused himself to go to the little boys room quen had gone with him and i didnt have anything to do until they returned i thought the idea of a demon using the facilities was odd and i wondered if al was a living being and used to it or if going to the can was a new and exciting experience jenks had spent the evening in the chandelier avoiding mrs withon i found myself hoping he might pix ellasbeth so we could leave tired i raised my glass and sipped my wine i was going to pay for it tomorrow but damn it was one of the best red wines id ever tasted i wouldve looked at the label but i knew it was far out of my reach even without the allergies my gaze slid to ellasbeth and i rolled the possibility around in my thoughts that she knew i was allergic to it and had served it intentionally as if feeling my gaze she turned to me smug as she chatted with her friends her face shifted expression for an instant when i heard als voice in the hallway the demon in lees body came in laughing with the band trailing behind him and i worried until i saw quen with him from the chandelier came jenkss soft wing chirp letting me know he had seen them quen met my eyes and i relaxed taking another sip of wine and setting it out of my reach it had surprised me how easy it was to work with the elf we complemented each other seeming to have found a comfortable body language that usually took me several runs with a person to develop i wasnt sure if that was good or not the band settled themselvespicking up seamlessly with soft forties jazz when the guitar endedand i clapped with the rest when a woman in a sequined gown started singing whats new i slumped back then started when i felt someones hand on my chair heart in my throat i spun my alarm falling into selfdisgust it was lee or al rather and his normallooking brown eyes glittered in amusement pulse still fast i sent my gaze to quen the older man smiled seemingly enjoying that i had been surprised what do you want i said shoving als gloved hand off the back of my chair his gaze lifted to touch upon the small dance floor as trent and ellasbeth moved to it great they were dancing id be here all night smiling like well the devil al gestured as if inviting me to dance my breath puffed out of me and i crossed my knees right no way was i going to dance with al lees striking asian features melted into a smile you have something better to do i have a proposition concerning that nasty mark of mine youre wearing my heart gave a pound then settled i felt every muscle tighten getting rid of my demon marks was high on my todo list but i was sure whatever he had in mind wouldnt do me any favors still talking to al here was better than doing this on the bus ride home or my kitchen or my bedroom if he decided to follow me i glanced up to jenks in the chandelier and the pixy shrugged his wings a dull orange why the hell not i muttered standing up thats the spirit al dropped back a step to elegantly offer his arm i thought about my splat gun then left it in my bag under the table no need to put it in als reach jenks is up there i said edging past al to reach the dance floor without his help you do anything funny and hell pix you oh im shivering in my little silk boxers al scoffed youve never been pixed i said and a frown crossed his brow making my guess that he couldnt go misty to avoid pain and discomfort seem likely my feet were on the parquet floor and he put out his hand waiting for me to take it suddenly i realized i was standing facetoface with a demonand he wanted to dance oookay i thought thinking my life couldnt get any more chancy al huffed impatiently and i slid my hand onto his the white cotton of his glove was soft and i stifled a shudder when his free hand went to my waist if he tried to get rid of the air between us i was going to slug him there he said when my hand lightly touched him and he shifted us into motion isnt this nice ceri danced very well i miss that nice it was as nerveracking as all hell my pulse was pounding and i was glad he had on the gloves not only because i didnt want to touch him but because i was starting to sweat he had said something about getting rid of my mark though so id listen what i croaked then cleared my throat embarrassed what do you want this is a rare opportunity al said smiling at me with lees beautiful teeth how often does one have the chance to dance with her savior amid the glitter of elves i sighed in impatience at least i told myself it was impatience the reality was i was starting to get a little lightheaded from not breathing im out here for one reason only i said moving stiffly with him in time with the music and if you dont start talking im going back to arranging the sugar packets als hand tightened on mine and he shifted my weight i hobbled when he spiraled me out to a swoop of music tense and gasping he yanked me back and i hit him a puff of burnt amber assailing me i pushed but he had me close eyes wide i tensed to stomp on his foot but my muscles went weak when he whispered i know you have the focus his breath moved my hair and this time when i struggled his grip loosened pulse hammering i put air between us his hand on mine pinched and conscious of people watching i put my hand back atop his waist i can smell it on you he murmured demon magic older than you older than me it marked your hand where you grasped it it stains everything you touch a trail that the knowing can follow like the dusting of prints i swallowed moving woodenly to the slow jazz im not giving it to you i said hardly breathing if i did itd be on the streets by sunrise you kill me and youll lose your lease on lees body and have to go back you hurt me and newt will put you in a bottle let go of me charm flowed from al looking wrong coming from lees body yes lets do that he said his voice wispy with distraction lets call newt she will show up right here and put me in a bottle youd like that wouldnt you i fought to not twist my fingers from him but i knew he wasnt going to call my bluff he was scared of her too besides i didnt know how to call her id have to go through minias and i knew he wouldnt agree to it whether he owed me a favor or not i want something he whispered his eyes finding mine and ill pay you well for it but its not the focus wouldnt you like that to be free of my mark to be free of me i stared at him as we danced he wanted something from me not the focus feeling ill i moved my hand to his shoulder my unfocused gaze on ellasbeth and trent shifted as al turned us i felt disconnected short of breath al leaned in and i did nothing numb i dont want the focus he breathed his words ruffling my hair but since you brought it up you are in a spot of trouble he hesitated coming even closer i can help you there jerked out of my thoughts i pulled back his gloved fingers gripped harder and his eyes were stern with the warning to stay where i was i dont think you can keep it a secret much longer he cautioned and you arent strong enough to hold it on your own once the world knows you have it what will you do silly girl dont call me that i said then went cold as i put it together he didnt want anyone knowing i had it damn he was the one killing the weres alarmed my eyes widened and i twisted my hand only to have his grip tighten until it hurt youre killing weres to keep it quiet that ive got it i said my dance movements going stiff you killed mr rays secretary and mrs sarongs accountant to warn them off throwing back his head al laughed eyes were on us but as in high school where the football star gets away with whatever he wants no one intervened frightened no al said confidence flowing from him as he reveled in the power he had simply by what he was im not killing them to protect you that is delightful i know who is though if they should find it they would have no qualms about killing you for it and that would really piss me off my first impetus to get away from him faltered you know whos killing the weres as he moved us to the music he nodded his black bangs had fallen before his eyes and i could tell it was bothering him but he wouldnt let go of me i didnt think he liked lees hair and i wondered how long it would be until he invested some kitchen time in making a curse to change his looks do you want to know who he said tossing his head to clear his vision ill tell you for an hour of your time first my mark and now the name of the murderer an hour of my time i said imagining how that hour might go thanks but no i said dryly ill figure it out for myself in time to do anything about the next death he mocked is a life worth sixty minutes of your time tensing i glared i wont feel guilty for that i said and why do you care it might be someone close to you he mocked and fear spiked through me even as the music changed and the singer started in with crazy he calls me i couldnt think as the music swelled and i moved without resistance when al danced us away from trent who was trying to eavesdrop on our conversation i need a favor al said lips barely moving and his voice heavy with embarrassment do this one thing and ill take the focus off your hands ill even promise to keep it until after you die youll never have to see the wars the pestilence he smiled sickening me its a nobrainer a golden age of peace that would last as long as i lived right as soon as he got it hed kill me with ceris help i might be able to make an ironclad deal to keep myself alive but it was a false hope and it made my chest hurt i wanted the simple answer so badly i managed to swallow as i danced with the demon of my futures past he said he didnt want the focus but would take it as a favor i moved woodenly as i thought something wasnt right i was missing something al said he liked it here but i could see that the loss of his omnipotence was chafing him there had to be a reason he was lowering himself to this fraction of strength and i didnt think it had to do with wanting a suntan he wanted a favor from me pulse settling to a hard beat i eyed him squarely squeezing his hand until he noticed what arent you telling me al the demon grimaced pulling my eyebrows high i made a telling face youre over here for a reason and its not me im not that big a pain and nothing is stopping you from dragging me off my words trailed to nothing as a thought trickled through me why hasnt he just dragged me off a smile quirked my lips and i aimed it at the suddenly unsure demon youre in trouble arent you i guessed knowing i was right when his smooth pace bobbled youre up crap creek and youre hiding on this side of the lines because they cant drag you back while youre possessing lee dont be inane al said but he was sweating i could see a bead of moisture at his temple and his hand gripping mine in its glove was getting damp im here to kill you slowly then do it i said boldly if you do youre back in the everafter you put yourself into a huge amount of debt to stay here when the sun is up the only one who knows is an insane demon who probably forgot about you already al frowned knowing i was pressing my luck i said what did you do forget to return a library book pain cramped my hand and i tried to pull from him its your fault al snarled the hate in his eyes stopping my protest newt found out ceri is running around under a yellow sun knowing how to spindle line energy and since ceri was my familiar im the one responsible let go i said twisting my fingers if i go back im going to be held accountable he said darkly squeezing you are hurting me i said let me go or im going to kick you in the nads als grip loosened i pulled away standing three feet from him and glaring as the band continued to play the singers voice becoming distracted and uneasy for an instant we stared at each other then he snatched up my hand and got us moving again forgive me he said not sounding at all apologetic im understandably upset i have never been in such a position before his eyes narrowed they dont know you know the same and its in your best interest to keep your mouth shut about it but you were there when she and i struck the deal and youre going to tell them that shes been bound to keep her mouth shut but for one child that the damage is contained my pulse was fast but his hold was again light the song ended and we seamlessly moved into the next one the pace slowing i dont stand a ghost of a chance figures arching my eyebrows high i made a telling face you want me to verify your story i said caustically they dont trust you why should i bother flashed over him and before i could react he pulled me into him my breath was a quick intake and i lost my bravado in a wash of icy fear oh al hissed threateningly his words shifting my wispy curls no need to get nasty he crushed me to him his heavy hand landing on the back of my neck adrenaline spiked i was playing with a tiger i was taunting a freaking demon behind me the band continued albeit shakily seeing my fear al split his lips in a nasty grin leaning into me he tilted his head and whispered it doesnt have to be this way his hand caressed my neck and i sucked in my breath hot need trilled through me sparking from neuron to neuron lighting a path to my core my knees buckled but i didnt move held in his grip he was playing upon my scar and doing it really really well my next breath was a harsh gasp i couldnt think it felt that good als breath mingled with mine uniting us when his breath swirled in my lungs the scent of burnt amber mixed with the delicious feeling he instilled forever melding the two did you think only vampires could play upon your scar al murmured and i shook when he rubbed his thumb against me we came first theyre only our shadows sstop it i said my eyes closing my pulse was a fast thrum i had to get away from this mmmm such beautiful skin he breathed and i shuddered youve been dabbling in a little vanity curse my dear it suits you go to hell i panted come with me and testify that ceri has agreed not to teach anyone but a daughter he insisted ill take away a mark ill give you a night of this a hundred vanity curses whatever you want rachel we dont have to be adversaries a moan feather light slipped from me youre crazier than newt if you think im going to trust you if you dont he said breath moist and hot on me ill kill you then youll never get what you want his grip clenched and finding strength in the knowledge that he was trying to dominate me my eyes flew open let go i demanded my hand balling up and pushing excuse me lee came trents voice from behind me the passion flowing through me cut off so fast i staggered groaning it hurt damn it having it ripped away so suddenly dizzy i turned though trent looked calm and confident on the surface i could tell he wasnt behind him quen watched from across the room tense but distant it was obvious he didnt approve of his sahan interfering you have monopolized ms morgan long enough trent said smiling may i cut in als gloved hand slipped from my neck i took a breath trying to expunge the last of the ecstasy he had drawn through me i stumbled feeling both numb and aliveunreal of course trenton the demon said placing my hand in trents i will console myself with talking to your beautiful bridetobe i wasnt breathing right and i blinked at trent as the warmth of his hand stole into mine but trent wasnt looking at me watch your step demon trent said his green eyes hardening with an ancient hatred we are not helpless als smile widened thats what makes it fun i jumped when al put a gloved hand on my shoulder and i cursed myself for it ill be in touch rachel he said voice full and throaty when he leaned closer ill sharpen my stakes i said pulling myself out of my shock his hand fell away and he walked off laughing jaunty and sure of himself and through it all the band played on i took a slow breath and brought my eyes to trents i didnt know what to feel i was frightened relieved grateful he hadnt needed to intervene i was supposed to be protecting him it was obvious he wanted to know what al and i had been discussing but there was no way in hell i was going to tell him still thank you i whispered a smile twitched at his lips his head bobbed slightly with the music three times and then he pulled me into motion yes well its not like i want to marry you he said my free hand rose as we moved and after a moment i placed it lightly on his shoulder trent didnt say anything and i started to relax my pulse slowed and i began seeing things again the scent of green leaves pushed out the stench of burnt amber and i abruptly realized i was utterly pliant in his arms letting him direct me about the floor without a thought in my head i met his eyes seeing my horror he chuckled you are a surprisingly fine dancer ms morgan he said thanks so are you did you take classes or is it an elf thing okay maybe that had been a little sharp but trent didnt take offense inclining his head gracefully a little of both my eyes darted to ellasbeth al was moving in on her but the woman didnt know it yet too intent on trying to kill me with her thoughts beside her her mother was trying to coax jenks down her husband was sitting sullenly beside her clearly having given up on trying to stop her and as i watched jenks left his post coming to a light landing before her even from here i could see he was embarrassed at the attention but he was slowly warming up trent twirled us so my back was to them and i looked at him i cant believe you didnt tell them about jenks i said his eyes flicked to mine and away i didnt think it mattered a chuckle escaped me and i found it did more than anything else to wash away the remnants of adrenaline your entire species has been shunning pixy contact for forty years and you dont think it matters i think you were afraid to tell them trent returned his eyes to mine no it was for the entertainment value i believed it he must be bored out of his everloving mind trent is there something about pixies that you like his hand on my waist pinched in warning excuse me i felt a stir of confirmation im just curious if theres an interspecies bond or something that youve been neglecting no that had been way too fast and i smiled he liked pixies but wasnt going to admit it it just seems as if no his movements went stiff and i backed off before he danced me over to al are you ready for sunday i said changing the subject wow married in the basilica i never thought that would happen me neither his voice was distant and emotionless it should be quite a day i ran my gaze down him i bet you wanted to get married outside huh under the trees in the moonlight trents ears reddened oh my god i said you do dont you his roving eyes never met mine its her wedding not mine needling trent was one of my favorite things and thinking that als showing up qualified as trouble and a pay increase i shrugged pleased that the day would end with money in my pocket i dont think its her wedding either we had made a full circuit and i was looking at ellasbeth again al had captured her attention and knowing that trent didnt like his back to them i moved freely under his direction until he could see them i wasnt fooling myself that he loved her but he clearly took his duties as husband seriously sure am glad im not royalty i muttered i wouldnt want to have to bump uglies with someone i cant stand on a regular basis and no one else ow i exclaimed trying to yank my fingers from trent but finding them caught then i colored realizing what id said oh sorry i stammered meaning it that was insensitive trents frown turned into a sly smirk bump uglies he said eyes on the table behind me you are a font of gutter slang rachel we must do this again the song had ended and i felt his hand start to slip from mine i glanced at ellasbeth uptight and glaring at me as al whispered in her ear the thought of the unending indifference trent would endure lay heavy on my mind and i licked my lips in a sudden decision i tightened my hold on his hand and trent eyed me suspiciously his attempt to rock away from me turned into a tug and we seamlessly stepped into sophisticated lady he spun me and i caught a glimpse of ellasbeth whitefaced as she listened to al she was a big girl she could take it it was obvious that trent had felt my desire to keep dancing and i wondered if he went along with it simply to bother ellasbeth my focus blurred and as trent kept silent with his own thoughts i found myself imagining his life with her i was sure they would be okay they would learn to love each other it would likely take only a few decades my gut tightened now or never ah trent i said and his gaze sharpened on me ive got someone i want you to meet can you come over tomorrow about four or so his eyebrows rose and without a hint showing that i was about to complicate his life beyond reason he chided me saying ms morgan your pulse has increased i licked my lips my feet moving by rote yeah so can you make it disbelief shone in his green eyes rachel he said irately im a little busy the song was at the refrain and i knew he wouldnt dance another with me you know that old card you have in your great room framed on the wall i blurted that got his attention and he took a slow breath the tarot cards nervous i nodded yes i know someone who looks like the person on the devil card trents expression went cold and his hand pressed heavy on my waist the devil card is this some sort of deal youve got going jeez trent i said insulted not the devil the woman hes dragging away oh his focus blurred as he thought that over and then he frowned that is in really bad taste even for you he thinks its a joke her name is ceri i said stumbling over my words she used to be als familiar before i rescued her she was born in the dark ages shes just started putting her life back together and is ready to meet whats left of her kin trent stopped and we stood unmoving on the dance floor shock showed in his eyes and if you hurt her i added my hands leaving him ill kill you i swear ill track you down like a dog and kill you his mouth snapped shut why are you telling me this he said his face pale and the scent of green leaves almost an assault im getting married in two days i put my hands on my hips what does your getting married have to do with anything i said not surprised he would consider himself first and foremost shes not a broodmare shes a woman with her own agenda and as much as it might surprise you i poked a finger at his chest it doesnt include the great and desirable trent kalamack she wants to meet you and give you whatever sample you need thats it emotions crossed his features too fast to be recognized then the wall came down and i shivered at the icy control saying nothing he turned on a heel and walked away i stared at him blinking hey does that mean you arent coming moving stiffly he crossed the room to talk to his parentsinlawtobe clearly trying to escape a prickling at the back of my neck pulled my attention to quen his eyebrows were high in question and i looked away before he decided to come over arms clasped about myself i headed for a back table where i could sit out the rest of the evening jenks landed on my earring in a gliding slide of gold sparkles his almost nonexistent weight comforting and familiar you told him about ceri he asked i nodded as the music ended the singers voice rising beautiful and alone jenkss wings fanned my neck what did he say sighing i sat down and started fiddling with the sugar packets nothing twentyfour my feet hurt and as i walked the last few blocks from the bus stop to my church i paused to lean against a maple to take my flats off a car whizzed by going way too fast and i scowled at it listening to the breaks squeal as it turned the corner jenks yelped in surprise from my shoulder when i bent at the waist to remove my shoes darting off in a clatter of wings hey he snapped the pixy dust sifting from him how about some warning witch i glanced up sorry i said wearily you were so quiet i forgot you were there his wing noise dulled and he returned to my shoulder thats because i was asleep he admitted my shoes hooked over two fingers i straightened the party had broken up early so all good elves could get home for their midnight siesta pixies kept to the same clocksleeping four hours around midnight and four again at noon no wonder jenks was tired the cracked sidewalk was warm against the soles of my feet and we made our way in the streetlightlit darkness toward the cheerful glow of the bulb illuminating the vampiric charms sign above the door in the distance a siren wailed the full moon wasnt due for a few days but the streets had been busy even here in the hollows not that id been listening but the gossip i caught on the bus was that the warehouse on vine had caught fire again the route home hadnt taken us anywhere near it but the number of is cruisers id seen had been astounding the few people on the bus had looked afraid for lack of a better word yet my thoughts were too full of my own troubles to strike up a conversation and jenks apparently had been asleep my feet were silent on the steps and i yanked open the door my gaze darting to the coat hooks in the hopes of seeing something of ivys hanging there nothing jenks sighed from my shoulder im calling her right now i said dropping my shoes by the door and swinging my shoulder bag around rache the pixy left me to hover where he could see my face its been a full day thats why im calling her the connection went through as i wandered into the sanctuary flicking on lights as i headed for the kitchen guilt whispered at me she couldnt have found out about kisten and me and even then i think she would have yelled at me before she left i think the sound of crickets joined the hum of jenkss dragonflylike wings as i thunked on the kitchen light squinting until my eyes adjusted to the glare ivys missing computer was depressing and i dropped my bag on the table to try to make it look less empty my cell phone rang until ivys phone told me it was going to voice mail and i disconnected before i got charged for the call i closed the top with a dull snap jenks was sitting atop his brine shrimp feet moving slightly as his wings hung still from worry if its not one of you its the other he said sourly hey im not the one who left last winter i said padding to the fridge for one of ivys bottled waters you really want to bring that up he snarled and i shook my head feeling guilty maybe shes with kisten i said cracking the plastic top and taking a swig i wasnt thirsty but it made me feel better as if ivy might come storming in demanding to know what i was doing drinking her water jenks rose into the air slowly unfolding to stand on the lid of his brine shrimp let me know if you hear something im calling it a night jhan is in charge if something comes up if you need me let him know my eyes widened he had his kid playing sentry jenks i questioned and he turned from the screen hovering by the pixy hole his shoulders lifted and dropped im going to spend some time with matalina he said and i worked hard to keep from smiling okay i said you want tomorrow off he shook his head then vaulted through the hole in the screen i stepped to the window leaning over the sink to watch him trail a green shimmer of dust to the stump in the garden then he was gone i was alone my eyes drifted to the cake ivy had made for me still unfrosted id had put foil on it this afternoon so it wouldnt dry out god this stinks refusing to let this become a pity party i yanked one of my spell books out from the shelf and headed into the sanctuary with my water and the tub of frosting i wasnt hungry but i needed something to do id watch local tv since the cable wouldnt stretch out here pretend to do some research then go to bed early jeez some birthday this had been is it my fault ivys gone i thought as i shuffled into the sanctuary damn it why did i let my emotions make my decisions no one had forced me to bite kisten i could have given him the caps back but ivy had no right to be upset he was my boyfriend besides she had said her kiss was a taste so i could decide what i wanted well i was trying to decide and kisten figured into that depressed i flopped into ivys cushy suede chair vampire incense puffed up and i breathed it deeply looking for solace far off i heard the bang of a transformer go and i waited for the lights to blink out they stayed lit happy for me but sad for the squirrel that had just bit the big one thanks to a zillion volts of electricity i opened my spell book and snatched up the remote it was almost midnight the news probably had something now about the fire the tv brightened and as the commercials blared and i ate a spoonful of frosting i called kisten nothing pizza piscarys was next and i listened to the recorded message of their business hours wondering why no one was answering they must really be busy my head tilted and i looked at the dark foyer i could just grab my keys and head over there but the presence of so many cops on the street had me worried about my suspended license there was another bang from outside closer this time and the lights flickered two squirrels i thought then frowned it was dark there wouldnt be any squirrels maybe someone was taking potshots at the streetlights again curious i set the frosting down and went to look out a window the thumping at the door brought me spinning around and ceri blew in rachel she exclaimed her heartshaped face worried rachel thank god she said coming forward and taking my hands i have to get you out of here what i said intelligently then looked past her when keasley trooped in the older black mans steps painfully quick despite his arthritis ceri whats the matter keasley bobbed his head at me then locked and barred the door hey i exclaimed ivy isnt in yet shes not coming the old witch said limping forward do you have a sleeping bag i stared at him no i lost it in the great saltdip of there was a lot i had lost during my is death threat and replacing my sleeping bag was low on the list and how do you know ivys not coming in i added ignoring that the old man headed down the hall and into my room hey i said again then turned to ceri when she gripped my arm whats the matter ceri pointed at the tv now a mishmash of noise and confusion hes out she said whitefaced al is walking this side of the lines free and under no ones compulsionwhether the sun is up or not immediately my shoulders eased god im sorry ceri i meant to tell you you really need to get a phone i know al was at trents rehearsal and dinner the elfs eyes widened its true she exclaimed and i cringed i was going to tell you as soon as i got home but i forgot i pleaded wondering how shed found out already but its okay hes not after anyone but me he can do the sun thing because he made a deal with lee to possess his body until lee kills me and thats not going to happen until hes done with me i couldnt tell her that the deal shed made with al was why he wanted me this time it would prey on her ceri hesitated doesnt lee killing you come under the him or his agents clause my stomach clenched and i glanced at keasley at the top of the hallway waiting for us with my summer comforter in his arms als going to free lee before he kills me and since lee has reason enough to want me dead the agent clause wont come into effect keasley dropped my pillow and comforter just inside the sanctuary before shuffling back down the hallway ceri took my arm and started to follow him we can discuss the intricacies of demon law later you have to get to hallowed ground exasperated i pulled from ceris grip im fine i protested if al was going to do anything he would have done it already hes not going to kill me at least not right away i looked at the tv mystified as to why everyone was freaking out then i looked closer they werent in front of the warehouse they were in front of a grocery store terrified people in vans and station wagons were looting the place the announcer seemed scared as she told people not to panic that the situation was under control uhhuh it sure looked under control there was a boom of sound and a flash of light and the pretty reporter swore falling into a crouch the camera panned to the gas station across the street another flash of light and i realized what had happened a ley line witch had just blasted someone trying to cut in front of him at the gas station the faint purple haze was still hanging in the air are you getting this the woman announcer cried out and my stomach felt queasy when the picture dipped the city is going crazy she shouted eyes wide the is has declared a state of martial law and all residents are told to remain inside buses will stop at midnight and anyone on the street will be incarcerated jake she shouted jumping when a loud bang shook her are you getting this jake was indeed getting it and i stared at people frantically filling their gas tanks i gasped when a frustrated driver rammed the car ahead of his to shove it forward a fight started and my mouth fell open when a ball of greentinted everafter blasted into the gas pump it exploded in a shower of orange and red the woman screamed and the camera fell my windows rattled and i turned to the dark street damn that had been close what in hell was going on so al was walking around i was the only one he wanted i dont get it i said gesturing he can only do what lee can hes not any more dangerous than your average deranged masochistic black ley line witch i hesitated taking in the fear coming through the tv okay i amended maybe a little screaming is in order but he can be brought down someone tried ceri tugged at me but i didnt budge fixated on the chaos he caused trouble at a dance establishment tonight and when the bouncers tried to get him out he killed them incinerated them right where they stood and set the place to flame then he banished the six witches the is sent to catch him into the everafter no one can stop him rachel and hes not under anyones control people are scared they want him gone he incinerated them i said my horror mixing with confusion all right maybe he is more powerful than i thought im the one he wants why is he doing this she turned from the tv her eyes wide and tried to get me to move what did he ask of you she asked and i licked my lips i hesitated then said to testify that you promised to not teach anyone how to spindle line energy i told him no and if he goes back without me theyre going to put him in jail ceris eyes closed her jaw clenching as she struggled to keep her fear and despair from showing im sorry she whispered her voice shaking hes trying to change your mind ive seen him do this before you and piscary are the only two people who have demonstrated the ability to control him and because you didnt circle him tonight everyone will think hes doing this with your blessing if you dont do what al wants hes going to turn the city against you what i yelped as keasley appeared in the hallway with three bottles of water and the dusty radio i had under the cupboards for when the power went out bring your phone he said shortly do you have extra batteries i couldnt think seeing my confusion he held up a twisted brown hand and went to look for himself ceri was tugging on me and i let her drag me to the top of the hallway this is not my problem i said starting to panic if i testify to get al out of cincy then im a demon practitioner and he kills me that much sooner and if i dont help him then im responsible for everyone he hurts or sends to the everafter she picked up my comforter and meeting my eyes nodded swell i couldnt win i could not win for losing damn it it wasnt fair but thats not the worst of it ceri said fear showing on her heartshaped face its all over the news that you had dinner with al you didnt take control of him so they let piscary out of jail to do it hes the only other person in cincy who can i stood for three seconds taking that in piscary is out oh shit jenks i shouted heading into the hall jenks is the backyard clear i had to get out of here it was dark the church was unsanctified my security had become a trap ceri followed me into the kitchen she looked miserable at my fear but i didnt care jenks i shouted again and he buzzed in his green robe furling what the hell do you want he snarled cant you spend one freaking night alone i blinked taken aback cincinnati is panicking because al is walking the streets with no one holding his leash i said six witches tried to circle him and he sent them into the everafter everyones afraid hes here to harvest familiars and because i didnt catch him tonight they let piscary out to get control of him is the backyard clear im going to be sleeping in the graveyard tonight and tomorrow and the day after hell maybe i ought to put up a little cottage jenks gaped at me face pale his mouth moved and he said softly ill check and he was gone good evening jenks ceri said to no one the back screen door slammed shut and keasley shuffled in lets go i put a hand to my stomach i have to call my mother do it from the graveyard ceri took my elbow and led me to the backdoor keasleys bent shadow went before us and i let them drag me out onto the wooden landing and into the night the backporch light was on and in its uncertain flicker i fumbled for my phone piscarys number glowed as the last line called and in a wash of fear i realized where ivy was she hadnt heard about kisten and me piscary had called her to him this was a setup al and piscary were working together as they had before piscary had called and she had gone to prepare for himlike the scion she was oh god i whispered my knees going weak as my bare feet found the cold grass ivy was with piscary right now ivy i shouted spinning to head back to the kitchen and my car keys rachel no keasley called he reached for me falling into a fit of coughing i leapt to the stairs jerking back when ceri took my shoulder shes a vampire the elf said eyes snapping in the dim light its a trap a lure al and piscary are working together you know its a trap shes my friend i protested get into the graveyard she demanded pointing as if i were a dog well deal with this in an orderly fashion orderly fashion i shot at her you know what that monster can do to her who do you think you are i shouted pushing her hand off me ceri fell back a step then her jaw clenched and i felt her tap a line i stiffened shes going to spell me dont you dare i exclaimed shoving her like we were two girls on the playground fighting over a piece of chalk ceri gasped falling down on her butt her eyes wide in shock as she looked up at me with her hair all over the place my face went red in embarrassment im sorry ceri i said shes my friend and piscary will screw her up i dont care if its a trap she needs me the elf gaped at me all her skills and magic forgotten in her confusion and affront that i had shoved her down keasley i said spinning to find him ill be back my words cut off as i saw him with my cherry red splat gun in his hands adrenaline jerked through me and i froze i cant let you knock me down he said the guns alignment unwavering from my chest i might break something he said then pulled the trigger as smooth and unhurried as a waltz i tensed to run but the puff of the escaping air shocked me ow i yelped as the stinging sensation hit me square in the chest and i looked down at the slivers of red plastic damn it keasley i said then collapsed out before my head hit the soft garden soil twentyfive is it supposed to take this long came jenkss voice buzzing as if from behind my eyes my shoulder hurt and i shifted my arm bringing my hand up to touch it i was soaking wet and surprise brought me awake taking a lungful of air i sat up my eyes flashing open ho there she is keasley said worry in his brown eyes as he backed up and straightened his leathery face was creased with wrinkles and he looked cold in his faded cloth coat the rising sun gave him a hazy glow and jenks hovered beside him both of them were watching me with concern as i slumped against a tombstone we were surrounded by pixies and their giggles sounded like wind chimes you spelled me i shouted and jenkss kids scattered with squeals i looked down realizing it was salt water dripping from my hair my nose my fingers and pooling in my underwear im a freaking mess keasleys ageworn expression eased i saved your life dropping the plastic fivegallon bucket onto the grass he extended a hand to help me up avoiding it i lurched to my feet before the water could seep farther damn it keasley i swore shaking my dripping hands and disgusted with myself thanks a helluva lot he snorted and jenks landed atop one of the nearby monuments the sun glinting prettily through his wings thanks a helluva lot he mocked what did i tell you oblivious clueless and bitchy you should have left her there till noon i tried to wring salt water out of my hair ticked off it had been almost eight years since anyone had nailed me like this my fingers froze and my attention jerked to the rest of the graveyard misty and golden in the rising sun wheres ceri keasley bent painfully to tuck a folding chair under his arm at home crying guilt hit me and i looked at the graveyards wall as if i could see his house through it im sorry i said remembering her shocked look when i had shoved her down oh god ivy i stiffened as if to run and jenks got in my face rocking me back no rachel he yelled this isnt some jackass movie if you go after piscary youre going to be dead you make one move to leave im gonna pix you then give you a lobotomy i ought to pix you anyway you stupid witch what the hell is wrong with you my urge to run to my car died he was right keasley was watching me with his hand hidden suspiciously in the wide pocket of his jacket my eyes rose from it to his face wrinkled with intelligence ceri had once called him a retired warrior i was way past believing her he had pulled that trigger last night with too much familiarity if i was going in to get ivy away from piscary i was going to have to plan it depressed i crossed my arms and leaned against the grave marker in the distance was a group of about ten people jumping the stone wall to get off the property i bristled then relaxed it was holy ground and i hadnt been the only one scared sorry about last night i said i wasnt thinking its just my mind flashed back to ivy last year numb as she lay shaking under her covers telling me how piscary had raped her mind and body in an effort to convince her to kill me my face went cold and i swallowed my fear is ceri okay i managed i had to get ivy away from him dark eyes sharp keasley harrumphed as if aware i was still teetering yes he said his bent posture shifting to hold his chair more firmly shes okay ive never seen her like this though embarrassed that she tried to stop you using her magic i shouldnt have shoved her stiffly i retrieved the radio and my pillow wet from dew actually that was one thing you did right the radio thunked into the empty bucket huh smirking jenks took flight rising forty feet straight up in the time it took my heart to beat he was doing a surveillance check bored with the conversation keasley dropped a coffeestained thermos into the bucket groaning as he straightened his back you knocked her down because she was going to use magic to stop you if you had reacted with your magic too now that would have been scary but you didnt showing a control she had forgotten to maintain shes wallowing in shame right now poor girl i stared not having realized it im glad you shoved her he mused shes been getting uppity these last few weeks i tucked a strand of dripping hair behind an ear cold it was still wrong i said and he patted my shoulder to send the scent of cheap coffee over me my gaze fell to my new red shirt the cotton holding the salt water like a sponge crap id be lucky if i hadnt ruined it plucking my comforter from where it hung over a tombstone i gave it a good shake dirt and last weeks grass clippings flew it was still warm from having been wrapped about my body and after draping it over me like a cloak i squinted in the hazy glare and tried to remember what time the sun rose in july i was usually asleep at this hour but id been out since midnight it was going to be a long day yawning keasley started to shuffle away with his chair i called your mother he said reaching into a pocket and handing me my phone shes fine things should settle down the radio said piscary captured al in a circle and banished him freeing mr saladan the damned vampire is a city hero he shook his graying head and i agreed freed lee from al not likely i tucked my phone into a pocket awkward because of the damp fabric thanks i said then met his dubious expression theyre working together arent they piscary and al i mean i said grabbing everything else and falling into place behind keasley his silvering hair shone in the sun as he nodded seems like a wise assumption a heavy sigh sifted through me the two of them had a long association both knowing that business was business and not caring that it had been als testimony that put piscary in away so now piscary was out of prison the city was safe but i was in trouble sounded about right i had my pillow under my arm my blanket draped over my shoulder and the bucket holding the radio and thermos in my hand catching my balance i said softly thank you for slowing me down last night he said nothing and i added i have to get her out of there keasley set an arthritic hand atop a stone as we passed halting you make one move toward piscary and ill plug you with another charm i scowled and with a toothy grin keasley handed me my splat gun ivy is a vampire rachel the old man said his mirth evaporating unless you start taking some responsibility you should accept that she is where she belongs and walk away my posture stiffened and i tugged my blanket up when it slipped just what in hell does that mean i snapped dropping the gun in with the radio keasley though smiled his narrow chest moving as he caught his breath either make your relationship official or let her go surprised i stared at him squinting in the strong morning light excuse me vampires have an unbreakable mindset he said putting an arm over my shoulder and starting us to the gate apart from the master vampires they physically need to look to someone stronger than them its hardwired in like weres and their alphas ivy looks powerful because there are so few people stronger than she piscarys one youre another my steps slow to match his grew even slower i cant best him despite what i wanted to do last night god it was embarrassing i deserved to have been downed by my own spell i never said you could beat piscary the old witch said as we helped each other over the uncertain footing of the graveyard i said you were stronger than him you can help ivy be who she wants but if she cant let go of her fear and make peace with her needs shes going to fall back to piscary i dont think shes decided yet i felt odd how do you figure that his wrinkles deepened because she didnt try to kill you last night my stomach clenched how come he can see things so clearly and im thicker than a cement wall must go along with the wiseoldman image we tried it once i said softly wanting to touch my neck she almost killed me she says the only way she can control her blood lust is if we mixed it with sex otherwise she loses control and id have to hurt her to get her to back off i cant keasley i wont mix the ecstasy of bloodletting with hurting her its wrong and sick my pulse had quickened from the foul thought that thats what piscary did and what he had turned her into i knew that my face was red but keasley didnt seem shocked when brought his attention up his brow pinched he gave me a pitying look youre in a spot arent you we passed the foothigh wall that divided the graveyard from the backyard pixies were everywhere the sunlight flashing on their wings this was really uncomfortable but who else could i talk to my mom so i said softly angling us to the tall gate that led to the street you think its my fault she went running to piscary because i cant bring myself to hurt her if she loses control and i wont sleep with her keasley grunted ivy thinks like a vampire you should start thinking like a witch you mean like a charm i offered recalling ivys aversion to them then flushed at the eagerness in my voice maybe one to mute her hunger or calm her without hurting her his head went up and down and i slowed our pace seeing him start to labor so what are you going to do he asked his hand landing on my shoulder i mean today plan something out and go get her i admitted i didnt know what to think anymore he was silent then if you try hell tighten his grip on her i went to protest and he pulled me to a stop facing me his dark eyes were thick with warning you walk in there and piscary will make her kill you trust her to get herself out piscary is her master but you are her friend and she still has her soul trust her i said shocked he thought i should do nothing i cant leave her there he bloodraped her the last time she said no when he told her to kill me a soft hand on my shoulder pushed us into motion trust her he said simply she trusts you his chest rose and fell in a sigh rachel if she walks away from piscary without someone to assume his protection the first undead vampire she runs into will use and abuse her like piscary isnt abusing her i scoffed she needs protection as much as you do he chided and if you cant give her that you shouldnt condemn her for sticking with the only person who can put that way it made sense but i didnt like it especially when if you thought about it piscary was protecting me through her oh swell give her a reason for her to get herself out and shell stand with you keasley said as we reached the wooden gate you know what that will make her no i said thinking it made me a coward he smiled at my sour expression then took his thermos out of the bucket it will make her into someone no one can manipulate its who she wants to be this is crap i said as he lifted the latch and the gate opened she needs my help snorting keasley propped the folding chair against the wall and shuffled over the threshold past him the street was quiet and damp with dew youve already helped her you gave her a choice besides piscary i dropped my eyes it wasnt enough i wasnt enough i couldnt protect her against the undead i couldnt protect myselfthinking i could protect her was ludicrous keasley paused in the threshold ill be honest with you he said i dont like the idea of samesex relationships it doesnt seem right to me and im too old to start thinking different but i do know youre happy here from what jenks tells me ivy is too which makes it hard for me to think youre making a mistake or that its wrong whatever you do if i knew the charm to curl up and die i would have used it as it was i watched my feet and moved forward to stand in the gate sort of like what i was doing in my life are you going after piscary he asked suddenly warm under my blanket i jiggled on my feet i want to smart decisions rachel he said with a sigh make smart decisions restlessness filled me as he headed to his tiredlooking house a few homes up the street keasley tell ceri im sorry for pushing her down i called after him he raised a hand to acknowledge me i will jenks dropped from the tree overhead to land atop the gate making me think hed been eavesdropping again i glanced at him then yelled to keasley can i come over later pausing at the curb to let the minivan belonging to the only human family on the street pass keasley smiled to show coffeestained teeth ill make lunch tuna sandwiches okay the minivan beeped and keasley returned the drivers wave i couldnt help my smile the elderly witch carefully stepped off the curb and started home head up and eyes scanning jenks rose when the gate thumped shut and with the splat gun rattling against the radio i made for the back door and where were you when keasley downed me i asked jenks tartly right behind him stupid who do you think told him what you stocked your splat gun with there wasnt much i could say to that sorry i took the porch steps juggling everything in my arms to manage the door jenks darted in to do a quick runthrough of the premises and remembering him in his robe last night i hollered is matalina okay shes fine he said swooping back in i wedged my soaked shoes off padding into the kitchen to leave wet prints as i dropped the bucket just inside it continuing on i headed to my bathroom to wash my comforter ceris upset huh i asked fishing to find out what had happened while i was out shes crushed he said landing on the raised lid as i punched buttons to get it going and youre going to have to wait the power is out cant you tell i hesitated only now realizing it was eerily quiet in here lacking the usual hum of computers fridge fans and everything else not doing too well am i i said remembering ceri gaping up at me her hair in disarray and her eyes wide in shock at my having shoved her ah we love you anyway jenks said taking flight the church is clear the front door is still bolted ive got some things to do in the garden just yell if you need me he lifted up and i smiled at him thanks jenks i said and he darted out the buzz of his wings obvious in the poweroutagesilenced air shoving my comforter into the washer i started to plan out my day shower eat debase myself to ceri call the holy guy and offer to have his baby if he would find a way to remove the blasphemy and resanctify the church prep some spells to storm the evilvampire fortress typical saturday stuff barefoot i wandered into the kitchen i couldnt make coffee with the power out but i could make tea and by the time i changed into something dry the water would be hot as i rattled around to get the kettle going my thoughts kept returning to piscary i was in big trouble i didnt think he had forgiven me for walloping him into unconsciousness with a chair leg and i had an ugly feeling i was still alive so he could use me to bring ivy in line when the timing was right even worse was my growing belief that he and al were working together this all was simply too convenient from what al had said i didnt think it was possible to summon and hold a demon in a circle if he was possessing someone so piscary had taken the credit for ridding cincy of its newest inderlander in what was probably a prearranged agreement for services rendered the master vampire had been pardoned for murdering those ley line witches last year it was aeon the entire thing was aeon my only question now was who had helped arranged it cause piscary couldnt safely summon a demon in prison someone had helped him set it up it just wasnt fair the biting scent of sulfur rose as i lit a match and got the burner going i held my breath as the smoke dissipated thinking if i didnt do something soon i was going to be dead either cincy would run me out on a rail for having dinner with al and then letting him incinerate bouncers and toss six witches into the everafter or mr ray and mrs sarong would band together and kill me for the focus or there was the yetundiscovered faction still trying to find out who had the thing according to al i had to get rid of it i didnt know how vampires had kept it quiet for so long hell theyd hidden it for half of forever before nick found it my face blanked and my motions slowed as i set the kettle on the flame vampires piscary i needed protection from everyone and his brother protection piscary specialized in what if i gave the focus to piscary in return for his freaking protection sure al and piscary worked together but vampire politics came before personal power plays and even if al did find out so what al was hiding over here once the focus was safe i could call minias and rat out al to get rid of him i could turn in my favor for that right then id be free of al and piscary both and the damned focus would again be safely hidden i stood in my kitchen staring at nothing elation and angst trickling through me id have to trust piscary to keep it in hiding not to mention giving up his desire to kill me but he thought in terms of centuries and i wasnt going to last that long vampires didnt want the status quo to change piscary had everything to gain if i gave it to him and the only thing he had to lose was revenge hell if i did this right i could get lee free and trent would owe me big time oh i whispered my knees feeling funny i like this the front doorbell bonged and i jerked rex was sitting in the kitchens thresholdstaring at meand i brushed past her if i was lucky it was ceri i had tea already going rache jenks said zipping in from who knew where his voice excited as i paced barefoot through the sanctuary youll never guess whos on the front steps ivy i thought my heart leaping but she would have just walked in i hesitated drawing my hand back from the door but jenks looked wound up glowing in the smothering darkness of the foyer with excitement not fear jenks i said in exasperation cut the twenty questions and tell me whos out there open it he said eyes bright and dust spilling from him youre clear tinks a disney whore this is great im going to get matalina hell im getting my kids rex had followed uspulled by jenks not meand with images of news cameras and vans i reached for the locking bar sliding it up and away nervous i looked down at myself fully aware of the disastrous image i made with my saltstained dripping hair a pixy by my side and a cat at my bare feet god i lived in a church but it wasnt a news crew on my front steps blinking at me in the sun it was trent twentysix surprise flickered over trent then vanished under the cool confidence of his sixhundreddollar suit and hundreddollar haircut quen stood on the walk below like a chaperone there was a fistsize pale blue package in trents hands the lid fastened with a matching bow lined in gold is this a bad time ms morgan trent said green eyes flicking from my bare feet to rex then back up to me it was friggin seven oclock i should be in bed right now and he knew it painfully conscious of my damp rumpled state i shook my stringy curls out of my eyes my thoughts zinged back to my idea to get lee free of al but he was here for ceri i had almost forgotten please tell me thats not for me i said gaze dropping to the gift and he flushed its for ceri he said his grayedged voice melting into the humid morning i wanted to give her something as a visible display of how pleased i am to find her visible display god trent had a crush on her before even meeting her lips pressed tight i crossed my arms over my chest but my toughchick image was being ruined by rex twining about my feet she didnt fool mei was a convenient rubbing post thats alland when she realized i was wet she gave me an insulted look and stalked away you didnt find ceri i said tartly i did can i come in he asked wearily he took a step forward but i didnt move and he stopped my attention flicked behind him to quen in his black outfit and shades they had brought the beemer instead of the limo good call ceri would be impressed look i said not wanting him in my church unless there was a reason i didnt think you were coming so i didnt say anything to her this really isnt the best time not with her crying the way she was im usually asleep right now why are you here so early i said four oclock trent took another step and i stiffened almost falling into a defensive stance quen twitched and trent rocked back he glanced behind him then rounded on me damn it rachel stop screwing with me he said jaw clenched i want to meet this woman call her my eyes widened ooooooh pushed a button did i my gaze rose to jenks sitting out of sight on the lintel inside and he shrugged jenks you want to see if she can come over he nodded and surprise showed on both trent and quen when he dropped down you bet shell probably want a minute to get her hair brushed and her face washed and put on a dress that doesnt have graveyard dirt on it quen trent ordered and my warning flags went up just jenks i said and quens softsoled shoes scuffed to a halt on the damp sidewalk the dark elf looked to trent for direction and i added quen park your little butt right here or nothings happening i didnt want quen over there keasley would never speak to me again jenks hovered waiting and trents eyebrows bunched weighing his options oh please test me i mocked and trent grimaced do it her way he said softly and jenks darted off gone in a flash of transparent wings see i said beaming that wasnt so hard from behind me came a chorus of highpitched giggles and trent blanched seeing him nervous i stepped aside you want to come in she might be a while you know how those thousandyearold princesses are trent glanced past the dark foyer abruptly reluctant quen took the steps two at a time brushing past me in a whiff of oak leaves and aftershave hey i snapped following him in trent pushed into motion and came in on my heels he didnt shut the door probably for a quick getaway and as trent drew to a halt in the middle of the sanctuary i ducked back into the foyer and yanked the door shut pixies squealed from the rafters and trent and quen warily watched them i plucked at my saltstained shirt and tried to find an air of nonchalance as i prepared to introduce his most holy pain in the ass to miss elf princess the hair on the back of my neck rose as i strolled past quen and flopped into my rolling chair parked beside my desk have a seat i said shifting back and forth and gesturing to ivys furniture still arranged in the inner corner of the church youre in luck we usually dont have our living room out here but were doing some remodeling trent looked at the gray suede couch and chairs and turned away glancing at my desk before moving on to ivys piano where interest pulled his eyebrows high ill stand he said rex strolled in from the dark foyer and headed right for quen much to my surprise the older elf crouched fondling the orange cats ears to make her flop onto her back to show her white belly quen rose with rex in his hands and the cats eyes slitted in pleasure as she purred stupid cat trent cleared his throat and my gaze shot to him rachel he said setting his gift on top of the closed piano do you make a habit of showering in your clothes my backandforth motion stopped i tried to think up a lie but that the power was out didnt lend itself for me to be damp i uh slept in the graveyard i said not wanting to tell him my neighbor had downed me with my own spell hoping trent might think it was dew a smirk came over him and somehow he made it look good he knew i was afraid of piscary you should have killed piscary when you had the opportunity he said his wonderful voice filling the open space of the sanctuary with the sound of grace and comfort damn the man had a beautiful voice i had almost forgotten and yes i could have killed piscary and probably gotten off with a plea of selfdefense but if i had the vampire wouldnt be around to hide the focus for me so i said nothing trent though apparently wanted to talk that doesnt explain why youre soaking wet he prompted my jaw clenched but then i forced myself to relax hell if ivy could do it i could too no i said cheerfully it doesnt carefully lowering himself to sit on the piano bench he inclined his head having trouble with your charms he said fishing for an answer absolutely not quen let rex drop to the floor and the cat shook herself making the little bell jenks had put on her jingle i watched trent fidget subtly reading in his slightly elevated color and his crisp enunciation how nervous he was my thoughts went to his anger when he had asked me to work security for his nuptials his blaming me for lees capture and installation as a demons familiar a twinge of guilt took me quickly suppressed but if i got lee free of al trent would owe me a big debt of gratitude one big enough that he might leave me alone ah i said hesitantly into the pixygiggleladen air and trent looked at me green eyes interested someone in the rafters shrieked when he or she got shoved off the beam and trents eyelid twitched feeling a smidgen of sympathy i stood and clapped my hands at the ceiling okay youve all stared enough time to go theres waxed paper behind the microwave go polish the steeple quen started when jenkss kids dropped down in a swirling maelstrom of silk and highpitched complaints it was jhan who took control and with his hands on his hips in a painful reminder of jenks he browbeat them all into the hallway thanks jhan i said i heard blue jays earlier be sure to watch for them yes ms morgan the pixy said seriously then darted out rex trailing under him there was a crash and a shriek from the kitchen then nothing wincing i moved to lean against the back of ivys couch quen looked at me expectantly and trent said arent you going to see what they broke my head shook i uh wanted to thank you again for interrupting al yesterday i said and my face warmed god al had practically pulled me into an orgasm right in front of every body trents attention flicked to the pixies in the side yard blurs through the stainedglassed windows and then his gaze came back to me no problem uncomfortable i crossed my arms over my chest really you didnt have to and i appreciate it quen shifted his weight and settled in and seeing his relaxed posture trent found a lessstiff position he still looked like a male model sitting at ivys baby grand i dont like bullies he said simply as if embarrassed i grimaced wishing ceri would hurry up a beep came from the kitchen and the whine of electronics hit my middle ear the lights winked on invisible in the bright sun and from behind me the tv slowly blossomed into noise scrambling for the remote i clicked it off embarrassment sprang up from nowhere and i got mad at myself i could feel trent evaluating me and my lifemy little tv ivys living room set my plantstrewn desk the twobedroom twobath church we lived inand it ticked me off that i was coming in so much shorter than his huge living room his bigscreen tv and his stereo system that filled a wall excuse me i muttered hearing the washer start to fill i bet trent didnt have to entertain with the chug chug of a whirlpool in the background flicking off the overhead lights as i went i stopped in my bathroom to open the washers lid it could soak then i did a quick check in ivys bathroom in case trent wanted to rifle through her medicine cabinet under the excuse of using the can it was neat and tidy the incenseandashes scent of vampire a dim hint under the orangeperfumed soap she used depressed now i headed to the kitchen to see if the lights were on my cell phone rang the electronic music blaring out to startle me scrambling for it i cursed jenks i usually had it on vibrate but someoneaka jenkshad monkeyed with it changing my ring tones fumbling to the tune of ive got a lovely bunch of coconuts i finally wrestled the thing out of my damp pocket real funny jenks ha ha it was glenns number and after a moments hesitation i leaned against the kitchen counter and flipped it open i had a bug to put in his ear hi glenn i said tightly he knew i was usually sleeping right about now i hear piscarys out it would have been nice if someone had told me the undead vampire i put in jail was free i could hear keyboards and a loud argument in the background glenns sigh was heavy over it sorry he said by way of greeting i left a message on your phone when i heard i never got it i said only slightly mollified then i grimaced look i didnt mean to bark at you but i spent the night in my graveyard and im a little cranky i wouldve called again glenn said and i heard papers being shuffled but when your demon burned down the warehouse using their bouncers as kindling we got swamped my demon i yelped phone pressed tight to my ear since when is al my demon i said softly remembering how well trent and quen could hear since you called him up to testify the fib officer covered the mouthpiece i heard something muttered and i stewed until he returned that doesnt explain why piscary is out i snarled what do you expect glenn said sounding annoyed neither the is nor the fib is equipped to deal with a demon who can walk under the sun you werent doing anything there was an emergency meeting of the city council and they let piscary out to deal with it he hesitated then im sorry they gave him a full pardon city council that meant trent had known hell hed been in on it what a total ass i had risked my soul to put piscary behind bars for killing ley line witches apparently that meant nothing it made me wonder why id even bothered this isnt why i called glenn said another body has turned up my thoughts were still on piscary apparently free to do whatever he wanted to my roommate and you want me to come down i said my hand to my forehead and my head bowed as i got angrier i told you im not an investigator im a haulthemin person besides i dont know whether i want to work for you anymore if youre just going to let murderers out when things get rough rough glenn exclaimed we had sixteen major fires last night five riots and a near lynching of some guy in a dress reading shakespeare in the park i dont think they even know the number of fender benders and assault charges its a demon you said yourself you spent the night hiding in your churchyard hey i snapped that was unfair i was hiding from piscary not al als burning things up to get me to go to the everafter with him and dont you dare sit there and call me a coward because i dont want to i was furiousmy anger fueled by guiltand i fumed until glenn muttered sorry all right then i huffed wrapping an arm around my middle and turning away from the hall this isnt my fault im not responsible for als actions at least hes gone glenn said no emotion in his voice i laughed bitterly no he isnt there was a moment of silence piscary said piscary and al are working together and you fell for it letting him out so now you have two monsters with free run of cincy not one my face twisted bitterly dont ask me to take care of them for you this time okay the background office noise filled my ear can you come down here anyway glenn finally said i want you to identify someone my heart clenched he had said there was another body suddenly piscary was the last thing on my mind david i said knees going weak cold though the sun shone in strong on my back through the kitchen window someone had killed him someone was killing weres looking for the focus and lots of people knew that david was my alpha god help me theyve killed him no glenn said and relief made my breath tremble in my lungs its a were by the name of brett markson he had your card in his wallet do you know him my brief elation that david was okay shifted to numb shock brett the were from mackinaw i slid to the floor my back against the sink cupboard my knees scrunching up rachel came glenns voice from far away you okay yeah i breathed no i amended ill come right down ceri i licked my lips and tried to swallow can you give me about an hour shower and eat maybe two ah damn it rachel did you really know this guy glenn said his voice guilty now im sorry i should have come over i looked up seeing ivys empty spot at the table no im fine he was an acquaintance i took a breath remembering the last time i saw brett hanging at the outskirts of my life trying to ease his way into my pack a powerful man looking for something to believe in its what seventhirty glen was saying ill send a car at noon unless you have your license i shook my head though he couldnt see it a car would be nice rachel are you okay there was a demon loose in the city a master vamp was out to get me my church was unsanctified and brett was dead im fine i said sounding wispy see you after noon numb i hung up the phone before he could say anything more it felt heavy in my hand and i stared at my spell books at eye level damn it this wasnt right i wiped my eyes and got to my feet feeling like everything had changed bare feet squeaking i headed into the sanctuary i came to a halt just past the top of the hallway trent was examining the stainedglass artwork and his shiny shoes caught the light when he turned quen was six feet away looking ready for anything trent im sorry i said thinking my face must be white when his eyebrows went high i cant do this right now i dont think ceri is going to come over anyway why he asked spinning on a heel to face me fully oh god they had killed brett i shoved her down last night i said and shes probably still upset about it brett was dead he was military how could someone kill him he was damned good at staying alive trent shook out the sleeves of his expensive suit and let out a disbelieving laugh you shoved her down do you know who she is i took a quick breath trying to hold myself together brett was dead because of me i know who she is but when someone pushes me i push back trent glanced at quen his face going tight my jaw clenched and i kept my breathing shallow i looked to the rafters for jenks trying not to cry someone had killed brett he had been only one step away from me i was so damned vulnerable all it would take was a sniper but i couldnt live in a cave this was crap purple fairy crap with green sparkles on it i trailed my hand along the wall as i went to sit in ivys chair the scent of vampire incense made me feel even worse i had to stop living my life as if it were a game i had to start buying insurance or i wouldnt live to hear my mother complain about the lack of grandchildren though it twisted my gut i was going to give piscary the focus to put into hiding to bribe him into not killing me then i was going to rescue lee to get al back where he belonged and trent off my case might as well start there i thought sitting up and taking a deep breath al i could take care of later after dark trent i said closing my eyes in a long blink as i felt my sense of right and wrong take a hit i think i might have a way to get lee free of al it wont cost you a dime but i want you to leave me alone i looked at him his face blank in wonder think you can you do that you said you couldnt get a familiar free from a demon he said his velveteen voice holding a rough edge i shrugged staring past him at the door and unfolding myself so i didnt look so miserable where do you think ceri came from his expression empty trent glanced at quen the dark elf blinked once with meaning im listening trent said warily this was where it would get sticky im going to try to swing a deal with piscary careful he mocked someone might think your blackandwhite outlook is going gray shut up i shouted at the billionaire feeling the sting im not breaking the law i have something he might want and once he has it i ought to be able to get rid of al safely and in such a way that will free lee but i want your word that youll leave me and the people i care about alone and i took a deep breath feeling like i was becoming one of them ill leave you and your business dealings alone i wanted to survive i wanted to live i had been playing in a sandbox with murders and casual killers with the arrogant innocence of a snowflake in hell the fib couldnt protect me the is wouldnt trent could kill me and i had to respect that even if i didnt respect him god who am i becoming youd stop trying to tag me trent said softly and then went still in unvoiced thought his lips parted and he looked at quen in wonder she has the focus he said to him then turned to me amused thats what youre going to give piscary you have the focus he said around his laugh i should have known it was you my face went cold and i felt my stomach drop oh shit i stood upright when quen shifted to stand between usmaneuvering stop i said my hand outstretched and he did heart pounding i held him off with my fingers splayed trying to figure it out trent was the one killing the weres you killed brett i said seeing him flush it was you i exclaimed dropping my hand and flushing in anger damn it what had i almost done what in hell was wrong with me this couldnt be happening i didnt kill him he killed himself trent said his jaw clenched before he could tell me you had it he finished hands behind his back quen was balanced with his weight on his toes his arms loose at his side as if in a dream i said to him you killed brett and mr rays secretary and mrs sarongs aide quens face darkened with guilt and his muscles tensed you sons of bitches i whispered not wanting to believe it cursing myself for wanting trent to be better than he was wanting both of them to be better than murderers and assassins i thought you had more honor than this quen the older elfs jaw clenched we didnt kill them trent said defending himself and i snorted with derision they committed suicide he insisted the devil in his perfect suit and perfect hair every last one of them none of them had to die they could have told me as if it made a difference they didnt know i had it trent took a step forward finger pointing and quen pulled him back this is a war rachel the younger man said tightly shaking off quens grip there will be casualties i stared at him in disbelief this is not a war this is you angling for more power god trent how much more do you need are you so insecure that you have to be king of the freaking world to feel safe i thought of my church and my friends and i lifted my chin yeah they had killed people but ivy was trying to get out and jenks had to in order to ensure his and his childrens survival and seeing as i had pretty much sacrificed lee in order to survive i couldnt claim i was pristine and pure either but id never killed for money or powerand neither had my friends my words hit trent and he reddened in shame or guilt how much do you want for it he said softly shocked i gaped at him you want to buy it i stammered trent licked his lips im a businessman and a murderer by hobby i accused or do you think the tenuous state of your species gives you the right to murder face showing his guilt and anger trent tugged his coat straight if he had brought out a checkbook i would have screamed anything rachel enough to make you safe you your mother jenks even ivy enough to have anything you want it sounded so easy but i didnt want to deal with him anymore piscary killed people but he didnt have the concept of pity or remorse it would be like telling a shark he was a bad fish and to stop eating people but trent he knew he was doing wrong and he did it anyway trent never dropped my eyes waiting i hated him i hated him to the bottom of my soul he was attractive and powerful and i had almost let that cloud my sense of right and wrong so he could kill me so what did that make it right to cut deals with him to keep myself safe why in hell should i trust him to honor to his word it was like making a deal with a demon or using a demon curse both were the easy way out the lazy way i wasnt going to use demon curses i wasnt going to make deals with demons i wasnt going to trust trent to honor his word he was a casual murderer who put his species above all others screw him quen knew what i was thinking and i saw him tense trent though wasnt so perceptive he was a business man not a warrior a slimy little businessman ill give you a quarter million for it trent said disgusting me my face twisted you dont get it pixy dust i said it would start a war if it got out im giving it to piscary so he can put it back into hiding hell kill you once he has it trent said quickly his beautiful voice thick with truth dont be a fool this time give it to me ill keep you safe im not going to start a war just bringing everything into balance balance i stepped forward stopping when quen mirrored me maybe the rest of inderland likes how things are balanced right now maybe its time for the elves to die out if theyre all like you and ellasbeth scrabbling for money and power maybe youve gone so far from your roots so far from grace and moral standing that youre already dead as a species dead and gone and good riddance i mocked while trent reddened if youre the model of what youre going to build your species with then we dont want you back we were not the ones who abandoned the everafter to the demons trent shouted anger pouring from him honest and raw the source of his drive flowing from him in a wave of frustration you left you left us to fight alone we made sacrifices while you turned tail and ran if im ruthless its because you made me that way son of a bitch you cant blame me for something my ancestors did trent grimaced ten percent of my portfolio he said seething sick bastard its not for sale get out fifteen percent thats a third of a billion get the hell out of my church trent gathered himself as if to speak then looked at his watch im sorry you feel that way he said his steps loud as he quickly retreated to the piano pocketing his gift for ceri he asked is it on the premises pretending it was just an idle question damn i went wiretight jenks i shouted finding my balance jhan get your dad but he was watching for blue jays like id told him to double damn quen was waiting for direction and sweat broke out over me trent brought his head up with what i hoped was regret in his eyes quen he said softly secure ms morgan well talk to ceri at a later date apparently shes not coming today do you have a memory potion oh god in the car sahan it was not a happy voice and i glanced at quen knowing what was going to happen good trent looked as unyielding as iron no memories means no loose ends well leave her sleeping and shell wake when someone picks her up for her trip to the morgue son of a bitch i whispered then looked to the empty rafters damn it why had i told them to leave jenks i shouted but there was no clatter of wings quen pulled a splat gun from the small of his back and i swore under my breath what is it i asked thinking of mine in the bucket by the back door if i moved hed shoot a little different being on the other end of the weapon isnt it trent mocked and it was all i could do to keep from screaming at him trent i backed up a step with my hands raised in placation quen handed the gun to trent you want her like that you shoot her yourself he said trent hefted the gun taking sight at me down its length i can do that he said then pulled the trigger hey i yelped when it hit me stinging and painful damn it twice in one day but i didnt collapse it wasnt a sleepytime charm trent didnt seem surprised when i didnt fall but simply stumbled back my impulse to flee coming far too late trent handed the weapon back to quen honor is expensive quen i dont pay you enough quen was not happy and i stared at them scared for what might happen next voice cold trent enunciated clearly rachel tell me where the focus is go to hell trents green eyes went wide quen looked me up and down in shock then relaxed almost laughing shes covered in salt water he said she said she pushed ceri down the woman obviously spelled her and rachels still wet from breaking the charm that wasnt quite what had happened but i wasnt going to enlighten him standing in my bare feet i started to get mad from trents question i was forming the distinct impression that trent had stocked his splat gun with subjugation charms illegal gray seeing as you didnt need to kill anything to make it but very very illegal trent made a puff of noise and tugged his sleeves down fine subdue her your way try not to leave any bruises no traces mean no reason to dig for missing memories okay not out of this yet pulse fast i fell into a fighting stance searching for the sound of pixy wings quen came forward his earlier indecision apparently having stemmed from using magic not force to assert his right to dominate seemed if i couldnt best him physically i deserved to be used and discarded quen i dont want to have to do this i warned remembering our last fight he would have creamed me if my roommates hadnt interfered get out or ill youll what trent said standing sideways by the piano with an infuriating smile on him turn us into butterflies you dont do black magic hands made into fists i steadied myself she doesnt came ceris voice from behind me in the hall and trents gaze shot over my shoulder but i do twentyseven damn it trent swore softly his eyes on ceri as quen halted the air seemed to crackle but then i realized it was jenkss wings the pixy hovered beside me waiting for direction i could feel ceri behind me but i couldnt take my eyes off quen standing with his lips parted and his arms slack at his sides in his black uniform slowly i straightened from my crouch ceri came forward smelling of soap in a fresh dress of purple and gold that hid her bare feet when she stopped beside me her crucifix rested easy against her and her confidence was absolute as was her anger uh ceri i said not knowing what else to do that man in the suit is trenton aloysius kalamack drug lord murderer and fortune member thats quen before him his security officer trent quen this is ceridwen merriam dulciate originally from the dark ages of europe lets get this party started trents face was white how long were you listening ceris narrow chin lifted long enough i blanched when i realized that the humming noise was coming from ceri and the black haze edging her fingers with their little butterfly bandages was magic waiting for direction oh crap uh rachel jenks said his voice high a shiver took me at her proud anger lets hang back jenks this might get nasty the warning slant to trents eyebrows told me he wanted to pretend nothing had happened so he could make ceris acquaintance without the ugly reality of his life intruding riiiiight multicolored sun coming in through the stainedglass windows added a surreal look to the standoff quen was by the piano and when the older elf stepped to join trent ceri calmly turned her gaze to him quen stopped seeing his acquiescence the black surrounding her hands vanished my shoulders eased when i felt her drop the ley line i knew she probably had enough everafter spindled in her head to blow the roof off the church but trent and quen didnt now that ive found you i see that rachel is right ceri said as she gracefully took the middle of the room her dress moving gently youre a demon i beg your pardon trents beautiful voice held more ire than confusion i didnt have a clue how this was going to end but i was glad to be out of the line of fire ceri noticed quen moving to mirror my position and she stiffened pale hair shifting as she cocked her head regally did rachel tell you i was a demons familiar before she rescued me she said to trent seeing his understanding she continued i know demons very well and thats what they do they offer you something that looks out of your reach in exchange for something they want that is out of theirs theyre called businessmen here youre very good his face reddened this is not how i wanted to make your acquaintance ill bet ceri said the modern phrase and the sarcasm with which she said it were shocking proud and collected in his tailored suit trent fingered his gift and came closer hiding his tension under a practiced calm learned in the boardroom i couldnt help but be impressed with his determination to try to salvage something from this i brought you a gift he said extending the wrapped box a show of thanks for your cellular sample jenks landed on my shoulder the man has more balls than a prize bull he muttered and the rims of ceris ears colored she didnt take it and trent finally set it atop the piano ignoring him ceri turned to quen you hesitated to attack rachel at first why quen blinked clearly not expecting this rachels strongest defensive abilities are in her physical skills not her magic he said his gravelly voice blending beautifully with ceris smooth perfect tones im proficient with both and it wouldnt be honorable to defeat her using something she cant defend against when i can assert my will where she has a chance to meet me equally from my shoulder came jenkss loud comment piss on my daisies i knew there was something i liked about the little cookie maker thats important to you ceri questioned regally ignoring jenkss comment quen dropped his head but his eyes were unrepentant from beneath his dark bangs trent shifted his feet i knew it was a ploy to bring her attention to him but ceri smiled at quen there is a spark of us left she said then took a breath as if readying herself for a difficult task outside pixies plastered themselves against the glass and i felt a stab of nervousness when ceri returned her focus to trent seeing them together i was struck by how much they looked alike their hair was that same fine almosttransparent blond their features both had the same delicate yet firm cast slim without losing strength strength without sacrificing beauty ive been watching you for some time ceri said softly youre very confusing very confused you have forgotten nothing but you dont know how to use it trents expression almost hid his anger almost mai sahan ceris breath hissed and she dropped back a step dress furling to show her bare feet dont she said complexion a delicate rose not from you quen twitched when she reached for her waistband and she froze him with a look as she pulled a swab in a torn cellophane package from it i recognized it as one of mine i came to give you this she said handing it to trent but since i have your attention jenkss wings made spurts of cool wind on my neck and the tension escalated ceri tapped a line and her hair shifted in a breeze that touched only her i thought i sensed a metallic taste on my tongue my face cold i looked over the sanctuary as if expecting a demon to melt into existence but then my gaze fell upon ceri and i blanched holy crapjenks breathed his wings going absolutely motionless ceri had gone deathly still gathering intent and power about her as if supplementing her damaged aura her undeniable beauty was like that of a fairy savage and pale face hollow hard and unyielding quen didnt move as she closed in on trent near enough that her hair mingled with his near enough that she could pull his aura into her as she breathed i am black she said and a shudder rippled through me i am foul with a thousand years of demon curses dont cross me or i will bring you and your house down rachel is the only clean thing i have and you wont sully her to further your high ideas understand a hard expression replaced trents shock reminding me of who he was and what he was capable of youre not who i though you would be he said and ceri let a cruel smile curve the corners of her mouth im your worst nightmare come to walk this side of the lines im an elf trent something youve forgotten how to be youre scared of black magic i can see fear shimmering under your aura like sweat i live and breathe black magic im so tainted with it that i will use it without thought without guilt and without hesitation she stepped forward into his space and trent moved back leave rachel alone she said the words soft as rain and as commanding as a gods ceri reached to touch him and in a blinding fast motion quen bolted forward i took a breath to shout a warning but ceri spun a hurling black ball of everafter finire ceri i exclaimed then cowered when it hit the circle quen flung up and exploded into black sparkles clearly ticked ceri strode to quen latin spilling from her like black smoke quis custodiot ipsos custodies she said wrathfully then plunged a tiny white fist into his circle quen stared in shock as his circle fell finire ceri said tightly reaching for him and when quen grasped her wrist to do something he froze then dropped to the hardwood floor out cold holy crap jenks chirped from the rafters and ceri looked away from quen anger made her pale beauty terrible ceri i coaxed then stopped when she rounded on me shut up she said long hair flying im angry at you too no one has ever shoved me before in my entire life mouth open i looked at trent the shocked billionaire was backing to the door excuse me he said this was a mistake if you will release quen ill leave ceri spun to him my apologies for keeping you from your next appointment youre a very busy man she said caustically then turned her attention to quen slumped on the floor is he a good person she asked abruptly trent paused and the metallic stench tickling my nose grew stronger yes you should listen to him more often she said crouching before him her dress pooled like water turned to silk thats why we have others around us jenks dropped down to me and i wondered if ceri thought of me like that sort of a servant with whom to talk things over trents eyes pinched in worry as ceri muttered latin and a black shimmer of everafter coated quen he snorted the black splintering away to silver threads when his eyes opened scrambling up he stood while ceri found her feet with more grace it was obvious by his chagrined expression that he was surprised and humbled i couldnt help but feel bad for the man ceri was a handful even when she wasnt pushing us around did you see what i did she asked him seriously and quen nodded his green eyes fixed upon her as if seeing his salvation can you do it she asked him next glancing at trent he nodded i can now that ive seen you do it he said guiltily but ceri smiled in delight he didnt know you practice the dark arts did he quen looked down then blinked when he realized she was barefoot no mai sahan he said softly and trent shifted uncomfortably ceri laughed the wonderful sound cascading over me like cool water perhaps we are alive yet she said touching the top of his hand as if they were old friends keep him safe if you can hes an idiot trent cleared his throat but they were lost in each others attention its what he was made into mai sahan quen said kissing the top of her hand the gesture full of grace he had no choice ceri sniffed as she drew her hand from quen well he does now she said saucily see if you cant remind him of who and what he is with a respectful nod quen turned to me i too was given that same head bob but mine was accompanied by a smirk i couldnt decipher jenks sighed from my shoulder and i found myself rocking back off the balls of my toes it seemed to be over just a minute i said jiggling on my feet dont leave yet ceri dont let them leave both men froze when ceri smiled at them and i jogged into my room snatching the two garment bags i hustled back i was alive check still had the focuscheck introduced trent and cericheck im kind of hungry wonder what ive got in the fridge my eyes widened now that i realized what that metallic stench was damn it i had left the kettle over the flame and it had gone dry here i said dumping the two dresses into trents arms im not working your lameass wedding id refund your money but you havent given me any trents face was murderously furious and he dropped them on the floor turning on a heel he stiffly walked out the door leaving it open behind him i heard his feet on the sidewalk and the sound of a car door opening and shutting then nothing quen made an elegant bow to ceri who drew her dress up and curtsied back shocking me hesitating quen bowed again to me and i gave him a sloppy seeyoulater salute like i could curtsy his dark face smiling quen followed trent out and quietly shut the door my exhaled breath seemed to be very loud holy crap jenks said leaving my shoulder to make circles around ceri that was the damnedest thing ive ever seen as if it had been a signal the sanctuary was abruptly pixyfilled my head started to hurt and though i was obviously happy with how this had ended i was worried too i had to get rid of the focus as soon as possible ceri i said waving pixy kids from my path as i flung the discarded dresses over the back of the couch and hotfooted it into the kitchen to turn off the burner just what am i to you anyway she had followed me and i was surprised to see trents gift in her hand when i glanced over my shoulder my friend she said simply the stink was awful in the kitchen and i wedged the window higher see this was why i liked coffee you couldnt screw up making coffee even the bad stuff was good using a hot pad i moved the black kettle to the sink the pops of superheated water startling me when the kettle hit the damp porcelain you want some coffee i said at a loss for what to do i knew shed rather have tea but not made in something so dirty on the outside i like him she said wistfully and i spun shocked at the shy tone quen i stammered remembering him kiss her hand she was standing in the threshold to the kitchen a dreamy look on her face where a powerful anger had just been no she said as if mystified at my confusion trent hes so deliciously innocent and with all that power i stared at her as she took the lid off the gift box he had left and plucked an opal the size of a chickens egg from it holding it up to the light she sighed trenton aloysius kalamack twentyeight the sun had shifted across to the far wall of the kitchen and i sat at the table wearing one of jenkss humansize shirts over a black chemise i had it on for the comfort factor i wasnt looking forward to going to the morgue again to my left was that jar of jalapeño salsa and a tomato for glenn to my right a cup of longcold coffee sat beside my cell and the land line neither one was ringing it was a quarter after noon and glenn was late i hated waiting leaning closer to the table i eased another coat of clear polish over my index fingernail the odor of acetone mixed with the scent of the herbs hanging over the center island counter and the sound of jenkss kids was a balm as they played hideandseek in the garden three more pixies were braiding my hair jenks playing supervisor to prevent a repeat of the snarl incident no not that way jeremy jenks said and i stiffened you go under jocelynn then over janice before you do the double back there thats it got the pattern a weary chorus of yes dad brought a smile to my face and i tried not to move as i painted my thumbnail i could hardly feel the tugs on my hair as they worked finished i capped the bottle and held my hand up for inspection a deep almost maroon red i brought my hand closer noticing that the faint scar on my knuckle was gone undoubtedly erased along with my freckles after id used that demon curse to were this spring id gotten the scar from falling through the screen door when i had been ten robbie had pushed me and after he dried my tears and put a bandage on it i suckerpunched him in the gut which sort of left me wondering if ceri would be landing one on me when i least expected it robbie and i had come up with this wild story that the neighbors dog had tried to jump through it looking back now i was sure mom and dad knew that the black lab had nothing to do with the broken screen but they hadnt said anything probably proud that wed settled our differences then hung together to escape punishment i rubbed my thumb against the smooth skin of my finger sad the scar was gone the draft from jenkss wings brushed my hand what are you smiling about my gaze fell upon my phone and i wondered if robbie would return my call if i left a message i wasnt working for the is anymore i was thinking about my brother that is so weird jenks said one brother i had twentyfour when i left focus blurring i tightened the cap on the polish thinking that when he had left home it had been as if they had died he knew it was a oneway trip to cincy he was stronger than i ow i yelped when someone pulled too hard my hand came up to my head and i turned sending them whirling up in silk and dust the polish was still tacky and i froze okay get out jenks said authoritatively all of you youre just playing now go on jeremy check on your mother i can finish ms morgans hair go on the three of them rose up in complaint and he pointed still protesting they flew backward to the screen all talking at once apologizing and pleading wringing their hands and twisting their pretty little faces into sad expressions that tugged on my heart out jenks demanded and one by one they slipped into the garden someone giggled and they were gone sorry rache he said flitting behind me hold still jenks its fine ill just take it out get your hands out of your hair he muttered your polish isnt dry and you arent going out with a halfassed braid you dont think i know how to braid hair tinks little red shoes im old enough to be your father he wasnt but i set my hand on the table and settled back feeling soft tugs as he finished what his children had started a heavy sigh shifted me and jenks asked now what his tone unusually gruff to cover his embarrassment over messing with my hair the sound of his wings was pleasant and i could smell oak leaves and queen annes lace my gaze went to ivys empty space and the sound of his wings dropped in pitch you going to get her out he asked softly he had reached the ends of my hair and i slowly leaned forward pillowing my head on my folded arms im worried jenks jenks harrumphed at least she didnt leave because you bit kisten i suppose i said the warmth of my breath coming back to me from the old wood there was a final tug and jenks flew to land on the table before me i sat upright to feel the heavy weight of my braid his tiny features pinched she may not want to leave piscary my hand rose and fell in a gesture of frustration so im supposed to leave her there looking tired jenks sat crosslegged beside my abandoned coffee mug i dont like it either but hes her master vampirethe one that protects her and screws with her mind bothered i rubbed at a nail smoothing out a nick before the polish finished setting you think youre strong enough to protect her against an undead master vampire jenks asked i thought back to my conversation with keasley in the garden no i whispered glancing at the clock where the devil is glenn jenkss wings blurred and he rose four inches still sitting crossedlegged then let her get herself out shell be all right damn it jenks he started to laugh which ticked me off there is nothing funny about this i said and smirking jenks landed on the table i had this same conversation with ivy about you up in mackinaw shell be all right my eyes went to the clock if she isnt ill kill him no you wont jenks said and i flicked my gaze to him no i wouldnt piscary kept ivy safe from predation when she came home id make her a cup of cocoa listen to her cry and this time damn it id hold her and tell her it was going to be okay vampire culture sucks my eyes blurred and i jumped when the front bell rang there he is i said chair scraping as i stood and yanked the waistband of my jeans up jenkss wings were a subdued hum as i grabbed my phone and dropped it into my bag my thoughts went to piscary and i added my splat gun then i thought about trent and i dropped the focus in there too checking to see if id marred my nails i slid the jar into my arms and picked up the tomato ready jenks i said with a forced cheerfulness yup he said then shouted jhan the seriousminded pixy came in so fast i was sure hed been on the gutters outside the window watch your mother jenks said you know how to use my phone yes dad the eightyearold said and jenks put a hand on his shoulder call ms morgan if you need to reach me dont look for me use the phone got it yes daaaaad this time it carried a heavy exasperation and i smiled though i was dying inside jhan was assuming more responsibility to take his dads place in the next few years pixy life spans suck jenks i said as i shifted the jar of sauce to my hip its noon if you want to sit this one out thats fine i know you nap this time of day im fine rachel he said darkly lets go to insist would only tick him off so we headed out my vampmade boots clumped on the hardwood floor of the sanctuary and after setting the jar on the table by the door i fumbled in my bag for my sunglasses i wrangled them on onehanded and pulled the door open i got that sauce you wanted glenn i said then looked up i was getting tired of finding unexpected people on my stoop maybe i ought to spend an afternoon with a drill and put in one of those peepholes how expensive could they be hey david whats up i said taking him in he was out of his usual suit wearing a soft gray suede tuckin shirt and pair of jeans instead his face was absolutely cleanshaven and a long dull scratch marked his cheek and neck behind him at the curb his gray sports car idled rachel his quick gaze darted to jenks jenks he added standing a step back the usually collected were took a steadying breath reaching to straighten his missing jacket his hand clenched as if reaching for the handle of his briefcase my worry intensified what i said expecting the worst david looked behind him at his car i need your help serena my girlfriend needs a heavy painkiller his eyes were pinched when they met mine i would have phoned but i think the fib has tapped my line she wered rachel my god she actually wered holy crap jenks said tense i took my shades off and set the tomato down beside the sauce the full moon isnt until monday thats when the others first wered his head bobbing david fidgeted i told her about the women in the morgue i told her i was sorry and that she probably wouldnt be able to stop from wereing on monday unless she gained some control over it between now and then brown eyes pleading for forgiveness he added so i walked her through it or i tried shes not built for it he said his voice cracking weres came from humans but weve evolved apart from them for too long its not supposed to hurt this bad she is in too much pain do you have a charm a potion anything lately id begun carrying pain amulets in my bag like some people have breath mints i have three with me right now i said reaching behind me to shut the door lets go david took the steps two at a time jenks was a flash of wings and i brought up the rear slipping into the passengers side as david slammed his door shut i thought that a curse that turned humans into weres was stupid if it hurt too much to be of any use but then again the focus enabled alphas to pack together to eliminate the pain of shifting so maybe there was some sense to it hey i protested when the car started moving before i had my door shut ignoring me david scanned the street as i buckled myself in bracing against the dash when he took a corner too fast weres had excellent reflexes but this was pushing it david slow down ive doped her up on bane he said managing the wheel with one hand as he fastened his belt with the other i cant let her wake up and find me gone the pain is killing her i dont think its going to stop until she turns back this was a mistake god what have i done my fingers felt the outline of the focus in its leadlined bag i didnt think the artifact was going to help the dulling of pain happened when were packs combined into a round the focus only allowed them to do it more efficiently david slow down i repeated when he came out onto a oneway driving like he was in the indy jenks hugged the stem of the rearview mirror he looked a little green the is is watching for me i added they usually have a cruiser in the church up on the right david slowed a shaky hand on the wheel the lot was empty and he picked up speed what do you mean the fib has tapped your line i asked as we got on the interstate to cross the river from the hollows to cincinnati they cant do that they did david said grimly officer glenn thinks im responsible for the were deaths not just the suicides but all of them thinks im a jack the ripper meets mr hyde i made a scoffing bark of laughter then tensed when he darted across the path of a semi its trent i said in the fading adrenaline he told me himself and watch what youre doing god youre a worse driver than ivy david gave me a quick look trent kalamack what for jenkss wings were an odd shade of green hes after the focus the ill pixy said he found out this morning that rachel has it damn me back to my mothers bitch david swore softly do you have it is it safe my head bobbed im going to give it to piscary to put it back into hiding rachel david exclaimed and i pointed to the truck stopped at the red light just off the bridge i cant keep it safe i said as he hit the brakes what am i supposed to do with it i dont have enough magic to hide it once someone knows ive got it at least piscary has enough clout to keep people from drugging him into telling where it is davids eyes were worried but it belongs to the weres the light changed and i held my breath until i was sure david wasnt going to dart around the truck ahead of us but the usually ubersafetyconscious were just fumed at the slow acceleration believe me i said softly if there was a way i could give it to the weres i would but its demoncrafted and all its going to do is cause problems change is needed but slow not fast otherwise i thought of his girlfriends pain a were should hide it then he offered who david i demanded frustrated and jenkss wings shifted nervously you we tried that mr ray mrs sarong how about vincent he had three packs bound to him and they were savage every one of them channeling the power of an alpha but lacking the restraint that evolved with the alpha position silently his jaw clenched and i continued you dont become an alpha youre born that way they couldnt handle it change has to come slow its like your girlfriend trying to were without the mental and physical cushion a thousand years of evolution gave you davids grip on the wheel eased and i relaxed maybe its not time yet i said softly bracing myself as he made a quick right into his apartment complex ah that doesnt look good jenks said and davids face went empty of emotion i followed their gazes to the parking lot and my stomach sank there were two is cruisers three from the fib and a multispecies ambulance its okay i said reaching for my seat belt i dont think theyre at your apartment saying nothing david pulled up as close as he could get fumbling with his seat belt swearing until it released its my apartment my curtains were closed theyre open now and serena couldnt be awake yet leaving the keys in the ignition he lurched out of the car steps crisp and intent as he headed for his door i slowly got out to stand wedged between the car and the open door my arms on the roof jenks landed on my shoulder and we said nothing when an is officer stopped david on the threshold they spoke briefly and i felt sick as the man cuffed him david looked broken but offered no resistance knowing that to fight would give them a reason to throw him in a cell and forget about him to the limit of the law someone moved past the upstairs window and i gripped my bag tighter glad i had the focus since the is was taking the opportunity to search davids apartment his cat was watching me from a second window and it skittered away before a dark figure passed by it what are we going to do jenks i whispered jenkss wings cooled my neck and i squinted in the glare as they bundled david into a cruiser jenks i said and the pitch of the pixys wings shifted see you back at the church he said darting off to eavesdrop on them i held my breath as he hovered over the lot dropping like a stone to dart inside the cruiser with david when no one was looking i wished him well as the cruiser eased forward hesitating briefly before pulling into traffic bye david my breath slipped from me long and slow leaning into the car i retrieved davids keys and dropped them in my bag id find another way home but id need his keys to get in to feed his cat damn it id seen this before and it hadnt ended well i shut davids car door with a thump and my blood pressure spiked when i spotted glenns trim silhouette headed for me from across the lot well at least i know now why you didnt show for our date at the morgue i shouted across the distance between us his pace was purposeful but his head was bowed in what i hoped was guilt im sorry rachel the exmilitary officer said as he halted beside me sorry i exclaimed more than a little upset at glenns overzealous boy scout mentality whatever davids been arrested for he didnt do it i was with trent this morning and he flatout told me he was the one murdering the weres to find that stupidass statue glenn didnt look any happier his stud earrings making an odd statement next to his otherwise eminently professional mien im really glad to hear you say that he said putting his hands behind his back and all but pinning me to the car with his tooclose presence taken aback i felt my anger slow so youre going to let him go head shaking he squinted to look worried no but if mr kalamack can verify that you were with him this morning i can keep the is from arresting you right now i felt myself pale me i stammered what for for aiding and abetting the murder of brett markson his gaze went to my bag you got anything in there i need to know about adrenaline surged and i felt like id been kicked in the stomach ive got my splat gun but i dont need a permit for it and this is crap glenn i just told you trent murdered them all of them the three jane wolves were accidents and have nothing to do with the murders glenn pulled himself straighter his hands still laced behind his back rachel could you step away from the car and come with me please and give me your purse my mouth dropped open am i under arrest i said loudly clutching my bag closer crap i had the focus in there no one is arresting youyet he said his expression pained please rachel if you dont cooperate the is will handle your questioning im trying to jump ahead of them here that was all the encouragement i needed feeling very alone for the lack of jenks i handed him my bag it looked funny in his grip and he gestured with a free hand for me to accompany him shaking inside i fell into step beside him we were moving steadily to the fib vanthe one with the metal mesh in the windows talk to me glenn mr david hue was seen talking to mr markson last night he said unhappily today the victim was found dead in mr hues apartment dumpster with your card in his wallet mr hue admits to having relations with the three jane wolves now in the morgue and when officers came to question him they found a heavily sedated were woman showing signs of assault my knees went watery this looked really bad and i was glad id told glenn about the focus earlier serena was human glenn the focus turned her david was helping her to learn to control it before the full moon so she would know what was coming and be able to deal with it he doped her up in bane so he could get me to help with her pain thats all that it is glenn glared at me his brown eyes full of warning lower your voice eyes dropping i frowned listening to the distinctive radio chatter sorry i said then scuffed to a halt before we got much closer to that open van david did not kill brett i said firmly the three women in the morgue were tragic accidents serena is trying to deal with what happened and david is doing the best he can you should be arresting trent not david rachel stop he told me he did it i exclaimed why does no one believe me glenn leaned close and i stiffened using every ounce of will to not break his hold when he took my shoulder shut up he said tightly so close i could smell the sweat under his aftershave everyone with a badge knows you hate kalamack i cant ask for a warrant to arrest him because you said he told you he did it i made a scoffing noise then yelped when he yanked me closer i believe you rachel glen said almost whispering into my ear that man is slime and im going to look into it look into it i taunted then winced when glenn pinched my shoulder i said im going to look into it and if i find something ill let you know he let go of me just hang tight youre no help to me if youre in jail dropping back a step i watched the ambulance crew bring serena out they had used a witch spell to trigger her return to her human shape from what i could see she looked like the women in the morgue a trim outline showing under the stretchers sheet her long brown hair in disarray david clearly had a preferred look to his women though she was unconscious pain had drawn her face into lines david didnt hurt her i whispered as the ambulance crew loaded her in the back then hell be released when she regains consciousness and tells us that glenn said i turned to glenn tears of frustration blurring my vision if we lived in a perfect world my nose tickled with the scent of incense and i spun denon was behind me clearly amused that he had startled me he looked better almost his old self and dressed in his usual polo shirt and slacks that showed off his narrow waist and his muscular legs obviously some dead vamp had been at him giving a little back to boost his morale it was in his attitude my pulse quickened at the reminder of the is officers bundling david into cuffs and i backed up into glenn denon i said stiffly telling myself i wasnt afraid of him but of what he could do to me under the flag of is justice morgan the big man said his deep beautiful voice sounding like chocolate milk given sound his gaze slid to glenn behind me officer glenn i shivered his voice creeping up my spine with the subtlety of velvet damn someone had been playing with him all right glenn seemed to have noticed too for all he did was nod denon smiled to show his flat teeth morgan it gives me great pleasure to take you in for questioning in conjunction with the murder of brett markson my breath caught when he reached for me and i fell back into glenns solid weight flustered i pulled myself straight i have an alibi denon back off people were watching and denon arched his eyebrows the time of marksons death was put at seven you were asleep and i know no one was with you seeing as both your boyfriend and your roommate were with piscary at the time he leered i didnt want to think about it i couldnt think about it i was having an earlymorning meeting with mr kalamack i said keeping my voice soft so he wouldnt hear it shake denons eyes widened cracking his cocky attitude and giving me a measure of strength you know how humans are i added sliding sideways so if i had to move i wouldnt bump glenn but glenn shifted with me the way they insist everyone keep to their time clock no respect for other cultures brown eyes narrowing denon drew an obscenely thin cell phone out of a belt holster his brown fingers hitting the buttons carefully he appeared to scroll through a list of numbers you wont mind if i verify that i froze not knowing if trent would tell the truth be my guest i said boldly people were closing in around us i could feel them glenn edged closer rachel my gaze flicked to his and i felt small between the two black men trent was with me i insisted but will he admit to that i thought cringing when i remembered how we had parted probably not mr kalamack please denon said pleasantly and i heard a womans voice of course maam this is officer denon from the is denon smiled at me as the call was put through mr kalamack he said cheerfully i apologize for interrupting your afternoon i know youre busy and this will only take a moment i need you to verify that you were with ms rachel morgan this morning between seven and seventhirty i swallowed hard wanting my splat gun tucked away in my bag it was probably a good thing that glenn had it denons eyes flicked to me no sir he said into the tiny phone yes sir thank you you have a good day too face empty of emotion denon snapped the phone shut well i asked i was sweating even a human could see it you act as if you dont know the answer he said smoothly from behind me glenn shifted officer denon are you arresting ms morgan or not i held my breath denons big hands clenched and released not today he said forcing a smile exhaling i tossed a strand of hair that had escaped jenkss braid and tried to look confident youre lucky witch denon said as he rocked back a graceful step i dont know what star youre wishing on but its about to fall and with that he spun and walked away yeah and angels cry when good men die i said wishing he would find a new book of cliches to memorize relieved i reached for my shoulder bag still in glenns possession give me that i said yanking it to me the car denon had gotten into drove away with a tiny squeak of tires head down in thought glenn pointed me to an unmarked fib car big black and sporting blocky lines ill get you home he said and i obediently headed for it trent told the truth i said our steps matching perfectly i dont get it he could have gotten me in jail then searched the church for the focus at his leisure glenn opened the door for me and i slipped inside enjoying the courtesy maybe hes worried someone saw him glenn mused aloud then shut my door maybe he was using ceri and me as his alibi i muttered as glenn went around the front and got in i grimaced thinking how sick is that using meeting a beautiful woman like ceri as an alibi while one of your peons was shoving someone into a dumpster for you glenn started the car and we waited for the ambulance to leave before us the lights off and moving slow david wont be taking the blame for this i said in determination clutching my bag on my lap maybe trent told the truth because he knew i had the focus with me and if the is got it it would make his task to retrieve it a lot harder i hope youre right glenns voice was distant as he looked both ways before pulling out i really hope youre right because if mr hue is officially charged with the murders the is is going to come after you for aiding and abetting even with that alibi david asking you for help looks really bad settling myself into the leather seats i put an elbow on the open window and stared at nothing swell i whispered to no one my life sucks twentynine my eyes fluttered open when glenn eased to a stop at a stoplight blinking i realized i was almost home and i sat up from my slouch the day had gotten warm and apparently id nodded off clearly being knocked out for eight hours wasnt the same as sleep embarrassed i glanced at glenn flushing when he smiled at me his teeth a startling white against his dark skin please tell me i wasnt snoring i muttered never imagining i would have fallen asleep i had only closed my eyes to gather my thoughts or maybe to escape from everything you snore cute he said giving his unused ashtray a tap you two are funny jenks rose from it in a puff of gold glitters im awake he exclaimed tugging his clothes straight and looking charmingly wideeyed as he arranged his shock of blond hair he at least had an excuse seeing as he was usually asleep this time of day the clock on the dash said it was a shade after two after leaving davids glenn had first taken me to the fib to make an official statement before the is could choose the most inopportune time to get one from me from there we went to pick jenks up at the is and physically drop off a copy of my paperwork all nice and legal we visited the morgue in there too which had left me depressed i was sure glenn had more to do than cart us around but since i didnt have a valid license i appreciated it david was still in custody jenks had overheard his interrogation and apparently brett had met with david yesterday to talk about brett joining our pack it was supposed to have been a surprise which had me in tears when i found out thats why trent had targeted him trent was slime and i cursed myself for letting some of the good things he didlike admit he spent the morning with me for instancecloud the fact that he was a murderer and drug lord he only did something decent if it might be of some use to him such as giving himself an alibi for seven to seventhirty ceri had it right the man was a demon in all but species under some madeup point of law the is was detaining david without any formal charges it was illegal but someone in the basement had probably realized that the focus was out seeing as a loner was turning human women into weres david was kneedeep in it it would only be a matter of time before i joined him maybe if he was in is custody trent couldnt kill him maybe im sorry david i never expected this to happen the cool shade of my street fell over me and i gathered my bag onto my lap feeling for the heavy outlines of the focus squinting i realized there was a black van parked in front of the churchand someone was tacking a note on my door jenks look at that i whispered and he followed my gaze glenn eased to a stop several car lengths back and when i cracked the window jenks darted out saying ill see what it is the man with the hammer caught sight of us and with a worrisome quickness he hustled down the stairs and into his vehicle you want me to stay glenn asked shoving the car into park he had a pencil in his grip and was writing down the plate number as the black van drove away the dust spilling from jenks as he hovered before the note shifted from gold to red i dont know i murmured getting out i stomped up the stairs evicted jenks said his face white when he spun in the air rachel piscary evicted us he evicted us my stomach going light i ripped the paper from the nail no freaking way i said skimming the official document it was blurry from being the second copy but clear enough we had thirty days to vacate they were going to tear the church down now that it wasnt sanctified but the impetus behind it was piscary glenn leaned out the window everything okay rache jenks exclaimed clearly terrified i cant move my family matalina isnt well theyre going to bulldoze the garden jenks i said hands upraised though i couldnt touch him its going to be okay i promise well work something out matalina will be fine jenks stared at me his eyes wide i i he stammered then with a little moan he darted up and around to the back of the church my hands fell to my sides i felt so helpless rachel glenn called from the street and i turned weve been evicted i said moving the paper in explanation thirty days anger trickled into me glenns eyes narrowed dont do it witch he warned as he looked at my fists clenched at my sides i gazed down the street at nothing getting madder im not going to kill him i said give me some credit this is an invitation if i dont go see him hell do something worse shit my mother glenn ducked back in the window his door opened and he got out my blood pressure rose get your little brownsugar candy ass back in your ugly grown victoria i said i know what im doing my fingers felt the outlines of the focus in my bag as glenn came to the bottom of the steps and looked up at me pistol on his hip and attitude all over him like icing on a cake give me your car keys dont think so his eyes narrowed give them to me or im going to arrest you myself on what grounds i asked belligerently looking down at him you boots theyre breaking every unwritten fashion law huffing i looked at them tilting one onto the toe to see them better im just going to talk to him nice and friendly eyebrows high glenn put his hand out ive seen how you talk to piscary keys my jaw clenched put a car at my mothers house i demanded and when he nodded i shoved the eviction paper into my bag found my keys and threw them at him bastard i muttered as they hit his hand thats my girl he said as he looked at the zebrastriped car key you get them back when you go to class i opened the door to the church and put my hand on my hip you call me your girl one more time and im going to turn your gonads into plums and make jam out of them chuckling glenn got into his car entering the dark foyer i pulled the heavy door shut to make the upper transom windows rattle my bag held tight to me i stomped into the sanctuary and headed for my desk yanking open drawers i slammed and banged around until i found my spare set of keys it had everything the first had plus the key that opened ivys safe and one from nicks apartment never thrown away god knows why a smug satisfaction tugged the corners of my mouth up into a wicked smile as i dropped the keys into my bag and i went to the side window to watch glenn turn the corner at the end of the street the red of the stained glass gave everything outside an unreal look like the everafter jenks i shouted as his car vanished if you can hear me get your best suit on we have some major ass kissing to do thirty this isnt the same i told myself my twohanded grip tightening on the wheel of my convertible and the wind from the cracked window tugging a few strands from my braid this wasnt anything like the night i had tried to tag piscary last year for one jenks was with me this time i wasnt mad eithernot blind mad anyway it was daylight for at least a few more hoursnot that that made a difference jenks was with me i had a nice peace offering to buy my life with and lastly jenks was with me signaling i made a quick left turn heading to the riverfront and going against the predominant flow of traffic i had friends at pizza piscarys but piscary was back and they wouldnt help me jenks was my confidence now that the focus was really at the post office lost in the human bureaucracy so deep and jealously guarded that even the is couldnt reach it his presence meant more to me than my splat gun fully stocked and tucked into my bag i had an invoked pain charm around my neck hanging outside my shirt so it wouldnt affect me until i needed it and i had a feeling i was going to need it other than that i was going in pretty much naked of earth charms i had a hefty amount of ley line energy spindled in my head though and in my pocket a pair of heavyduty toenail clippers you might use on an elephant which i hoped would be strong enough to cut an antiley line zipstrip but it was jenks i was counting on to be the difference between my walking out with a new lease on life or spending an eternity of hell with piscary or al this was my best option trent knew i had the focus the is wasnt so dense that they hadnt realized it was still in my possession i wanted piscarys protection from all of them my god how did i get to this place the breeze from my window shifted jenkss wings he was sitting on the rearview mirror facing backward as he gazed vacantly into the past his features were lined and worried there wasnt a scrap of red on hima symbol of his intent if we lost the garden the stress might tip matalina into a downward spiral id be hardpressed to keep him from trying to kill piscary if push came to shove but if push came to shove killing piscary might be the only way to survive i didnt want to do that the undead vampire was the only person i knew who could keep the focus safe until it could be hidden again seeing jenkss misery i took a breath to ask him about his outfit id never seen it before sort of a combination of quens black uniform with the freeflowing folds of a desert sheiks robes but jenkss gaze flicked to mine making me pause thanks rachel he said wings utterly still for everything i want to tell you in case we both dont make it through this jenks i started and he cut me off with a sharp wing chirp shut your mouth witch he snapped though i could tell he wasnt mad i want to thank youthis past year has been the best in my life and not just for me that sterility wish i got from you is probably why matalina made it through last winter the garden and everything that came with working with you jenkss gaze went distant even if they bulldoze everything i want you to know that it was worth it my kids know you can make it if you take risks and work hard that we can work in the system you lunkers set up thats all a parent really needs to give his kids that and how to love someone with all your soul this was sounding like a last confession and i flicked my gaze from the car braking in front of me to him jeez jenks were going to be fine ill give piscary the focus and hell rescind the eviction and once everyone knows he has the thing life will go back to normal matalina will be fine he didnt say anything matalina wasnt going to be fine no matter what happened in the next twentyfour hours but id be damned if i wouldnt do what i could to get her through the coming winter she was not going to hibernate and risk not waking up that was for sure jenkss wings drooped and he pulled a fold of fabric up and polished his sword just as well i wasnt enjoying the conversation and jenkss misery was making my stomach hurt i wished he were bigger again just so i could give him a hug understanding hit me and i stiffened this inability to touch was what ivy lived with every day she couldnt touch anyone she cared about without her blood lust asserting itself we are so screwed up i forced myself back from the bumper of the guy in front of me piscarys was just ahead and i wanted to get off the street before the is found me they were suspiciously absent and i wondered if they were watching me from a distance to see if i had left to get the focus from someone i suppose mailing it hadnt been the smartest thing but i couldnt put it into a bus locker and giving it to ceri wouldve been a mistake humanity had steadfastly kept control of the mail system and even piscary would think twice about leaning on an overworked employee who might snap and go postal there were some things even a vampire wouldnt mess with the jitters started and jenkss wings shifted fitfully as we pulled in to piscarys parking lot yeah the plan looked good on paper but piscary might be more ticked than i thought about my putting him in jail that id just been doing my job probably wouldnt go very far with him nervous i scanned the area there were a few cars clustered about the kitchen entrance that were clearly not patrons i didnt see ivys cycle but there was a huge mound of stuff piled at the curb sheets of paneling that once covered the upstairs windows and the tall trendy tables and stools that kisten had put in were now carelessly piled to make a fivefoot wall between the lot and the street waiting for pickup apparently piscary was doing a little remodeling my eyes widened and i took my foot off the gas when i realized kistens light show was among it the metal scaffolding bent and twisted as if it had been pulled from the ceiling without regard the colored lights were smashed and his pool table was leaning atop it rache jenks said chilling me that pile of trash just moved fear slid through me and my heart jumped it was kisten sitting on the curb between the mounds of debris sun glinting on his blond hair he threw something into the pile with a metallic ting he looked rumpled in his red silk shirt and black linen slacks discarded oh my god i whispered his head came up as i swung the car around to point my nose to the exit parking sideways against the faded lines there was anger in his absolutely black eyesutter hatred blending with betrayal and frustration ah rachel maybe you should stay in the car heart pounding i fumbled for the door and jenks zipped out before me aggressive and wary kisten stood and leaving the car running i glanced at the dark restaurant and the upper windows overlooking the parking lot nothing moved but a scrap of paper taped to the door worried i paced to him my kickbutt boots tapping kisten what are you doing here he barked and i jerked to a stop confused i stood there for a moment with the nearby cars whooshing past trying to realign my thinking piscary evicted us i said jenkss wings clattering as he hovered what happened i said gesturing to his club now on the curb what do you think happened he shouted looking at the silent restaurant the son of a bitch kicked me out he kicked me out and gave my last blood to someone god help us his last blood as in here he is have fun draining him to death pulse quickening i dropped back when kisten swooped down to the fragments of his dance club with vampiric strength he flung a chair at the front door the metal tumbling and clanking to stop short of the entryway the wind from the nearby river tugged at my braid and i felt cold despite the two shirts i had on kisten i said frightened its going to be okay but my confidence trickled away when he turned to me his shoulders hunched and dark fear and hatred in his eyes no he rasped it isnt he gave me to someone as a thankyou to kill for their enjoyment and no one will stop him because hes a fucking god the draft from jenkss wings tickled my neck and an ironcold band of fear slithered through my heart there was death in kistens eyes there in the sunshine death waited backing up another step i felt my mouth go dry kisten dipped a hand into a leather pocket of the pool table to come up with the five hall when ivy says no she gets praised for her strength of will he said bitterly hefting it experimentally for weight when i say no i get fucking kicked out with a grunt he threw the ball it sped over the parking lot almost unseen fuck you you bastard he shouted and a window broke in the upper story i jumped when jenks landed on my shoulder ah rachel he said and gold dust spilled over me leave please just get in the car and leave swallowing i took a hesitant step forward while kisten found another pool ball kisten i whispered frightened at his show of temper never had i seen him this bad come on i said reaching out to take his arm we have to go jenks left me and kisten froze when i tugged on him face empty he turned his black eyes freezing me as they glinted from behind his blonddyed bangs feeling like id made a mistake i let go we have to leave i said worried someone would come out go where he said around a harsh laugh that didnt sound like him at all im dead rachel soon as the sun goes down someones going to kill me as slowly as their anticipation can stand i gave everything to that bastard and now he wont his words broke off and fear and pain crossed his face i did everything for him he said betrayal staining his anger made a shitload of profit off his bar when it lost its mpl and now he fucking wont touch me his rage and desperation finding a release in a movement of controlled anguish kisten threw another pool ball i fell back almost tripping on the wreckage of his light show i made more on his damned business after he lost his mpl than he did all of last year he shouted and the ball thunked low and to the left of a wide plateglass window he never even looked at the books kisten threw a third and my pulse raced when it went through the wall he doesnt fucking care he raged and the eight ball hit the window i gasped when it shattered completely and a shadow came forward to investigate kisten turned away palm on the pool table sitting at a fortyfivedegree cant atop a stacked pile of little round tables beyond the rubble cars passed oblivious he never looked at the books he said softly as if trying to figure it out i thought that would mean something the creak of the restaurants door opening sent alarm spiking through me fear for what was coming beat the fear of kistens having lost it and i pulled on his arm the scent of old blood mixing with his usual scent of leather get in the car kisten get in my car he never looked at the books kisten said again in shock just put down an ultimatum then gave my last blood to the vampire who set up the deal between him and that demon to get him out someone who doesnt care about me i i wanted him to have it this was just too sick kisten we have to go i exclaimed my gaze darting to the five big men walking toward us their pace slow and their wide shoulders swinging one hesitated at the chair kisten had thrown twisting a metal leg free before falling back into step ah shit kistens head came up at the sound of metal tearing my face went cold he was dead inside though he breathed and his heart beat kisten was dead killed by an anger and betrayal that id never comprehend hed known piscary his entire life bound his life to him was given power and authority over others through him found and relished the power of living above the law because of him and piscary had ripped all the promises away and thrown him to the curb without pity or thought discarded given to someone as a gift to take pleasure in killing him this is who i wanted to buy protection from please i whispered both wanting and fearing kists turning his black eyes to me my hand was on his shoulder and the muscles of his arm tightened as he made a fist i saw his determination before he voiced it i need to hurt someone rachel he said brushing my hand from him dont stop this until i cant move he pulled a pool cue from the wreckage and hefted it kisten i pleaded but he shoved me backward i stumbled to catch my balance frightened and kisten went to meet them never looking back panicking i shifted my weight to follow but jenks dropped down to block my way let him go he said his hands on his hips and a grim determination on his face theyre going to kill him i said pointing to the advancing vampires as kisten took up a stance between me and my car but jenks shook his head no they wont he said eyes never leaving them he belongs to someone else his eyes went to me filled with deep fear after they finish beating him up youve got to get him out of cincy before whoever that is finds him thats what im trying to do i shouted almost stamping my foot stupid asinine men how could i give piscary the focus now but then a thought hit me painful and hard if the focus was as important as i thought then maybe i could buy kistens safety as well as mine i had to let ivy find her own way out but kisten my panic rose anew and i shifted from foot to foot out of helplessness as the men closed on kisten one of the vampires slid across the hood of my car while four more continued forward to trap him against the trash the one in the lead was familiar i recognized the slant to his cruel smile it was the guy kisten had beat up last year before taking me down to see piscary sam jenks i said nervously my bag with my splat gun was out of reach in my car itll be okay he said his voice high but i didnt believe him stay out of it jenks i said louder then jumped when kisten shifted his grip and swung his pool stick at sam sam blocked it without slowing down smiling to show fangs he followed it with a hopstep and a side kick to kistens middle kisten took it turning his body into a roundhouse his face was ugly with hatred id never seen it raw in him before and i backed up a fist to my chest do they really expect me to just stand here and let them beat him up almost too fast to see kisten and sam exchanged blows the other vampires ringing them no one was paying any attention to me but i couldnt get to my car kisten behind you i shouted when one of them grabbed kisten as he rocked back teeth bared kisten took the second vampires arm a soft pull and a savage twist and a scream of pain ripped from the vampires throat kisten licked his lips before smacking the butt end of the pool cue into the vamps neck black eyes intent he snarled and shoved the downed vampire to the pavement kicking the writhing man as he tried to breathe sam charged him and kisten swung his broken cue like a knife sam danced back taunting until kisten followed coming away from the downed vampire i didnt think he was breathing yet still convulsing on the pavement a third vampire wearing a backward cap came forward hunched and cautious with that chair leg in his grip lost in battle lust kisten jumped at him fangs bared the vampire sprang sideways and kisten shifted falling to the ground for a leg sweep the metal chair leg pinged as it hit the ground right before the vampire holding it i gasped when kisten moved too fast to see covering the man for the span of a breath his cry of pain cut off with a frightening quickness and kisten rolled away the metal leg in his hands now it was aimed at sam and the vampire cautiously backed up howling like a mad thing kisten attacked his movements blurred and fast the twitching of the vampire kisten had left on the pavement stopped his eyes stared unseeing at the faultlessly blue sky his hair shifted in the wind but the man was dead i could tell and i hadnt even seen what kisten had done to him kisten stop i shouted then leapt to the side when the fourth vampire smashed into the pool table beside me he hit it hard his eyes going blank and his limbs spreadeagle for a breathless moment until he slid to hit the pavement i turned to kisten my heart pounding i wanted it to stop but he was out of control and i was afraid to interfere his face was twisted and ugly his motions were sharp and aggressive and when sam came at him with the same look i could do nothing grunting sam spun his hair flaring as he smashed a roundhouse into kistens head kisten stumbled back a hand coming up to touch the blood leaking from a cut under his eye as if not feeling it he took a back kick then another each one moving him closer to me the third one kisten caught sams face went still and with a savage smile kisten wrenched his ankle sam cried out in anger to drop back in a controlled fall and keep kisten from snapping it kisten moved to follow up with a deathblow and sam spun on his back for momentum flinging his unhurt foot at kistens knee in a sweep kisten went down his foot knocked out from under him i reached out then gasped when two of the other vampires he had previously downed fell on him grunts of pain and silent thuds of fists into flesh turned my stomach as they attacked kisten one vampire kisten could hold his own against but two it had turned into a mauling sam staggered to his feet wiping a ribbon of blood from his chin get him up he breathed heavily and jenks got in my way stopping me from interfering frustrated i jerked back this was enough hed had enough but when sam looked at me and pointed for me to stay i did frightened by the dark depth of hatred in him dont worry chicky witch he said breathing heavy were almost done piscary gave him to someone else to kill or hed be dead already he laughed then chilling me to my soul he knew who it was he knew who piscary had given kisten to i wondered if it was whoever had summoned al to arrange the entire con to get piscary out of jail who is it i shouted but he only laughed harder using the support of my car the vampire with the broken arm and the one stunned by hitting the pool table struggled to drag kisten upright blood leaked from kistens mouth and there was a cut under his eye which was swollen almost closed his blond hair glinted in the sunlight as his head hung sam limped closer grabbing his hair and jerking his head up kisten squinted to see him anger simmered in him still and sam smiled tauntingly thought you were such a badass he said then punched him in the gut i lurched forward as kisten sagged almost pulling down the vampires who held him youre nothing sam shouted furious you never were everything was piscary balance hobbling sam punched him again and kisten groaned thats enough i shouted ignored and jenkss wings hummed the angry vampire wiped the blood from his nose marking kistens hair when he yanked his head up again kistens eyes were shut and i could see the breath passing his bloodied lip and his chest moving as he breathed you were never anything felps remember that when you die you were nothing alive and youll be less when youre dead i said thats enough i shouted hearing the wail of distant sirens sam glanced at me and smiled to show his teeth come see me when you need a little something chicky witch id love to give it to you i took a breath to tell him to shove it but the two vampires let kisten go and he slid down the side of my car balancing to keep the weight off his broken ankle sam leaned toward kisten kisten jerked and horror hit me when sam straightened with the diamond stud earring from kistens ear piscary says youre going to be dead twice by sunup sam said head tilted as he put the earring in his own lobe he doesnt think youve got the guts to see it through and redeem yourself says youve gone soft me i think you never had it in you to be undead the other two vampires started to hobble away and after giving kisten a last kick sam headed after them leaving the last of them to stare at the sun kisten barely moved curling in on himself pulse fast i went to him this had been stupid god how stupid could men be beating each other up had done a helluva lot of good kisten i said kneeling beside him i glanced behind me at the road wondering why no one had stopped kisten was a mess his head hanging bleeding all over from scrapes and contusions his expensive slacks were scuffed and his silk shirt was torn fingers fumbling i got my pain amulet off my neck and around his hearing him take a clean breath when i tucked it behind his shirt and it connected with his skin its going to be okay i said wishing i could see the restaurant but my car was in the way come on kisten help me get you up at least i wouldnt have to drag him to the car he pushed me off him then leaned back and used his legs to push himself against my car to get himself upright im okay he said squinting at my worried face then spitting blood onto the gravel give me my lucky stick his eyes were on the broken cue and my lips pressed together just get in the damn car i swore we have to get out of here it sounds like the is is coming i fumbled for the door jenks getting in the way as he tried to help dusting kistens cuts i want my stick kisten said again as he fell into the passenger seat his bloodied hair smearing the window im going to shove it up piscarys ass yeah that sounds likely but after i put both of his feet into the car and yanked him upright i scooped up the broken cue and set it next to him i slammed the door shut only now glancing at the restaurant fear hit me and i held my arms around myself feeling the wind tug at my hair ivy was down there lost in the madness that was piscary and i was going to have to deal with him for kisten as well as myself my gaze went to kisten slumped in the front seat i had to get ivy out of there this was insane stuff like this shouldnt happen the howl of sirens lifted through me and as traffic passed at a hurried fortyfive miles per hour i paced to my side of the car rachel jenks said getting in my way this isnt safe gee you think i said bitterly reaching for the handle but he got in my way again no he said hovering so close i was almost crosseyed i mean i dont think youre safe with kisten i looked at kisten slumped against the bloodsmeared window then yanked open my door this isnt the time for pixy paranoia i said tightly shedding a bright coppery dust that landed on my hand to make it tingle he refused to move i think piscary told him to kill you he pleaded softly so kisten couldnt hear and when kisten refused he threw him out you heard what kisten said about ivy saying no and getting praised and him getting kicked out i stopped my hand on the open door i felt cold jenks landed on the window before me his wings never slowing think rachel he said gesturing hes been dependent upon piscary for his entire life ivy isnt the only one piscarys been screwing over but kisten has always been pliant so it doesnt show killing you is the only way he might get back in with piscary rache this isnt safe dont trust this jenkss face was pinched in fear the sound of sirens grew closer i remembered what keasley had said about vampires needing someone stronger than they were to protect them against the undead and my resolve strengthened i couldnt just walk away watch my back okay at that jenks nodded as if expecting it like you were my last seedling in the garden he said then swooped into the car taking a last look at the restaurant i gathered my resolve i got in feeling light and unreal beside me kisten groaned wheres my stick he breathed and i jumped when the starter ground as i tried to turn the alreadyrunning car over again its at your feet i muttered frustrated i jammed it into first and lurched forward i reached the exit before i remembered my seat belt and i screeched to a halt at the entrance to fasten it sitting there watching the traffic pass i felt my chest clench i didnt have anywhere to go in a sudden decision i pulled out to go the opposite way from the church where are we going jenks asked dropping to land on my shoulder as the car settled into its new direction i glanced at my keys and nicks apartment key nick had said hed paid rent through august and i was willing to bet the place was empty to nicks i cant take him home i said lips barely moving everyone knows thats where id take him i snuck a glance at kisten his eyes swollen shut as he mumbled i shouldnt have put in the light display i should have left the kitchen menu alone jenks was silent then in a very small panicked voice he said i have to go home my breath caught and i exhaled in understanding matalina was there alone if someone showed up at the church looking for kisten jenkss family might be in danger go i said i cant leave you twisting i grabbed my bag from the back and fumbled until i had my splat gun on my lap eyeing jenkss expression torn with indecision i pulled to the curb and hit the brakes kisten weakly braced himself as he shifted forward and back horns blew and i ignored them get your little pixy ass out of the car and get home i said voice even and level as i rolled the window down take care of your family but youre my family too he said my throat tightened every time i screwed up big time jenks was gone ill be fine rache ill be fine i shouted frustrated and kisten turned to us squinting and breathing hard im a witch damn it im not helpless i can handle this go jenks lifted into the air call me if you need me ill have my phone on i managed a smile deal he nodded his face looking old and young all at the same time and i froze when he flew close his wings brushing my cheek for an instant thank you he said and then he was gone thirtyone as expected i had found nicks place empty i didnt think anyone had noticed me helping kisten inside and up the steps to the onebedroom apartment kisten had revived somewhat on the way and he had gotten himself into a warm tub of water without my help there was no shower curtain and i thought a soak would be better anyway he was still in there and if i didnt hear some water draining soon i was going to go check on him the sound of the street noise coming through the open windows was nice it had smelled musty when i hesitantly opened the door to find empty walls and barren carpet clearly nick had packed up everything on the solstice leaving very little to return to if he ever found himself in cincy again where all his stuff was now i didnt know or care his moms maybe i couldnt help but feel betrayed all over again though there was nothing here to trigger the memories but worn carpet and empty shelves i tried not to feel bitter as i drank the coffee nick had left along with a sleeping bag three cans of stew and the pan to heat it up in there was one plate one bowl and one set of silverwarenothing he would miss if he never came back but there if he found himself on the run and needed somewhere to hide for a night or two bastard i mumbled not putting much emotion behind it if he had just been a thief i might have been able to see past it what with my new and improved outlook on life but he had been buying demon favors from al with pieces of me innocent things hed said worthless but if they were worthless why had al agreed to it so i sat at the metal and formica table that came with the apartment drinking stale coffee and staring at the stains on the matted carpet the traffic sounds were both soothing and unfamiliar nicks apartment wasnt in a residential area but what passed for downtown hollows there was no scent of nick in the air yet i could almost feel the stale magic i looked at the scratched linoleum for the circle nick had said was there scribed with a blacklight marker the memory of standing in nicks closet to summon al lifted through me god i shouldve walked away right then even if calling up al for information had been my idea but i hadnt thought anyone who claimed to love me could willingly betray me like that the water in the bathroom sloshed and as the gurgle as it left the tub intruded into my thoughts i sat up feeling bitter and stupid i scooted my chair back and went to warm up a can of stew the can opener was one of those cheap flimsy things and i was still fighting it when a soft breath and hesitant steps turned me around i smiled when i saw kisten wearing a towel his hair damp he had his torn and scuffed clothes in his hands as if he didnt want to put them back on ugly bruises brought out by the warm water splotched his torso and his eye was swollen bigger than before redrimmed scratches marked his arms and face his hair had been washed and despite his beating he still looked goodstanding there in the kitchen wrapped in a towel the definition of his muscles all damp and glistening rachel he said looking relieved as he set his wad of clothes on a vacant chair youre still here um dont take this the wrong way but where are we nicks old apartment the cans finally popped lid off angst spiked though me at jenkss warning but i had to trust kisten otherwise what was the point of loving him kistens blue eyes widened and i licked a spot of cold gravy off my thumb your old boyfriends he said turning to the empty living room with only the curtains moving in the slight breeze kind of spartan with the decorating wasnt he snorting i dumped the stew into the pot and set the dial to warm im guessing he hasnt been here since the solstice but hes paid up to august and i had a key so here we are no one knows but jenks youre safe i said hesitantly for the moment exhaling kisten sat and put an elbow on the table thank you he said fervently i have to get out of cincinnati i had my back to him as i stirred the stew and a shiver rose through me maybe not the soft hush of the cotton towel as he straightened brought me around and seeing his wonder i said im going to give piscary the focus to put into hiding if he will leave me alone and keep anyone else from knocking me or you off kistens lips parted and i wished his towel would slip a little more god what was wrong with me we were both teetering on death and i was looking at his legs you want to buy protection from piscary kisten said in disbelief after what he did to me he gave my last blood to someone outside the camarilla do you know what that means hes abandoning me rachel its not so much the dying im worried about but being shunned no one will risk his anger to make me undead now except maybe ivy and if shes his scion thats not going to happen he was scared i didnt like seeing him like that taking a miserable breath i leaned against the stove and crossed my arms its going to be okay no one is going to kill you so youll be fine besides ive been getting protection from him by way of ivy i said thinking i would cheerfully be a hypocrite if it meant we both would survive this is just making it more official im going to ask that he leave you alone too take you back it will be okay hope lit his blue eyes then died he wont he said in a flat tone sure he will i coaxed coming to sit beside him no he wont kisten looked worse for having seen hope for an instant he cant its done youd have to make arrangements with whoever he gave me to and i dont know who that is i wont until they show up its part of the mind game his eyes darted nervously and i drew back it wasnt that cut and dried i knew how vamps worked until the coffin was nailed shut there were options then ill find out who he gave you to i said kisten took my hands his eyebrows furrowing over lost chances rachel its too late i cant believe youre giving up i said angry as i pulled from him he took my hand and kissed the top of it im not giving up im accepting it even if you could find out who it was or if you were here when they came for mewhich you wont bethat would leave you with nothing to buy protection from piscary with his hand rose to touch my jawline i wont do that to you damn it it isnt too late i exclaimed standing up and going to stir the stew before it burned i couldnt look at him anymore the pot slopped over in my agitation and i got mad all you have to do is lay low until i get this sorted out can you do that for me kisten i turned angry just hide and do nothing for a day or two his sigh was heavy and i wasnt certain i believed him when he nodded sure that id be able to buy both our safeties with a fivethousandyearold artifact i kept stirring the stew there were a couple of packets of hot chocolate in nicks emergency store and my jaw clenched i was not going to make hot chocolate is ivy okay i asked reminded his feet squeaked against the floor of course she is he said flatly he loves her i couldnt tell if he was angry i set the spoon aside and turned down the burner spinning to find he had dropped his forehead into his cupped hand worry went through me then pity piscary was ticked about the embalming fluid huh i said trying to be light i have no idea he said in a monotone it never came up he was angry about what i did to the restaurant his blue eyes held the pain of memory when he lifted them to me he was like an animal he said fear and betrayal staining his voice he ripped out my chairs and tables unshuttered the windows burned the new menus and punished my waitstaff he almost killed steve his eyes closed and the faint wrinkles on his face deepened as if a lifetime of pain had fallen on him in an instant i couldnt stop him i thought he was going to kill me too i would have been happy if he had but he threw me out with everything else as if he was an old menu or a used napkin why kisten i whispered i had to hear it it hadnt been what kisten did to the bar that caused piscary to do what he did afraid i stayed where i was hands holding my elbows i needed to hear it i needed to hear kisten tell me the truth so i could trust him why did he kick you out i asked again his free hand rubbing at a sore rib kisten looked at me he hesitated as if waiting for me to guess it before saying it he told me to kill you he said and fear pinged through me he said it was the only way i could prove that i loved him he didnt ask ivy to prove herself he said his voice cracking and his need for my forgiveness pouring from him i said no i told him anything but that and he laughed the heat from the burner against my back wasnt enough to stop a shudder rippling through me kistens expression shifted to fear but it was the terror of realization not madness im sorry rachel i couldnt do it he rushed im going to die he gave my last blood to someone as a gift theyre going to kill meand no one will hold them accountable theyre going to get away with it i could handle that he said his quickening breath giving away his fear but he kicked me out of the camarilla and no one will cross piscary to keep me undead its a double death sentence one done quickly by a stranger who will suck me dry for his or her pleasure the other slow by madness his gaze met mine and i froze at the controlled panic in his gradually widening pupils its not a good way to die rachel he whispered chilling me i dont want to go insane tension pulled through me blood he was talking about blood he wasnt afraid of dying he was afraid of not having anyone to keep him undead afterward and he was looking for me to help him damn it all to the turn and back i cant do this fear lay deep in his eyes the rim of blue shrinking as he sat at the table in an empty apartment and saw his life fall apart and no one willing to risk piscarys anger to help him i shifted forward and sat before him taking his hands on my lap look at me kisten i demanded scared i cant become his source of blood i have to keep him alive look at me i repeated and his darting gaze met mine in agitation i am here i said slowly to try to ground him they wont find you ill work something out with piscary the thing is five thousand years old its got to be worth both of us the water from his bath glistened on his shoulders his expression slack in fear as he looked at me as if i stood between himself and insanity perhaps at that moment i was im okay he said huskily and he took his hands from mine visibly trying to divorce himself from his emotions where is jenks he asked changing the subject a hint of unease stained my senses not knowing why i leaned back jenkss warning resounded in me home i said simply he went to check on his kids but my heart beat hard and the hair on the back of my neck rose hey uh i should probably head home and make sure hes okay i said lightly not knowing why all my instincts said to leave and leave now if only for a moment i had to think something told me i had to think kistens head swung up panic clear in his eyes youre leaving a shiver rose through me and died we have two hours before sunset i said as i stood not liking him between me and the door all of a sudden i loved him but he was pulled to the breaking point and i didnt want to have to say no if he asked me to be his scion no one knows youre here i wont be long drawing away from him i scooped up his clothes besides you dont want to put these on until theyre clean ill wash them and be back before sunset promise it will get me some time to make up some spells too i had to get out i had to give him time to realize he was going to make it otherwise he would assume he wasnt and would ask me something i didnt want to answer kistens shoulders eased and he exhaled thanks love he said making me feel guilty i wasnt looking forward to putting them back on not in that condition i leaned forward and gave him a kiss from behind my lips touching his cheek while his hand rose to caress my jawline do you want jenkss shirt meantime i asked slipping from him when he shook his head you want me to stop and pickup anything while im out no he repeated looking worried kisten its going to be okay i said almost pleading i wished he would stand up so i could give him a proper kiss goodbye hearing my misery he smiled and stood we moved to the door together his scent rising from the armload of limp clothes in my hands wet from the bath he had almost no scent at all i hesitated at the door and shifted my splatgunheavy shoulder bag up onto my shoulder his arms went around me and i exhaled letting my entire body meld into him relaxing and just taking him in under the smell of soap was the hint of incense and my eyes closed as i encircled him holding him tightly for a long moment we stood there and i wouldnt let him go when he tried to rock back his eyes met mine and his brow rose at my naked fear for him its going to be okay he said seeing my doubt kisten and then he pulled me closer angling his head to kiss me i felt the hint of tears prickle as our lips met my pulse jumped not from lust but heartache kistens grip on me tightened and my throat closed in misery he was going to be okay he had to be but in his kiss i could feel his fear through his tense muscles pressing against mine and his hold on me a shade too tight he said it was going to be okay but he didnt believe it though he said he wasnt afraid to die i could tell he was terrified of being helpless and he was a faceless stranger was going to try to end his life and there would be no pity no caring no gentleness any sense of belonging or family however warped was going to be absent kisten would be less than a dog to whoever was coming it would turn what might be a rite of passage into an ugly act of selfserving murder it was not the way kisten should die but it was how he lived i couldnt take it anymore i pulled from him our lips parted and i met his eyes heavy with unshed tears he didnt believe i was going to make him believe i was going to prove him wrong i have to go i whispered and his hands fell from mine reluctantly hurry back he pleaded and i dropped my head unable to look at him i love you he said as i opened the door never forget that almost in tears i blinked fast i cant i wont i love you too i said then fled slipping through the door and into the hall before i changed my mind i hardly remembered going down the cool stairs dark from old paint and faded carpet i looked up before i got into my car seeing kistens shadowy silhouette hovering by the filmy curtains a shiver went through me rattling my keys when i didnt stifle it i hadnt known that the depth of control the undead had on their underlings was so strong that they would willingly submit to planned murder and i again thanked god that i had never let any vampires even ivy bind me to them though he was seemingly independent and confident kistens mental wellbeing hung upon the whim of someone who really didnt give a damn and now he had nothing except my trying to keep a faceless vampire from killing him for sport never i thought i loved kisten but never would i let a vampire bind me id die first thirtytwo the soothing scent of vampire and pixy sifted through the upper levels of my thoughts skimming through the hazy dream state i was slowly pulling out of i was warm and comfortable and as my mind moved from sleep to awareness i realized i was curled up in ivys chair in the sanctuary with jenkss black silk shirt draped over me i didnt care to analyze my motives for falling asleep in ivys chair maybe i just needed some comfort knowing she was going through hell and there wasnt a damned thing i could do about it wait a moment im sleeping in ivys chair that would mean i was jenks i shouted realizing what had happened and jerking upright id come home to wash kistens clothes and had apparently fallen asleep eight hours of spelled unconsciousness finally running thin damn it jenks why didnt you wake me up god help mekisten i had left him alone then fallen asleep i jumped up to call kisten on his cell jolting to a surprised halt when my body protested at the sudden movement aching from having slept in a chair it was chilly and i glanced at the mantel clock atop the tv in passing as i slipped my arms into coolness of jenkss shirt my shoulders stretched painfully hurting all the way to my lower back i was fastening the first button as i entered the kitchen it smelled like lilac in here and candle wax and the clock over the sink said the same thing fivethirty how could i have just fallen asleep i hadnt gotten much sleep yesterday but zonking out for an entire night i hadnt made any charms or anything damn it i was going to kill somebody if kisten wasnt all right jenks i shouted again as i found the phone and hit it to dial there was no answer and i hung up before i was dumped into voice mail a pang of fear shot through me and i tried to collect myself before i went and did something stupid taking a deep breath i turned to get my car keys hesitating in confusion where did i leave my bag jenks where in hell are you i shouted rubbing my aching upper arm my wrist too was sore and i shook it as i darted into the living room to see if my bag was in there cataloging a myriad of aches and pains from my stiff neck to my aching foot why am i limping im not that old unease went through me at the silence and one hand was still holding my upper arm as i looked at the barren room in confusion rachel came jenkss worried muffled voice an instant before he zipped in through the chimney a thin trail of silver marking his path youre awake i stared at the vacant space tickednot because i had come in here searching for my bag and forgetting that the room was empty but because he looked scared he ought to be why didnt you wake me up i exclaimed tucking my shirt in as he spilled dust coated with chimney soot kisten was alone all night and hes not answering his phone are you okay he asked coming too close and i pulled back my neck protesting apart from falling asleep in the middle of my bloody day and leaving kisten alone yeah i said sarcastically weight on one foot why didnt you wake me jenkss wings dropped in pitch and he landed on the mantel he called after you fell asleep said he was moving underground to lessen the chance that anyone would hurt you to get to him you needed the sleep he said sounding eerily relieved and besides piscary might not think the focus is worth you and kisten both his features tightened and he couldnt seem to keep his wings from moving my urge to race to nicks apartment slid into a general worry and i focused on jenks standing nervously on the fireplace kisten went underground without telling me he called before sundown i asked i didnt want to feel guilty that my not being there forced him out into the open jenks shrugged and i muttered why didnt you wake me up jenks reached to clean the soot from his wings like a tiny cat his distress clear he said you needed the sleep kisten going underground was the best thing for everyone yeah i shot back sourly if hes not careful hes going to be permanently underground frowning i headed back to the kitchen and some coffee he went into hiding in what a towel and a smile and what was it with this human time clock i was on anyway jenks took to the air to follow me rache kisten was right i wouldnt want you there either whenever whoever piscary gave kisten to finds him why because i might save his ass i exclaimed frustrated as i stood in the sun and dumped out yesterdays coffee it was a painful reminder that ivy was gone shed never let the coffee sit like that my arm hurt and i held it as i ran the water to rinse out the pot damn it jenks letting a vampire drain someone to death as a thankyou is twisted and sick especially when the person being murdered thinks its acceptable piscary is an animal you think i like that hes the only one i can go to for protection you think i like giving the focus to him if i thought hed do anything other than stick it into hiding id give it to someone else but i wont let kisten die jenkss wings drooped as he landed beside mr fish the sun shining through them to make sparkles on my hands feeling like an ass for my outburst i put cold water in the pot and wiped it dry with a hand towel sorry i said knowing that this animal was my best longterm insurance to stay alive how did i get here depressed i pushed the coffeepot away not feeling up to making coffee anymore kisten must think im a boob for falling asleep i muttered he knew you were tired his brow was creased and he sounded almost bitter dont worry about him kisten probably has plans you dont even know about jenks lifted into the air and gave himself a shake to sift the last of the soot into the sink besides ive got some news thats going to make you piss your pants i didnt want to hear whatever gossip he had dug up and i held my upper arm and tried to remember where i had left my shoulder bag i had to talk to kisten damn it this wasnt fair he was running away like an old cat to die in the woods that was the terrifying partthat he accepted his murder willingly like he deserved to be treated like a thing listen to me jenks said with a false eagerness as he got in front of me youre not going to believe who called this morning i felt funny standing in my sundrenched kitchen with jenks hovering closetoo closewhile i tried to remember where i had left my bag my hand had crept up to my neck and i forced it down i was getting the oddest feelinglike i should have a string around my finger or something confused i focused on jenks kisten isnt answering his phone where is he tinks titties rache he exclaimed his wings clattering get off it let the man be a man besides if you call or go see him theyll find him that much sooner i slumped against the sink stymied there was that my car was well known and i wasnt about to take the bus and risk getting stranded somewhere giving up on finding my bag i headed into the bathroom as a mildly pressing need grew worse are you sure hes okay i asked rubbing my arm through jenkss shirt that was the last time i was going to sleep in ivys chair it was harder than it looked trust me jenks followed me in with a soft almost subliminal hum going to see him wont help him at all make everything worse let it go rache it was excellent advicethough not any i wanted to takeand i sourly stared at jenks standing on the washer lid with his feet spread and his hands on his hips i had to use the bathroom but he looked immovable do you mind i said and he sat down his wings stilling i couldnt make him leave and i wasnt going to use the can with him sitting there so i grabbed my toothbrush my mouth tasted like dead weeds and i put an extra glop of minty toothpaste on the brush you know where he is dont you i accused while i leaned over the sink to check out my perfect teeth and when jenks flushed i continued he left without his clothes he went to a girlfriends house didnt he someone who doesnt have any ties to piscary jenks said nothing avoiding my gazeand looking really really guilty i knew that kisten had someone he was tapping for blood and the fact that whoever it was might willingly defy piscary if worse came to worst was a guilty relief besides a vampire chick was probably tougher than me in a pitched fight as long as she didnt hand him over if she does im going to freaking kill her i thought in a pang of angst then prayed id never have to make that decision how long until you can get yourself cleaned up jenks said and i made a telling face ah ot icker if ou werent in ere i said around the foam ticked off that jenks knew where kisten was and i didnt if i really pressed him jenks would tell me probably even come with me to keep my ass above the grass when the bad guys followed me to kistens hideout crap on toast i dont like feeling this helpless jenkss wings blurred glenn called he said as if it were a great honor whoopdeeefreakingdo mmmm i prompted around the toothbrush my hair was down about my shoulders and i frowned as i brushed my teeth jenkss kids work usually had to be picked apart but this braid was completely gone i winced when my toothbrush hit my inner lip bending over the sink i spit eyes widening at the thread of pink in with the paste what does glenn want i asked as i leaned to the mirror and curled my lower lip down to see a red line when did i do that more tabasco sauce hes got a warrant jenks said hovering so close that i had to back up until there were twin images of nervous pixy between me and my reflection or he will soon okay now i was interested for who i rinsed and spit glad there was no more blood jenks grinned looking relieved for trent my head jerked up what i shouted he did it glenn got a warrant why didnt you tell me silver dust slipped from jenks and he returned to the washer he has the verbal okay and hes on his way to the fibs headquarters in detroit to get the original paperwork thats why i let you sleep he doesnt want you to do anything until he has the papers in his hand hours yet you need any help in the kitchen holy crap i exclaimed pulse quickening i looked at what i was wearing then at the shower fingers undoing a button i had to get cleaned up this was just too cool it was you jenks said his features glowing with pride thanks to your tip that trent confessed to the murders glenn got approval to take another crack at bretts body he lifted a print off bretts toenail before they moved him back to a person and destroyed it it matched one they got from trent from when you got him hauled in last year hot damn i whispered too excited to be disgusted that i had more than trents admission that he had abducted tortured and killed another person in the name of whatever holy mission he thought he was on ive got to get dressed i have to go to work i put a hand to my snarled hair and hesitated uh glenns going to let me bring him in right yup jenks hovered an inch from the cool porcelain wings faintly humming he said hes turning this over to you seeing as youre just a minute i want to get this right he said youre not a detective person but a smackthemupandbringthemin person all he wants is for you to wait until he has the paperwork in his hands thats why hes going up there to get it himself hes afraid it will get lost in the fax machine or something i didnt blame him not for one glorious moment ecstatic i headed to the kitchen to see if i needed to make anything ive got a warrant for trent for murder i said sliding the last yard or so in my socks to land in the threshold im going to tag him im going to get him off my back for good and i dont have to rescue a demon familiar to do it jenks was smiling at me you are so funny he said its like christmas for you okay i said feeling the blood thrum in me as i found the sunbright kitchen the window was open but still the faint scent of yew from the forget potion id been planning on making for newt lingered let me think you going to be around this afternoon jenks im going to need your help like i would miss this he was grinning looking happy and relaxed beaming i threw my charm cupboard open and ran my hands through my amulets i had enough of everything except disguise amulets but i wouldnt need them to bring in cincys favorite bad boy i have to take a shower i said excited as i limped across the kitchen are you sure kistens okay jenks landed on the spigot his fitfully moving wings sending flashes of morning light everywhere i expect hes exactly the way he was when you left him i had to trust that and hed be okay now until the sun went down as jenks had said the is was probably watching me and would relay my movements to whoever was looking for kisten actually that might make tagging trent more difficult unless get yourself cleaned up i said to jenks as i headed for the shower we have a wedding to go to what jenks yelped as he followed youre going to arrest trent at his wedding why not i halted in the threshold to the bathroom my hand was on the doorframe but i didnt want to shut the door on him its the only place ill be able to tag him without him siccing quen on me not to mention the is bothering me i am invited i felt my expression grow hard and piscary probably id rather talk to him there than on his own turf this was going to work in so many ways it was perfect jenkss sigh was loud rachel youre cruel right i said eyebrows rising like trent really wants to marry ellasbeth shrugging he darted out of the kitchen shouting to matalina if she knew where his good bow was i got the shower going and stripped my motions slowing as i found that my hip was sore from ivys chairand my foot i prodded the swollen tender tissue as i waited for the water to warm thinking i was way too young to get sore from sleeping in a chair but the water was hot and when i got into it it soothed all the aches away kist was in hiding and i could barter for his safetyour safety once dusk fell but before that i got to pick up trent at last damn this was going to be a good day thirtythree i put a hand out to brace myself against the seat ahead of me as the bus bounced forward through the heavy fog gears slipping taking my car to trents wedding would have been easier but this was safer when it came to getting pulled over by the is and hauled in for driving with a suspended license then there was the little question of the ugly dent someone had put into my front fender along with breaking the left turn light it had happened somewhere between yesterday and today and it ticked me off that it might have been the is trying to up the citations i eyed my red nails peeping past the long lace sleeve thinking the black weave looked nice against my pale skin my shoulder bag sat beside me and jenks was swinging from a ceiling strap the silver dust sifting from him making a bright spot on the otherwise dim bus it was crowded but everyone was giving me loads of room smirking i glanced at my black buttkicking boots showing past the hem of the delicate silk dress and wondered why okay even i knew the boots didnt go with the dress but i wasnt going to tag trent in heels no one would see them anyway i didnt know which dress ellasbeth had picked out but i wasnt going to wear that ugly green thing god id be the laughingstock of the is besides my foot still hurt and heels would have me in agony nervous i squinted in the glare of the oncoming traffic we were almost to the basilica and my pulse was quickening i had my splat gun in a thigh holster keasley had given melike i could really believe he was just a harmless old man nowand a spindle of line energy in my head the present on my lap held the focus i had gone out and picked it up as a general delivery at the post office this afternoon trent wasnt getting it but it was better than trying to find a place for it in my bag still full of the accumulated crap of the week i thought it ironic that i had used the carefully preserved paper and bow from ceris gift to wrap it i looked up from the floor in anxiety ceri had come over after hearing what i was going to do and though shed pursed her lips in disapproval shed helped the pixies braid my hair and work in the flowers i looked gorgeous except for my boots she had asked if i needed backup i told her that was jenkss job the reality was i didnt want to see her and ellasbeth in the same room some things you just dont do i wasnt too worried about making this run with only jenks as backup i had the law on my side and in a room full of witnesses a publicityconscious trent was going to come quietly after all he was up for reelection next year which was probably why he was getting married the flop if he was going to kill me it would be a private affair at least thats what i was telling myself brakes huffing we turned a sharp corner the old woman across from me was eyeing my present and when her gaze dropped to my boots i shifted my knees so my dress would cover them jenks snickered and i frowned we were almost there and i shuffled through my bag for my cuffs enduring the looks as i hiked up the dress and clipped them onto the thigh holster carefully adjusting the slip and dress back over it theyd jingle when i walked but that was okay i glanced at the cute guy three seats down and he nodded as if telling me they were hidden i turned my phone to vibrate and went to tuck it in a pocket frowning when i realized the dress didnt have one sighing i tucked it in my meager cleavage getting a thumbsup from mr three seats down the plastic was cold and i started when it slipped a little too far i couldnt wait for glenn to call me with the news he had the warrant in his hand id talked to him a few hours ago and hed made me promise to do nothing until he did till then id be the perfect bridesmaid in black lace a smile curved up the edges of my lips yeah this was going to be fun jenks dropped to the back of the seat ahead of me better stand up he said were almost there my focus sharpened the blocky structure of the cathedral loomed ahead the floodlights bathing it in a beautiful glow in the fog and almost full moonlight tension spiked hiking my bag onto my shoulder i held my present close and stood the drivers attention flicked to me and he pulled off the entire bus went silent and my skin crawled as i edged to the front all eyes on me thank you i muttered as the driver opened the door then jerked back when my dress caught on a screw poking out of the ceilingtofloorbar maam the driver said as i laboriously unhooked it pardon my asking but why are you taking the bus to a wedding because im going to arrest the groom and i didnt want the is stopping me en route i said flippantly then flounced down the steps jenkss dust putting gold sparkles in my hair the door sighed shut behind me but the bus didnt move i glanced through the door at the driver and he motioned for me to cross in front of him either he was a gentleman or he wanted to see me walk into the church in my beautiful bridesmaid dress and kickass boots jenks snickered pulling the damp air deeply into my lungs i ignored the faces pressed against the window hiked up my dress to keep it from getting dirty and crossed the oneway street through the fog glowing from the buss headlamps an usher waited in a pool of humid light the big burly guy taking a stance at the top of the stairs before the doors ill get him jenks said you might mess up your hair naaaah i said conscious of the bus behind me now tilting since everyone was on the one side watching ill do it thats my girl he said will you be okay for a second i want to do a periphery yup i said taking the steps with my dress hitched up high jenks zipped off and when i reached the landing before the doors i settled my dress and smiled at the guy he was dark like quen and i wondered if he was one of the withons personal attendants im sorry maam he said with a soft surferboy accent the wedding has started youll have to wait and join the party at the reception youre not nearly as sorry as youre going to be if you dont get out of my way i thought it a fair enough warning but he saw the pretty dress and the present in my hands and assumed flake okay i was a flake but i was a flake in asskicking boots i went to edge past him and he touched my shoulder oooooooh big mistake jenks came back right about then whooping as i spun gripping the guards wrist and swinging my elbow into his nose without ever dropping the present oh that had to hurt the pixy cried as the man stumbled back hand over his broken nose eyes tearing and hunched in pain sorry i said shaking out my dress i drew myself up and pulled on the door from behind me came a harsh toot from the bus framed in the threshold i turned and gave them all a bunnyeared kisskiss still the man wasnt unconscious and i ought to move before he remembered to do something i strolled in my dress getting me past the hangerson between the front doors and the christening pool with no resistance save whispers adrenaline shivered through me as a wave of flower scents hit me the church was dim with candlelight and the soft intonations of the holy guy up front created a sensation of comfort by the looks of it they were just getting started good i had to go along with this until i got glenns call and i didnt know when that would be someone in the back row turned starting a slow chain reaction my pace hobbled and i took a deep breath shit the mayor was here and takata oh god i was going to arrest trent in front of takata talk about performance anxiety as expected piscary was in the front row with ivy and skimmer and i stifled a surge of anger at him for giving kisten to someone to murder for some twisted pleasure and the clout he had with the is to get away with it but i needed his help so as much as i hated it id have to be damningly politically correct i couldnt look at ivy not yet but i recognized her stiff carriage from under a gray widebrimmed hat beside piscary ivys dad was here too and what had to be her mother beside him looking like an ice queen from asia next to his elegant rugged fatigue mr ray and mrs sarong made an unusual showing together banding up since they lacked their usual packs al was standing up with trent and catching sight of me he grinned the pureal expression looking odd on lees strongly asian features quen was beside him his face blank he mouthed something at trent and ellasbeths grip on his arm tightened the brides side was entirely full of thin tan people they hadnt listened to me and they all dressed all alike to look as if they were extras from a spielberg movie at a hollywood commissary i thought they ought to be more careful if they didnt want their little secret to get out jeez they all looked the same to me the holy guys spiel faltered when the usher stumbled in from outside i glanced back in warning seeing his hand still over his nose a white handkerchief stained with blood piscary slowly turned drawn by the scent of blood he smiled delightedly at me making my own blood burn he knew i hated him and he liked it the usher went pale at piscarys attention and when quen motioned for him to leave he beat a hasty retreat trying to hide the blood sure about this rache jenks said you could always retire and open a charm shop i thought of kisten a spike of fear coming from nowhere im sure hiking up my shoulder bag i tucked the focus under an arm and headed for the altar jenks took to the rafters and whispers started in my wake the eyes of cincys finest were on me and as my boots smeared the flower petals i prayed that i wouldnt slip on them and fall on my ass the holy guy gave up trying to remember his place and fumbled in his bible for his crib sheet jowls shaking while he tried to act normal that he was ignoring me spoke volumes quen inclined his head at me and when the holy guys voice faltered to a stop trent turned okay ill admit it he was absolutely stunning in his white tux his almost translucent fair hair perfect the tips shifting in the slight draft elegant and polished he made anger look damn good from his blackorchid boutonniere to his embroidered socks he was the apex of elite power and grace and he was really really ticked by the choleric look in his green eyes ellasbeth spun with him her elaborate dress with the arranged train rustling all over creation if trent was stunning she was stunning taken to the nth power her icy beauty done up with perfect makeup and an exquisite gown her defined cheekbones were faintly blushing and i marveled that the makeup artist had managed to hide her tan and give her a porcelain beauty her hair still looked like a cheap imitation of trents though especially in the candlelight the maid of honor was in that ugly green dress and i gave her an apologetic wince figures ellasbeth would have picked that one sorry im late i said cheerfully my voice loud in the expectant silence i was held up on the bus traffic you know setting the focus in its disguise of a wedding gift on the steps i shuffled off my shoulder bag and settled in behind the maid of honor clasping my hands demurely before me yeah right rachel trent started his hand slipping from ellasbeths no no go on i said making shooing motions though my insides were wound tighter than a pixy on brimstone im all set ellasbeths painted lips were pressed tight a veil would have been nice i thought then mused disparagingly upon my own makeup slapped on almost at the last minute green eyes vehement she took trents arm and turned her back on me shoulders trembling the holy guy cleared his throat and started in where he had left off talking about devotion understanding and forgiveness i tuned him out i had to get my pulse down i might be here a while the cathedral was beautiful the scent of queen annes lace faint in the closed air flowers decked every available flat surface and a few vertical ones with little bouquets pinned to ribbons there were exotic vines and lilies but it was the simpler blooms i liked the best the worldrenowned stainedglass windows were muted from the fog and moonlight and the shadows of the nearby trees moved against them in the breeze like dragons circling the candlelight flickered and the smooth voice of the holy guy was like dust given resonance i blinked when i realized al was making eyes at me from across the coupletobe beside him quen was scowling they were in marvelous black tuxes that looked like dress uniforms from a classic eighties space opera nervous i adjusted my dress id gotten a spot on it somewhere and i wished i had a bouquet to hide it with but thats what you get when youre late i turned my attention to the audience to find jenkss twinkle in the rafters he was dusting heavily and takata sneezed in the artificial sunbeam he was making bless you i mouthed to him and his bushy eyebrows rose the middleaged rock star looked worried but the scarred were woman beside himripley his drummerwas clearly amused thank god takata was in a suit instead of the orange monstrosity hed been wearing the one time id seen him he even had his blond tangle of curls in order and i could see the charm about his neck that did it glancing over the congregation he mouthed back what are you doing working i said without a sound i glanced at mr ray and mrs sarong behind him they look like little kids plotting i wouldnt worry about it it would be over soon finally i grew brave and looked at ivy fear slid through me she was numb blank and empty id seen that look on her before but never this deep she had shut herself down beautiful in her elegant gray dress and a widebrimmed hat she looked remarkably like her mother a pew behind her she sat stiffly between skimmer and piscary the blond living vampire glared at me jealously clearly part of piscarys camarilla now despite the little detail that the city had let piscary out because of al not her skills in the courtroom i had to believe ivy would be all right i couldnt rescue her she had to save herself seeing my pain at ivys state piscary smiled at me mocking and confident my breath hissed in when my demon scar sent a surge of tingling sensation through me damn it i hadnt counted on that ticked i mouthed at him i want to talk to you piscary inclined his head looking fabulous in some authentic outfit from egypt apparently thinking i wanted to discuss ivy he lifted her slack hand and kissed the top of it i stiffened suddenly realizing that trent was watching me out of the corner of his eye actually the entire church was paying more attention to me and piscary than the couple on the stage if ellasbeths clenched jaw was any indication she was pissed grimacing i tried to find a kickass posture while wearing a lace dress and flowers in my hair not ivy i mouthed i want your protection both me and kisten ill make it worth your while piscary seemed confused at my request but he nodded deep in thought als amused grin went sour and behind takata mr ray and mrs sarong started talking in hushed voices that every inderlander could probably catch skimmers satisfaction turned to hatred and ellasbeth ellasbeth was gripping trents arm hard enough to make her knuckles white the tinkling sounds of someones phone burst rudely out into the solemn cadence of the holy guys speech and my eyes widened it was coming from me oh my god i thought mortified as i jammed my fingers down my cleavage scrambling it was my phone damn it jenks i thought glaring at the ceiling as nice day for a white wedding played out i had put it on vibrate damn it i had put it on vibrate face flaming i finally fished the thing out jenks was laughing from the upper windows and takata had his head in his hands clearly trying not to laugh a nervous titter went through the church and i looked at the incoming number glenn adrenaline hit me excuse me i said really excited i am so sorry i had it on vibrate really takata laughed outright and i reddened upon remembering where id fished it out from ah i have to take this i said ellasbeth was furious and when the holy guy gestured sourly for me to go ahead i flipped it open and turned my back on everyone hi i said softly and my voice echoed im at the kalamack wedding everyones listening whatcha got crap could this get any more awkward there was a crackle of static telling me glenn was still on the road and he said youre at his wedding rachel youre one crazyass witch i halfway turned and shrugged at the holy guy sorry i mouthed but inside i was running full out at least glenn had gotten my unspoken reference to people being able to hear him and would word his responses carefully ive got the paperwork glenn said and my tension spiked you can go to work i shifted my weight to feel the comforting bump of my splat gun hoping i wouldnt need it hey uh jenks never said how much youre going to give me for this oh for christs sake rachel im on the interstate can we discuss this later later gets me nothing i said and the congregation started to stir trent cleared his throat the anger of a thousand desert sunrises in it and i shot him a look behind him quen was starting to look suspicious i wasnt going to get my fee out of them after pulling this little stunt and i wanted something to show apart from my satisfaction of tagging trent i want your department to get my church resanctified i said and a ripple of surprise shifted through the people nothing like waving your dirty laundry in front of cincinnatis finest piscary especially looked interested this had better work or i was dead tomorrow rachel glenn started oh never mind i said nastily ill do this pro bono like i always do for the fib like everyone didnt know who i was talking to by now my back was to the pews but jenks was watching and i felt reasonably safe im calling you some backup glenn said and i put a hand to my forehead good i said around an exhale i dont want to haul my tag in on the bus i heard glenn take a breath to say something and catching trent shifting from the corner of my eye i blurted thanks glenn hey if this doesnt work out you want red roses on your grave right that wasnt it but he had hung up closing the phone i hesitated then dropped it back down my front as i turned trent was not happy that was a fascinating look into your life ms morgan do you do childrens parties too nervousness rose in me quickly followed by a spike of adrenaline it lit through me almost as good as sex my thoughts zinged back to ivy telling me i lived my life making decisions that would put me in dangerous situations just to feel the rush an adrenaline junkie but at least i was making money at it usually ivy she was staring at me a glimmer of fear marring her deep blankness jenks i said loudly and when he chirped his wings quen tensed the congregation gasped when i leaned to pull aside my dress to show my calfhigh boots fumbling with the silk slip i grabbed my cuffs under temporary jurisdiction of the fib im authorized to arrest you trent kalamack for suspicion of the murder of brett markson a unified gasp rose like a wave from the audience thats it ellasbeth shouted and the holy guy snapped his book shut and took a step back trenton ive put up with your little tart of a witch in my bathtub i put up with your insisting she be in my wedding but her arresting you just to stop our marriage is intolerable she was royally pissed and i yanked a pliant trent from his groomsmen quen moved then leapt backward a flash of dragonfly wings between us al was laughing in big booming guffaws but i didnt see anything funny except maybe the witchinhisbathtub comment rachel trents words cut off and his beautiful face went indignant at the twin clicks of metal ratcheting about his wrist quen tried to outflank jenks his pockmarked face dark with anger when jenks stopped him an arrow pointed at his eye try me quen the pixy said and the congregation went silent trent stood with his cuffed hands before him uh uh uh i mocked picking up my shoulder bag and getting ready to bug on out of here trent remind quen what happens if he interferes with me ive got a warrant oh yeah turning to trent i said you have the right to remain silent but i doubt you will you have the right to an attorney which i imagine quen will be calling soon if you cant afford one hell has frozen over and im the princess of oz but in that case one will be appointed to you you understand your rights that the entire congregation of cincys finest have heard me recite green eyes angry he nodded satisfied i tugged his shoulder and started him toward the steps trents mix of anger shock and disbelief gave away to anger call the appropriate lawyer he was saying to quen as i dragged him ellasbeth this wont take long yeah call your lawyer i echoed scooping up the focus als laugher echoed up into the rafters i hesitated waiting for the windows to break or something there was an evil delight to it and it seemed to free the seated people from their shock they burst into a sudden noise of conversation startling me ivys face remained blank beside her piscary too was wideeyed trying to wrap his thoughts around this takata was worried and mr ray and mrs sarong were arguing vehemently jenks i shouted not wanting to walk down that aisle alone and suddenly he was with me got your back rache he said his wings snapping with excitement flying backward with his arrow still aimed at quen lets go bag on one shoulder and focus under an arm i guided trent down the stairs holding his elbow so he wouldnt trip and sue me for unnecessary roughness daaa daaa da dum i got the bastard now echoed in my thoughts in a mockery of the wedding march someones phone snapped a picture and i grinned imagining tonights front page i could hear sirens in the background and i hoped they were the fib come to hustle me off the street and not the i s to arrest me i didnt actually have the warrant but my contact did forgotten by the altar ellasbeth made a frustrated sound of anger trent she cried and i almost felt sorry for the woman this is outrageous how can you let her do this i thought you owned this city trent halfway turned and i steadied him on the steps with a hand on his shoulder i dont own ms morgan dear i need a few hours to sort this out ill join you at the reception god i hoped not as we passed piscary i slowed would you meet me at the fib i said pulse pounding and breathless i have something for you the undead vampire kissed the underside of ivys wrist making her shudder you are utterly inhuman rachel almost as cold as you are audaciously contemptible its a side to you that is delightfully unexpected im most interested in what you have to say not knowing what to make of that i nodded and pushed trent back into motion he was indignant apparently figuring out that i was going to give the vampire the focus hell piscary insured fourfifths of the city and davids company picked up the rest it wasnt hard to figure out i wanted to be added to the list seeing trents understanding i smiled bastard trent ellasbeth shrieked you walk out of this church and im gone im on the plane and im home i agreed to marry you not this this circus you call a life i dont have much choicedear he said over his shoulder will you curb your hysterics and tend to our guests this is a minor glitch minor glitch i was walking sideways nearly missing it when she threw her bouquet at the holy guy screaming quen do something thats what youre paid for my eyebrows rose i was almost to the door and no one had tried to stop me shock was a wonderful tool when used correctly quen looked up from his phone i am ms withon ive already established that morgan is acting within the law and im calling trentons trial lawyer al was laughing tears streaming down his face his hand was against the altar for balance and the flowers on it were turning black being in lees body let him touch it with impunity but he was still a demon and clearly his presence was being noted when we reached the entry way it hit trent that i was really tagging him this is ridiculous rachel he said as i bitchkicked the door open moonlight spilled in through the fog shining on the cement steps this is my wedding day you are way out of line hauling your ass in is justice i said squinting from the flashing fib lights killing brett was out of line he didnt know anything all he wanted was someone to look to i shoved trent through the door before the heavy wood could arc closed then pulled the damp cool night air smelling of garbage and exhaust deep into me relieved to see those fib cruisers officers were all over the place securing the area before anyone could follow me out hey hi i called while i waved wanting to be sure they knew i was the good guy i got him hes all yours just tell me where to put him i headed toward the nearest cruiser pushing trent before me trust me trent i said when we found the pavement youll thank me for this someday i didnt think you cared about my happiness ms morgan he said as an excited officer touched his cap and opened the door for him i dont i said shortly watch yourself i put my hand on the back of his head feeling a jolt of everafter try to surge to him checking it just in time shaken for my lack of control i shoved him into the car and slammed the door shut it was noisy and i blinked when i realized the bus was still there i waved and everyone waved back the driver tooting the horn satisfied i stood a little taller and slicked my hair back out of my eyes damn when i was bad i was good thirtyfour the hem of my lacy bridesmaid dress whispered over the cracked gray tile in eddens office sitting hunched in the chair before his desk i nervously bobbed my foot the fib captain had taken possession of my elbow the moment i crossed the federal inderland bureau seal inlaid in the floor of the lobby dragging me into his office and telling his guide rose to keep me here before stomping out in search of coffee his son glenn and a first impression that didnt come from me that had been ten minutes ago unless he was grinding the beans himself or waiting for glenn to get back from detroit i figured hed come in knowing more than i did the jitters had started it was growing noisy in the lobby voices raised in protest and demand by the sound of it the entire wedding party was out there i glanced at jenks perched on eddens pencil cup he looked unusually nervous having opted to stay with me instead of hanging with edden as was his habit when we were at the fib leaving the present on the floor i stood to shake out my dress and went to peek past the blinds i was getting the distinct idea that edden hadnt known i was going after trent kalamack this evening maybe we shouldve gone to the is jenks said his wings making a distracting hum the is i said turning to gape at him are you crazy it sounded as if mr ray was close to losing it and wincing i reached for the blinds jerking my hand back when the door scraped open edden stomped in the muscular almost squat man so close to my height that it didnt matter he was in his usual khakis and white shirt with the sleeves rolled up but the outfit had lost its justpressed look sometime between dragging me in here and getting the two waxedpaper cups of capped coffee he had sandwiched between a hairy arm and chest feeling guilty i let the blinds slip from my fingers the lacy dress made me feel stupid and i tucked a wayward strand that had escaped my elaborate braid behind an ear and stood with my hands clasped before me like fig leaves i felt about as vulnerable as if i had been naked too edden had been instrumental in helping me save my butt when id quit the is but he had his own bosses to please and he didnt look happy of all the humans id met only his adopted son glenn and my old boyfriend nick were more comfortable with my being not human his round face creased he set both coffees on the desk and dropped into his chair on the exhale captain edden was not tall and the first hints of a soft widening of his waist added to his comfortable latefifties look his military background showed in his quick mannerisms and slow decisions only accentuated by the black hair cropped close to his skull lacing his stubby fingers across his middle he stared at me in annoyance his mustache was showing more gray than it had last time and i couldnt help but cringe at the accusing look in his brown eyes jenks clattered his wings as if in apology and the captain glanced at him as if he ought to have known better before turning his disapproving attention back to me would you be more comfortable running my department from my chair rachel he said and i shifted forward to take a coffee just to have something between him and me what did you think you were doing arresting kalamack at his own wedding he added and i sat down the focus between my feet as if this were good news jenks brightened flying up to land closer to the fib captain to look satisfied and relieved i thought it totally unfair that though jenks and i were partners id be the only one to suffer for any trouble we got into pixies were never held accountable for their actions but then they usually didnt involve themselves this deep in big people affairs if i arrested him anywhere else he would have buried me i said singeing my finger and spilling some coffee when i removed the lid disgusted with myself i sopped up the rivulet with my worn shoulder bag before it could drip to my dress jeez i felt like one of those wackos haunting fountain square with my ratty bag my wrapped gift holding the focus and wearing a gown that cost more than a semester of tuition you being dead would make my life easier eddens face was tight when he leaned to get his coffee listen to that he exclaimed gesturing at the unseen lobby my people dont know how to handle this thats why the is exists and you bring them all here to me i thought you knew what i was doing i said glenn my words cut off when edden lifted a hand his anger slid away replaced with a rueful pride for his adopted son no he muttered his eyes dropping to the desk he slipped the paperwork in with the requisitions for the company picnic youre invited by the way thanks i said wondering if id live that long depressed i took a sip of coffee glad the fib had their priorities in order and bought the good stuff edden frowned his pride at glenns bucking the system to further justice now fading back to anger kalamack left the species box blank on his statement he said you know what that means i took a breath to answer but he had rushed ahead with it means hes not saying if hes inderland or human and is accepting fib jurisdiction i have to deal with this me and you want me to pay you for dumping this crap on me my jaw clenched he broke the law i said hotly the unusually enlightened human sighed his entire body moving yes he did for a moment there was silence then edden took the lid off his coffee piscary is in my lobby he said tightly he says you want to talk to him how am i supposed to keep you alive through your testimony when piscary comes to my department to kill you i glanced at jenks who was starting to shed a faint trail of glittering dust in agitation piscary didnt come here to kill me i said hiding my jitters behind a sip of coffee i asked him here i want to arrange some protection from him for me and kisten edden went markedly still as i guiltily swallowed more coffee and set the cup down the acidic drink hit my stomach where it sat to make me feel ill piscary was a sick wackoand the only one who could protect me and rescind kistens blood gift youre buying protection from piscary edden shook his head his few wrinkles deepening he wants you dead you put him in jail hes not going to forget that just because hes out and the word is he made a blood gift out of your boyfriend his gaze fell from mine in shame rachel im sorry i cant do anything about that a hot feeling of betrayal rose through me of innocence lost i knew that nothing could stop piscary from getting away with treating kisten like a box of godiva but damn it these were the people who were supposed to keep us safe from the bigbaduglies i hated this but what i hated more was that i had to work in such a depraved system to stay alive like i have much choice im sorry edden said again and i glanced at him ruefully so he would know that i understood his position hell i was standing right next to him jenkss wings clattered and i shifted the split in my dress to show the present sitting between my feet my buttkicking boots looked really odd down there but i was glad id worn them ive got something he wants more than revenge i said praying i hadnt overestimated its worth though it grated on every fiber of my being this had to work it had to edden bent forward to see the bluefoiled package then leaned back i dont want to know whats in there i really dont want to know i let my hem cover it i thought this was the safest place to hammer out an agreement with piscary i said meekly my office he barked well i hedged maybe a conference room eddens brown eyes went wide in disbelief and i started to get a little upset edden i cajoled i dont have anywhere else to go kalamack is responsible for the deaths of those weres im trying to save my own butt here all i have to do is swim through the crap to get to it now are you going to throw me a preserver or do i have to dog paddle the whole way by myself he tilted his head to see the clock on the wall above and behind him i could almost read his thoughts why couldnt i have waited a few hours when he would have been offshift i wish you would include me in your thought processes he said dryly just pretend youre still in the military i said hearing our conversation ending yeah he said with a rueful chuckle as he stood id be safer on a front line than working with you he took up his coffee and gestured to the door after you the sooner were done with this the sooner i can go home jenkss wings buzzed to life and i stood taking a moment to gather my present my bag and my composure the butterflies had turned to fireflies cramping my stomach edden opened the door and when the noise hit me i balked thinking about how i needed the rush of danger to remind myself i was alive adrenaline junkie i was embarrassed to admit that jenks was probably right it explained way too many things for me to simply dismiss because it was a stupid way to live i couldnt help but wonder if i hadnt misjudged the risk this time and if it was going to turn around and bite me but some of this wasnt my fault landing upon my shoulder jenks said that little charm shop is looking mighty good right about now eh rache shut up jenks i muttered but i let him stay where he was needing him edden came to a halt beside roses desk and gazed over the maelstrom of officers trying to deal with upset inderlanders they looked as if they were doing okay maybe the essays edden had asked me to write up for their handbook were helping piscary was standing off a little by himself his inquiring eyes on me and his grip possessively on ivy as skimmer spoke lawyer to a nervous woman with a clipboard they were all sitting down and my heart clenched at ivys blank stare it was like she wasnt there the news crews were visible through the black windows lights glaring in the fog as they clustered outside the doors like wannabes trying to get into a club i meant to tell you thats a pretty dress the captain said not looking at me as he rocked from heel to toe with his hands behind his back the boots are a nice touch i looked at them and sighed my foot hurts they help my foot my arm my backthey all ached like crazy i felt like id been in a fight not sleeping in ivys chair god i hope shes okay edden chuckled at my dry sarcasm i thought you simply liked stomping around in them turning away he gestured for a thin officer who looked less harried than the rest i hope you can work something out for your boyfriend jenkss wings fanned faster thanks i said carefully tucking away a strand of hair why dont you find a nice witch edden said shifting back a step to make room for the approaching officer take the opportunity to get some space between you and mr felps i care what happens to you and i hate to see you getting involved in vampire politics people die when they do that i couldnt help my smile gee thanks dad can i have my driving privileges back his eyes glinted youre grounded until you clean up your room and you know it from my shoulder came a tiny snort but jenks was too close to see clean my room i suppose that was a suitable metaphor i had certainly put the city in a mess the officer that edden had pulled from the melee stopped expectantly before us and edden drew him close wheres kalamack ms morgan needs a room and i dont want her anywhere near him i huffed in insult and the man gave me an apologetic glance hes in five but three is available he said no way i said tightly i am not getting in a little interview room with piscary i want a conference room big enough so that i can have a few witnesses and kick some vampire ass if i need to edden crossed his arms over his chest to turn immovable witnesses witnesses i gripped the focus tighter this wouldnt work unless everyone knew i didnt have it anymore i want mr ray and mrs sarong i turned to look over the open offices each one occupied with a belligerent inderlander and one or two nervous but doggedly determined fib officers quen i said finding him standing alone and on the phone as if none of this was touching him and al i finished finding the demon flirting with the receptionist now glowing from the attention of someone she thought was a wealthy eligible bachelor in a tux ellasbeths dad was behind him the upright man looking like he was ready to whip out his checkbook right here if it would help get his daughter married al edden said following my gaze to his receptionist handing her phone number to the smiling man thats mr saladan piscary said he exorcised the demon from him my people have seen him in the sun i shook my head feeling als gaze on me piscarys lying thats still al the fib officer with the clipboard paled thats a demon he squeaked eddens brow furrowed putting a thick hand on each of our shoulders he turned our backs to the room all the while scanning the surrounding people to decide if they had heard him rachel he said voice hushed but intent im not set up to deal with this situation his hand was warm through the lace on my shoulder and i shivered neither am i but here i am i can do this edden i just need a quiet room your people dont have to do anything no ones going to get hurt but i couldnt promise it he was silent in thought deep concern in his gaze he looked at the package in my hands then turned to the officer with us how messy is camelot camelot i mused and the man in question fidgeted i could smell his fear on him and piscary was watching him its full of mailings the officer said junes newsletters still have to go out eddens frown deepened its the only room with a twoway that will hold all of them twoway i scoffed i want a room not an fib audience im not going to let you go into a room alone with those people edden said you put me here morgan and youre going to do it my way jenks stifled a snicker and i cocked my hip copping an attitude in black lace and buttkicking boots whatever i said knowing i was at his mercy satisfied edden drew the fib officer even closer grab a couple of guys and get the table cleared off and have someone get ms morgans wish list in there my neck grew cold as jenks took flight ill get them he offered and the fib officer looked relieved edden started to protest but upon seeing jenks already fronting the two weres he hesitated piscary was next falling into step behind them from his corner quen closed his phone and rocked forward before jenks reached him giving the pixy a nod al noticed the mass exodus and joined them kissing the receptionists hand in farewell damn edden swore softly taking my elbow and angling us to the top of the hallway ahead of them i need to get me a pixy on the payroll i couldnt help my smile theyre expensive i warned him the comforting blank walls took us in and the noise behind us dulled i thought they worked for sugar water and nectar edden said and i slowed as i noticed we were passing interrogation rooms i meant in terms of loyalty i clarified pulling him to a stop when i found trents room a soft murmur came from behind the door and when he saw my expression eddens face went hard there was one more person i wanted to be present quen wasnt enough i wanted trent no edden said clearly knowing why id stopped then pressed back against the walls as the weres al quen and piscary all passed before us in silent expectation mrs sarongs heels clicked smartly and al gave me an amused grin over his smoked glasses quen was silent his shoulders tense under the expensive fabric of his tux jenks was with them and i gave him a nod as he went along to serve as my ears skimmer and ivy were with piscary and my heart clenched as ivy did nothing when i tried to catch her eyes she looked pale and empty her perfect face still blank and beautiful graceful in her sophisticated gray dress it hurt to see her like that and the memory of her voice rang in my head the broken sound when she had begged me to keep the sun away from her after piscary had raped her body and her blood and she thought she was dead pulling back i forced myself to keep from reaching out to give her a shake piscary smiled in smug satisfaction at my pain his hand upon the small of her back as he guided her forward i watched until they turned the corner how could i do nothing how could i stand here and watch her go by without doing something she was my friend hell she was more and with that thought i felt my face go cold kisten and ivy offered me the same chance at finding blood ecstasy kistens offer packaged in a way my upbringing would have no problem dealing with yet id said no to him continually all the while i was courting disaster trying to battle both my preconceived notions of myself and the risk of death to find the same thing with ivy why and i closed my eyes shutting out the world as i hammered the thought home i wanted something lasting with ivy yes this spring i had come to grips with the idea that id probably moved into the church unconsciously hoping shed bite me true i had beaten her off a few times before in fear but i couldnt bring myself to do it anymore if the van incident this spring was any indication i made no apology for wanting to try to find a blood balance with her but only now did i realize what that meant i was talking about a life commitment just because it might not involve sex didnt make it any less important or lasting no way rachel edden said and i stared in panic until i realized he was talking about my wanting trent with us not the possibility of ivy and me together bound by blood and friendship that it didnt necessarily preempt a secondary more traditional relationship with a manwith kistonly added to the scary factor eddens head tilted in confusion at my deerintheheadlights expression and i dropped my gaze feeling dizzy crap why did i always pick the best times to figure things out i need trent there i said pressing the focus to my middle if he doesnt see me give this thing to piscary then it doesnt do me any good edden grimaced making his mustache stick out quen can tell him the door to trents interrogation room opened cutting our argument short the fib officer stopped but it was too late trent had followed him out accompanied by a second man in a suit his lawyer probably trent looked totally unlike himself yet nothing significant had changed he was still dressed in his wedding finery he still walked with grace but there was an eerie wariness that had been absent before his gaze fastened on mine with the usual intensity but the edge of icy hatred was new disturbingly controlled he drew himself upright hiding the fatigue born of his efforts to lie his way out of his heinous crimes trent needs to be there i blurted trying to muddle things more hes a council member until proven guilty and he needs to be present this involves the citys security you want to wait around for someone else to show up youre pretty good if you think you can put a master vampire in a room with two alpha weres a demon and a a whatever quen is i said remembering to keep his elven heritage a secret rachel edden warned but i had given trent all he needed if there is a city security issue i have a right to be present he said regaining a modicum of his usual crisp presence trent didnt know what i was doing but clearly i was trying to include him in it and despite his probably wanting to put out a contract on me for tagging him hed go along with it all things in their own time apparently the officer and the suit flanking him had a hushed conversation and when the fib guy shrugged edden sighed damn it rachel he muttered squeezing my elbow this is not how i do things tired i said nothing as i waited for his decision my thoughts went to ivy then kist the squat exmilitary man rubbed a hand over his chin and took a firmer stance im in there with two other men just you and you can cuff him to a chair i came back trents frown deepened until it showed on his forehead we all had to press back against the walls as three harriedlooking officers carrying boxes of blue paper and envelopes passed apparently the room was cleaned up and i started getting nervous again all right edden said sourly mr kalamack would you please accompany me ms morgan seems to want to have a town meeting well get you back to your processing as soon as possible so you can make bail bail i thought not having imagined they would even offer it trent saw my startled expression and he allowed a hint of smugness to show thank you captain i would appreciate that jenks flitted into the hallway to hover by the door okay rache theyre all yours mine i thought as i steadied myself and followed edden and trent but what by tinks little red shoes was i supposed to do with them now that i had them thirtyfive edden escorted trent into the room ahead of me hesitating in the hall i tugged the lacy collar of my dress straight tucked a stray curl behind an ear hiked my shoulder bag up took a tighter grip on the wrapped present and wished i could run to the bathroom charm shop jenks taunted from my shoulder and i made a rude noise there was a mild stir as everyone reacted to trents appearance it wasnt going to get any easier knowing that ivy was already in there i squared my shoulders and walked in i scanned the room and saw where the camelot remark had come from a round table with its attendant half circle of chairs took up the right side of the large rectangular room between it and the twoway mirror to my left was a wide space that gave me the impression of a stage at the far right was a coffeestained counter with a sink covered in anything anyone could possibly use to put together a presentation tatty binder clips scratched report covers threehole paper punches and a massive paper cutter that looked like it could chop wood for a campfire piscary and ivy sat at the back near the counter skimmers thin grace standing submissively behind them in her strict black business suit a flash of nervousness went through me shortly followed by selfdisgust i was going to buy protection from the same man who had abused ivy and given kistens death to someone as a thankyou gift but what choice did i have someone powerful had to hold the focus it didnt matter whether i liked him or not if he could keep me and kisten alive and prevent a worldwide inderland power struggle the two weres sat near the middle of the table across from the door upon seeing me enter mrs sarong yanked mr ray back into his seat before he could make an ass of himself trent was sitting beside the door with edden looming behind him the elf wasnt in cuffs across from them quen stood with his arms over his chest looking good in his tuxuniform my attention went to al he was a vision of upright elegance in his black tux standing with his back to me before the twoway mirror the demon was breathing heavily on the glass to mist it up using a gloved finger to scribe ley line symbols i couldnt understand i didnt want to imagine the fear of the men and women watching behind the glass al turned beaming over his round smoked glasses rachel mariana morgan he drawled his accent proving that despite looking like lee he was all algaliarept watching you cuff trenton was extreeeemely entertaining what will you do for your next trick glowering beside mrs sarong mr ray grumbled pull a flaming bunny out of her ass maybe quen stifled a smirk and i came forward boots clunking and dress furling jenks left me for the overhead lights in a soft hum only quen and al watched him go the rest clueless as to how much of a threat he was up there the gown made me feel stupid but everyone was overdressed i tried to get ivys attention as i stood at the table a few chairs down with trent between me and al she never looked up her gaze fixed on the nothing and her face peacefully blank skimmer let her hatred show and i ignored the sophisticated pretty blond vamp i set the package and my shoulder bag on the table pushing them together as i gathered my thoughts thanks for meeting me here piscary i said forcing my hand off my aching upper arm you are the foulest thing ive ever seen but i hope we can come to some agreement god im such a hypocrite piscary smiled while petting ivys hand and when al took a breath to say something i turned shut up i demanded and he huffed though i could tell he thought it all a big joke youre here as witnesses all of you thats it there was a nervous shifting of position from everyone but quen and satisfied i touched my stuff on the table and tried not to think about my full bladder okay i said and trent smiled mockingly at my nervousness as you all probably figured out i still have the focus mr ray stiffened and mrs sarongs grip on his wrist tightened ive got the focus i continued when he settled back and all of you want it i sent my gaze to my right trent i imagine you want it for a power play seeing as you offered me an insane amount of money for it and killed three weres but why bring that up we double his offer mrs sarong said crisply and trent laughed outright bitter and mocking it was a new side to him and it wasnt attractive the woman turned scarlet and mr ray hunched over looking uncomfortable its not for sale i said before anyone else could interrupt then turned to piscary piscary you want me dead for obvious reasons i added and so does trent probably by now dont forget me love al said turning his back on the mirror i just want you for an hour one hour and this would all go away jenks clattered his wings in warning and i steadied myself no i said though my stomach was starting to hurt an hour with him would become an eternity mr ray himself tugged out from under mrs sarongs grip give it to me or ill hunt you down like an animal and take it then the man jumped and mrs sarongs smile made me speculate about what she had done to him under the table gold pixy dust sifted down to put the were in a temporary sunbeam and mr ray looked up in surprise clearly having forgotten about jenks wondering if he had just been pixed i stifled a smirk yes i said dryly i know which is why im talking to piscary not you there was a heartbeat of silence and mr ray surged to his feet no he bellowed his round face flashing red you sorry little whippet you cant give it to that undead bast his words cut off when quen put a hand on his shoulder and shoved him down close your mouth quen said listen before you draw your battle lines lest you alienate your allies oh that sounds just peachy damn keen but at least it was quiet shifting my weight to my other foot i glanced at alwho was starting to match mrs sarong in terms of pissedoffness to trent who was clearly thinking furiously and finally to piscary the undead vamp was smiling like the benevolent god he believed he was a honeyhued hand sat atop the pale purity of ivys and i imagined he thought i was going to barter the focus for her and kisten i wanted to but keasley was right she had to escape him on her own or she would never be free of him ill give it to piscary i said as sweat trickled down my spine but i want something all eyes were on me piscarys smile widened he slipped an arm behind ivy and pulled her gently close there was barely a flicker behind her brown eyes ivy is mine he said my breath shook as i exhaled ivy belongs to herself i want you to rescind the blood gift you made of kisten take him back into your camarilla and give me protection from yourself and those yahoos i said as i tossed my head to indicate everyone else in the room i also want my church back and the freedom to pursue my business interests without interference trent stiffened quen uncrossed his arms and took a more balanced stance al turned completely around from where hed been scribing more ley line symbols on the twoway mirror piscary blinked in surprise kisten he murmured in question you want kisten yes i want kisten back under your protection i said belligerently will you rescind his blood gift or not piscary made a small sound of surprised consideration then as if shifting his thoughts he said you would have to restrain from persecuting me of course thats not fair al protested indignantly im trying to get cincinnatis gambling and protection and that gives you an unfair advantage i want a witch on my payroll too i gritted my teeth i will not put myself on piscarys payroll i will not i can work on that i said to piscary it depends upon how much you tick me off the small man in his traditional egyptian robes steepled his fingers in consideration you want me to rescind my gift of kisten take him back into my graces grant you protection from all of them he said with an elegant gesture and have me still be subject to your unique sense of moral outrage als shoes clicked smartly and everyone tensed as he came to the table clearly enjoying everyones unease at his approach al sat with a provocative motion at the head of the table ill say it again rachel mariana morgan youre not shy about asking for things i wished hed stop using all my names look i said seeing edden relax now that the demon was sitting i know what the focus is what it does and that it works ive got it and i wont give it away for nothing my gaze slid to trents and money doesnt keep me alive i can keep you alive he said his gray voice confident though edden stood behind him to cart him off to a cell if he couldnt make bail you underestimate me if you think i cant i grimaced as i remembered him offering me an island to get me out of the city and under his thumb i still didnt know why maybe because hed known that my blood could kindle demon magic but he was afraid of black magic it didnt add up thanks but no i said tightly id rather deal with the undead mrs sarong was looking at my shoulder bag as if she might snatch it and i pulled it closer the focus will cause more turmoil than the turn i cant destroy it without twisting demon magic and despite what you all think i avoid it when i can i took a deep breath turning to piscary im assuming you will keep it hidden and on this side of the lines so the weres dont overthrow vampire superiority i asked and he nodded the light glistening on his shaven scalp they are not superior to us mr ray bellowed and mrs sarong edged her chair away in a show of distancing herself from him clearly tired of his lack of grace and thats why you want it so bad i said sharply without the focus youre second maybe third on the food chain deal with it everyone else does tension had pulled all my muscles tight i was losing control edden had a weapon but there were two predators and one elven warrior in here all deadly on their own piscary alone looked confident youre afraid he breathed the rim of brown about his eyes starting to disappear you smell so good adrenaline dove through me followed by the memory of him pinning me to the floor of his apartment licking the blood from my elbow on his way to my neck and you stink like threedayold carrion under your pheromones and witch charms do we have a deal or not perhaps he said shortly but you ask for too much im going to have my hands full trying to keep that fluffy ball of damnation under control he said glancing at al as his smile grew to show his fangs thats why they let me out i must do my civic duty behind him skimmer shifted uneasily and glanced nervously at her you mean al i questioned when the demon leaned back and put his shiny dress shoes on the table in satisfaction no problem ill have him back in the everafter as soon as i make an interdimensional phone call i wasnt a demon practitioner i wasnt you little canicula al swore his feet hitting the tile as he stood his glasses slipped and he fumbled for them you cant you dont know anyones summoning name but mine edden moved drawing his weapon the safety clicked off and al stumbled to a halt remembering he had a body now that couldnt go misty quen was tense and trent was stiff in his chair i was the nearest to him but he knew i wouldnt protect his lame elf ass besides he was looking at me as if i had sprouted black wings with matching tail and horns piscary though was as cool and calm as ever skimmer behind him looking scared at last and ivy blinking the faintest worry lines showing upon her forehead compared to piscary al was weak now trapped in a witchs body and capable of doing only what lee could you cant banish him the undead vampire said coolly not with him possessing another i lifted one shoulder in a nervous shrug someone in the everafter owes me a favor als over here hiding from trouble if i blow the whistle someone will pick him up you bitch al howled jerking when edden aimed his weapon you dont know anyone but newt and newt doesnt have a summoning name who gave you their name hes back into the everafter piscary said smiling again to show his fangs and out of your territory my fingers trembled and i glanced at trent bothered by his look of horror territories i added to make it plural not liking that trent thought i dealt in demons ill do that for you for free trent trent shook his head his fair hair floating in the breeze of the buildings air you consort with demons he whispered then turned to quen looking betrayed everyone he thought was untainted was not seemed like trent had his own problems i dont i said unclenching my teeth before i gave myself a headache someone in the everafter owes me you have a problem with my calling in a favor to get rid of al his confidence shaken trent asked what did you give a demon for a favor owed stomach cramping i turned to piscary do we have a deal or not the vampire smiled to make me shudder very much so al growled and as edden held him at gunpoint i shoved the package down the entire length of the table mazel tov i said depressed anxious and jittery it was the gift trent stammered you brought it to the wedding yup i said with a false brightness i felt sick buying kistens and my safety from piscary was so wrong but it was either that or deal with a demon and id rather keep my soul clean and let my morals get dingy i guess but i felt filthy this wasnt who i wanted to be son of a bitch al said as piscarys long fingers stretched forward to take it rachel jenks shouted from the ceiling get down my breath hissed not looking i dropped the flat of my arms hit the tile and i saw als feet move toward me i rolled under the table to quen but quen was gone get down eddens voice bellowed strong and demanding i was on my hands and knees under the table and i tensed for a gunshot it never came a guttural snarl erupted from the back of the room and i gasped when al fell into my sight on the floor piscary was atop him the undead vampire had launched himself across the room he was protecting me i had paid him to keep me alive and thats what he was doing shocked i scrambled up quen and i had exchanged places the warrior elf had trent backed into a corner by the door edden was standing before them gun trained on al the weres were by the back counter wideeyed ivy was blinking where she sat looking at her reflection in the distant twoway mirror oblivious to skimmers attempts to tug her upright and to the back of the room the pretty vampires eyes were black in fear and her mouth was open in horror i could smell burnt amber and i patted at my clothes looking for damage but then i saw it the doorknob had been melted we werent getting out of here anytime soon oh god i wanted to live the lights were on in the room behind the mirror and someone was trying to break the glass with a chair heart pounding i backed up to the wall my gaze on piscary and al jenks get back i shouted when i saw the sparkle of pixy dust snarling fangs bared piscary grappled with al the demon was at a severe disadvantage in his witch body and i went cold when i realized that piscary had him hand covering my neck i stood in shock as the vampire sank his teeth al howled managing to get an arm between them then a knee with a pained grunt he tried to shove piscary away failing tears of remembered fear filled my eyes as the demon went limp with a moan the vampire saliva starting to work my hand clutched my sore upper arm and i looked away my gaze found trent behind quen he too appeared shocked i dont think he knew until this moment the horror quen and i had endured when we were attacked by an undead they didnt care they existed to feed the walking and talking simply made it easier for them edden was ashenfaced but his painted weapon stayed steady waiting the pounding on the mirror had shifted to a pounding on the door with a sodden thump piscary let al drop wiping his mouth on the back of his hand then delicately cleaning even that from himself with a black handkerchief piscary rose his eyes were black he had just fed but we were trapped in here with him als hand lifted then fell the room tensed and jenks landed on my shoulder he was pale as shocked as the rest of us its not over rache he said his voice frightened get yourself in a circle i drew myself up to tap a line and set an informal circle but a hint of burnt amber brought my attention to the front of the room shit a mist was forming over al al wasnt dead he was leaving lees body now that it wasnt useful anymore piscary didnt know it standing satisfied and full of himself smiling benevolently any circle i was going to make had to have a real beginning to stand against a demon my bag and its stick of magnetic chalk was on the other side of the table hiking up my dress i crawled up onto the table to jerk my bag to me backing into a corner as piscary advanced i scrabbled in my bag fingers fumbling rache hurry up jenks shrilled heart pounding i found it yanking it out it slipped and i cried out in frustration as it rolled under the table i dove for it but quen got there first and both our hands landed on it the demon isnt dead the elf said and i nodded i need this he said jerking the chalk from my fingers damn it quen i shouted then screamed when a set of fingers fastened about my ankle and dragged me out from under the table i twisted and flat on my back stared up at piscary he bared his fangs and my heart gave a thud from my neck came a pulse of feeling but i was too scared for it to feel good piscarys eyes closed in twisted bliss soaking it in like sunshine behind him a sheet of everafter swirled and condensed into a vision of the egyptian god of the underworld his smooth chest bare and bells jingling from his scarletandgold loincloth i never thought id be so glad to see algaliarept too bad he was likely going kill me after he finished staking piscary piscary i said breathlessly as the demons goatslitted eyes glinted red and a long canine tongue slipped out to catch a drop of hanging saliva you might want to turn around pathetic the undead vampire mocked and i stifled a gasp as he yanked me up you only killed lee you stupid ass jenks said from above me not al the vampire took a deep breath scenting the air i shrieked when he shoved me away i flew backward hitting the cupboards struggling to breathe i put a hand to my back rachel jenks shrilled are you okay can you move yeah i rasped almost crosseyed as i looked at him inches away from me i scanned the room for ivy not seeing her someone screamed it wasnt me this time and i staggered up oh my god i whispered as jenks hovered beside me al had piscary it was a vision from the depths of history as a jackalheaded god grappled with an egyptian prince in royal robes who had set himself even with the underworld the demon had his hands around piscarys neck his fingers pressing into the vampires flesh as if it were dough and he was trying to pinch his head right off piscary was fighting him but now that al was in demon form and pissed to the ends of the turn the undead vampire hadnt a chance piscary couldnt die it would ruin everything quen give me the chalk i wheezed hand over my bruised throat i had to save piscary damn it i had to save his worthless stinking perverted life from his corner quen hesitated who do you think al will go after when hes done with piscary i exclaimed frustrated and the elf threw it at me my heart leapt crap why did people always throw stuff at me i was a lousy catch but i put my hand up and the chalk hit it with a satisfying thump keeping one eye on the jackalheaded god and the dying vampire i hunched over tripping on my dress as i drew a circle around them making it as big as i could to stay out of their way jenks went before me and i followed the path he was dusting to get it circular ivy i gasped when i found her standing blankfaced before the mirror watching her faint reflection oblivious to everything go to quen get over by quen i cant help you she didnt move and when jenks shrilled at me to hurry i lurched past her praying she would be okay and cursing my helplessness i had to crawl under the table to finish the circle and as i came out the end of my silver line met the beginning rhombus i breathed tapping a line the gold of my aura flowed upward the black of demon smut following to coat it a breath behind no al howled his eyes red with fury as he dropped piscary an instant too late the vampire hit the floor still conscious piscary grabbed the demon about the calves and pulled him down piscary was on him in an instant fangs tearing ribbons of flesh like a wolfs i scrambled up shocked as he gulped them down to make room for more trying to savage the demon into nonexistence the sound was absolutely horrifying let them kill themselves trent said from beside the door pale and shaking demon i shouted unable to risk calling al by his summoning name i have bound you you are mine leave here and go directly to the everafter the egyptian god howled saliva dripping red from his muzzle and his neck reduced to ribbons of exposed flesh he had returned to his demon form and he was vulnerable leave now i demanded and with his anger ringing within the room al vanished piscary fell through the space where al had been his arm hitting the floor to catch himself hand against his crushed neck he found his feet the room was silent but for skimmers gasping breaths sounding almost like sobs the weres were in one corner and the elves in another edden was passed out on the floor beside the door just as well he would have tried to shoot someone and that would only have given him more paperwork i turned to quen the chalk still in my grip thanks i whispered and he nodded slowly piscary collected himself turning from a savage monster to a ruthless businessman albeit one covered in blood his eyes were utterly black and a shudder rippled over me taking a step forward he stopped at the edge of my bubble he tugged down the sleeves of his elegant traditional dress robes and wiped the last of the demon flesh from his mouth clearly waiting my pulse slowed and praying i was safe i slid a foot forward and broke the circle hell i had saved his undead life surely that meant something to him you could have let him kill me piscary said scanning the room until he found ivy her back to him as she touched her reflection uhhuh i panted scooping up my bag and tucking the chalk away but youre my ticket to normalcy right and the only way to get kistens blood gift reversed piscary raised one eyebrow i cant rescind my gift of kistens last blood i wouldnt even if i could kisten needed to be reminded of his reason for existence and besides that would have been rude would have been i thought going cold as in past tense kisten i stammered suddenly feeling trapped my hand clutched at my sore arm and i felt sick jenkss wings rose to a pitch that made my eyes ache kisten what did you do i took a frantic breath what did you do to him the vampire dabbed at the black blood leaking from him it smelled like incense potent and heady kisten is dead he said flat out and i reached for the table dizzy not only dead but truly dead twice he didnt have it in him to stay the course piscary pressed his lips and cocked his head in a mockery of interest im not surprised youre lying i said hearing my voice tremble my chest clenched and couldnt get enough air kisten couldnt be dead i would know i would have felt it something would have been different everything and nothing was jenks had said hed called he couldnt be dead he went underground i exclaimed frantically looking at everyone wanting someone anyone to tell me i was right but no one met my eyes piscary smiled to show a glint of fang he was getting too much joy from my despair for it not to be true you dont think i know when one of my own passes into undead existence he said i felt him die and then i felt him die again face showing a twisted pleasure he leaned toward me and whispered loudly it was a shock to him he didnt expect it and i licked up his despair and failure reveling in it his entire life was worth just that one exquisite moment of failed perfection pity his living bloodline ended with him but he was always so careful it was as if he didnt want anyone to follow him vertigo hit me and i clutched at the edge of the table this cannot be happening who i rasped and piscary smiled like a benevolent savage god who killed him how pathetic he said then cocked his head or do you really not remember he said in speculation dropping his bloodstained handkerchief and focusing intently on me i tried to speak but nothing came out horror that he might be speaking the truth numbed me i couldnt think my arm throbbed under my fingers and when he leaned closer i did nothing too shaken to respond you were there he said distantly reaching out to take my jaw in his hand and tilt my head so the light hit my eyes you saw i can smell kistens final death all over you you breathe it out it lifts from your skin like perfume i was sleeping in the church i thought in denial then felt my world shift with a nauseating spin as things added up i had woken sore and hurt i had a cut on my lip the kitchen had smelled of candles and lilacthe materials for a forget potion my damned foot was so swollen that i couldnt wear anything but my boots what had i seen what had i done i stumbled back when piscary took a step forward i didnt believe this i had given him the focus for what kisten was dead tears prickled oh my god kisten is dead and i was there piscary reached for me and i flung my hand up to block only to have him capture my wrist fear spiked to my middle and i froze the room seemed to waver as the people in it drew their breath and piscary breathed deep scenting me relishing my fear youre stronger than ivy let on he said softly almost introspective i understand why shes fixated on you perhaps theres a use for you if you can walk unscathed from a room where one undead vampire met his end and another barely escaped to see another night i jerked away my frantic gaze going to edden tension crept along my spine as i backed up there had been another i didnt remember it but i had to believe him what have i done to myself why or maybe youre too dangerous to be allowed free range anymore time to break you to the bit perhaps disoriented i did nothing when piscary put a goldenskinned hand around my throat no i shouted but it was too late my word escaped with a gurgle adrenaline flamed through me and i struggled as piscary backhanded jenks with a slow nonchalance the pixy shot across the room hitting the wall and falling to the floor god help me jenks i gave you the focus i rasped toes brushing the tile when he lifted me you said youd leave me alone piscary pulled me closer you put me in jail he said his breath smelling of blood and burnt amber i said id keep you alive but i owe you some serious pain youll only wish you were dead he put up a warning hand when quen moved and the elf stopped horror trickled through me this isnt possible i saved your life i rasped when his fingers let up so he could hear me beg i could have let al kill you your mistake he smiled at me with sinblack eyes say goodbye rachel time to start your new life no i screamed then tapped a line i pushed at him willing the energy to flow but it was too late crushing me to his chest piscary savagely sank his teeth into me my shriek of terror filled my ears my heart hammered as if trying to find a way out of my chest but my muscles had gone slack pain flowed and i couldnt move it was agony i heard my breath come in gasps pushing my blood into piscary all the faster a dark shadow approached like fast water and piscary backhanded quen without breaking from me i heard a thump and a pained grunt just kill us i thought wanting quen to blast us both to hell with a ball of everafter how could it end like this it wasnt supposed to end like this it couldnt end like this piscary ivy pleaded and my heart leapt at the emotion in her voice let her go she cried and i saw her slim hand take his shoulder gripping with fierce intensity you promised you promised if i came to you that youd leave her alone i groaned as he pulled from me his teeth ripping tears in my neck i couldnt i couldnt move its too late piscary said and i hung in his grip unresisting this has to be done you said you wouldnt hurt her ivys voice was heavy as gray as morning fog piscary held me upright one arm crushing me to him youve been careless he said flatly this is the last time im going to pick up after you you should have bound her to you when i told you to by rights i have to kill her an unpredictable animal needs to be culled rachel would never hurt me ivy whispered and i tried to speak feeling my heart break i took a breath seeing my sight graying at the edges i was slipping i couldnt stop no ivy girl piscarys face was gentled in concern as he leaned over me and touched her face with false love leaving my blood on her jawline i could hear skimmer crying in the corner adding to the travesty thats both their lure and their downfall im going to kill her for you if i dont ill only use her to torture you and ive tortured you enough its my gift to you ivy she wont feel a thing i promise ivy stared at him her face lost in terror as piscary bent to me again making a small sound of pleasure when he licked the blood leaking from my neck wallowing in it she stood beside him struggling to overcome a lifetime of conditioning her eyes filled spilling over my vision blurred and she touched piscarys shoulder lightly stop she said before his teeth could find me again but it was a whisper stop she said louder and hope struck through me piscary hesitated his grip tightening i said no ivy shouted i wont let you kill her backing up a step she swung her foot in a roundhouse to hit piscarys head it never landed piscary hissed dropping me to collapse between their feet i took a raspy breath and my fingers searched my neck i was dizzy weak hed bitten me how bad how bad was it ivy girl the undead vampire questioned from somewhere above me no ivy said her shaking voice was determined but even i could hear her fear no piscary said lightly and i tried to push away to get out from between them you arent strong enough to best me my heart pounded and i managed to find the wall fingers scrabbling weakly as i turned to sit with my back to it lees body was gone from under the mirror and i found that trent had dragged it to the door his tuxs coat covering him like a blanket lee is alive in the space between the table and mirror ivy dropped into a fighting stance then ill die trying and kill you myself shes my friend i wont let you hurt her a smile of satisfaction blossomed over the older vampires face ivy he crooned my sweet ivy you defy me at last come here little fish its time you leave the weeds and swim as the predator you are no i thought in horror seeing that everythingthe terror the pain the agonyhad all been meant to manipulate ivy into standing up to him completing his vision of finding an equal in her it will hurt like the sun piscary warned arms open to embrace her as she backed away face white your last blood will be sweet in me edden again conscious scrabbled to me and i slapped weakly at him as he tried to look at my neck shoot him i breathed almost vomiting when i reached up and found my neck ripped open hes going to kill her i whispered but edden didnt seem to care ivy had defied piscary he was going to kill her so they could live an undead existence together ivy no i said louder since edden wasnt listening you dont want this piscary raised one eyebrow patience witch he said then reached for ivy terror overcame training and ivy backpedaled she screamed high and shrill and the sound struck through me he had her against the mirror his mouth on her neck as he dug deep to end it fast she didnt resist him she wanted to die it was the only way she could fight him and hope to save me she was letting him kill her to save me no i sobbed trying to rise but edden had my arm he wasnt letting go no a blond shadow darted to them grunting skimmer swung the arm of the paper cutter like an ax against the back of piscarys neck it hit his flesh with a meaty thump piscary jerked he drew away from ivy showing her neck bloodied and torn blood flowed from her he had bitten deep a death bite crying in fear and her fury skimmer swung again my stomach churned at the thunk as it met the front of piscarys neck this time his hands slipped from ivy and skimmer swung yet again screaming in a blind frustration as she angled to hit him in exactly the same spot the blade went through the third time and skimmer stumbled and fell sobbing to her knees as piscary collapsed the bloodied blade still in her hand rang as it hit the floor sweet mother of god edden swore his grip falling away slumped against the mirror ivy stared at piscary in disbelief his severed head looked up at her his eyes blinking once before the pupils turned silver black and empty he was dead skimmer had killed him thin stream of red blood pooled from the ruin of his neck slowing to nothing piscary ivy whispered like a forgotten child then collapsed no skimmer shrieked crying she crawled to ivy her hands went red as she tried to stop the blood from flowing from ivys neck god please no the door crashed open the sound of the drill they used to open the door fading away as people rushed in two fell on skimmer she fought them but her movements were blind and easy to overcome three more descended upon ivy and i heard the rhythmic chants as they started cpr oh god she was dead ivy was dead i crawled under the table forgotten as feet rushed about to pull trent from his corner and escort mr ray and mrs sarong out a sheet was draped over piscary both parts of him ivy was dead kisten was dead jenks no i whispered eyes filling as i slumped jenks i thought in despair throat heavy with an immovable lump wheres jenks piscary had hit him the pain was easing the heartache wasnt jenks where was jenks my neck was cold and i wouldnt touch it my breath escaped me in a sob oh god i hurt from under the table i saw shiny dress shoes and three people kneeling before ivy her hand lay outstretched as if looking for her salvation as if looking for me she was dying and nothing could stop that but jenks was somewhere and someone might step on him i crawled to the back of the room looking for him the focus lay forgotten on the floor in an open box amid the nest of black tissue paper i shoved it out of the way to find the shimmer of fallen gold beside my bag my heart seemed to cease i felt nothing but pain it was all i was jenks i croaked please no i thought tears blinding me as i hunched over him my hands sticky with blood tumbled as i picked him up he wasnt moving his face pale and one of his wings bent jenks i sobbed the release shaking me as i felt him light in my hand jenks was dead kisten was dead ivy was dying my wouldbe protector had tried to kill me only to be killed in turn i had nothing i had absolutely nothing there were no more choices no more options no more clever ways out of a tough situation and the rush i realized in a brutal wash of despair is a false god ive chased my entire life one that cost me everything in the blind search for sensation my entire existence amounted to nothing running from one thrill to the next with no regard to what really was important what in hell is left for me everyone i had cared for was gone it had taken me too long to find them and i knew deep into my soul that their like would never come again i had come too far from my beginnings and no one else would understand who i really wasor more important who i wanted to be under all the crap my life had become i was now something no one could trust not even me i openly consorted with demons my blood kindled their curses my soul was coated with the stink of their magic every time i tried to do good i hurt myself and those who loved me and those i loved i thought the tears blurring my vision well the hell with that i thought as i fumbled for the open box with the focus in it there was one final way to find an end to this and now now i had no reason not to a profound feeling of apathy took me hollow and bitter and my fingers shook as i wiped my face and pulled the hair from my eyes past the edge of the table feet moved and voices were raised in urgency but i was forgotten alone and apart i pulled the focus out of its open box knowing what i was going to do and not caring it was going to hurt probably kill me but there was nothing left in me except pain and anything was better than that even oblivion watching my hands as if they belonged to someone else i scribed a circle encompassing most of the tile under the table with my metallic chalk my heart felt like ash unstirred by the power of the ley line as i touched it to make a shimmering black sheet bisect the table above me wheres morgan trent said suddenly his voice cutting through the excited babble i could hear the cpr chant but id seen ivys neck she would die if she wasnt dead already she had wanted me to save her soul and i had failed it was gone as if she had never been never smiled never taken joy in the day eddens work shoes moved restlessly someone check the bathroom cold despite the warmth of the line running through me i clenched the focus to me and scribed three more circles intersecting them to form four spaces i was crying but it didnt matter i was inside the circles i was inside the circles morgan trent accused in a tired voice and he bent at the waist finding me its over you can come out of your bubble now i ignored him my fingers hummed with force and from my bag i pulled the candles i had bought for my birthday why god what in hell did i ever do to you trents face went pale and he sat down when the latin spilled from me as i lit and placed them first the white one then the black and lastly the yellow one the yellow one that would represent my aura there was no gray so i put a second black one in the middle confident that because my soul was the color of sin the magic would work this one i left it unlit it would burn when the curse was twisted and my fate was immutable quen tried to pull trent up and failing he bent to look himself bacchus save us he whispered knowing what i was doing the focus no longer had a protector everyone knew i had it i couldnt give it to piscarythe bastard was dead i had to get rid of it another way just because i had screwed up that was no reason to send what was left of the world into war the blackness on my soul would have no meaning if there was no love no understanding no one to share my life with i just wanted it to all go away to stop and because i didnt think i was going to survive this it was all to the better edden bent at the waist swearing when be reached out to find that the shimmering black shadow between us was real from the hallway came mrs sarongs complaining voice going faint as she was led away what is she doing edden said rachel what are you doing killing myself numb i set the focus in its spot and myself in the other the third space where my ring of hair would go was empty i was in the circle i didnt need a symbol of connection my chest clenched and i drew my will together jenkss body lay outside my circle ivys was beneath the mirror kisten was dead i had no reason not to do this i had no reason at all piscary had ripped everything from me in less than twentyfour hours since his release not bad maybe he was a little more pissed than id thought rachel edden said louder over the chants of the emts who had arrived to push the fib officers away what are you doing shes getting rid of the focus quen said tightly why didnt she just do that in the first place edden said his expression annoyed rachel come out of there quens voice was empty because it will take a demon curse to do it edden was silent for a moment and i jumped when i felt his fist hit my bubble rachel he exclaimed then swore as his knuckles met my bubble again get out now but i couldnt stop and i didnt want to almost having forgotten i touched my finger to my oozing neck and using the blood i scribed a figure on the unlit black candle i still didnt know what the figure stood for and now i never would silence ached through me when the emts knelt before ivy their heads bowed as they slowly put their things away tears spilled and i started to get angry i touched the interlaced circles willing energy to fill them i didnt even need to use my trigger wordit happened just as i willed it edden swore again as the tainted bubbles rose about me and i wondered if he knew that the arcs of gold where the circles intersected were what my aura was supposed to look like will it kill her trent whispered lets find out i thought bitterly not believing i could hold the power of a demon curse and when they killed mewhich they would for working demon magic inside a public building in front of credible witnessesthe power of the curse would die with me problem solved except a small part of me really wanted to live damn it hope is a cruel god fingers still shaking i knelt in my tiny space and clasped my hands willing the trigger words back into my memory they came exhaling i said harshly animum recipere quens breath hissed and he pulled trent back the power of the curse flowed into me warm like sunshine i stiffened as the scent of burnt amber coated me tasting bittersweet like dark chocolate it felt good it tasted sweet my thoughts wailed in despair what in hell have i become jaw clenched i knelt under the table my unseeing gaze lifting upward and my breath held against the sensations it felt good and that was wrong the power of creation coursed out of the focus and into me familiar and welcoming it sang it lured it whispered behind my eyes of the lust of the chase the joy of the capture the satisfaction of the kill within me stirred the need to dominate i remembered the feel of the earth beneath my paws and the scent of time in my nose filling my memories making me want more and this time instead of denying it i accepted it non sum qualis eram i said bitterly angry tears spilling from under my closed lids i would take the curse into me and i would keep it it would end everything there was no reason not to i felt the white candle go out and i opened my eyes to see a thin trail of smoke showing me the lost path to eternity i had set the taper with the word for protection but i was beyond its reach nothing could protect me the focus was empty and the curse was inside me beating like a second heart crawling through my aura and clouding my sight i could feel it alive like a twin awareness beside my own but i wasnt done yet i still had to seal the magic a wild impulse to flee filled me born of the curse gritting my teeth i forced myself to stay still chaining the second awareness with my will but it fought me slipping deeper when i struggled to keep it separate eyes fixed on the black candle i willed it to go out with a soft puff the light was gone the curses need to run grew stronger my hands started to shake uncontrollably my bowed head swung to the gold candle it would seal the curse into me so it couldnt unravel it flickered in a wind only i felt and then as soft and surprising as a butterfly wing upon ones cheek it went out the last black candle burst into light the curse was twisted anew a groan slipped from me and i felt lightheaded it was done i was a demonic curse i could feel it within me poison seeping from my soul to my mind now all that remained was to see if it would kill me lips parted in the shock at what i had done i lifted my head to find trent sitting under the table in his white tux shirt without a coat he was watching me quen behind him ready to drag him away i blinked my chest burning there was just enough time for me to take a breath and then the reality imbalance from twisting the curse hit me i jerked my head hitting the bottom of the table and my elbows breaking the circles gasping i convulsed as a wave of black coated me i couldnt breathe my cheek hit the cool tile and i clenched in pain the curse saw my will weaken and its need to run redoubled twining into mine until they were the same i had to run i had to flee but i couldnt move my damned arms will she be okay trent asked worry and bewilderment in his voice shes taking on the payment for the curse quen said quietly i dont know someone touched me i screamed hearing only a guttural groan the curse dove deep into my psyche melding with me there was no way out for it anymore and it flowed into every facet of my memory and thought becoming me i was dying from the inside out and through it all the smut of the imbalance burned threatening to stop my heart i take it i panted and the hurt ebbed i take it i sobbed clenching into a ball it was mine the curse was all i had left a frightening need to run was filling me it was the demon curse but we were the same its need was mine why am i fighting this i thought suddenly the agony of the demon smut burning my blood and with that last bitter feeling i let my will die my fear vanished in a ping of singular thought the heartache left in a blink of bewilderment that i cared and the turmoil of mental anguish evaporated in the sudden realization that everything had changed my eyes opened peace filled me it was as if i was reborn there was no anger no heartache no sorrow my breath filled my lungs in a smooth unhurried motion i stared at the world in a pause of time my cheek resting on the cool tile and i wondered what had happened my body hurt as if i had fought and won but there was no tornapart corpse lying before me and then i saw my prison beside me knocked askew from where i had placed it behind the trappings of demon magic oh that eyes narrowing i reached for it it would never hold me again celero inanio i snarled not caring it was a demon curse not caring i didnt know how i knew it the bone shattered where i touched it superheated to flake into fragments i jerked my hands back and sat up the pain surprising but nothing against my satisfaction that prison would never hold me again and i welcomed the imbalance for breaking the laws of physics as it flowed into me coating me in a comforting layer of warmth protecting me on to other things above me i felt the flat smoothness of wood and above that a crisscross of metal plaster carpet and space i was in a buildingbut i didnt have to stay here someone was watching me actually a lot of people were but one was looking at me like a predator at its prey my eyes searched the silent questioning faces until they found the vivid green eyes of an elf framed by dark hair quen i thought giving him a name and then i saw the open door beyond him watch out someone yelled i leapt for it tripping on my dress someone fell on me to pin me to the floor i fought silently lashing out with my fists a man was yelling at me to be still the memory of the clatter of pixy wings was like a knife through my soul and i felt the last of myself of rachel morgan vanish hiding from the heartache there was a grunt as my fist found a tender spot and in the slight release i clawed for the door someone grabbed my wrists and i cried out when they were wrenched behind my back snarling i fought to be free then went still as i lay on the floor a crafty smile curving over my face i didnt have to fight with my body i could fight with my mind someone strap her shrilled a pixy from above shes tapping a line rachel stop a woman cried and i whipped my head at the familiar voice ivy i warbled my breath hesitated at seeing her sitting slumped against the wall a hand pressed to her neck and pale from blood loss reason tried to force its way through my brain but a heady feeling of power shoved it out men stood between me and the door the woman on the floor wasnt enough to best the curses demands shivering i twisted to sit upright latin spilled from me the words coming from somewhere in my past my future from everywhere im sorry rachel a gravelly voice said behind me we dont have ley line bands i turned savage in my need to hurt someone a fist swung at me stars exploded lighting my conscious thought dying away to leave only the blackness of sweet oblivion but as my breath left me in a gentle sigh and i fell i could swear that the drops of warmth upon my face were those of tears that the shivering arms holding me from the cruel coldness of the tile had the luscious scent of vampire and someone was singing about blood and daisies thirtysix i was moving it was warm and i was wrapped in a blanket that reeked of cigarettes something was on my sore wrist and since there wasnt an erg of everafter in me it seemed someone had found a zipstrip probably the one i had in my bag the thrum of a big engine was soothing but the sudden shifts of motion made me sick shes awake jenks said his voice holding an incredible amount of worry how can you tell came ivys voice from the front and i cracked my eyes i was in the back of a fib cruiser wrapped in a blue fib blanket and slumped across the backseat her aura brightened jenks snarled shes awake my breathing quickened the fog was lifting making me even more confused i was thinking everything twice almost as if trying to filter the world through an interpreter a wave of fear took me when i realized it was the curse i wasnt just holding it it was apart of me the damned thing was alive rachel ivy said and i winced pain iced through me as a wave of panic i didnt understand rose i could move but i couldnt wrapped up tight where where are we going i managed then opened my eyes wide when we turned a corner and i almost rolled off the seat ivy was up front and edden was driving his neck red and his motions quick the church ivy said a barrier of plastic separated us why i had to get out of here everything would be better if i could just run i knew it her eyes were black in fear because when vampires are afraid they go home the curse inside me was gaining strength and i wiggled i have to get out i breathed knowing it was the curse but unable to stop myself jenks squeezed between the ceiling and the divider and i blinked when he stopped inches from my nose rachel he coaxed look at me look at me my darting eyes following the passing building returned to him youre okay he soothed but his voice was making me nervous the emts gave you something to relax you thats why you cant move it will wear off in about an hour it was wearing off now i have to get out i said and jenks darted back when i threw off the blanket and sat up whoa edden said from behind the wheel rachel take it easy well be there in five minutes and then you can get out i wiggled the door latch to no avail it was a cop car for gods sake stop the car i demanded looking for a way out and not finding it panic was settling in i knew i was safe i knew i should ease back in the seat and sit but i couldnt the curse inside me was stronger than my will it hurt and when i moved the confusion was less let me out i shouted smacking a fist into the plastic edden swore when ivy turned in her seat and with one motion broke the plastic with a sharp back fist tamwood what the hell are you doing he shouted the car swerving as he tried to watch the road and ivy both shes going to hurt herself she said clearing the shards and wiggling over the seat i pressed into the corner of the car scared of her stay away from me i exclaimed trying to get control of myself but i couldnt rachel relax she said but her hand was reaching for me my breath hissing in i moved to block it ivy moved blindingly fast she twisted her hand catching my wrist yanking me forward she wrapped her body around me hauling me onto her lap let go i shrieked but she had me firmly edden ivy panted her lips next to my ear pull over you have to give her another shot or shes going to hurt herself keep driving jenks said ill do it pulse beating wildly i struggled ivy grunted when my head smacked into her face but she wouldnt let go cant you hold her still for a bleeding minute jenks said from in front of me and i twisted wildly he wanted to drug me the little bug wanted to drug me so i couldnt move i wanted to move i had to run it was why i existed and i couldnt let them take it from me let me go i grunted edden flipped on the lights and pulled over traffic passed as we stopped right on the bridge the thickset man wedged himself half over the front seat grabbing my arm at the wrist and elbow he held it steady nooooo i howled struggling but he had that one part of me unmoving and i shrieked at the tiny prick of a needle hold still rache jenks said as i gasped for air youll feel better in a minute you son of a fairy whore i seethed im going to step on you im going to pluck your wings off and eat them like chips looking forward to it the pixy said hovering at my eye level and peering at me how you feel now im going to stuff your stump with poison ivy i said blinking as edden let my arm go and buy a terrier to dig you out and then im going to to god this stuff works fast but i couldnt remember anymore and i felt my muscles go limp the curse went somnolent and i had a brief instant of clarity before the drug took complete control golden sparkles blotted my vision turning black as i shut my eyes i thought you were dead jenks i said starting to cry are you okay ivy my voice shook and i couldnt open my eyes anymore are you dead im sorry i messed everything up its okay rache jenks said youre going to be okay i wanted to cry but i was falling asleep kisten i slurred edden go see kisten hes at nicks and then my lips quit working ivys arms were around me keeping me from rolling to the floor as edden twisted back into the front seat the siren wailed a short bleep and he pulled back onto the road i heard ivy whispering softly in my ear please be okay rachel please the gentle sound of her words became the shushing of my blood in my head and i listened hovering on the edge of consciousness bathed in the oblivion of whatever drug they had given me it was a relief not to have to fight the curse id made a mistake id made a horrible immense irrevocable mistake and i didnt think there was a way out of it it was a shock when i realized my cheek was cold i wasnt moving anymore either and the echo of voices came from everywhere confusing me as i tried to give them meaning where there was none the warm arms around me slipped away and i felt dead i think i was in the church yeah i was laying on the floor like a sacrificial lamb that was about right i dont know if i can a soft voice said it was ceri and i tried to move i really did but the drug wouldnt let me the confusion was starting up again it seemed as if the more awake i was the more the curse could exert itself i was beginning to feel anxious and jittery i had to get up i had to move i can help came keasleys gravel voice and an unexpected fear joined my bewilderment keasley was my friend but i couldnt let him touch me he was a witch a witch could put me back in prison a witch had done it before i wouldnt let it happen i had finally gotten free and i wouldnt go back i could feel the drug slipping away but i couldnt move yet so i pretended to be dead i could be still as well as run id been still for millennia and then when the time was right i would run its not that i cant do the curse ceri said and i felt someone brush the hair from my eyes but her psyche is mixed with it i dont know if i can lift the curse away without taking a chunk of her im calling minias he owes her a favor panic slid through me not a demon he would see hed put me back i couldnt go back not now not when i had tasted freedom i had to get up i winced at the brush of air and the clatter of wings shes waking up again that damned tiny voice shrilled a presence smelling of aftershave and shoe polish came close making the floorboards creak shes had enough to put down a horse said a man and i tried to pull back when my arm was lifted i dont want to give her any more just do it ivy said and i tried to slow my breathing we have to get that thing out of her and we cant do it if shes fighting us again the prick of the needle and i fought it blackness swirled and i was running running my pulse strong and my feet moving like water but it was a dream like all the other times and i cursed the pain it left behind when a new voicesoft and demandinglifted through me and stirred me to life it was a weres voice low strong independent i wanted it so badly i almost choked on my desire to be free i tried to get his attention he would take me he had to take me he knew how to run this witch didnt not even in her dreams i can legally make lifeanddeath decisions for her the were said and i heard the rattle of paper see its right here and i make the decision that she will exchange the favor you owe her for your helping ceri you will make sure rachel is herself before its called done and you will not harm anyone in this room until it is finished and youre gone i cracked an eyelid rejoicing in it with sight came a confusion of double thought the witch in my thoughts tried to stop me but i piled pain and confusion on her and she ceased thinking this was my body and i wanted it to move as i said a pair of purple slippers shifted on the hardwood floor about a yard from me a shimmering band of black was between us but i knew the terrible stink of demons a hundredfold worse than the green reek of elves the mark is between rachel and me the demon said and my hope died it would put me back in a little box of bone but i wanted to run i would be free the were came closer and i sang to him but he didnt hear me im her alpha he exclaimed look at this paper look at it you damned demon i can make this decision for her its the law i stiffened at the clatter of wings hating them it was that pixy again damn it why wouldnt it leave me alone guys the pest said hovering at my nose and peering into my eyes she needs a little more of that happy juice the slippered feet padded closer and someone turned me i stared up at the demon feeling my hatred grow his kind had created me created me bound me and then trapped me in a little box made of bone that couldnt move a sliver of satisfaction lifted through me when the demons eyes widened and he backed away bless me back to the turn she really does have it in her he whispered still retracting ill do it he said and i struggled to move he was going to put me back into my cell i would kill him first i would kill them all sleep the demon commanded and i shuddered as a blanket of black imbalance shifted over me and i slept i had no choice the demon had willed it and they had made me thirtyseven the room was dim and i was hot i could smell my conglomeration of perfumes over an unfamiliar throatcatching incense but the heavy weight atop me had the familiar feel of my afghan the sound of birds coming in my open dusky window was soothing and the warm spot beside me said rex had been here my curtains were closed but predawn light filtered in as they moved in the breeze to tell me along with my clock that it was just before sunrise i took a slow breath feeling the air slip in with barely a twinge of pain just muscle aches a chanting heavy with ceremony came from the sanctuary and the ting of a bell the scent of incense wasnt vampiric but herbs and minerals to be quite honest it stank i managed to sit up my heart quickened and i put my back to the headboard wincing i touched my neck and the bandage there it felt okay and my hand moved to my middle when it rumbled my face lost all expression as i realized that the confusion was gone i sat on my bed worriedly remembering ceri and david a pulse of fear shot through me minias had been here and i had literally been out of my mind where was the curse ceri was going to take it out oh god ivy she had been savaged by piscary but i remembered her in the car she had been alive hadnt she i flung the covers off ready to find out who was here and demand some answersbut when the cooler air hit me i realized i had a more pressing problem uh i have to go to the bathroom i murmured swinging my feet to the floor not nearly as fast as i wanted to a myriad of aches and pains hit me i was shaky too carefully i stood with my hand atop the bedpost for balance last time i checked i had been in that gorgeous bridesmaid dress now i was in a pair of panties and a long tshirt atop my dresser among my perfumes and sitting on nicks file were my hairbrush a tube of antibiotic ointment and some bandages i shuddered when something passed through my aura with the tinkling of silver bells to leave me with the sensation of wintergreen id never felt the like but it hadnt hurt more like the pristine pricks of snow on your upturned face uneasy i pulled up my shirt to see the bruises and scrapes in my bedroom mirror i wasnt dead hell wouldnt have me in a takata staff shirt and heaven would smell better i heard the front door shut then silence moving slowly i headed to the door feeling every muscle protest i had to use the bathroom in the worst way but as my hand reached for the knob i froze my nose was tickling i was going to sneeze a thread of alarm unrolled as i took a deep breath trying to stop it my hand went to my bandaged neck to hold me in place as a sneeze shook me hunched i sneezed again then again crap its minias wheres my scrying mirror i whispered panicking as i looked over my dark room lurching to my closet i flung the door open i had put it in here hadnt i pain jolted me as i dropped to my knees flinging aside boots and magazines as i searched i sneezed again grimacing at the throb in my neck i couldnt see in the darkness of my closet but a cry of relief passed my lips as my fingers found the cool glass staggering to my feet i backed out and into my room my hair swung into my eyes and i plopped onto my bed i put my hand on the glass and froze trying to remember the word but it was too late i spun where i sat at the soft pop of displaced air springing to my feet with the mirror in hand minias stood in the shadowed darkness between me and the closed door his funny hat atop his brown curls that exotic purple robe draped over his wide shoulders and the glint of bare toes catching the faint light no i exclaimed terrified and minias raised his hand i didnt wait to see what he was going to say hefting my scrying mirror i swung it at his head it connected pain reverberating up my arm minias yelped and the mirror shattered into three heavy pieces wideeyed i fell back shaking my stinging hand and tapping a line ugly words i didnt understand fell from the demon and continuing to backpedal i made a circle but it wasnt set from a drawn line i knew it wouldnt stand striding forward minias jabbed one finger into my circle and it fell i retreated to kick him but he caught my foot before it reached him fear iced through me when he didnt let go hopping me backward and pushing me onto the bed you stupid witch he said in disdain then slapped me stars exploded and i think i passed out because the next thing i knew minias was bending over me gasping i thrust my palm jamming his nose the demon fell back swearing at me get out i exclaimed id love to you asinine witchanderthal the demon said voice muffled by the hand holding his nose will you relax im not going to hurt you unless you keep hitting me my gaze darted to the closed door and he brought his hand from his nose glancing at it to see if he was bleeding he murmured a word of latin and a glow from my dresser mirror lightened the predawn gloom my mouth was dry and i scooted to the headboard why should i believe you my throat hurt as if id been yelling and i held a hand to it you shouldnt minias looked at his fingers in the new light then let the hand drop youre the most backward person i know im trying to finish up this arrangement so i can return to my quiet life and you want to play demon summoner and demon pulse easing i flicked my gaze to the door and back to him again someone had gone outside and i hadnt heard a car start it had to be ivy if shed been in the church she would have heard us and come im safe i said softly so my throat wouldnt hurt wondering if i could trust him were in the middle of a deal minias took a firmer stance his head canted in exasperation and his hands clasped before him im trying to finish it up the way your were worded it im not done until im sure the curse is out of you and youre back to your usual backward self and until it is everyone that was in the room is under a measure of protection so yes we are in the middle of a deal his gaze went to mine and i shivered but youre not safe i curled my feet up under me not liking this at all im not paying for you to come over here i babbled i was trying to answer you didnt give me enough time to answer good lord minias exclaimed crossing his arms over his chest and leaning back against my dresser bottles spilled and he jerked forward its only a little imbalance he said fingers fumbling to stand a bottle upright before he turned to ignore the rest making me think that for a demon he didnt have much experience in dealing with people you make your dates pay for everything too dont you he added no wonder you cant keep a boyfriend shut up i yelled hurting my throat oh god kisten piscary had been lying he had to have been otherwise i was going to have to decide if i was above revenge or not and i wasnt good at telling myself i couldnt have something when i wanted it miniass eyes ran over the lines of my room as i sat on my bed in my underwear and a shirt and tried not to shake you have such interesting thoughts he said lightly no wonder witches are ephemeral you drive yourself crazy you should simply do what you want without the soulsearching his goatslitted eyes fixed on me and i felt my stomach drop it will be easier in the long run rachel mariana morgan my pulse had slowed and i was starting to believe i was going to survive this rachel is fine i said not liking him saying my middle name a single eyebrow rose you seem to be all right any urges to run under the moon refusing to shrink away i let him get close enough that the scent of burnt amber settled deep in me no wheres the focus feel the need to tear out peoples throats he asked just yours who has the focus you took it out where is it he straightened and i realized again how tall he was ceri took it out not me and if there had been a way to help her do it wrong i would have just tell me who has the damned focus i exclaimed and he snickered your alpha he said and my stomach knotted david were back to square one it settled in him as if it wanted to go the demon added and my heart seemed to stop david didnt possess the focus it possessed him like it had been inside of me where is he i said springing off my bed but there was nowhere to go how should i know minias lifted a bottle and sniffed the top recoiling hes handling it better than you are it was made for a were not a witch taking it in you was stupid like dropping a chunk of sodium metal into a bucket of water the bottle hit the dresser with a clink i shifted uneasily not knowing if i should believe him hes okay better than minias drawled his fingers still toying with my perfumes giving the focus to the weres is going to turn around and bite you but it did accomplish what you wanted his goatslitted eyes focused on mine and my tension rose the weres are happy and the vampires think its destroyed right right im fine i said tartly my fear coming out as cheek you can go now the elf did it he said shaking his head al has more drive and talent to teach than i gave him credit for he taught her extremely well to be able to untwist a curse like that and leave you relatively unscathed no wonder he kept her for a thousand years face scrunched up he smelled another bottle and set it down al is furious he said casually and even my false bravado vanished they caught him seconds after you threw him back to our side of the lines hes in his own personal hell and you still owe him a favor sniffing a third perfume he looked at me from under a lowered brow i wonder what it will be im fine get out i repeated may i have this he asked holding the bottle upright if you leave you can have them all the bottle vanished from the cradle of his fingertips one last thing he said an odd glint in his eyes the focus i stiffened a trickle of fear growing in the pit of my being yeah it wasnt what newt was looking for when she tore your church apart he began to vanish and i stepped forward frightened what was she looking for i havent the slightest idea echoed in my thoughts wait i shouted does she remember me minias does she remember me i searched the night for sound and my mind for thoughts but he was gone another instant and the light he had set glowing in my mirror faded to nothing crap what had she been looking for if it hadnt been the focus the thump of the front door closing echoed through the brightening air and i looked to the front of the church a car started and tension brought me straight when i recognized ivys soft footsteps in the hall ivy i said then put a hand to my throat when it hurt i jumped when my bedroom door was flung open and a gray shaft of light spilled in rachel ivy said her features lost in shadow last time i checked i said deciding that mentioning minias wouldnt help anyone youre okay she whispered coming in and gripping my arm its you right just you her eyes were wide from the shadow and there was a bandage on her neck seeing my blank stare she took me in a surprising hug thank you god my tension born of surprise vanished and i relaxed my face next to hers as i took in her scent as if it were water i didnt care if it was chockfull of pheromones meant to relax me to make it easier for her to bite me thats not why she was holding me she had been worried and she was alive a dead vampire wouldnt have cared if i was myself or not ivy was alive maybe kisten is too please let piscary have lied to me its me i said remembering ivy and edden grappling with me in the back of a car when id been lost to the curse uh i have to go to the bathroom ivy stepped back you scared me she said i scared myself i said catching myself against the bedpost as i scuffed forward jenks ivy yelled when my bare feet edged into the hallway shes okay shes up what is that stench i said sniffing the distastefully harsh scent of bad incense we got the church unblasphemed she said following me out the guy just left i think you embarrassed him so he did some research all he had to do was find and replace the original scrap of holy cloth that the sanctity was focused on jenkss kids found it and the rest was easy i nodded thinking that odd sensation id felt when waking up must have been the blasphemy falling away then i wondered what the guy was going to do with the fouled cloth put it in the everafter maybe thats what id do i wobbled three more steps to the bathroom then turned youre alive right i asked remembering the emts stopping their efforts from my doorway ivy laughed i must have really scared her id never seen her show so much emotion clearly happy she smiled im alive she said looking beautiful with her eyes wet piscary didnt she took a breath i passed out when piscary gave me enough vamp saliva to stop my heart but the fib guys kept me alive and the emts gave me an antitoxin i never died she said happily i still have my soul good i thought something had gone right for a change i was afraid to ask her about kisten i have to go to the bathroom i murmured the situation turning critical oh she said suddenly embarrassed sure ill um her thought was cut short when jenks blew in from the back rooms rache he shrilled shedding gold sparkles you okay tinks bordello youre one wild woman ive never seen anyone do the things you did who taught you to swear in latin he was flitting madly between ivy and me and i put a hand to the wall so i didnt lose my balance trying to watch him it was the curse not me i said hows your knees he said dropping down to look at them and my head snapped up when he darted to the ceiling you hit them pretty hard when ceri took you down i dont remember that either i said crossing my legs and praying would you get out of my way i have to go to the bathroom holy crap jenks said rising up to follow ivy and me i thought you were going to kill edden hes the one who gave you the black eye so thats why my face feels puffy i thought shuffling down the hallway what day is it i asked wondering how long it had been since i ate monday ivy was hovering tight to my heels wait its tuesday now oooooh the spirits did it all in one night i said squinting as i flicked on my bathroom light my eyes hurt i turned to find them staring at me as if id said something scary what i protested and jenks landed on ivys shoulder you sure youre okay yes but if i dont get into this bathroom im going to make a puddle jenks took flight and ivy took three steps back you want something to eat she said and i hesitated in my motion to shut the door anything but brimstone i said and her face flushed guiltily the door closed between us and i put both hands on the washer leaning over it and shaking it wasnt blood loss and i wasnt beaten up that badly i was fatigued somethingmaybe someonehad fought a battle in me and i didnt remember any of it the focus was gone so it had lost i was the one picking myself up off the battlefield and hobbling to the next fight i hoped it would be easier than this last one pushing myself upright i went to the mirror my hand moved to peek behind the bandage on my neck then dropped i didnt want to know just yet turning my head i looked myself over deciding that it wasnt bad a complexion amulet would take care of the black circles under my eye and the fat lip made me look pouty there was a bruise on my shin and another on my hip just below where the tshirt ended my back hurt when i bent over to check out my knees but nothing would need more than a day or two to return to normal it was almost a disappointment having been a demon curse however brief should leave some kind of mark a streak of silver hair or bewitching eyes maybe crows on ones roof or a hound from hell at your heel but what do i get blowing out my breath i stood and squinted at my reflection a black eye swell ivys voice murmured as she talked on the phone and after taking care of my most urgent need i decided a shower could wait until after i got a few questions answered and my stomach filled the dryer contained a pair of jeans instead of kistens clothes so with a new depression i tucked my staff shirt in invoked a complexion charm ran a toothbrush over my teeth and called it good the smell of coffee sifting in under the door made me feel ill i was so hungry movements slow from the expectation of bad news i headed out the bright light of a new day spilled into the hallway from the kitchen this was the third morning id gotten up at dawn instead of going to bed and i was tired of it rachel just woke up came ivys voice before i had gone two steps and i slowed she wasnt on the phone we had someone in our kitchen shes not talking to anyone until she gets a chance to eat and catch her breath and shes not talking to your shrink so you can just get back into your cruiser and the hell back to the fib where you belong my eyebrows rose and i hastened forward whats glenn doing here shit kisten i thought miserably answering my own question hes dead felps wasnt at sparagmoss apartment i heard edden say and my reality shifted not only was kistens death still uncertain but this wasnt glenn it was his dad i didnt know if that was better or worse we need to find him and rachel might be able to help he finished give the woman some peace jenks said piscary said he was dead find him on your own the is isnt going to stop you they dont care i pushed into motion ready to try anything if it would lead to kistens still being alive but if hes alive he might be hurt i said as i entered and edden turned from his position at the back of the kitchen there was someone else with him looking spare next to eddens squat bulk and my bare feet squeaked to a stop edden had brought the fibs shrink out with him edden glanced at the young man beside him ignoring the threat of ivy standing before the sink with her arms crossed edden came forward his brow pinched in worry he was in his usual khaki slacks and white shirt and the gun in his shoulder holster said he was working rachel he said glad to see me you look a lot better thanks i blinked in surprise when he gave me a hug the scent of old spice puffed up and i couldnt help my smile when he awkwardly dropped back i didnt hurt you did i he smiled and rubbed his elbow dont worry about it it wasnt you i exhaled in relief though still feeling guilty and i looked over the kitchen for anything to eat nothing was cooking but the coffeemaker was gurgling its last the cake had been frosted and it sat on the counter as a sad testament of how things were supposed to be depressed i sank down at my spot at the table kisten wasnt at the apartment i asked desperate hope almost painful as it settled in around my heart and i glanced at the other guy now shifting awkwardly jenks said he called to say he was going underground and piscary has lied before if kisten might be alive ill do anything eddens friend went to speak changing his mind when ivy pushed away from the sink and slunk to her chair before her computerher safe spot jenks stayed at the window standing on the sill where he could keep an eye on his kids i hadnt realized how noisy they were at sunrise edden thinks human psychology can bring back your memory ivy said scowling human science cant best a witch charm its only going to tear you up rachel ignoring her edden turned to the man and he came forward with a hesitant confidence dr miller this is rachel morgan rachel i want you to meet dr miller our psychiatrist i leaned forward in my chair and shook his hand the hope that kisten might be alive was desperate and painful and the color of the amulet dr miller was wearing shifted from a deep purple to white nice to meet you i said indicating he should sit down and he and edden took two chairs to my right the young man had a nice grip which wasnt surprising if he was the fibs shrink what did surprise me was the slight lifting of everafter that had tried to pull through me when we touched he was humani didnt sense any redwood coming off him at all and he worked for the fibbut he could do ley line magic and his amulet was metallicclearly a ley line charm he was taller than me and his brown shoes made an odd statement against his gray slacks and graypinstriped white shirt his black hair was cut to an easy style his frame was spare and he was wearing wirerimmed glasses before his brown eyes glasses i mused no one wears glasses unless my suspicion was borne out when dr miller tucked them away with a grimace crap they were for seeing auras without tapping in to ones second sight which humans generally couldnt do unaided without a lot of practice great nothing like a good first impression the amulet he wore shifted to a reddish gray and the fibs psychiatrist gave me an apologetic smile as he scooted his chair in its a pleasure to meet you ms morgan he said from between edden and me call me ford jenkss wings clattered and he flew to land on the table standing with his hands on his hips so the hilt of his garden sword showed that thing reads emotions doesnt it he said belligerently is that how you do your job you use that to know if people are telling the truth or not rachel isnt lying if she says she doesnt remember she doesnt remember shed want to find kisten if she could ford glanced down at it again taking it off from around his neck and setting it on the table the amulet isnt reacting to her its reacting to me sort of and im not here to find out if ms morgan is lying im here to help reconstruct what i can of her artificially muted memory with the intent to find mr felps i felt a stab of guilt and his ley line amulet flashed a brief grayblue once more if she allows it he added fingering the metallic disk the longer we wait the less she will remember we are under a time constraint especially if mr felps is in trouble ivys eyes were closed as she struggled to hide her emotions rachel hes dead she whispered for the fib to play on your hope to make their job of finding him easier is wrong you dont know hes dead edden protested and a chill took me when she opened her eyes they were black with pain im not going to listen to this she said i stiffened when she rose and walked out jenks hovered uncertainly then buzzed out after her the smell of the coffee pulled at me and i went to pour myself a mug filling two more for ford and edden the first gulp hit me like a balm doing as much as the soft breeze coming in the window to soothe me maybe there was something to this upatdawn stuff what do i do i said as i put the coffee before the two men and sat fords smile was brief but sincere if you would put this on the amulet settled into my hand and i felt the hum of everafter running through it tugging on me as if trying to pull it from my fingertips what does it do he hadnt let go of the charm yet and feeling his fingers slide against mine as he i looked up in almost shocked surprise his lips quirked in a smile when the amulet in my hand turned to a delicate lavender i was starting to see a pattern here your friend was correct its a visual show of your emotions he said and i cringed i could guess what lavender meant and i forced my thoughts to remain puritan pure as i looped it over my head unlike an earthcharm amulet this one only had to be within my aura to work not touching skin but you said it was responding to you not me a brief look of pain passed over his features it is my eyes widened you mean you can feel other peoples emotions naturally ive never heard of that before what are you you dont smell like a witch chuckling edden took his coffee and retreated to the corner of the kitchen pretending to watch jenkss kids in order to give us some privacy ford shrugged human i guess my mother was the same way she died from it ive never heard of anyone else like me im trying to find a way to make it work for me instead of against me the amulet is for you not me so you know exactly what im feeling from you the intensity of emotion is shown by brightness and the type of emotion by color i started to get a sick feeling but you can feel my emotions whether im wearing the amulet or not i asked and when he nodded i added then why am i wearing it edden shifted nervously at the window i knew he wanted us to get on with it so that when were done and you take it off you have the illusion that im not listening anymore jenks came in right about then changing his mind about landing on my shoulder at the last moment to park it on eddens shoulder when he saw my look it made sense even if it was a lie thats got to be hell i said someone ought to make a muffler for you fords expression blanked do you think you can i shrugged i dont know his brown eyes were distant and the amulet around my neck went pearl gray taking a deep breath he brought his attention back i couldnt help but wonder at the misery of sensing everyones emotions all the time poor guy i thought and the amulet burst into blue his lips parting ford blinked at me clearly feeling my pity for him the amulet shifted to red and my face flamed to match it embarrassed i reached to take the amulet off this isnt going to work i said fords hands enveloped mine stopping me please ms morgan he said earnestly and i swear i could feel the amulet warming in our hands this is a tool the reality is that people are far more adept at reading facial expressions than this amulet can indicate its simply a way to make a data point of something as nebulous as emotions i sighed my entire body easing and the amulet peeping between our fingers went a neutral gray call me rachel he smiled rachel his hands left mine to show that the disk was a silvery purple not the purple of anger as when i thought of the is but lavender ford liked me and when i smiled he went red in embarrassment jenks snickered and edden harrumphed can we get on with this the fib captain complained letting the amulet drop to where i couldnt see it i straightened suddenly nervous do you really think kisten is still alive his brow knitting edden crossed his arms over his chest and leaned back i dont know but the faster we find him the better nodding i settled into the chair and glanced at ford for direction id been to family counseling with my mom when my dad died but this was different ford angled the chair so that his legs ran perpendicular to the table rather than under it tell me what you remember he said simply hands folded jenkss wings increased in pitch then went silent i took a sip of coffee closing my eyes as the liquid slipped down it was easier if i didnt look at the amulet or fords eyes i didnt like the idea that i couldnt hide my emotions from him i left him at nicks apartment to wash his clothes i said feeling a pang of heartache it was a few hours until sunset and i had to move the car before it was recognized i was going to go back my eyes opened if piscary was right i did go back and you dont remember anything after i shook my head not until i woke up in ivys chair i was sore my foot hurt my inner lip was cut fords eyes went to my hand clutching my upper right arm and i forced my hand down even i was starting to realize it was my subconscious trying to tell me something dont try to remember then he said and i felt some tension leave me think about your foot you hurt yourself and thats hard to wash away completely who did you kick my breath exhaled slowly i closed my eyes and my foot seemed to throb not who but what i thought suddenly my hair had been in my mouth and it blocked my vision making me smack into the archway to the door instead of the handle the damn door was so freaking narrow and it hadnt been my fault the floor had moved throwing me off balance i felt my face go blank and i opened my eyes ford had leaned forward knowing that i had remembered something and his eyes seemed to demand an answer the amulet between us glowed a slurry of purple black and grayanger and fear i didnt remember the night but there was only one place kisten would go with narrow doors where the floor would move kistens boat i said standing up edden youre driving thirtyeight we sped down the paved road hitting the potholes caused by last years frost and snowplows the back roads outside of the hollows didnt get much attention as the cities grew larger and the country grew wilder edden had called in support and we quickly found out that kistens boat wasnt at piscarys but a fib officer on patrol remembered seeing a boat matching its description downriver at an old warehouse dock thats where we were headed lights on and sirens off speeding through the outskirts of the hollows and beyond until we were at the edges of whereever i would go after dark it wasnt that the neighborhood was bad it was that there was no neighborhood at all not after forty years of abandonment entire neighborhoods had been bulldozed under and left to go fallow when the survivors of the turn fled to the cities cincy had been no exception trees arched overhead and i could tell that the river was close by the winding road and the occasional glimpses of silver water i was up front with edden and ivy was in the backseat with ford that she wanted to come had surprised me until i realized her earlier words had been meant to quash her hope that kisten might still be alive or undead or something jenks was with her working hard to keep her distracted and calm it wasnt working if her black eyes and fords growing nervousness were any indication putting them together might not have been a good idea but i didnt want to sit next to him either there i exclaimed pointing to the outline of an abandoned brick building peeking from behind huge ancient trees it had to be the place we hadnt seen anything but empty lots framed by large trees for half a mile i tried to quell my nervousness even as i searched my feelings for having been here before nothing looked familiar the hot morning sun glinted on the leaves and the river as we slowed and pulled in to the weedchoked gravel drive my heart gave a painful thud when i saw kistens boat thats it i said fumbling for the door even before the car stopped thats the solans jenks left ivy hovering as i undid my belt rachel wait it was edden and i scowled when he hit the button and the lock engaged the crown victoria rocked to a halt and he put it in park ivy tried her door but it was a cop car and wouldnt open from the inside even if edden hadnt locked it i mean it he said as a stuffy silence filled the car broken by the agitated hum of jenkss wings youre going to stay in the car until backup gets here there could be anyone in that building jenks snickered and darted under the dash to flip edden off from the other side of the windshield i glanced at the twoway radio and the chatter coming from it it sounded as if the nearest person was five minutes away if its undead vampires youre worried about they wont be coming out for a suntan i said as i manually unlocked the door and lurched out and if its anyone else im going to kick their ass ivy scooted into fords space and while the man sat wideeyed and scrunched in the corner she kicked the door the lock snapped and she slid out unruffled and moving with the eerie grace of those that belong to the night jenks was gone and we followed him to the boat with a grim determination we were halfway there when edden caught up rachel stop ivys expression was awful and after a single glance that showed the depth of her fear she continued without me get your hand off me i exclaimed voice loud with misplaced anger as i yanked away from his grip im a professional not some distraught girlfriend well i was that too but i knew how to act at a crime scene you never would have found him if not for me he might need my help or are you admitting you manipulated me knowing he was dead already eddens face creased up in the bright light and it made him look old behind him ford sat leaning against the front of the car i wondered what his range for reading emotions was i hoped it was less than the twenty feet that separated us now if hes deadedden said i can handle myself i shouted the fear that he was right making me reckless im going in there its not a crime scene until we know theres a crime so get a grip ivy had reached the boat and swung up the fourfoot height to the deck in an enviable motion i jogged to catch up my swollen eye hurting from under the complexion charm and my foot throbbing kisten i shouted hoping for his voice kisten you here from the corner of my sight ford remained leaning against the car his head bowed feeling awkward i levered myself up onto the deck different muscles protested and i got from my knees to my feet tossing my hair out of my eyes ivy was already below the deck jenks still hadnt shown and i didnt know if that was good or bad i shivered at the dampness of the dewwet deck trying to remember being here nothing nothing at all the boat hardly moved with my weight and i half slid to the cockpit door grasping for handholds ivy i called as i went belowdecks fear winding between my soul and reason when she didnt answer the silence ate away at my hope like bitter acid drop by drop breath by breath if kisten was conscious he would have answered if he was undead he would be dead from the sun unless he had made it to the warehouse either option was bad it was quiet as i passed through the kitchen only the sounds of my heartbeat and a plane high overhead ivy would have said something if shed found him the smear of blood on the high window looking out over the far shore shook me a handprint kisten i whispered but i knew it wasnt his and it wasnt mine it was his killers the tears pricked i couldnt remember anything why in hell had i done this to myself the sight of the splintered door between the kitchen and the living room brought me to a breathless halt my foot started to throb and my heart raced i couldnt look away i knew my breath came back in a gasp when eddens bulk landed outside the window jarring me the boat scarcely moved under his weight either as if in a dream i stepped to the door reaching to touch it to make sure it was real sharp smooth slivers brushed my fingertips and i felt dizzy the light was eclipsed and i didnt turn when i felt edden and ford fill the doorway i did this i whispered my hand falling i didnt remember it but my body did my foot throbbing and my pulse fast i stared at the shattered frame my foot had broken the doorframe gaze unfocused i leaned against the cupboard for balance as remembered panic took me i remembered crying i remembered my hair in my mouth and trying to escape my arm had hurt so badly i couldnt manage the door so id kicked it open my eyes closed and i felt it all over again scattered images were all that was left i had kicked the door in and then the back of my head had met a wall i touched the back of my head as it began to throb there had been someone else here and at the faint hint of unfamiliar vampiric incense that still lingered i knew it had to have been kistens killer it had happened here and i had been a part of it i did this i said turning to the two men i remember doing this eddens face was tight and he held a drawn pistol pointed at the ceiling ford was behind him looking like the professional psychiatrist he was out of place and gathering information i wouldnt want his opinion on the soft sound of dragonfly wings brought my tearstreaked face around to see jenks his wings sparkling in the light coming in the low windows rache you better come in here oh god ivy i called out and edden shoved his way into the cramped space get behind me he said face grim and i pushed through the broken frame before him desperate to find her either kisten was dead and no threat or he was undead and destroyed from the sun or his killer was still here or ivy had found kisten and she needed me the living room was clean and empty smelling of water and sunshine through the open windows pulse fast i followed jenks into the hall past the bathroom and to the back bedroom the rasp of ivys ragged breath sent a chill through me and i jerked from eddens grasp only to stop dead just inside the door ivy stood alone with her back to the dresser arms over her middle and her head bowed before her on the floor slumped upright against the bed was kisten my eyes closed and a lump filled my throat grief slammed into me and i staggered to stand against the doorframe he was dead and it hadnt been easy eddens soft curse behind me cut through my awareness and i took a gasping breath you son of a bitch i whispered to no one you son of a bitch bastard i was far too late kistens barefoot body was dressed in a clean pair of jeans and a shirt id never seen his neck and body had been savaged and his arms and torso were torn as if he had tried to defend himself silvered blue eyes told me he had died undead but the blood pooled in his legs and heels said that he hadnt been drained simply killed twice dark blood matted his oncebright hair and his smile was gone i took another breath trying to keep upright though the room was starting to waver im sorry rachel edden said softly his hand landing on my shoulder in a show of comfort i know he meant a lot to you this wasnt your fault at that the tears started to dribble out one by one kisten i warbled not wanting to believe he was gone i had been here i had tried to keep him alive i must have but i hadnt been able to and the guilt must have been why id tried to forget i took a helpless step closer wanting to fall on my knees and pull him to me im sorry kisten i started to cry in earnest i must have tried i must have from behind me in the hall ford said you did both ivy and i turned he looked ragged as both of our personal hells resonated in him its in your thoughts he said and i just about lost it giving up i sank to my knees before kisten the tears flowing unchecked as i tried to arrange his shirt collar to hide his ravaged skin i dont remember i gushed i dont remember any of it tell me what happened fords voice was strained i dont know but youre feeling guilt and remorse theres hatred but not at him someone made you forget i looked up wanting to believe everything was blurry unreal you didnt forget because you couldnt handle it he said guilt in his voice for having labeled me weak someone made you forget against your will its all there in your emotions blinking fast i tried to clear my sight the pain in my chest wouldnt go away and let me think someone had been here besides me someone else knew what had happened someone had forced me to forget why a new fear pulled my attention to ivy still standing apart and miserable as kisten lay cold and dead between us she hadnt wanted ford to help me to remember had she had she killed him because hed bitten me i dont remember ivy whispered as if knowing my thoughts her head bowed and arms wrapped around herself to keep from falling apart i could have i dont remember edden put his weapon back in the holster snapping it shut arms crossed aggressively he took a firm stance i stood torn between anger at him and fear for ivy she wouldnt do it i said frightened and i went to give her a shake you wouldnt do that ivy look at me you loved him she shook her head her black hair hiding her face she was piscarys scion edden said she would if he told her to she loved kisten i exclaimed appalled and scared she wouldnt do it edden took a harder line word on the street is shed kill him if he touched your blood did he guilt seemed to stop my heart and i looked frantically for a way out jenks stood on the dresser miserable we were in the same room where id bitten kisten in a blood passion i scarcely knew how to comprehend he hadnt bitten me but it didnt seem to matter now ivy brought her head up at my silence her beautiful face was twisted in pain i might have done it she whispered i dont remember everything up to piscary attacking you is a a jumbled nightmare i think someone told me you tasted kisten i cant remember if someone told me or if i made it up tearwet eyes rose to mine framed by black hair iced in gold a terrible fear lay in her gaze i might have i might have done it rachel my stomach was in knots but the terror was gone and in a sudden surge i understood she hadnt wanted to come out here afraid she might find shed killed him she hadnt wanted ford to help me remember for the same reason someone had killed kisten but i knew to the bottom of my soul that it hadnt been ivy though centuries of evolution and conditioning made her want to you didnt kill him i said putting my arms around her to help her believe her muscles tensed and she started to silently tremble you didnt i know it ivy you wouldnt i dont remember she sobbed admitting her fear i dont remember anything but being angry and confused and out of control she moved and i let go so she could pull her head up did you bite him she whispered her eyes begging me to say no i was glad i wasnt wearing that amulet so at least i could pretend ford wasnt watching the drama play out if i said yes she would assume she had killed kisten but to lie was not possible i bit him i said the guilty words coming quick so i could get it out before she decided shed killed him to end the pain inside her he gave me a pair of caps for my birthday he knew youd made a pass at me looking back on it im sure i did it to convince him that i wasnt going to leave him that he was important to me ivy moaned and pulled away damn it ivy i exclaimed wiping at the slowly leaking tears you wouldnt kill him for that you loved him piscary never touched that part of you he couldnt you were never his he only thought you were kisten said piscary never asked you to kill me but piscary did didnt he i said watching her i could hardly breathe and her misery hesitated as she tried to remember he told you to kill me and you said no you wouldnt kill me for piscary and you wouldnt kill kisten for him either i know it ivy thats why you shut yourself off you didnt kill him you didnt for six heartbeats she simply stared thoughts sifting through her behind her i saw ford drop his head into his hand trying not to eavesdropbut hell that was his job she took a deep breath and all her muscles went limp kisten she finally breathed falling to her knees to touch him and i knew she believed her hands went to his hair his and she started to cry the first heavy cry was her undoing and proud stoic ivy finally let go huge racking sobs shook her shoulders tears for his death yes but for herself as well and i felt my own eyes fill and spill over as i dropped down to hold her beside his cold stillness kisten was the only person who had known the depth of depravity to which piscary had sunk them the heights of ecstasy the breathstealing power he had granted them and the terrible price he extracted for it the only one who had forgiven her for what she was who understood who she wanted to be he was gone and thered be no one else who could possibly understand not even me im sorry i whispered rocking her while her ragged sobs broke the silence as we sat on the floor of the tiny bedroom in a backwater tributary of the ohio river i know what he was to you well find out who did this we will find out and then well track them down and still she wept as if her grief would never end and then grief came for me as well cold and hard grief defined by bright blue eyes and the smile i loved so much and would never see again as my hand found his bitter salt tears spilled from my eyes in sorrow and pain and regret that i had so utterly failed him thirtynine two weeks later i jiggled the handle of the canvas bag to the crook of my arm so i could open the door to the church squinting up at the vampiric charms sign glowing wetly ivy wanted ice cream and since she didnt want it enough to go out in the rain for it i had been suckered into it id do just about anything to see her smile again it had been a rough two weeks course we needed cat food too and dish soap and we were out of coffee it was scary how fast my quick run to the store had turned into a threebag trip the door to the church creaked open and i slid inside leaning against the closed door for balance i wedged my shoes off it was dark seeing as the moon wasnt up and the clouds were thick i paused just inside the sanctuary flicking the light switch with my elbow nothing crap on toast i muttered smacking it a few more times just for fun jenks i shouted the fuse in the sanctuary blew again i didnt really expect an answer but where was ivy she had to have noticed shifting the bags awkwardly i headed for the kitchen three steps in i froze i could smell unfamiliar vampire lots of them and old smoke and beer shit i whispered adrenaline whipping through me now someone yelled and the lights flashed on panicked i dropped the bags and fell into a fighting stance blinded by the sudden glare surprise came a chorus of voices from the front of the church and i spun heart pounding happy birthday i stared my mouth hanging open and my hands in fists as the pint of chocochunk rolled to ivys feet she was actually smiling and i slowly stood straight my heart was still hammering her and jenks was making darting loops from me to her shedding a brilliant gold we got her he was shouting and what looked like all his kids took up the refrain filling the air with color and sound we got her good ivy look at her not a clue shocked i fumbled for the bags david keasley and ceri were at the couch and ivy was standing by the far light switch everyone was smiling but then as jenks had said theyd gotten me good there were no vampires here other than ivy and the only drink i could see were the three twoliters of soda on the coffee table the smell of vampire cigarettes and old beer was coming from the battered pool table now set up to one side of the sanctuary it hadnt been there when i had left seeing it i felt my throat close up it had been kistens but my birthday was last month i said still confused ceri came forward there was a cone hat on her head but she somehow made it look more dignified than one had any right to expect we didnt forget she said giving me a quick hug we were distracted happy birthday rachel i honestly didnt know what to say keasley had on a hat too and when he saw me look at him he took it off the pixies though kept theirs on darting about like mad my gaze went to the pool table and tears pricked at my eyes from there i looked to the surrounding faces under their smiles they were pleading almost desperate for me to pretend everything was normal that life was getting back to what it should be that i wasnt missing a huge piece of myself that there was one person that should be here who wasnt and never would be again so i smiled wow i said coming to take the ice cream ivy had picked up off the floor this is great and yeah im surprised i let the bags of groceries slip to the couch and took off my coat i really dont believe this thanks guys ceri gave my upper arm a squeeze in support and then her expression blanked i forgot the cake she exclaimed green eyes going wide i left it on my table theres cake i said wincing when jenks flicked on the stereo and marilyn mansons personal jesus blared out before he turned it down ceri must have made it because wed thrown the old one out i hadnt been able to eat it while kisten lay in the morgue and now that he was cremated and in ivys room i felt no different but tonight other peoples feelings were involved and i realized i was going to have to eat ceris cake or risk hurting her feelings jenks flitted back to me shooing his kids away from the soda hell yes theres cake he said loud to cover ceris distress cant have a birthday without cake ill help you ceri the pretty elf shook her head you stay she said halfway to the door no need for you to leave ill go get it ill be right back she jerked to a stop and retraced her steps smiling and bright here she said taking her hat off and putting it on me wear this ivy snickered and i reached up to touch it thanks i said cursing my outright fear of hurting her feelings great i was going to be eating cake in a silly hat damn it no one had better have a camera keasleys brown arthritic hands gathered up the handles of the canvas grocery sacks ill take those you entertain he said pulling them from the couch hesitating he turned bending his oncetall height to give me a fatherly kiss on the cheek happy birthday rachel youre quite the young woman your father would be proud of you if they were trying to cheer me up they were doing a lousy job of it thanks i said feeling my throat start to take on a lump i turned looking for something to do ivy was supervising jenks handing out soda to his kids in little cups made from the plastic plugs they put in pressboard furniture to hide the holes david caught my eye and started over his worn brown boots showed from under his blue jeans and he scuffed to an uncertain halt i hadnt seen him since the night id been lying on the floor drugged as he told minias that he had a legal right to make decisions for me david had saved my life as much as ceri happy birthday he said clearly wanting to say something more hell a handshake wasnt going to do it and as a wash of gratitude warmed me i reached out and brought him close taking him in a hug his arms were solid and real comforting the complicated scent of were filled my senses and i closed my eyes feeling my chest grow heavy when i noticed the differences between being held by him and kisten id never hold kisten again i clenched my jaw and refused to cry i didnt want to talk about kisten i wanted to pretend we were all normal but i had to say something i couldnt let david think i wasnt grateful for what hed done thank you i said into his shirt thank you for saving my life it was an honor his voice rumbled from him to me through his chest and his hold on me grew more certain now that he knew that the depth of my emotion was coming from gratitude im sorry about brett i said miserably and his grip tightened me too he said and i heard the pain in his voice the loss of more than a fellow were but a possible friend i want to make him a member of our pack posthumously id like that i said throat closing giving my arms a squeeze he let go and backed up i met his eyes surprised at the flash of fear it was the curse it was afraid of me and it was only davids alpha confidence that held it in check anyone else might have misunderstood the fleeting deepseated terror but id had that thing in my thoughts i knew what it was and it was dangerous david dont he said his dark eyes fixing on me to stop my words i did the right thing i turned five women and it killed three of them if i have the curse in me i can help serena and kally his anger left him as he got lost in a memory and its not that bad he finished gesturing helplessly i feel good whole like this is the way i was supposed to be yeah but david he confidently shook his head i have this under control the curse is like the devil itself i feel it in me and i have to weigh my thoughts to decide if its me or the curse but its happy to be able to run again and i have that as a threat it knows if it makes me angry ill come to you and youll take it out and put it in a prison of bone its right i said remembering the fear in his eyes from just my touch david this is so dangerous let me take it out everyone thinks the focus is destroyed we can hide it he held up a hand and i stopped with the curse in me serena and kally can shift without pain do you really want to take that from them and its okay i didnt want a pack but sometimes our choices are made for us the curse belongs to the weres leave it where it is he said firmly as if the conversation were done slumping against the back of the couch i gave up david ducked his head and relaxed he had won and he knew it ivy glanced at me from where she was handing out soda when jenks whispered something in her ear and her questioning gaze turned into a smile taking two plastic cups she moved to sit against the pool table where she could watch everyone do you want something to drink rachel david asked and ivy raised one to say shed already poured me something ivys got it i said and he touched my arm before going to see what keasley wanted i wasnt thirsty but i went over to ivy leaning against the table beside her her thin eyebrows were high and she silently handed me my drink my gaze strayed to her neck piscary had bitten her so cleanly that the bites had healed with almost no scar my neck still was a nasty mess and it would likely stay that way i didnt care my soul was black and the outward scarring seemed to fit piscary had been dead for two weeks and the minor camarillas were chomping at each others heels to find out who would be cincinnatis next master vampire the mourning period was nearly over and all of cincy was gearing up for the squabbles and power plays ivys mom had a good shot at it which didnt fill me with any confidence though ivy would be exempt from being a blood source shed probably have more backroom responsibility all of piscarys vampires had banded together under her if a different camarilla came out on top their lives wouldnt be worth the grape leaves piscary had used to wrap around his lamb sandwiches ivy said she wasnt worried but it had to be preying on her now she cleared her throat in warning and i forced my hand down from my own neck before i accidentally set the scar resonating to her pheromones the scent of the pool table rose around me the combined scent of vampires cigarette smoke and beer bringing back memories of me knocking around the balls as i waited in a peaceful empty dance club for kisten to finish locking up and our evening to begin again my throat closed and i set my drink down nice pool table i said miserably im glad you like it at my shoulder ivy blinked fast but didnt look at me its your birthday present from jenks and me jenks darted up with a clatter of wings happy birthday rachel he said with a forced brightness i was going to give you some colorchanging nail polish but ivy thought youd like this better unshed tears made my vision swim but i wasnt going to cry damn it i stretched out my hand and ran my fingers over the rough felt it had stitches just like me thanks i said damn it ivy jenks said as he darted erratically from me to her i told you it was a bad idea look shes crying i sniffed loudly glancing up to see that only keasley had noticed no i said my voice a shade too tight i love it thank you ivy took a drink maintaining a silent companionable misery i didnt need to say a word i couldnt every time i had tried to comfort her the last two weeks shed fled id learned it was better just to meet her eyes and look away with my mouth shut the pixy landed on her shoulder in silent support and i saw her tension ease the pool table might be mine in name but i think it meant more to ivy it was the only thing besides kistens ashes that she had taken and the fact that she had given it to me was an affirmation that she understood that hed been important to both of us that my pain was as important as hers god i miss him the ice in my drink shifted to smack my nose when i took a sip i wasnt going to cry not again edden wanted me to come in and talk to ford about my memory for your own piece of mind not the case he had said but i wasnt going to i might have had my memory loss forced upon me but now that it was gone it could stay gone it would only cause more pain the fib were bucking the system and trying to find out who had killed kisten by way of who had made the deal between piscary and al to get him out but that was a dead end the ringing of the doorbell cut through my mournful musings and i started ill get it i said pushing from the pool table and heading for the door i had to do something or i was going to make myself cry its probably ceri jenks said from my shoulder youd better hurry cake and rain dont go together very well i couldnt help my smile but it froze and broke to nothing when i yanked open the door and found quen standing there his beemer running at the curb anger rose at the reminder of the murdered weres i knew too many people in the morgue i didnt want to live my life like that trent was a slimy murdering bastard quen should be ashamed to work for him hi quen i said putting an arm up to block his entrance who invited you quen took a step back clearly shocked at seeing me his gaze went behind me to the party then returned he cleared his throat tapping the legalsize envelope he had against his hand the rain seemed to glisten on his shoulders but he was completely unaffected by it i didnt know you were having a gettogether if i can talk to jenks a moment ill go he said his gaze lingered on my head and when he smiled i snatched ceris hat off what not going to hang around for cake i snapped snatching at the envelope id take his money then buy a lawyer to put him in jail with trent currently out on bail quen jerked the envelope out of my reach his face creasing in bother this isnt yours pixy kids were starting to gather around the doorframe and jenks made an earpiercing chirp hi quen is that mine he said as his kids scattered laughing the elf nodded and i cocked my hip not believing this youre going to stiff me again i exclaimed mr kalamack isnt paying you for arresting him quen said stiffly i kept him alive didnt i at that quen lost his ire chuckling as he touched his chin and rocked back on his heels you have a lot of nerve morgan its what keeps me alive i said sourly starting when i found rex at the foot of the belfry stairway staring at me god creepy little cat do tell he hesitated looking past me before he brought his attention back jenks ive got your paperwork he went to hand the envelope to him then hesitated again i could see why the envelope was three times jenkss weight if it was an ounce just give it to rache jenks said landing on my shoulder and i smugly held out my hand for it ivys got a safe we can put it into quen sourly handed it over and curious i opened it up it wasnt money it was a deed it had our address on it and jenkss name you bought the church i stammered and the pixy darted off my shoulder literally glowing jenks you bought the church jenks grinned the dust slipping from him a clear silver yup he said proudly after piscary tried to evict us i couldnt risk you two bankers losing it in a poker game or something i stared at the paper jenks owned the church where did you get the money in a flash of vampire incense ivy was beside me she pulled the paper from my slack fingers eyes wide quen shifted his weight his shoes gently scuffing good evening jenks he said his voice carrying a new respect working with you was enlightening whoa wait up i demanded where did you get the money for this jenks grinned rent is due on the first rache not the second or the third or the first friday of the month and i expect you to pay to get it resanctified quen slipped down the steps with hardly a sound ceri was coming up the walk and the two passed with wary cautious words she had a covered plate in her hands the cake presumably she glanced back once as she rose up the stairs and i moved so she could come in ivy though was too struck to move you outbid me ivy shouted and ceri slipped between us and into the sanctuary rex twining around her feet that was you i was bidding against i thought it was my mother the click of quens car door opening was lost in the hush of rain and jenks still hadnt answered me quen glanced at me across the top of his car before he got in and drove away damn it pixy i shouted youd better start talking where did you get the money i uh pulled a job with quen he said hesitantly the masculine murmur of keasley and david rose and i shut the door against the damp night jenks had said job not run there was a difference what kind of job i asked warily if a pixy could hover guiltily jenks was nothing much he said darting past ivy and me into the sanctuary nothing that wouldnt have happened anyway my eyes narrowing i followed him back to the party setting ceris hat on the piano in passing ivy was right behind me what did you do jenks nothing that wouldnt have happened on its own he whined shedding green sparkles onto the pool table i like where i live he said landing behind the side pocket in his best peter pan pose you two women are too flaky to put my family in your hands just ask anyone here theyd agree with me ivy huffed and turned her back on him muttering under her breath but i could tell she was relieved her new landlord wasnt her mom what did you do jenks i demanded ivys eyes narrowed in a sudden thought faster than i would have believed possible she snatched up a pool cue and slammed it down inches from jenks the pixy shot up into the air almost hitting the ceiling you little bug she exclaimed and ceri grabbed keasley and the cake and headed toward the kitchen the paper says trents been released what appalled i gazed at jenks up near the ceiling keasley jerked to a brief halt in the hallway then continued on david had dropped his head into his hands but i think he was trying not to laugh the fingerprint they lifted from brett and the paperwork was lost ivy said smacking a beam with the cue to make jenks dart to the next one over they dropped charges you stupid pixy he murdered brett she had him and you helped quen him get off whaaaat he griped moving to my shoulder for protection i had to do something to save your pretty little ass rache trent was thiiiiis close to taking you out his voice went high in exaggeration arresting him at his own wedding was stupid and you know it my anger evaporated as i remembered trents expression when the cuffs ratcheted shut god that had felt good okay ill give you that i said trying to see him on my shoulder but it was fun did you see the look on ellasbeths face jenks laughed doubling up you should have seen her dads he said oooooh doggies that man was more upset than a pixy papa with eight sets of girls ivy set the pool cue on the table and relaxed i dont remember it she said softly her lack of memory was disturbing and trying to ignore that i was missing chunks of my week too i looked up as ceri and keasley came back in the cake almost on fire from all the candles theyd stuck into it i couldnt very well stay mad when they started singing happy birthday and i felt the tears prick again that i had people in my life who cared enough to go through the misery of trying to pretend everything was normal when it wasnt ceri settled the cake on the coffee table and i hesitated only briefly at my wish it had been the same every year since my father had died my eyes closed against the smoke as i blew the candles out they smarted and i wiped them with no one saying anything as they clapped teasing to find out what the wish was taking up the big knife i started slicing the cake layering perfectly triangular pieces on paper plates decorated with spring flowers the chatter became overly loud and forced and with jenkss kids everywhere it was a madhouse ivy wouldnt look at me as she took her plate and seeing as she was the last i settled myself across from her david followed ceri and the cat to the piano where she started playing some complicated tune that was probably older than the constitution keasley was trying to keep the pixies occupied and out of the frosting entertaining them with the way his wrinkles disappeared when he puffed his cheeks out and i was sitting with a plate of cake on my lap absolutely miserable and having no cause for it or not really the awful feeling of loss i had felt in the fib conference room rose from nowhere pulled into existence by the reminder of kistens death id thought ivy and jenks were dead id thought everyone i cared about had been severed from me and that i had given up and accepted the damage of a demon curse when i thought id nothing left to lose had opened my eyes really fast either i was an emotional wimp and had to learn to handle the potential loss of everyone i loved without caving orand this was the one that scared me the mosti had to come to grips and accept that my blackandwhite outlook on demon curses wasnt so black and white anymore i had a sick feeling that it was the latter i was going bad the lure of demon magic and power was too much to best but damn it when shes fighting demons and nasty elves with the strength of the worlds economics on their side a girl has to get a little dirty i looked at my chocolate cake and forced my jaw to unclench i wasnt going to agonize over the smut on my soul i couldnt and still live with myself ceri was coated with it and she was a good person hell the woman had almost cried over forgetting my birthday cake i was going to have to handle demon magic the same way i did earth and ley line magic if the stuff that went into the spell or curse didnt hurt anyone and the working of the spellcurse didnt hurt anyone and the result of the spellcurse didnt harm anyone but me then i was going to twist the stupid curse and call myself a good person i didnt give a damn what anyone else thought jenks would tell me if i was straying wouldnt he fork in hand i cut a bite then put it back on the plate untasted i met ivys miserable expression seeing the tears in her eyes kisten was dead to sit here and eat my cake seemed so hypocritical and trite but i wanted something normal i needed something to tell myself that i was going to live past this that i had good friendsand since i didnt drown my sorrows in beer id do it in chocolate you going to eat that or cry over it jenks said flitting in from the piano shut up jenks i said tiredly and he smirked sending a glitter of sparkles to puddle on the table before the breeze from the upper transom window blew them into infinity you shut up he said spooning up a wad of my frosting with a pair of chopsticks eat your cake we made it for your damned birthday eyes warming from unshed tears i jammed the fork into my mouth just so i wouldnt have to say anything else the sweet chocolate tasted like ashes on my tongue and i forced it down reaching for another bite like it was a chore across from me ivy was doing the same thing it was my birthday cake and we were going to eat it in the rafters pixies played safe in their garden and church until the two worlds collided kistens death would darken my coming months until i found a new pattern to my life but there were good things to balance against the heartache david seemed to be handling the cursehe seemed to like it actuallyand since he had a real pack his boss would stop gunning for me al was tucked away in an everafter prison most likely the weres were off my case piscary was not only no longer my landlord but was dead really dead lee would step into the gambling and protection vacuum hed left behind and seeing as i had some part in freeing him he probably would give up on his urge to knock me off having lee back would pacify trent too though it rankled me back to the turn that he was out of jail god the man was like teflon and ivy ivy wasnt going anywhere we would figure this out eventually and no one would die trying no longer tied to piscary she was her own person together with jenks we three could do anything right
