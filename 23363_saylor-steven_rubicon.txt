steven saylor rubicon part one minerva i pompey will be mightily pissed said davus soninlaw you have a penchant for stating the obvious i sighed and knelt and steeled myself to take a closer look the lifeless body lay facedown in the middle of my garden directly before the bronze statue of minerva like a prostrate worshiper at the goddesss feet davus turned in a circle shielding his eyes from the morning sunlight and peering warily at the four corners of the peristyle roof surrounding us what i cant see is how the assassin got in and out without any of us in the house hearing he wrinkled his brow which made him look like a perplexed and much overgrown boy built like a greek statue and just as thick that was bethesdas joke my wife had not taken kindly to the notion of our only daughter marrying a slave especially a slave who had been brash enough or stupid enough to get her pregnant but if davus had a penchant for the obvious diana had a penchant for davus and there was no denying that they had produced a beautiful son whom i could hear even now screaming at his mother and grandmother to be let out into the garden crying as only a twoyearold can but aulus could not be let out to play on this bright mild januarius afternoon for there was a corpse in the garden and not just any corpse the dead man was numerius pompeius who was somehow related to pompey one of the great ones cousins though a couple of generations younger he had arrived at my house alone half an hour earlier now he lay dead at my feet i cant understand it davus scratched his head before i let numerius in the door i took a good look up and down the street like i always do i didnt notice anybody following him when davus had been a slave it was pompey who had owned him and davus had been a bodyguard an obvious choice given his hulking physique he had been trained not just to fight but to keep a lookout for danger as my soninlaw davus was the physical protector of the household and in these perilous times it was his job to greet visitors at the door now that a murder had occurred within the house practically under his nose he took it as a personal failure in pompeys service such a lapse would have called for a harsh interrogation at the least in the face of my silence davus seemed determined to interrogate himself he paced back and forth using his fingers to tick off each question why did i let him in well because i knew him by sight back from my days with pompey he was no stranger he was numerius my former masters favorite young cousin who always had a good word for everyone and he came alone not even a bodyguard to worry about so i didnt see any need to make him wait outside i let him into the foyer did i ask if he had any weapons its against the law to carry weapons inside the city walls of course but nobody pays attention to that these days so yes i did ask and he didnt make any fuss at all and handed over his dagger right away did i search him for more weapons as youve told me to do even with citizens yes i did and he didnt even protest did i leave him alone even for a moment no i did not i stayed with him there in the foyer sent little mopsus to tell you there was a visitor then waited until you sent back word that youd see him i escorted him through the house back here to the garden diana and aulus were out here with you playing in the sunny spot at minervas feet right where numerius is lying now but you sent them inside did i stay with you no because you sent me inside too but i knew better i should have stayed numerius said he had a message for my ears alone i said if a man cant safely have a private talk in his own home i looked about the garden at the carefully pruned shrubbery and the brightly colored columns that lined the surrounding walkway i gazed up at the bronze statue of minerva after all these years the face that peered down from her great war helmet remained inscrutable to me the garden was at the center of the house its heart the heart of my world and if i was not safe here then i was safe nowhere dont chastise yourself davus you did your job you knew that numerius was whom he claimed to be and you took his weapon but pompey would never be left unguarded even for have we reached a point where a common citizen needs to mimic pompey or caesar and have a bodyguard standing over him every moment of every hour even when hes wiping his ass davus frowned i knew what he was thinking that it was unlike me to talk so crudely that i must be badly shaken and trying not to show it that his fatherinlaw was getting too old to deal with ugly shocks like a corpse in the garden before the midday meal he stared up at the rooftop again but numerius wasnt the danger was he it was whoever followed him here the fellow must be half lizard to scurry up and down the walls without making a sound did you hear nothing fatherinlaw i told you numerius and i talked for a while then i left him for a moment and stepped into my study but thats only a few feet away still i suppose the statue of minerva might have blocked the view and your hearing my ears are as sharp as those of any man of sixtyone davus nodded respectfully however it happened its a good thing you werent out here when the assassin came or else or else i might have been strangled too i touched my fingers to the rope that still circled numeriuss neck cutting into the livid flesh he had been killed with a simple garrote a short loop of rope attached to each end of a short stout twisting stick davus knelt beside me the killer must have come up behind him dropped the garrote over his head then used the stick to twist it tighter and tighter around his throat a gruesome way to die i turned away feeling queasy but a quiet way davus went on numerius couldnt even cry out maybe he managed a gurgle or a grunt at the start but then with his air cut off the only way to make a sound would be to bang against something see there fatherinlaw how numerius gouged his heels into the gravel but that wouldnt make much noise if only he could have banged a fist against the bronze minerva but both hands are clutched to his throat thats a mans instinct to try to tear the rope from his neck i wonder davus peered up at the roof again the killer neednt have been a big fellow it doesnt take a great deal of strength to garrote a man even a big man so long as you take him unaware do you speak from experience soninlaw oh i learned lots of things like that training to be pompeys bodyguard davus smiled at me crookedly then saw the look on my face his smile vanished you dont think that i of course not but i wonder might such an idea occur to pompey is there any reason for you to bear a grudge against pompey something i dont know about when you were his slave did he ever mistreat you no fatherinlaw have i ever complained about him he was a good master davus managed another crooked smile besides wasnt it pompey who lent me to you back during the clodian riots to guard the house and wasnt that how i came to know diana and he flushed pompey lent you to me you became my daughters secret lover the two of you made a baby and then it was up to me either to sue pompey for damages and see you flogged to death or else acquire you from pompey set you free and make you my soninlaw its i who should bear a grudge against pompey i thought this but did not say it i only mean to say davus stumbled on that i harbor only good will toward pompey as he must know if he ever gives me any thought at all what about numerius you say he was pompeys favorite young cousin did he take liberties with the slaves when he was in the great ones house did numerius ever mistreat you make fun of you abuse you in some other way some men might have taken certain advantage of a slave who was thick as a greek statue and built like one never i told you numerius had a good word for everyone i liked him then theres no reason no reason at all why you might loom up as a suspect in pompeys mind when he learns that numerius was murdered under my roof none at all because soninlaw if i thought pompey might suspect you id be tempted to drag numerius into the street and pretend he never set foot in this house these days it profits a man to go to whatever lengths he can to avoid trouble especially trouble with the great one i studied davuss face which was incapable of deceit i nodded well then pompey will have to be told i suppose i must do it myself make the trip outside the city walls to pompeys villa wait for an interview give him the bad news then let him deal with the matter as he chooses here help me roll the body faceup from inside the house i heard my little grandson shouting again to be let into the garden i looked toward the doorway bethesda and diana peered out anxiously it was something of a miracle that they had so far obeyed me and stayed out of the garden bethesda started to speak but i held up my hand and shook my head i was rather surprised when she nodded and withdrew taking diana with her i forced myself to look at numeriuss strangled face it was a sight to give anyone nightmares he had been young in his twenties probably a bit older than davus his broad blandly handsome features were now discolored and distorted and almost unrecognizable in a rictus of agony i swallowed hard as i used two fingers to shut his lids i saw my reflection in the black pool of his staring eyes no wonder my wife and daughter had obeyed me without question the look on my face was alarming even to me i stood my knees crackling like the gravel beneath my feet davus sprang up beside me as supple as a cat despite his size pompey will be mightily pissed i said gravely i said that already so you did davus but bad news keeps as the poet says the day is young and i see no need to rush across rome to bring pompey the news what do you say we have a closer look and see what numerius may be carrying but i told you i searched him when i took his dagger there was only a small moneybag around his waist with a clip for his scabbard nothing else i wouldnt be sure of that help me take off his clothes be careful we shall have to put everything back exactly as it was before pompeys men come to claim the body beneath his wellcut woolen tunic numerius wore a linen loincloth it was wet with urine but he had not soiled himself he wore no jewelry except for his citizens ring i took off the ring and examined it it appeared to be solid iron with no secret compartments or hidden devices there were only a few coins inside his moneybag considering the chaotic state of the city it would not have been prudent for a man without bodyguards to carry more i turned the bag inside out there were no secret pockets perhaps youre right davus perhaps he was carrying nothing of interest after all unless take off his shoes would you my back aches from bending over the uppers were made of finely tanned black leather stamped with an intricate design of interconnected triangles closed and fastened by thongs that wound around the ankle and calf the soles were quite thick made of several layers of hardened leather attached to the uppers by hobnails there was nothing inside them they were warm and carried the scent of numeriuss feet handling them was more intimate than handling his clothing or even his ring i was about to hand them back to davus when i noticed an irregularity in the layered sole at the heel the same irregularity appeared at the same spot in both shoes there were two breaks in the middle layer of the sole about a thumbs length apart near one of the breaks was a small hole do you have the dagger you took from numerius davus wrinkled his brow yes ah i see but if you mean to cut into his shoes i can fetch a better knife from the kitchen no let me see numeriuss dagger davus reached inside his tunic i handed him the shoes and he handed me the dagger in its sheath i nodded what do you notice about this sheath davus he frowned suspecting a test of some sort its made of leather yes but what sort of leather black he saw that i was unimpressed and tried again its decorated how its stamped and the same pattern is carved on the wooden hilt of the dagger yes a pattern of interlocking triangles davus peered at the shoes in his hands the same pattern as on his shoes exactly meaning davus was stumped meaning i said that whatever shop made the shoes also made the dagger theyre a set rather unusual dont you think that the same shop should produce such dissimilar goods davus nodded pretending to follow my thoughts so are you going to pull out the dagger and cut open the shoes or not no davus i am going to unlock the shoes i left the blade in its sheath and studied the hilt which was carved from the hard black wood of the syrian terebinth attached to the metal by bosses of ivory the triangle design ingeniously concealed the hidden compartment in the hilt but it slid open easily once i found the right place to press with my thumb inside the compartment was a tiny key hardly more than a sliver of bronze with a little hook near one end soninlaw hold up the shoes with the heels facing me i started with the shoe on my left the irregularity in the heel the two breaks i had noticed in the center layer of leather proved to be a narrow door with a hinge at one side and a keyhole at the other i inserted the tiny key into the tiny hole after a bit of fiddling the door gave a little snap and sprang open extraordinary i whispered what workmanship so delicate yet sturdy enough to be trod on i took the shoe from davus held it under the sunlight and peered down into the narrow chamber i saw nothing i turned the shoe over and knocked it against my palm nothing came out empty i said we could still cut into it said davus helpfully i gave him a withering look soninlaw did i not say that we must put back all of numeriuss things exactly as they were so that pompeys men will see no signs of our tampering when they come to fetch him davus nodded that includes his shoes now hand me the other one i inserted the key and fiddled until the lock sprang open there was something inside i withdrew what appeared to be several pieces of thin parchment ii what does it say fatherinlaw i dont know yet is it latin i dont know that yet either i see greek letters and latin letters both all mixed together clever of you davus to spot the difference davus had lately been taking instruction from diana who was determined to teach him how to read his progress had been slow but how can that be greek and latin letters both its in some sort of code davus until i figure out the code i cant read it any better than you can we had stepped from the garden into my study and now sat across from each other at the little tripod table by the window peering down at the thin pieces of parchment i had extracted from numeriuss shoe there were five pieces in all each covered with writing so tiny that i had to squint to make out the letters at first glance the text appeared to be pure nonsense a collection of random letters strung together i suspected the use of a cipher with the added complication of mixing greek and latin characters i tried to explain to davus how a cipher worked thanks to diana he had mastered the basic idea that letters could represent sounds and collections of letters could represent words but his hold on the alphabet was tenuous as i explained how letters could be shuffled arbitrarily about then unshuffled his face registered mounting bewilderment but i thought the whole point of letters was that they didnt change that they always stood for the same thing yes well i tried to think of a metaphor imagine the letters all taking on disguises take your name the d might masquerade as an m the a as a t and so on and altogether youd have five letters that didnt look like any sort of word at all but figure a way to see through those disguises and you can unmask the whole word i smiled thinking this was rather clever but the look on davuss face was now of confusion verging on panic if only meto were here i muttered the younger of my two adopted sons had turned out to have a genius for letters his natural gifts had served him well in caesars ranks he had become the generals literary adjutant to hear meto tell it he had done much of the actual writing of caesars account of the gallic wars which everyone in rome had been reading for the last year no one was more brilliant than meto at cracking codes anagrams and ciphers but meto was not in rome not yet anyway though expectations of caesars imminent arrival continued to mount day by day causing jubilation in some quarters terror in others there are rules about solving ciphers i muttered aloud trying to remember the simple tricks that meto had taught me a cipher is simply a puzzle solving a puzzle is merely a game and and all games have rules which any fool can follow i looked up and saw my daughter standing in the doorway diana i told you to stay in the front of the house what if little aulus mother is watching him shell keep him out of the garden you know how superstitious she is about dead bodies diana clicked her tongue that poor fellow looks awful i wanted to spare you the sight papa ive seen dead bodies before but not not strangled like that no though i have seen a garrote before it looks a lot like the one used to murder titus trebonius a few years ago the fellow you proved was strangled by his wife you kept the garrote as a souvenir remember mother threatened to use it on davus if he ever displeased me she was joking i think such weapons are as common as daggers these days i said davus are you doing a good job of helping papa diana moved to her husbands side and laid a slender arm over his brawny shoulders then touched her lips to his forehead davus grinned a strand of dianas long black hair fell across his face tickling his nose i cleared my throat the problem appears to be a cipher davus and i have practically solved it already run along diana back to your mother isis and osiris papa how can you possibly read such fine writing she squinted at the parchment contrary to prevailing opinion in this household i am neither deaf nor blind i said and it is unseemly for girls to speak impiously in front of their fathers even if the deities invoked are egyptian a passion for all things egyptian was dianas latest rage she called it a homage to her mothers origins i called it an affectation im not a girl papa im twenty years old married and a mother yes i know i looked sidelong at davus who was completely absorbed in blowing wisps of his wifes shimmering black hair away from his nose if solving a cipher is the problem papa then let me help you davus can go stand watch in the garden to make sure no one else comes over the rooftop davus brightened at this suggestion i nodded he strode off at once you too diana i said off with you instead she took davuss place in the chair across from me i sighed it needs to be done quickly i said the dead fellow out there is a relative of pompeys for all i know pompey may have already sent someone looking for him where did these pieces of parchment come from they were hidden in a secret compartment in his shoe diana raised an eyebrow this fellow was one of pompeys spies i hesitated perhaps why did he come here why did he want to see you papa i shrugged we hardly spoke before i left him alone for a moment and then davus came into the garden found his body and raised the alarm diana eagerly reached for a sheet of parchment if we look for vowels and common consonant combinations and common words and case endings right or likely words i added likely words likely to occur in a document carried by pompeys spy such as such as pompey for example or more likely magnus great one diana nodded or gordianus perhaps she looked at me askance perhaps i said diana fetched two styluses and two wax tablets for scribbling notes we studied our separate pieces of parchment in silence out in the garden davus paced back and forth in the sunlight whistling tunelessly and scanning the roof he pulled numeriuss dagger from its scabbard and cleaned his fingernails from the front of the house came more screams from aulus and then the sound of bethesda crooning an egyptian lullaby i think yes diana i think i may have found magnus i see the same sequence of letters three times on this piece look there it is on your piece too where there vcq so it is by hercules these letters are small if youre right that gives us for m v for a for g we scribbled on our wax tablets diana scanned her piece of parchment put it down and scanned two others papa may i see your piece i handed it to her her eyes moved down the page then stopped she sucked in a breath what is it daughter look there she pointed to a group of letters they began with and ended with cq or according to our cipher began with a g and ended with nus and had five letters between gordianus she whispered my heart pounded in my chest maybe forget the other pieces for now lets work together on this one we concentrated on the section of text immediately following my name it was diana who spotted the large numbers strewn throughout rather than quantities they appeared to be years following varros fashionable new system of dating everything from the founding of rome the cipher letters for d and i presumed already from gordianus turned out to stand as well for the numerals d five hundred and i one deciphering the years also gave us the letters for c l x and v using our growing list of deciphered letters we quickly spotted familiar names embedded in the text there was meto and caesar eco my other son cicero even bethesda and diana who seemed more amused than alarmed at seeing her name in a dead mans document as we made further progress the most devious feature of the text became obvious not only did the cipher mix greek and latin letters but the text alternated between phrases in both languages with a patchwork of truncated and irregular grammar my greek had grown rusty in recent years fortunately dianas egyptomania had included brushing up on the language of the ptolemies with her sharper eyes and quicker stylus diana drew ahead of me eventually despite some remaining gaps here and there she managed to make a hasty translation of the entire passage into latin scribbling it out on a long piece of blank parchment when she was done i asked her to read it aloud subject gordianus called the finder loyalty to the great one questionable a loyalty report i shook my head all these bits of parchment must constitute some sort of secret dossier on various men in rome someones evaluation of where they each might stand in the event of a in the war thats coming between pompey and caesar how matteroffactly diana was able to say the words i choked on she had no experience of civil war no memories of rome besieged and conquered of enemy lists and seized property and heads on stakes in the forum diana read on plebeian family origins obscure no known military service age about sixty then theres a sort of resume a chronological list of highlights from your illustrious career lets hear it little known of activities prior to year of rome when he gathered information for cicero for the parricide trial of sextus roscius earned gratitude of cicero his first major defense enmity of the dictator sulla numerous episodes of employment by cicero and others in subsequent years often related to murder trials travel to spain and sicily year of rome vestal virgins fabia and licinia accused of intercourse with catilina and crassus respectively gordianus thought to have some hand in the defense but his role obscure year of rome employed by crassus on the eve of his command against spartacus to investigate the murder of a relative in baiae again his role obscure his relations with crassus strained thereafter year of rome birth of his brilliant and beautiful daughter diana thats not in there no clearly whoever compiled this little review doesnt know everything actually the next entry reads year of rome death of his patrician patron lucius claudius inherited etruscan farm and moved out of rome year of rome played murky role in conspiracy of catilina spied on catilina for cicero or vice versa or both relations with cicero strained thereafter traded etruscan farm for his current residence on the palatine hill assumed pretense of respectability pretense dont read that part to your mother go on year of rome assisted clodia in prosecution of marcus caelius for the murder of the philosopher dio there was a catch in her voice further estrangement from cicero defending caelius i grunted the less said about that case the better concluded diana who shared with me a secret about the untimely death of dio she cleared her throat year of rome employed by the great one to investigate murder of clodius on the appian way service satisfactory satisfactory is that all after what this family suffered to find the truth for pompey im sure pompey would say we were well rewarded diana cast a wistful glance toward the garden davus smiled back at her and waved and the less said about that the better as well i muttered are those all the entries theres one more dated last month december year of rome no known activity for either side in recent she frowned and showed me her text its a greek word i couldnt translate i squinted thats a nautical term it means maneuvering maneuvering in the sense of two ships getting into position so as to engage in battle oh well then no known activity for either side in recent maneuvering between pompey and caesar is that it my whole career reduced to a few arbitrary episodes i dont think i care for this business of being epitomized by some stranger there a bit more about the family lets hear it wife a former slave acquired in alexandria named bethesda of no political significance one natural offspring a daughter gordiana addressed as diana age about twenty married to a manumitted slave one davus formerly property of the great one that last part was underlined in the ciphered text i nodded that would make sense if this document is what it appears to be a confidential report intended for pompey davus constitutes my only fleshandblood tie to pompey its the sort of thing hed want to see highlighted go on two sons eco adopted as a street urchin age about forty married to a daughter of the menenius family no military career resides in old family house on esquiline hill sometimes assists his father political connections resemble his fathers wideranging but fluid and uncertain loyalty to the great one questionable she glanced up from her text the next part was also underlined of particular interest second son meto also adopted originally a slave owned by marcus crassus age about thirty military career from early age rumored to have fought for catilina at battle of pistoria briefly served under pompey in year of rome since with caesar numerous episodes of bravery in gaul worked his way up through ranks to join inner circle notable for literary skills handles correspondence helped to edit caesars account of gallic campaigns firmly in caesars camp some say in caesars her voice trailed off yes go on some say in caesars bed as well what thats what it says papa more or less the original was a bit more uncouth that part was in greek but i knew all the words outrageous is it meto loves caesar of course youd have to love a man to risk your life for him on any given day hero worship its a cult among military men ive never understood it myself but thats not the same as diana shrugged metos never said anything explicit to me about himself and caesar but even so just from the way he talks about their relationship ive always assumed there must be assumed what papa theres no need to raise your voice well it appears youre not the only one whos been making wild assumptions in a confidential report intended for pompeys eyes no less caesars enemies have been spreading this kind of tale about him for thirty years ever since he befriended king nicomedes you can still hear him called the queen of bithynia in the forum but how dare they draw meto into their rumormongering dont roll your eyes diana you seem to think im making something out of nothing i think theres no need to shout papa yes well she laid her hand on mine were all worried about meto papa about his being so close to caesar and whats going to happen next only the gods know how it will all turn out i nodded the room seemed suddenly very quiet the sunlight from the garden was already softening days are short in januarius my temples began to throb we had been working for hours the only break had been to stoke the fire in the brazier to ward off the growing chill the brazier had been burning since first light the room was smoky i glanced at dianas text and saw that she had more left to read go on i said quietly what else few slaves in the household among them two boys brothers acquired from the widow of clodius shortly after his death originally stableboys at his villa on the appian way mopsus older and androcles younger often act as messengers for gordianus little jugs have big handles diana frowned im sure thats what it says its a quotation from a play by ennius i said it means that little boys have big ears implying that mopsus and androcles might make useful informers go on theres a bit more about mopsus and androcles given gordianuss inclination to adopt orphans and slaves will he end up with two more sons she raised an eyebrow and waited for a comment go on i finally said what else a summary subject possesses no political power and little wealth yet is held in high regard by many who do once called by cicero the most honest man in rome but where does his reputation for integrity come from by never firmly taking sides in any dangerous controversy he manages to appear above the fray and so remains able to move freely back and forth between sides even when employed by one side he maintains an appearance of independence and neutrality committed to finding truth rather than achieving a partisan agenda he combines the skills of the investigator with those of the diplomat this could be his chief value in a crisis as a gobetween trusted by both sides on the other hand some see him as a wily pragmatist exploiting the trust of powerful men without giving them full allegiance what sort of man hires out his integrity case by case in the event of an unprecedented crisis where will his true allegiance lie he has a fine house on the palatine and has managed to stay out of debt another factor in his independence it is hard to see how revolution or civil war could be to his interest on the other hand his unconventional family of adoptees and manumitted slaves indicates a man with little concern for traditional roman values most troublesome is his connection to caesar through his son meto this more than anything else may act to pull him into caesars orbit conclusion gordianus may be of use to the great one but should be carefully watched diana looked up thats all of it i wrinkled my nose a wily pragmatist that stung as sharply as the gossip about meto actually i think its flattering on the whole said diana it makes you out to be a rather subtle fellow subtle fellows lose their heads in times like these then davus shall be safe at least she looked at me with a straight face then laughed i managed a smile she was only trying to cheer me up i knew but she really had no idea of the enormity of the danger that was looming i suddenly felt a great tenderness for her i touched her hair there was some sort of commotion from the front of the house davus left the garden a moment later he was back he strode into my study another visitor he said his face was pale this late in the afternoon yes fatherinlaw the great one himself iii pompey impossible even so fatherinlaw hes waiting in the foyer with armed bodyguards hes breaking the law then pompey has a standing army never mind that his legions are off in spain proconsuls in command of armies are not allowed to enter the city walls diana spoke up stop quoting laws to us we carry swords she quoted a phrase which pompey had made famous when he was in sicily and some locals objected that he was overstepping their treaties with rome i took a deep breath how many men are with him davus only two in the foyer the rest of the bodyguards are waiting in the street i looked at the pieces of parchment on the tripod table numerius where in hades did his shoes end up if pompey finds him barefoot calm yourself fatherinlaw his shoes are back on his feet what do you think ive been doing in the garden all afternoon i dressed numerius put the ring back on his finger and replaced his moneybag the bodys just as we found it what about his dagger i put the little key back inside and slipped the dagger back into his sheath and the garrote around his throat davus nodded grimly still there i lowered my gaze to the table everything in place then except these pieces of parchment i meant to put them back before anyone came for the body if pompey discovers theyre missing davus frowned perhaps if we can keep pompey from seeing numerius hide the body i dont think so davus pompey must know that numerius came here thats why hes here himself if we make some clumsy attempt to hide the body and pompey discovers it how would that look diana touched my arm if youre worried about pompey catching you with the documents papa we could burn them theres a fire in the brazier it would take only a moment i stared at the pieces of parchment we could burn them yes or stuff them back into numeriuss shoe if theres time either way well never know what else they contain perhaps theres more about your brothers or someone else we care about shall we hide them then so we can decipher them later and what if pompey decides to search the house and finds them gordianus the wily pragmatist of dubious allegiance caught in possession of secret documents with one of the great ones kinsmen lying dead in his garden diana crossed her arms pompey has no right to come barging in here he has no right to search a citizens house the fire in her eyes reminded me of her mother are you sure of that daughter ten days ago the senate passed the ultimate decree the last time that happened was when cicero was consul and accused catilina of plotting insurrection you were too young at the time to remember i know what the ultimate decree means papa i read the notices in the forum the consuls and proconsuls are empowered to use any means necessary to safeguard the state any means necessary and you think pompey would hesitate to ransack this house for all practical purposes rome is under martial law the very fact that pompey dares to come into the city with armed men means that ordinary laws no longer exist anything could happen anything dianas composure wavered she crossed her arms more tightly knowing all that papa what do you want to do about these documents i stared at them uncertainly paralyzed with indecision i had succeeded in frightening myself more than diana i heard voices from the front of the house and looked up to see pompey emerge through the doorway into the garden accompanied by two bodyguards all three wore expressions of grim determination i had waited too long the situation was out of my hands i watched through the window as they turned sharply right then left following the colonnaded walkway around the perimeter of the courtyard heading for my study pompey glanced to his left he halted so abruptly that one of his men bumped into him from the look on his face i knew what he had seen i followed his gaze but the statue of minerva blocked my view all i could see of the body of numerius was one of the feet wearing the shoe from which we had taken the documents i looked at pompey in the blink of an eye his face become contorted with anguish he gave a cry and ran to the body his two guards drew their swords in alarm without a word from me diana scooped the documents from the tripod together with the parchment with her decipherings walked to the brazier and added them to the flames the moment had passed when davus or i could have done so pompey or one of his guards might have seen us and remembered later but who would take any notice of the daughter of the house tending to the brazier i drew a deep breath so much for the documents whatever other secrets they might have contained were beyond deciphering now from beyond the statue of minerva i heard pompey let out another wail of anguish his guards quickly circled the garden poking their swords into the shrubbery and gazing up at the roof as davus had done one of then tried to draw pompey away from the body back toward the foyer pompey waved the man off a moment later more bodyguards flooded into the courtyard drawn by pompeys cry diana davus back against the wall i said davus take out your dagger and throw it on the ground quickly if they see you draw it out theyre liable to swarm all over you davuss dagger was on the floor and his hands were pressed flat to the wall even before i finished speaking in the next instant three of pompeys men were in the room eyes wide and swords drawn from the garden pompey bellowed my name gordianus i cleared my throat and straightened my shoulders i turned to the brazier and pretended to warm my hands while i gazed into the flames to make sure that only ashes remained then i turned back toward the door i looked the nearest guard in the eye he was outfitted in full battle gear including a helmet that hid most of his face let me by i said thats my name the great one is calling the man stared back at me for a long moment then grunted the three guards drew apart just enough to let me pass through the doorway one of them deliberately breathed in my face making sure i caught the stench of garlic on his breath gladiators and bodyguards eat whole heads of garlic raw claiming it gives them strength another made sure that my arm slid against the flat edge of his sword i knew by such behavior that they were pompeys private slaves not regular legionaries some slaves like to take liberties when circumstances put a citizen at a disadvantage i didnt like the idea of leaving diana and davus alone in the room with three such creatures i took a breath and walked to the center of the garden pompey heard the sound of gravel crunching under my feet and looked up his plump round face was made for laughter or casting sardonic glances expressing grief his features seemed all askew i would scarcely have recognized him he loosened his embrace of the body gazed at his kinsmans face for a moment then looked back at me what happened gordianus who did this i thought you might have an answer to that question great one dont answer me in riddles finder pompey released the body and got to his feet you can see for yourself great one he was strangled here in my garden you see the garrote still around his throat i was about to set out for your villa to bring you the news myself who did it no one in the household saw or heard anything i left numerius alone for a moment to go into my study and then pompey clutched a fistful of air and shook his head hes the first then the first to die how many more damn caesar he glared at me do you have no explanation for this finder no explanation at all how could it have happened here in the middle of your house without anyone knowing am i to believe caesar can send down harpies from the sky to kill his enemies i looked him straight in the eye i swallowed hard great one youve brought armed men into my house what great one i must ask you first of all to call off your bodyguards there are no assassins lurking in my house how can you assure me of that if you never saw the man who did this at least call your men out of my study they have no reason to stand watch over my daughter and soninlaw please great one a crime has occurred here yes but even so i ask you to respect the sanctity of a citizens house pompey gave me such a look that for a long dreadful moment i expected the worst there were at least ten bodyguards in the garden there might be more elsewhere in the house how long would it take them to ransack the place and kill everyone in it of course they wouldnt destroy everything or kill everyone only davus and me the things of value and the slaves would be confiscated as for bethesda and diana i couldnt bear to follow the thought to its conclusion i looked into pompeys eyes in his youth he had been extraordinarily handsome a second alexander people called him just as brilliant and just as beautiful a commander touched by the gods with age he had lost his beauty as his bland features receded amid the growing fleshiness of his face some said he had lost his brilliance as well his lack of foresight and unwillingness to compromise had allowed the current crisis with caesar defying the senate and marching on rome while pompey responded with indecision and uncertainty pompey was a man with his back against a wall and at that moment he was in my house furious with grief accompanied by a large bodyguard of trained killers i looked at him steadily i managed not to flinch at last the moment passed pompey took a breath so did i you have nerve finder i have rights great one im a citizen this is my home and this is my kinsman pompey lowered his gaze then stiffened his jaw and looked at the guard in the doorway to my study you there call your fellows out of there all of you back into the garden but great one theres a man in here with a dagger at his feet and a very pretty girl in his arms added a sniggering voice from inside you idiots numerius wasnt killed with a dagger that much is obvious come out of there and leave the finders family alone pompey let out a sigh and in that moment it seemed to me that the worst possible outcome had been averted thank you great one he made a face as if displeased at his own restraint you can show your gratitude by offering me a drink of course diana find mopsus have him bring wine she looked at davus then at me then went into the house you too davus i said into the house but fatherinlaw dont you want me to stay and explain no i said grinding my teeth i want you to go with diana look after bethesda and aulus if he knows something then he must stay snapped pompey he looked davus up and down you look familiar oh yes it comes back to me now youre the one i lent to gordianus a couple of years ago to guard his house while he was off down the appian way doing some work for me only you guarded his daughter a bit too well as i recall id have taken your hide off and then your head but gordianus wanted you and so i let him have you and here you are what do you know about this i watched the color drain from davuss face pompey spoke to him in a tone suitable for addressing a slave and davus responded subserviently out of ancient habit he lowered his eyes its as my fatherinlaw says great one there was no scream no cry no one heard footsteps or anything else the assassin came and went in silence the first i knew of it was when my fatherinlaw gave a yell and i came running pompey looked at me how did you come to find him as i said i left him alone here in the garden while i stepped into my study for a moment only a moment i shrugged and gazed down at the dead man what was he doing here why did he come to visit you asked pompey i raised an eyebrow i thought you might be able to answer that question great one did you not send him to me i sent him into the city to deliver some messages yes but not to you then why did you come here if not to find him pompey scowled where is that wine the slave boys appeared androcles bearing cups and mopsus a copper flask casting furtive wideeyed glances at the corpse they made a mess of pouring the wine i joined pompey in his first cup but he drained his second cup alone downing it without relish as if it were medicine he wiped his mouth handed his cup back to androcles and dismissed the boys with a curt wave of his hand they ran back into the house if you must know he said i came here straight from ciceros house up the road i sent numerius to cicero with a message earlier today according to cicero numeriuss next stop was your house i didnt expect to still find him here i only thought that you might know where hed gone next what business did he have with you finder i shook my head whatever it was hes silenced forever now and how in hades did anyone get in and out of this garden do you think a man could have come down from the roof and then retreated the same way i dont see how its possible the roof is above any mans reach and the columns are too recessed to be of any use for climbing onto the roof not even an african ape could have done it but two men might have noted davus one to boost the other and then to be hoisted up in turn davus is right i said or one man alone could have done it with a sufficient length of rope pompeys scowl intensified but who and how did they know to find him here im sure great one if you make inquiries ive no time for that im leaving rome tonight leaving im heading south before dawn so will anyone else with a shred of sense or an iota of loyalty to the senate is it possible that you havent heard the latest reports do you never come out of that study of yours as seldom as possible these days he flashed me an angry look that held a glimmer of envy you do know that six days ago caesar crossed the rubicon river into italy with his troops and occupied ariminum since then hes taken pisaurum and ancona and sent marc antony to take arretium he moves like a whirlwind now theres word that both antony and caesar are marching on rome closing on us like a vise the city is defenseless the closest loyal legion is down in capua if rumors are true caesar could be here in a matter of days perhaps even hours rumors you say perhaps theyre only that pompey looked at me suspiciously what do you know about it holed up here in your garden you have a son with caesar dont you that boy who used to be one of crassuss slaves and claims to have fought with catilina he sleeps in the same tent with caesar im told and helps him write those pompous selfserving memoirs what sort of contact does he keep with you gordianus my son meto is his own man great one hes caesars man and whose man are you finder it took many years and a great many romans to conquer gaul great one many a citizen has a relative whos served in caesars legions that hardly makes us all partisans of caesar look at cicero his brother quintus is one of caesars officers and his protege marcus caelius has run off to join caesar even so no one would ever call cicero a caesarian i refrained from pointing out that pompey himself had been married to caesars daughter and it was only after julias death that their differences became irreconcilable great one i served you loyally enough when you hired me to investigate the murder of clodius did i not because i paid you and because in that instance there was no choice to be made between caesar and me thats not loyalty loyalty comes from slaves and soldiers from beatings bloodshed and battle those are the only ties that truly bind men together the most honest man in rome cicero called you once no wonder no one trusts you pompey turned from me in disgust and knelt beside his kinsman he observed the body more closely than he had in his initial shock heres his moneybag with coins in it the killer was no thief and heres his dagger still in its sheath he didnt even have time to draw it it must be as you said the killer came silently and took him from behind he never saw the face of the man who murdered him in truth numerius had been without his dagger when he died davus had taken it from him and replaced it after we searched the body i could explain none of this to pompey he was right not to trust me pompey touched the dead mans face with his fingertips he gritted his teeth fighting back his grief someone must have followed him here when he left ciceros house perhaps they followed him from the moment he left my villa this morning waiting for the chance to strike but who someone from caesars camp or one of my own men if theres a traitor in my household he lifted his angry gaze to the statue of minerva looming over us the goddess of wisdom was portrayed in battle gear ready for war an upright spear in one hand and a shield in the other with a crested helmet on her head an owl perched on her shoulder a snake coiled at her feet she had been toppled and broken in two during the clodian riots i had spent a small fortune to have the bronze repaired and freshly painted the colors were so lifelike that the virgin goddess seemed almost to breathe she looked directly at us and yet her gaze remained aloof oblivious of the tragedy at her feet you pompey rose to his feet and shook his fist how could you allow such a thing to happen right before you caesar claims venus for an ancestor but you should be on my side there was a rustle among the bodyguards made uneasy by their masters impiety and you pompey turned to me i charge you with finding the man who did this bring me his name ill see to justice i shook my head averting my eyes from pompeys wild gaze no great one i cant what do you mean youve done such work before very little since i last worked for you great one i have no stomach for it anymore i made a promise to myself to retire from public life if i managed to reach sixty years that was a year ago you dont seem to understand finder im not asking you to find numeriuss killer im not hiring you im ordering you by what authority by the authority vested in me by the senates ultimate decree but the law dont quote the law to me finder the ultimate decree empowers me to do whatever is necessary to preserve the state the murder of my kinsman acting as my agent is a crime against the state discovering his killer is necessary to protect the state the ultimate decree empowers me to enlist your assistance even against your will great one i assure you if i had the strength and if my wits were as sharp as they once were if you need a helper to guide you about like blind tiresias call on your other son hes here in rome isnt he i cant draw eco into this i said he has his own family to look after as you wish work alone then but great one say no more finder he stared at me coldly then turned his gaze to davus you there you still look to be a healthy fellow never sick a day great one said davus warily and not a coward certainly not good because one of the powers granted to me by the ultimate decree is to muster fresh troops you davus shall be my first recruit get your things together youre leaving rome with me tonight davuss jaw dropped diana who had been watching from the doorway ran to his side this isnt right great one i said as calmly as i could davus is a citizen now you cant coerce him into a citizen yes but also a freedman and a freedman has obligations to his former master ive pledged to raise a certain number of troops from among my own dependents davus shall be among them but hes no longer of your household you gave him to me as payment for my services i manumitted him ah but he still has certain obligations to his original master not legal obligations yes legal obligations if you dont think so i suggest you examine the contract you signed when i handed him over to you notably the clause regarding previous servitude and contingent future obligations in case of martial emergency its a standard clause in every contract when i sell or release a slave otherwise i might see my former slaves being used to fight against me instead of for me this is a martial emergency and davus must submit to military service when and where and how i choose and you would presume to quote the law to me papa is he right diana clutched her husbands arm i looked at the circle of armed men around us whether pompey was right or not hardly seemed to matter great one the city may soon be in chaos i need my soninlaw to protect the household he seems to have done a poor enough job of that pompeys voice broke as he gazed down at numerius he swallowed hard but i wont deprive you of protection for your women and slaves while youre out finding the killer of my kinsman i shall leave you a bodyguard in davuss place you there he called to one of the guards who had barged into my study the one who had breathed garlic in my face he was even bigger than davus and would have been ugly even without his broken nose and the hideous scar across one cheek youre called cicatrix arent you yes great one you shall stay here and watch this house for me yes great one cicatrix gave me a surly look gnaeus pompey please no i whispered yes gordianus i insist i looked at the stunned faces of davus and diana i felt as if a great stone was on my chest great one your kinsman is dead that such a thing happened in my home fills me with shame but as you yourself said hes only the first thousands may die what does one murder mean when all the laws are suspended you ask questions finder i want answers discover who murdered numerius and then we shall see about returning your soninlaw to you as the last of the sunlight retreated from the garden so did pompeys men taking davus with them and carrying the body of numerius pompey left the device that had been used to strangle him with me thinking it might be of some use in finding his killer i could hardly stand to touch it diana wept bethesda emerged from the house and gave me an accusing look mopsus and androcles followed after her with my grandson between them all holding hands at the sight of the ugly giant pompey had left to take davuss place little aulus burst into tears pulled free and toddled frantically back into the house iv ciceros house was only a short distance from my own along the rim road of the palatine hill even on such a brief walk i would normally have taken davus with me for protection especially after dark on this night of all nights i sorely missed him all around me i felt the uneasiness of the city like a sleeper in the throes of a nightmare the rustling of many footsteps rose up from the forum in the valley below torches like tiny fireflies at such a distance darted to and fro across the open squares what were so many people doing out after dark they were lighting votives in the temples i thought praying for peace making preparations for hasty departures banging on their bankers locked doors buying up the last scraps of food and fuel in the market stalls i rounded a corner and the capitoline hill came into view at its summit great fires had been lit in the braziers before the temple of jupiter watchfires to alert the people that an invading army was on the march two guards were stationed outside ciceros door they appeared supremely unimpressed by the approach of a grayhaired visitor without even a bodyguard to accompany him my relations with cicero were strained at best i asked to see his private secretary with whom i had always been on closer terms the younger of the guards scratched his head tiro never heard of him no wait isnt that the one who died while the master was on his way home from cilicia the other guard a fellow with a bristling beard saw my alarm and laughed pay no attention to this young idiot hes been around only a few months never even met tiro who isnt dead just too sick to travel i dont understand is tiro here or isnt he he isnt where is he the older guard looked thoughtful now what is the name of that place in greece close to the water what town in greece isnt close to water i said this one starts with a p piraeus no patrae thats it i was with the master during his stint as governor of cilicia you see and so was tiro of course last summer we all started back to rome took a slow easy route along about november tiro fell sick and had to stay behind with one of the masters friends in patrae the master pushed on and we got back to rome this month just in time to celebrate his birthday ciceros birthday three days before the nones of januarius fiftyseven same age as pompey they say what about tiro he and the master write each other back and forth but its always the same never seems to get much worse but never gets much better either still not well enough to travel i see i had no idea this is bad news for tiro i dont know about that i figure hes in a good place about now lots of peace and quiet in patrae i should think nice place to convalesce wouldnt want to be in rome these days if i didnt have two strong legs and felt up to running i see your point was there somebody else in the household you wanted to see want to see no nonetheless tell your master that gordianus the finder requests a visit whatever recriminations had passed between us in former days seemed to have been forgotten by cicero i waited in the foyer for only a moment before he came to greet me i received his embrace stiffly startled by his warmth i wondered if he had been drinking but i smelled no wine on his breath when he drew back i took a hard look at him i had braced myself to encounter cicero in one of his less pleasant moods the selfrighteous selfmade man smug friend of the powerful peevish settler of old scores priggish arbiter of virtue i saw instead a man with jowls and receding hair and watery eyes who looked as if he had just received the worst news of his life he gestured for me to follow him the mood in his house matched the mood of the city a panic barely contained by purposeful activity as slaves hurried back and forth and spoke in hushed voices cicero led me first to his study but the room was like a beehive with slaves packing scrolls into boxes this wont do he said apologetically come theres a little room off the garden where we can talk quietly the little room was an exquisitely appointed chamber with a sumptuous greek rug underfoot a brazier on a tripod in the middle of the room illuminated walls painted with pastoral landscapes herdsmen dozed amid sheep and satyrs peeked from behind little roadside temples ive never seen this room before i said no it was one of the first rooms terentia decorated when we came back and rebuilt after clodius and his gang burned down the house and sent me into exile he smiled ruefully now clodius is dust but im still here and so are you gordianus but for what to see it all come to this cicero paced nervously in a circle around the brazier casting deep shadows across the walls abruptly he stopped his pacing and shot me a quizzical look can it really have been thirty years since we first met gordianus thirtyone actually the trial of sextus roscius he shook his head we were all so young then and brave the way young men are because they dont know any better i marcus tullius cicero took on the dictator sulla in the courts and bested him i think back now and wonder how i could ever have been so mad but it wasnt madness it was bravery i saw a terrible wrong and a way to redress it i knew the danger and went ahead anyway because i was young and thought i could change the world now now i wonder if i can be that brave again i fear im too old gordianus ive seen too much suffered too much in my own recollections ciceros motives had never been quite as pure as he was painting them colored as they were by shrewd ambition was he brave certainly he had taken risks and been rewarded with fame honor and wealth true fortune had not always smiled on him he had suffered defeats and humiliations especially in recent years but he had caused others to suffer much worse men had been put to death without trial when he was consul in the name of preserving the state could any man advance as far in politics as cicero had and keep his hands entirely clean perhaps not what rankled me was his insistence in presenting himself as the untarnished champion of virtue and reason it was not a pose it was the picture he had of himself his unflagging selfjustification had often exasperated even infuriated me but now in the darkness that had fallen on rome with the choice narrowed between one military leader and another cicero began to seem like not such a bad fellow after all he shook his head can you believe it that its happening again that we must go through the same madness all over again our lives began with civil war and now they shall end with it a generation passes and people forget but do they really not remember how it was in the war between sulla and his enemies rome itself besieged and taken and the horrors that followed when sulla set himself up as dictator you remember gordianus you were here you saw the gaping heads mounted on bloody pikes in the forum decent respectable men hunted down and murdered by bounty hunters their property seized and auctioned off to sullas favorites their families impoverished and disgraced sulla got rid of his enemies cleansing the state he called it made a few reforms then stepped down and put the senate back in charge from that day until this i have spent every hour of every day doing everything i could to fend off another such catastrophe and yet here we are the republic is about to come crashing down around us was this inevitable was there no way this could have been avoided my mouth was dry i wished that he would offer me some wine pompey and caesar may yet patch up their differences no he shook his head and gestured wildly caesar may send messages of peace and pretend that hes willing to parlay but thats just for show so that he can say later on i did my best to keep the peace the moment he crossed the rubicon any hopes for a peaceful settlement vanished on the far side of the river he was a legally commissioned promagistrate in command of roman legions once he crossed the bridge into italy with armed men he became an outlaw at the head of an invading army theres no way to answer him now except with another army some people i said speaking slowly and carefully would say that the hope for peace vanished a few days before caesar crossed the rubicon on the day the senate passed the ultimate decree and drove caesars friend marc antony out of the city that was as good as declaring caesar an enemy of the state you did the same to catilina when you were consul we know how catilina ended can you blame caesar for mustering his troops and making the first move cicero looked at me darkly the old antagonism between us began to stir spoken like a true caesarian gordianus is that the side youve chosen i walked to the brazier and warmed my hands it was time to speak of something else i was sorry to learn of tiros illness i understand hes still in greece have you heard from him lately is he better cicero seemed disconcerted by the change of subject tiro why but of course you and tiro have always remained friends even when you and i have not yes i think he may be somewhat better what is his malady recurring fever poor digestion weakness he cant leave his bed much less travel im sorry to hear it you must miss him terribly under these circumstances theres no man in the world i trust more than tiro a silence ensued finally broken by cicero is that why you came tonight gordianus to ask after tiro no why then surely it wasnt concern for your old friend and patron cicero that drew you out alone on such a night without even that hulking soninlaw of yours to look after you yes without even my soninlaw i said quietly seeing in my mind the look on dianas face and davus looking over his shoulder as pompeys men dragged him off i understand that pompey came to visit you earlier today and before that pompeys kinsman numerius cicero scowled those damned guards at the door their jaws are always flapping it wasnt the guards who told me it was pompey himself after he left you he came to my house so did numerius earlier in the day numerius came to see you and then to see me what of it numerius never left my house alive he was murdered in my garden cicero looked aghast his reaction seemed almost too extreme i reminded myself that he was an orator used to performing to the farthest person in a crowd and was prone to overact by force of habit but this is terrible murdered you say but how strangled by whom thats what pompey would like to know cicero tilted his head back and raised his eyebrows i see the old hound has been put to the scent again the first place the scent leads is back to this house if you think theres any connection between numeriuss visit here and what happened to him later thats preposterous still you were one of the last people he spoke to one of the last besides myself to see him alive did you know him well numerius well enough from the tone of your voice i take it you didnt care for him cicero shrugged once again the gesture seemed too broad what was cicero really thinking he was likable enough a charming young fellow most people would say the apple of pompeys eye why did he come to visit you this morning he brought news from pompey the great one is vacating rome heading south the great one says that any true friend of the republic will do the same at once that was his message for me it sounds almost like a threat i said an ultimatum cicero looked at me warily but said nothing and then numerius left not immediately we talked a bit about the state of the city and such pompey hasnt called on all his allies to leave immediately the consuls and some of the magistrates will stay on a sort of skeleton government enough to keep the city from falling entirely into chaos even so the treasury will be closed the bankers will flee everything will come to a standstill he shook his head we talked a bit and then numerius left was anyone with him he came alone and he left alone odd that he should go abroad in the city on pompeys business without even a bodyguard youve just done the same gordianus and after dark i suppose numerius wished to moved as quickly and freely as he could there must have been plenty of other senators he had to call on all over the city i nodded there were no harsh words between you then cicero glared at me i may have raised my voice those damned guards did they tell you they heard me shouting no did you shout at numerius that loudly what was the altercation about he swallowed hard the knob in his throat bobbed up and down how do you think i felt when numerius told me to leave the city by daybreak ive been away from rome for a year and a half governing a miserable province and now that im back i hardly catch a breath before im told to pack up and flee like a refugee if i raised my voice if i shouted a bit what of it youre raising your voice now cicero he pressed a hand against his chest and took several deep breaths i had never seen him so overwrought it unnerved me whatever their flaws pompey and cicero represented models of roman selfassurance and selfdiscipline the military giant and the political genius both had known setbacks but always triumphed in the long run now something was different and both seemed to sense it born the same year they were a few years younger than i yet i felt like the child who sees his parents in a panic if they have lost control then all must be chaos he went on at a lower pitch its a mistake for pompey to flee if caesar is allowed to enter the city without opposition hell break into the treasury and squander the wealth of our ancestors to bribe the street gangs hell call together whatevers left of the senate debtors discontents rabblerousers and claim its the legitimate government then it will be pompey and those who fled who are outlaws have you said as much to pompey yes do you know what he replied sulla could do it why not i it always comes back to sulla i dont understand sulla abandoned the city to his enemies and then retook it with pompey as one of his generals thirty years later pompey thinks he can do the same if the need arises can you imagine the city under siege disease hunger fires spreading out of control and then the horror of the conquest he stared into the flames of the brazier and again tried to calm himself for a long time now pompeys mind has been set on playing sulla once caesar is defeated pompey will do what sulla did hell make himself dictator and purge the senate hell draw up a list of enemies confiscations heads on stakes in the forum but surely not your head cicero i tried to make light of his fear but the look he shot back at me was ghastly why not if im still in rome tomorrow pompey will call me his enemy follow him then and make myself caesars enemy what if caesar wins i shall never be able to return i was exiled from rome once never again he circled the brazier until he stood opposite me his eyes flashed catching the light the flickering flames and shadows transformed his face into a grim mask we must all choose sides gordianus no more argument no more procrastination this side or that but toward what end no matter who wins we shall end up with a tyrant what a choice beheaded if i pick the wrong side a slave if i pick the right one i stared back at him across the flames you sound as if you have yet to make up your mind between caesar and pompey he lowered his eyes in the next hour i keep telling myself before another hour passes i shall cast the dice and let fortune choose for me he stared at the floor with his hands tightly clasped before him his brow rigid his mouth turned down he raised his eyes at a sound from the doorway a female slave stole into the room and whispered in his ear my wife calls me gordianus poor terentia shall i leave her here in charge of the household or take her with me and what of my daughter while i was off in cilicia behind my back tullia married that wastrel dolabella the young fool has both feet firmly in caesars camp hell do his best to drag her along with him and now shes expecting his baby what a world for my grandchild to be born into and my son marcus turns sixteen this year when the day comes for him to put on his toga of manhood will we be in rome for the ceremony by hercules will we even be in italy on that abrupt note cicero left the room and the slave hurried after him i was left alone i took a deep breath i warmed myself at the fire i studied the images on the walls the face of one shepherd in particular fascinated me he reminded me of my old bodyguard belbo i looked up at the ceiling where firelight and shadow flickered across the black spot made by the smoke i turned my eyes down and traced my toe over the geometric pattern of the carpet alone and forgotten in another mans house surrounded by silence i felt overcome by a curious paralysis unable to depart it was the only moment of peace i had experienced all day i was reluctant to give it up to be abandoned and forgotten by the world to be left alone truly alone without fears or obligations for a few brief moments in that quiet room i indulged in a fantasy of what that would be like and savored it sank into it like a man into dark deep soothing water i pondered ciceros dilemma pompey and caesar were not only tearing apart the state they were tearing apart families rome was not easily split into two factions rome was a hopelessly tangled skein of blood ties overlaid and interlinked with ties of politics marriage honor and debt how could such a complex web of mutual obligations be severed down the middle without being destroyed altogether how many households in rome that night mirrored ciceros house with the occupants rushing about in an agony of indecision without eyes to see the future how could any man be sure of his choice in the end it came down to this that a man might have a willful daughter who chose her own husband against her fathers better judgment and that fellow intruding from the outside might have a link dolabella to caesar davus to pompey that might in the end prove the whole households undoing ciceros tullia and my diana we created them and now they were out of our control showing what vanity it was that any man should think to plot his destiny at last i forced myself to leave the peaceful room i passed a few scurrying slaves as i made my way through the house but none took notice of me in the vestibule the slave on duty lifted the bar and opened the door for me there was more activity in the street than there had been when i arrived handcarts and litters messengers and torchbearers hurried back and forth the palatine hill was home to many of romes richest and most powerful men those who had the most to lose or gain in the event of civil war pompeys decision to abandon the city had stirred up the neighborhood like a stick poked into an anthill the same two guards were stationed in front of ciceros house they had moved to one side where the trunk of a great yew tree shielded them from the hubbub of the street i considered asking one of them to walk me home a common courtesy cicero would surely have approved but i decided against it however unwittingly i had got them into enough trouble already arousing their masters suspicion against them but if they were as loose with their tongues as cicero seemed to think it seemed foolish not to ask them a few questions a wild night i commented inside and out noted the older one inside in the house you mean its crazy in there has been all day glad im out here never mind the cold i understand there was shouting earlier well your master himself told me so this freed the mans tongue it was him who did most of the shouting this was when that fellow numerius was here pompeys kinsman yes did numerius come often to see your master the guard shrugged a few times since the master got back to rome so they had quite a shouting match did they for you to hear them all the way out here i mean he ducked his head a bit and lowered his voice funny thing how the sound from the courtyard in the middle of the house seems to carry over the roof and land right here in front of the door acoustics they call that this spot by the yew tree is like the last row of seats in pompeys theater you may be too far away to see the stage but you can hear every word every word well maybe not quite every other word words like the older guard frowned and drew back a bit realizing that i was fishing but the younger one now seemed eager to speak up words like traitor he said and secret and liar and the money you owe to caesar and what if i tell pompey was this cicero speaking or numerius hard to tell the way they were talking on top of each other though id say the masters voice carried better probably on account of his training poor cicero betrayed by his oratorical expertise but which of them said what who said the word traitor who owes a debt to the older guard stepped forward brusquely elbowing his companion aside thats enough questions i smiled but i was only curious to know if youve got more to ask you can ask the master do you want to be announced again ive already taken up enough of ciceros time well then he crossed his arms his bristling beard grazed my chin as he backed me into the street just one more question i said numerius came to this house alone and left alone so your master told me but did he come alone was there no one loitering in the street while he visited cicero and when he left did you notice anyone who joined up with him or who might have been following him the guard said nothing his companion now joined him in backing me farther into the street almost into the path of a careening handcart pushed by two reckless slaves the handcart swerved and almost struck a team of litterbearers the litter lurched and almost ejected its passenger a fat bald merchant who appeared to be wearing every jewel and bauble he possessed fleeing the city and loath to leave behind anything of value the string of near collisions momentarily distracted the guards they backed away then moved toward me again i stood my ground and looked from one to the other the situation suddenly seemed comic like a pantomime in the theater the menace the guards projected was all for show they were overgrown boys compared to the brute pompey had stationed in my house i took a deep breath and smiled which seemed to confound them as i turned to walk away i saw the older guard cuff the younger against the back of the neck loudmouth he muttered his companion cringed and accepted the rebuke in silence the rim road around the crest of the palatine hill is wider than most roads in rome two litters can pass one another and still leave room for a pedestrian to walk on either side without brushing against a sweaty litterbearer such congestion would be rare the rim road is less traveled than most in rome lined by large houses and situated high above the turbulence of the forum and the marketplaces but on that night the road was crowded with vehicles and people and lit up as bright as day with what seemed to be an army of torchbearers illuminated by those torches i saw a succession of unhappy faces dazed citizens fleeing the city weary slaves toting loads determined messengers shoving past the rest several times i imagined i was being followed whenever i turned around to look the confusion in the street made it impossible to tell my sight and my hearing were not what they once had been i told myself i was mad to be out without protection on such a night i arrived at the door of my house and took one last look behind me something caught my eye it was the mans carriage and his overall bearing that attracted my notice i felt that i recognized him at once in the way that one often knows a familiar person at a distance or from the corner of ones eye the man turned about before i could get a clear look at his face and headed back in the direction i had come from walking very fast he vanished into the crowd i could have sworn by minerva that the man i had just seen was ciceros secretary tiro who was supposed to be in greece too sick to leave his bed v i passed a cold fitful sleepless night it would have been warmer if bethesda had been beside me she slept in dianas room i suspected that her abandonment of our bed was as much to punish me as to comfort our daughter if diana had to sleep without her spouse then so should i i rose several times to pass water and pace the house from dianas room i heard the two of them talking in low voices sometimes weeping long into the night the next morning before i had dressed or eaten even before my first disparaging glance of the day from bethesda who remained shut away with diana a slave arrived at the front door with a message mopsus ran into my room without knocking and handed me a wax tablet i wiped the sleep from my eyes and read if you are still in rome and this message finds you i beg you to come to me at once my messenger will show you the way we do not know one another i am maecia the mother of numerius pompeius please come as soon as you can while the messenger waited in the street i withdrew to the garden still wearing my nightclothes i paced back and forth before the statue of minerva looking furtively up at her on some days her eyes gazed back but not that morning what could the virgin goddess know of a mothers grief my stomach was empty but i had no appetite i shivered in my woolen gown and hugged myself after a certain age a mans blood grows thinner year by year until it becomes like tepid water at last i returned to my bedchamber to show respect for the dead and for a dead mans mother i would put on my best toga wearing it would also serve to demonstrate to anyone who saw me that gordianus at least was going about his business as calmly as on any other day i opened the trunk and smelled the chips of cedar scattered inside to ward off moths nothing looks sadder than a motheaten toga the garment was just as it had come from its last washing at the fullers lambwhite neatly folded and loosely bound with twine i summoned mopsus and androcles to help me dress usually bethesda assisted me in donning my toga she had grown so skilled that the procedure was effortless mopsus and androcles had helped a few times before but still had only a vague idea of what to do following my instructions they laid the irregular oblong of wool over my shoulders wrapped it across my chest and attempted to arrange the folds there seemed to be four of us in the room myself two slave boys and a very unruly toga intent on thwarting the rest of us as soon as one fold was tucked another came untucked the boys became flustered and sniped at one another i rolled my eyes admonished myself to be patient and kept my voice low at last i was ready on my way out i encountered bethesda emerging from dianas room she coolly looked me up and down as if i had no right to wear such finery when my daughters life was ruined her unpinned hair hung in tangles and she could scarcely have had more sleep than i even so she looked remarkably beautiful to me at that moment time had never yet diminished the luster of her dark eyes perhaps she read my thoughts she paused to give me a fleeting kiss and whispered in my ear be careful husband in the foyer i encountered cicatrix the hulking monster was leaning with his back against the front door arms crossed idly scratching the ugly scar across his face he gave me an impertinent look then stepped away from the door to let me pass i cleared my throat let no one in while im gone i told him take orders from no one except my wife or my daughter do you understand he nodded slowly i understand that im to keep an eye on this house for my master the great one he gave me an unsettling smile as i stepped out the door to join the waiting messenger i whispered a prayer to minerva to watch over my household where are we going i asked the slave yonder the big fellow pointed beyond the forum toward the esquiline hill i suspected he was a bit simple the powerful often prefer to use illiterate slaves to carry messages and only a slave too simpleminded to learn to read can be trusted not to the rim road was as busy in the early morning as it had been the night before we crossed to the other side threading between litters and carts and onto the ramp which would take us down to the forum the pathway was so crowded that people were pressed shoulder to shoulder and no vehicles could possibly have passed the descent was slow and tedious we found ourselves pressed against the sheer rock face of the palatine the view of the forum to our right blocked by the crowd people jostled stepped on each others feet squealed in pain and spat insults at one point a fist fight broke out nearby as we descended farther any glimpse of the forum was blocked by the massive rear wall of the house of the vestals at last we reached the bottom of the incline packed as tightly as sheep in a run here the ramp narrowed even more as it made a sharp right turn into the gap between the house of the vestals and the temple of castor and pollux the crush became dangerous behind me i heard a woman scream panic spread through the crowd like a wave of prickling heat a stampede began i clutched the messengers arm he looked over his shoulder and gave me a simpleminded grin then gripped my arm and pulled me forward practically lifting me off my feet around me swirled a sea of faces some grimaced in pain some shouted some screamed some were wildeyed with fear while others stared blankly dumbfounded i was punched and prodded from all directions by elbows and flailing arms i felt as helpless as a pebble in an avalanche then all at once the narrow path emptied into the open space of the forum the messenger pulled me around a corner we staggered onto the steps of the temple of castor and pollux i sat down gasping for breath we could have been trampled to death said the big fellow his penchant for stating the obvious reminded me of davus as we watched people spilled out of the narrow passageway into the forum looking dazed and shaken many of them weeping at last the torrent thinned and the trickle of stragglers emerging from the ramp seemed utterly unaware of the panic that had preceded them as soon as i caught my breath we set out again the forum had an air of unreality a continuation of the nightmare that had begun on the ramp i felt as if we were walking through a succession of theatrical scenes staged by some maniacal director people ran in and out of temples waving votive tapers and shouting prayers to the gods huddled family members took leave of one another holding hands and weeping kneeling together to kiss the ground of the forum while street urchins perched on nearby walls threw pebbles at them and made rude remarks angry crowds outside the banks and exchanges threw stones against doors that were locked up tight despondent women wandered through empty market stalls picked clean by hoarders and profiteers the oddest thing was how little notice strangers seemed to take of one another everyone appeared to be boxed inside his own little tragedy to which the rushing panic of others was merely a backdrop not everyone was leaving rome hordes of people were coming into the city from the countryside to seek refuge caesar according to one rumor was on the outskirts of rome no more than an hour away leading an army of savage gauls to whom he had promised full citizenship one gaul to be enrolled for every roman killed until the entire male population of the city was replaced by barbarians loyal to caesar amid so much chaotic movement my gaze was suddenly arrested by the sight of a formal cordon of magistrates wearing their senatorial togas with purple stripes the only togas besides my own i had seen in the forum that day the entourage strode through the forum at an unusually quick pace preceded by twelve lictors in single file each bearing on his shoulder the ceremonial bundle of rods called the fasces a dozen lictors meant a consular procession and sure enough within the cordon of senators i recognized the two newly installed consuls lentulus and marcellus they looked grimjawed but rabbiteyed as if a sudden loud noise could send them scurrying for the nearest cubbyhole i wonder what thats about i said aloud theyre leaving the temple of the public lares said maecias messenger i saw them going in on my way to your house they were performing a special ceremony whats it called a rite of safekeeping asking the hearthgods to watch over the city while the two consuls are away only one consul at a time ever leaves rome i explained remembering he was simple one may go off to lead an army but the other stays to run the city maybe so but this time theyre both leaving town i took a last fleeting look at lentulus and marcellus and knew the fellow was right they had been consuls for less than a month but this might well be their last formal walk across the forum hence the grim jaws hence the rabbit eyes and the unseemly pace of the procession the consuls were abandoning rome the state was deserting the people in a matter of hours however long it took lentulus and marcellus to return to their homes and join in the mad rush to get out of rome there would be no government remaining in the city maecias house was in the carinae district on the lower slopes of the esquiline hill where a great deal of real estate had been in the hands of the pompeius family for generations pompeys private compound was not far away maecias house was not as grand as that it faced onto a quiet street and was freshly painted in bright shades of blue and yellow the black wreath on the yellow door struck a discordant note the slave knocked with his foot someone inside peered at us through a peephole then the door swung open as i stepped across the threshold i hardened myself for the sight that awaited me just beyond the foyer the body of numerius pompeius lay upon a bier in the atrium beneath the skylight his feet pointed toward the door the smell of the evergreen branches surrounding him mingled with the heady odor from a pan of incense set in a brazier nearby the overcast morning light surrounded his white toga and waxen flesh with a pale ivory nimbus i forced myself to step closer and look at his face someone had done a good job of removing the horrible grimace embalmers sometimes break a jaw or stuff the cheeks to achieve the proper effect numerius seemed almost to be smiling as if enjoying a pleasant dream his toga had been arranged to hide the ugly marks around his throat i saw him in memory nonetheless and clenched my jaw is it so hard to look at him i looked up to see a roman matron dressed in black her hair was undressed and her face without makeup but the ivory glow from the skylight was kind to her i thought for a moment that she might be numeriuss sister then looked again and decided she must be his mother i think he looks rather peaceful i said she nodded but the look on your face i think you must have been remembering how he looked when you found him i didnt see him until later of course and not not until pompey made sure he was presentable that was kind of pompey to think of a mothers feelings with so much else on his mind was numerius so terrible to look at when he found him i tried to think of an answer your son i shook my head the older i become the more of death i see yet the harder it is to look at she nodded and we shall be seeing so much more of it in days to come but you havent answered me i think you know what im asking did he look as if as if he suffered a great deal as if his final thoughts were of the horror of what was happening to him the skin prickled across the back of my neck how could i possibly answer such a question to avoid her gaze i looked down at numerius why could she not be content to remember him as he looked now with his eyes closed and a serene expression on his face ive seen the marks on his throat she said quietly and his hands they couldnt quite unclench them i imagine him with that thing around his neck reaching up to claw at it i imagine what he must have felt what thoughts went through his mind i try not to think of those things but i cant stop myself she looked at me steadily her eyes were red from weeping but there were no tears in them now her voice was calm she stood erect with her hands clasped before her you neednt worry that ill collapse to the floor sobbing she said i dont believe in hairtearing especially in front of an outsider i have no more tears none i intend for a stranger to see anyway she smiled bitterly the men of this house have all run off except for the slaves theyve left me to bury numerius by myself your husband he died two years ago the men of this house are numeriuss two younger brothers and his uncle maecius my brother moved in to head the household when i became a widow now theyve all run off with pompey and left me to handle this they know i can do it you see they saw how strong i was when my husband died how strong ive been every day since then i never flinch never shirk im famous for it im the model of a roman matron so you see when i ask you to tell me what it was like for my son at the end and i ask you because it happened in your house because you were there and who else could tell me you mustnt avoid answering out of fear that youll reduce me to tears and have a sobbing hysterical woman on your hands you must answer as if i were a man she had gradually moved closer to me so that now she stood very near her face turned up to mine her sons beauty came from her her undressed hair fell back from her face in dark shining tresses her black gown emphasized the creamy flesh of her throat and the gentle flush of her cheeks her green eyes gazed up at me with disconcerting intensity it was impossible to think of her as a man surely the great one told you all you need to know it would be his duty to you as the boys cousin and your kinsman pompey told me what he thought i needed to know that numerius was strangled that he must have been taken by surprise from behind off his guard with no chance to respond pompey said that meant it must have been quick quick and not so terribly painful not necessarily i thought did maecia really want me to confirm her worst fears to tell her that a man strangled by a garrote with no chance to escape might nonetheless struggle against the inevitable for quite some time an eternity for him no doubt before succumbing did she truly wish to dwell on what numerius might have thought and felt in those final panicstricken moments of life pompey told you the truth but not the exact details she said when i pressed him you must know how he is when the great one has no more to say no more will be said but you were there you found my son you saw i saw a young man lying in my garden before my statue of minerva and the instrument used to kill him i shook my head dont do this tell me please i sighed a garrote a simple device that serves no other purpose than to kill pompey says he left it with you because you might need it for your inquiries i cant even imagine what such a thing must look like a piece of wood as long as my forearm but not so thick with a hole bored near each end a slightly longer piece of stout rope pulled through the holes and tied into knots how does it work please tell me you slip the rope over a mans head then twist the piece of wood pompey said it was still around his throat there are ways to catch the rope over the wood so that it stays twisted tight and cant be removed by the victim she touched the creamy flesh of his throat i saw the marks now i understand her eyes glistened when you found him with that thing still around his neck what did his face look like i lowered my eyes just as he looks now yet you wont look at me as you say that can you look at him i tried to turn my gaze to numerius but couldnt he must have looked quite horrible to have such an effect on a man of your experience he was hard to look at yes she shut her eyes tears glistened in her lashes she blinked until they vanished thank you i had to know how he died now i can turn to asking why and by whose hand pompey says you make your livelihood following such inquiries i used to pompey says youll help us now he gave me no choice her eyebrows lifted she had demanded unflinching answers after all did the great one not explain that he coerced me into accepting this duty no i never ask after his methods but you will help i thought of davus and diana and cicatrix in my home ill do what i must to satisfy pompey maecia nodded theres something something i couldnt tell pompey a secret anything you tell me may end up in the great ones ear i cant promise you otherwise she shrugged uncertainly if theres anything to be found out numerius has already suffered the consequences im not even sure theres anything to it a mothers suspicions what do you mean between numerius and pompey everything may not have been as it seemed numerius was the great ones favorite wasnt he yes pompey doted on him and numerius had always been loyal to pompey but in recent months she had broached the subject herself but seemed reluctant to pursue it in recent months as the situation with caesar grew more tense and the debates in the senate became more acrimonious as it became evident that war might come and soon i began to think that numerius might not be quite so loyal to pompey as we all thought what made you doubt him he was mixed up in something something he kept secret there was money money and secrets are you saying he was a spy a spy or something worse now it was maecia who could neither look me in the eye nor stand to look at her son what do you mean i said quietly i discovered a box in his room it was full of gold coins so heavy with gold i couldnt lift the box were not a rich family and never have been in spite of our connections to pompey i couldnt imagine where numerius had come by so much money when was this about a month ago i remember it was the day one of the tribunes caesars attack dog marc antony made that horrible speech against pompey in the senate ridiculing his whole career demanding amnesty for all the political criminals expelled from the city by pompeys reforms every virtuous roman in exile must be returned and given back his property even if it takes a war to do it you see a woman can follow politics more closely than many men im sure but the gold that night i asked numerius where it had come from i caught him by surprise he was flustered he wouldnt tell me i pressed him he refused he spoke harshly to me that was when i knew something was very wrong numerius and i never argued we were always very close from the day he was born and after my husband died it was numerius who reminded me most of his father more than his younger brothers it upset me very much that he had kept something secret from me it worried me the city in such a state and numerius somehow piling up money and refusing to explain acting guilty when i questioned him guilty he said that i mustnt tell pompey about the money so you see the money couldnt have come from pompey from whom then and why must it be a secret from pompey i told him i didnt like it i said to him youre doing something dangerous arent you what did he say he told me not to worry he said he knew what he was doing blind certainty every man on his fathers side of the family is just the same ive yet to meet a pompeius who doesnt think hes indestructible did you have any idea of what he was up to nothing specific i knew pompey had made him a confidential courier pompey trusted him why not pompey was in and out of this house all the time while numerius was growing up pompey watched him grow from child to man numerius was always his favorite of the younger generation but these days everything is twisted and turned upside down the young have no sense of what it means to be a roman every man looks out for himself not even putting family first so much money pours in from the provinces corrupting everything young men become confused she took refuge in abstractions it was easier to talk about romes problems than about her own suspicions i nodded when you say that numerius was a confidential courier for pompey you mean that he carried secret information yes she bit her lip her eyes glistened secret information has value doesnt it men will pay gold to get it perhaps i said carefully you say you found a box full of gold did you find any other boxes with surprises inside what do you mean if numerius possessed valuable information documents he must have kept them somewhere she shook her head no only the box with the gold have you looked again i mean since i glanced at the body i stayed up all last night searching the house pretending to help my brother and sons pack if there were any more surprises to be found i wanted them to be found by me not by my brother or by pompey or by the assassin who killed my son i found nothing she exhaled wearily you take it for granted dont you that numerius was a spy it doesnt even shock you its as you say we live in a world turned upside down men become capable of anything even good men my son was a spy there ive said it for the first time aloud it wasnt as hard as i thought it would be but to say the rest to call him a a traitor perhaps he wasnt perhaps he spied for pompey not against him then why did he insist the gold be kept secret from pompey no he was doing something behind pompeys back im sure of it and you think this was the reason he was killed why else he had no personal enemies unless there were other secrets he kept from you she gave me such a fierce look that a shiver ran up my spine the atrium suddenly seemed very cold the light from the overcast sky grew even weaker dwindling to a soft uncertain radiance that cast no shadows numerius on his bier bloodless and dressed in white glowed like a statue carved from solid ivory vi as i made my way homeward from maecias house the scene in the forum was even more hectic than before the people more frantic the rumors wilder before the temple of vesta an old man gripped my arm have you heard caesar is at the colline gate odd i said just moments ago a fishmonger told me caesar was on the opposite side of town coming in the capena gate at the head of an army of gauls carrying pompeys head on a stake the old man reeled back in horror he and his barbarians have surrounded us then jupiter help us he ran off before i could say a word i had thought to comfort the poor man by mocking his rumor with another that contradicted it instead he believed both rumors and now was off to tell people the city was doomed i continued to make my way across the forum alone maecia had offered to send her messenger back with me for protection i had declined it was one thing to have him lead me to her house another to take advantage of her generosity she was without her brother or sons and had only her male slaves to protect her who knew how lawless the city might become in the next few hours especially if rumors of caesars approach were true from the temple of vesta i could see that the ramp was crowded but not jammed foot traffic was passing in both directions still my heart beat faster as i entered the confined passage between the house of the vestals and the temple of castor and pollux i saw no sign of that mornings panicked stampede until i took the sharp leftward turn onto the ramp i sucked in a breath when i saw blood on the flagstones smeared by the passage of hundreds of feet i remembered the screaming woman someone had been trampled by the crowd after all i quickened my pace and began the ascent parts of the ramp are like a tunnel densely shaded by overhanging yew trees it was in one of these patches looking up ahead that for the second time in two days i thought i saw tiro i couldnt see the mans face only the back of his head the climb had apparently warmed him for he was in the process never breaking his stride of pulling a dark cloak from his shoulders revealing a green tunic beneath it was something about the way he moved that seemed to stir my memory keying that unsettling powerful yet fleeting sensation that one sometimes has of reliving a moment already experienced had i once walked up the ramp behind tiro perhaps thirty years ago and seen him shrug off a cloak in that exact same way or was my mind playing tricks youre an old man i told myself slightly out of breath with spots before your eyes looking at the back of someone under the shade of a dense tree on an overcast day the idea that i was seeing an old friend who was supposed to be hundreds of miles away across the sea was hardly worth a second thought still if only i could see the mans face i could at least be satisfied of my mistake i quickened my stride the path grew steeper and my breath shorter more spots danced before my eyes other pedestrians blocked my view i lost sight of the man ahead of me until i thought i had lost him entirely then i caught a glimpse of the green tunic farther ahead of me than before tiro i called out did the man pause for a moment cock his head then hurry on or did i imagine it tiro i shouted gasping for breath this time the man in the green tunic didnt pause if anything he walked faster he reached the top of the ramp well ahead of me before he vanished it seemed to me that he turned to the right in the direction of ciceros house i reached the top of the ramp and sat heavily on a yew stump the stately tree had stood in that spot for years since long before i came to live on the palatine i had been able to see the top of it from my garden courtyard early that winter a particularly violent storm had blown the tree over the limbs had been cut up for firewood but the stump had been left as a convenient spot to sit and rest after the climb from the forum poor old yew i thought not good for much but still good for something i would have laughed had i breath to spare pompey expected me to track down a killer for him i couldnt even follow a man up the ramp begrudgingly a glowering cicatrix admitted me to my own house youve got a visitor he said in a surly voice breathing garlic at me in the garden i found bethesda diana and little aulus waiting for me they had been joined by eco papa he gave me a forlorn look and a bruising hug ive heard the news about davus damn pompey to hades not so loud pompeys man is only a few steps away yes i saw him on the way in mother and diana explained about that too pompey is such a bully lower your voice instead eco spoke louder as if intentionally pitching his voice for cicatrix to hear absurd that a citizen in his own home should have to whisper every time he makes reference to the socalled great one i couldnt remember the last time i had seen my eventempered son in such a belligerent mood the crisis was provoking reactions in all of us did you bring menenia and the twins with you i asked through that mob in the forum no theyre safe at home how are they taking things titus and titania are old enough to know that somethings very wrong you cant hide much from two elevenyearolds but they dont really understand whats happening or likely to happen im not sure anyone does not even caesar or pompey and their mother serene as the face of lake alba even though the menenii are as divided as any family in rome some for pompey some for caesar the rest trying to find a hole to hide in till its all over but dont worry about us papa after the clodian riots i put a lot of effort and expense into making the old family house secure its practically a fortress now there are so many bars on the doors and spikes around the roof it sounds as if you could have used something to keep climbers off the roof here he turned his eyes up to the roof surrounding the courtyard too bad about pompeys unfortunate kinsman and the outrage of it that pompey should use such a tragedy to force you into his service and practically kidnap davus whats done is done i said he nodded just another problem to be solved eh you always told me there was no such thing as a big problem just lots of smaller problems intertwined like knots in a rope start at one end and work your way to the other a good attitude to have when the whole world is falling apart where shall we start you should start by going home to menenia and the twins we may be in for a dangerous night but what about our problem with satisfying pompey and getting davus back is not our problem eco its my problem im responsible for what happened ill find a way out of it diana spoke up papa dont be silly youll need eco to no i wont have him involved in this so far neither pompey nor caesar has any particular claim on eco lets keep it that way eco shook his head and started to speak but i raised my hand no eco you have your own family your own problems who knows what may happen in the coming days and months its best that you remain as independent as you can for as long as you can in the long run that may help to save us all i could see they were not satisfied but even in a family as unconventional as mine as unmindful of traditional roman values as the report in numeriuss shoe had put it there is a point beyond which the will of the paterfamilias cannot be disputed i had a hard time seeing myself as a stern roman father in the mold of the elder cato but if pressed i can perform a convincing enough imitation eco and diana fell silent two others in the garden were unawed however little aulus paying no attention to me at all tripped over one of his feet and burst into screams bethesda crossed her arms and peered at me what about tonight she said if the city is as dangerous as you say what shall we do without davus theres not a bodyguard in the house unless you count that monster pompey left at the front door i doubt if anyone is likely to slip by cicatrix wife unless they come over the roof husband she said wryly i suppose mopsus and androcles could at least keep watch i said dubiously i can spare a man to come over and help protect the house offered eco you could post him here in the courtyard or up on the roof for that id be grateful i said laying aside my mantle as paterfamilias with the relief one feels at taking off an uncomfortable pair of shoes and if things grow even worse asked bethesda perhaps well all take refuge in ecos house on the esquiline since its more defensible but it may not come to that these rumors about caesar may be only rumors he may have withdrawn beyond the rubicon for all we know but with so many abandoned houses isnt there likely to be looting observed diana between making faces at aulus to distract him perhaps not the rich have left factotums and gladiators to guard their property a few wouldbe looters hung in the streets may be enough to keep things quiet bethesda looked down her nose rome is as bad now as alexandria was when i was a girl worse riots and assassinations and insurrections one after another and no end in sight i suppose it will end only when either pompey or caesar is dead said eco he lowered his voice without being asked im afraid that might be only the beginning i said if cicero is right its inevitable that one or the other will make himself dictator and not for a year or two as sulla did but for life romans may have forgotten how to run a republic but they certainly cant remember how to live under a king the end of this crisis may mark the start of another far worse what a time for aulus to grow up in said diana cicero had expressed the same anxiety for his expected grandchild she turned her face away hiding sudden tears from aulus but the boy was not to be fooled confusion crossed his face then he opened his mouth to join her quiet weeping with a pitiful wail of his own bethesda hurried over and spread her arms to embrace them both shooting a sharp glance at me over her shoulder eco and i with androcles and mopsus surreptitiously peering from the doorway looked on helplessly what good was the much vaunted power of the paterfamilias if it could not stop a woman from weeping vii as it turned out caesar did not lay siege to rome that day nor the next nor the day after the remaining days of januarius slipped past every dawn spawned new rumors and fresh panic every sunset faded without the arrival of caesar before the gates from south of the city came news that pompey had joined the loyalist legions in capua had appointed cicero to organize resistance along the campanian seacoast and was daily consulting the consuls and the coterie of senators who had fled with him the talk of rome for several days had to do with the famous training school for gladiators in capua owned by caesar and notorious for the ferocity of its pupils first i heard that five thousand gladiators promised freedom by their master had broken out massacred pompeys troops and were marching on rome to rendezvous with caesar then word spread that pompey had anticipated caesars gambit freed the gladiators himself and enlisted them in his army over the furious objections of his advisors who argued that wholesale manumission of slaves in a time of crisis set a dangerous precedent the last rumor to trickle in least spectacular and most likely claimed that the school had been shut down and the gladiators dispersed to various new masters throughout the region purely as a precautionary measure daily bethesda asked what progress i had made in getting davus back from pompey i explained to her that staging a serious inquiry into the death of numerius was virtually impossible both caesars and pompeys partisans had left rome to join their respective leaders anyone with reason enough to kill numerius or to know who did was probably in one camp or the other and miles from rome bethesda was not impressed pompey wont give back davus until you find his kinsmans killer if you lack the energy husband why dont you ask eco to do it it occurs to me wife that your job is to see that this household is kept warm and fed which so far you have done brilliantly in spite of the shortages and outrageous prices at the markets are those duties not enough to keep you busy and out of my affairs a chill settled between us in those first days of februarius making the house as cold inside as out around us the crisis wore on despite my protests to bethesda i was not entirely idle if rome was a foundering ship from which captains crew and paying passengers had fled the rats remained aboard and rats have keen eyes and ears i called upon old contacts and put out feelers among the lower orders of the city petty thieves poisondealers pimps and tavernkeepers seeking knowledge of numeriuss shady dealings the few scraps of information i was able to find or more precisely purchase at prices as outrageously inflated as everything else for sale in the city were piecemeal and secondhand largely unreliable and mostly useless repeatedly i was told what i already knew that numerius had spent most of his time running errands for pompey which meant that he had frequently been seen all over the forum and on the doorsteps of senators and wealthy merchants his contacts among the powerful ranged far and wide but at least occasionally the great ones favorite cousin had patronized far more humble surroundings more than one of my contacts claimed to have seen numerius entering or leaving a particularly notorious establishment in the seedy warehouse district between the forum and the river i knew the place from previous investigations the salacious tavern i had not been to the tavern for a long time it had been over two years since i last spent an afternoon there with tiro of all people drowning our sorrows after the trial of milo on the chilly afternoon i decided to pay a visit i almost got lost in the maze of narrow streets surrounding it once i found the right alley it was impossible to miss the familiar sign an upright post surmounted by an erect marble phallus a phallusshaped lamp hung over the door sputtering fitfully beneath the overcast sky i knocked a peephole slid open then shut the door swung open to reveal a fleshy eunuch in a capacious white tunic ostentatiously bedecked with glass jewelry rings glittered like little rainbows across his fingers baubles of faux topaz amethyst and emerald were strung around his neck and dangled from his elongated earlobes the long dimly lit room behind him exhaled the warm smell of moldering wood oily smoke and sour wine to my eyes unadapted to the dark the place looked as black as a cave citizen the eunuch smiled do i know you i think not i dont know you i take it the tavern is under new management yes did you know it before i came here once or twice then youll find it much improved come in he shut the door behind us funny it smells the same i wrinkled my nose same rancid lamp oil smoking up the place same foul wine stinking up the floors the eunuchs smile wavered my eyes adjusted a bit to the dimness leaning against a wall a few feet behind the eunuch i made out a boredlooking redhead she too was familiar ipsithilla was already a fixture in the tavern the first time i stepped foot in the place six years before with the drunken poet catullus by the orange glow of a nearby lamp she still looked relatively young and fresh testament to just how dim the lighting was even the girls are the same i said the eunuch shrugged there are only so many pleasures to be had in this world citizen but youll find them all here i promise for a price what i really crave is a bit of information might i find that here for a price the eunuch raised an eyebrow i left the salacious tavern that day without having indulged a single vice but with a few intriguing bits of information numerius pompeius had indeed been a frequent patron the eunuch knew him by sight and had heard the news of his death numerius the eunuch told me always arrived at the tavern alone and left alone he always sat in the same corner sometimes he met with others but what they discussed and who those others were the eunuch couldnt say it was his practice never to eavesdrop and the men numerius met with were strangers to the salacious tavern who never came again except for one ah yes the eunuch told me i remember one day numerius shared his corner bench with that fellow soscarides soscarides odd name isnt it greek i suppose from alexandria swarthy little fellow with a beard been coming in for a couple of months now a philosopher rather famous to hear him tell it perhaps you know him citizen im sure i dont well numerius pompeius did they sat in the corner for a long time that day he and soscarides talking and drinking drinking and talking talking about what alas citizen i never eavesdrop and neither do my girls a mans secrets are safe in the salacious tavern even from the gods when was this oh let me think why just before pompey fled the city so i suppose it must have been only a day or two before numerius was murdered i nodded and mouthed the name soscarides i was sure i had never heard of him a philosopher a dark swarthy little fellow with a beard the eunuch fingering his alreadyswollen coin purse was eager to be helpful as i said soscarides comes in here every so often when i see him next shall i tell him youre looking for him citizen i shook my head i was never here i gave him another coin to be sure he understood several days of stormy weather followed my visit to the salacious tavern the weather was so foul that no one went abroad in the city even the forum was deserted i spent those days holed up in my study reading philosophy in rare moments when the rain broke i paced in the garden gazing up to contemplate minvervas inscrutable features she was the only witness to everything that happened the day numerius pompeius died she had heard his final words had seen the face of his killer what shall i do next i asked her she gave no indication of hearing the storm passed two days after the ides of februarius i made my way down to the forum to catch the latest flock of rumors at bethesdas insistence i took mopsus and androcles along with me to give the boys a chance to use up some of their pentup energy from being housebound by the storm going down the ramp they ran ahead of me and then back up to me over and over making a game of it just watching them exhausted me the daily panic over an immediate occupation by caesar receded reliable reports now placed him to the northeast along the adriatic coast all of picenum had surrendered to him it was said that the people of the towns he passed through had welcomed him jubilantly offering prayers as if he were a god he had garrisoned strategic cities with troops and now was heading south where pompey and the loyalist forces had occupied the region of apulia but were split in two lucius domitius ahenobarbus who by the senates decree was supposed to have replaced caesar as governor of gaul at the first of the year had occupied the central city of corfinium only seventyfive miles east of rome with thirty cohorts eighteen thousand men pompey in the meantime had moved farther south there seemed to be a tug of war between the two loyalist generals domitius wanting pompey to reinforce him in corfinium pompey demanding that domitius abandon the city and join him if domitius had his way would the deciding battle take place at corfinium with caesars legions confronting the combined loyalist forces or would corfinium be abandoned in a loyalist retreat if that happened it was easy looking at a map to imagine caesars troops forcing pompey relentlessly southward into the heel of the italian boot toward the seaport of brundisium some rumors claimed that pompey was already assembling a navy at brundisium and had all along intended to flee across the adriatic sea to dyrrhachium rather than engage caesar hearing such tactical questions discussed by citizens standing in line for pots of rancid olives and loaves of stale bread was a strange experience it was common enough to hear men in the forum speculate about battles and troop movements in faraway provinces but never on italian soil and with the fate of rome in the balance the sky began to drizzle i had had enough of the forum i made my way back to the ramp with mopsus and androcles running circles around me halfway up beneath the branches of a towering yew that blocked the drizzle i happened to look ahead my heart skipped a beat had i lost my sense or was the same uncanny experience happening again up ahead i thought i saw a familiar figure except that this time the man in the green tunic was pulling on his cloak not shrugging it off boys i said calling them in from their orbit do you see that fellow up ahead walking alone mopsus and androcles nodded in unison i want you to follow him not too close i dont want him to know do you think you can do that i can master said mopsus hooking his thumb to his chest and so can i insisted androcles good when he arrives at his destination one of you find a hiding place to keep watch while the other runs back to tell me now go off they went when they drew close to the man in the dark cloak one broke to the left the other to the right like jackals hunting in tandem one by one all three reached the upper end of the ramp and disappeared i resisted the urge to quicken my stride i whistled a comic egyptian tune one that bethesda used to sing to herself back in the days when she was my slave instead of my wife and had no slaves of her own to do the household chores happy days i thought those were the days when i first met tiro i came to the top of the ramp the stump of the fallen yew was out of the drizzle so i sat there to wait if i was correct the man in the dark cloak would not be going far and it would not be long before one of the boys came running back with news i waited and waited some more at last i began to wonder if i had been wrong after all and had sent the boys on a fools errand the drizzle stopped i got up from the stump and walked in the direction of ciceros house it occurred to me that if the man was not who i thought he was i might have put the boys in danger the crisis had frayed everyones nerves even a respectable citizen might react unpredictably if he discovered he was being followed by two unknown slave boys i followed the rim road to ciceros house and stopped in the deserted street there was no one to be seen i had been wrong after all i thought and then heard a hissing from the opposite side of the street where the cedars and cypress trees had been thinned to allow a view of the capitoline hill master over here i peered into the underbrush of shaggy bushes dotted with tiny red berries i cant see you of course not you said to hide it was mopsus he said for me to hide that was androcles no i was to hide and you were to run back and tell him no you were to run back while i stayed to watch boys i interrupted you can both come out now one head emerged then another both had bits of twigs and red berries stuck in their unruly hair isnt that right master said mopsus i was to stay and watch and androcles was to run back and tell you i sighed meto says that one mark of a great general is that he never gives an unambiguous order clearly im no caesar and you two are as bad as domitius ahenobarbus and pompey magnus squabbling like that instead of doing what needs doing did you hear that said mopsus to androcles emerging into the street and swaggering a bit he compared you to redbeard and me to the great one he did not im pompey and youre domitius boys enough tell me where the fellow went and what you saw we followed him here to ciceros house said androcles eager to deliver the news ahead of his older brother and he went in the door not exactly they let down a ladder from the roof he climbed up then they drew back the ladder explained mopsus i nodded thank you boys you both did a good job better than pompey and domitius seem to be doing anyway now you can both run along home and leave you alone master said mopsus alarmed but isnt the fellow terribly dangerous a thief or a murderer i dont think so i smiled at the thought of mild bookish tiro as an assassin once the boys were off i banged on the door there was no answer i stepped back and surveyed the roof but saw no signs of life i banged on the door again at last the peephole opened and a brown eye peered out no ones home said a gruff male voice you are i said i dont count the masters gone the house is closed even so i have business with someone inside the eye disappeared then reappeared some moments later who my name is gordianus cicero knows me i saw him the night before he left rome we know who you are who is it you want to see the man who arrived ahead of me the one you let up by ladder no such person he wasnt a phantom maybe he was no more games tell tiro i need to see him tiro the masters secretary is away in greece too sick to travel nonsense i know hes here tell him that gordianus needs to see him the eye disappeared and was gone for a long time i stood on tiptoes and tried to peer inside through the peephole but could see only shadows something moved among the shadows i drew back the eye reappeared no theres no tiro here no one by that name i banged on the door the brown eye gave a startled blink and drew back tiro i shouted let me see you or shall i stand here in the street shouting your name until every wretched soul left in rome knows that youre back tiro tiro a hissing issued from the peephole all right all right stop shouting very well then open the door cant what tiro shhhh cant open the door why not its barricaded shut barricaded boards nailed across the door and sandbags piled behind the boards i have to crawl through a tunnel just to get to this peephole step back into the street i backed up to the middle of the street and looked up a few moments later two men appeared on the roof i recognized them as the two guards who had been posted at ciceros door the night i last saw him together they lowered a long wooden ladder to the street dont tell me ciceros wife and his pregnant daughter go up and down this thing every time they leave the house i eyed the spindly steps and felt the brittleness in my bones of course not said the older one it was he who had been addressing me from behind the door the mistress and tullia left days ago stayed with ciceros friend atticus here in the city for a while then went to join the master down at the villa in formiae on the coast theres nobody at all in the house now except some of us slaves left behind to guard the valuables nobody else i said nobody except me the speaker stepped into view between the two men on the roof put his hands on his hips and looked down at me he wore a green tunic and a dark cloak i suddenly realized that i must have been mistaken all along or else they were playing another game with me the man was tiros height and bore a rough resemblance to him but had to be younger his skin was as dark as an egyptians his hair had a reddish tinge without a hint of gray he was slender as a youth and he wore a neat little beard of the sort that tiro had despised ever since catilina made it popular im not sure what youre playing at i said but i mean to find out i stepped onto the ladder no dont come up said the stranger ill come down i backed away as he descended his movements on the spindly steps gave him away he wasnt nearly as young as he looked at a distance by the time he reached the bottom rung and turned to face me the stranger had been transformed back into tiro tiro with skin stained and hair dyed with henna with a thinner face and sporting a very unlikely beard but tiro nonetheless you seem to have made a miraculous recovery i said how did you get here from greece so swiftly riding pegasus he silenced me with a finger to his lips behind us the ladder withdrew the two guards vanished we cant talk here he said but i know of a quiet place where the host never eavesdrops viii directly across the road from ciceros house amid the shrubbery where mopsus and androcles had hidden themselves tiro pulled back a branch covered with little red berries and appeared to step into empty space mind that the branch doesnt fly back and hit you he cautioned and watch your step on the trail its steeper than it looks that hardly seemed possible the trail was hardly a trail at all just a descending series of little cleared spots large enough for a man to place his foot amid the gnarled trees and thorny bushes sprouting out of the western face of the palatine hill directly below us was the congested warehouse district tiro where are you taking me if were heading down why not take the ramp too much risk of being recognized but you dont avoid the ramp ive seen you on it twice myself oh im not worried about being recognized but you would be and then someone would start to wonder who was that swarthy bearded fellow i saw with gordianus the finder today then why not talk privately inside ciceros house the guards for one thing they tend to hear things they shouldnt then they talk that was true enough and also tiro hesitated deliberating where next to put his foot to be candid cicero doesnt want people coming and going in the house while hes not there you think i might snoop i didnt say that gordianus but its ciceros house while hes away ill obey his wishes a loose stone slipped from under my foot and skittered down the hillside i gripped the branch of a cypress tree for balance caught my breath and cautiously sought the next foothold at last we reached the lower slopes of the palatine where the path gradually flattened and meandered amid trash heaps piled behind the warehouses tiro led me this way and that undaunted by the maze of narrow alleys stinking of urine at length we turned a corner and i saw ahead of us a familiar sign an upright post surmounted by an erect marble phallus not the salacious tavern we ran into each other here after milos trial said tiro remember that was the last time i saw you over two years ago i remember the hangover i said but i was thinking of my last visit to the tavern and the hosts account of a swarthy bearded foreigner tiro laughed you were getting over a hangover the very first time we met do you remember that a brighteyed young slave came to my house on the esquiline hill and asked if id help his ambitious young master defend an accused parricide yes but before i could speak you demonstrated a cure for your hangover did i what was it concentrated thought so as to flush the brain with fresh blood it was quite remarkable you were hardly more than a boy tiro you were easily impressed but it was amazing you deduced whod sent me and why without my saying a word did i a pity i can no longer concentrate my mind so keenly i cant begin to imagine for instance why ciceros righthand freedman is wandering about rome incognito tiro looked at me shrewdly you havent grown less keen gordianus just craftier you could work it out if you cared to but youd rather draw it out of me over the door of the tavern the hanging phallusshaped lamp cast a faint glow to brighten the chilly overcast afternoon a waste of oil i remarked to tiro considering the shortages in the city words like shortage have no meaning at the salacious tavern said tiro knocking on the door have you been here in the last year or so i shrugged once i think the place is under new management he went on but nothings changed same girls same smells same foul wine but the taste improves after the second cup the peephole opened then the door soscarides the eunuch practically shrieked gripping tiros hands he failed as yet to notice me my favorite customer who also happens to be my favorite philosopher youve never read a word ive written you dog you told me so the first day i came here two months ago said tiro but i keep meaning to insisted the eunuch i placed an order with a book dealer down in the forum really i did or i tried to the fellow claimed hed never heard of soscarides the alexandrian practically laughed at me the idiot now all the book dealers have closed their shops and left town i shall have to remain ignorant of your wisdom sometimes ignorance is the truest wisdom quipped tiro oh is that one of your famous sayings soscarides i like having philosophers in the tavern cleaner than poets quieter than politicians is your friend a famous philosopher too the eunuch finally looked at me his face fell as much a philosopher as i am said tiro and even more famous thats why were here to seek some peace and quiet the eunuch was nonplused for a moment then recovered he acted as if he had never seen me before will a corner in the public room do the private rooms upstairs are all taken by gambling parties well take that corner bench over there said tiro indicating a region so dark i could only conjecture the existence of a corner let alone a bench and two cups of wine your best tiro set out for the corner i followed close behind him i didnt realize there was more than one quality of wine offered in this establishment i said of course there is for the best you pay a bit more and what do you get the same wine but poured through a strainer no nasty surprises floating in the cup i grunted as i bumped into something that grunted back i apologized to a murky growling shape and moved on glad when we at last reached the far side of the room the corner bench was built into the wall i leaned back and waited for my eyes to adjust to the dimness our wine arrived it was as foul as i remembered the salacious tavern seemed unusually crowded considering that the sun was still up with all normal activities in the city at a standstill what better way to pass the time on a cloudy afternoon than to indulge in a bit of vice amid the murmur i heard laughter and cursing and the rattle of dice the die is cast shouted one of the players a round of drunken laughter followed it took me a moment to catch the joke caesar had uttered the same words to his men when he crossed the rubicon theyve immortalized him with a throw as well remarked tiro a throw of the dice the venus throw is the highest combination and beats all else the gamblers are all calling it the caesar throw nowadays and shouting gaius julius when they cast the dice i dont think it means theyve taken caesars side necessarily theyre just superstitious caesar claims to be partly divine descended from venus so the venus throw becomes the caesar throw which beats all else is there such a thing as the pompey throw tiro snorted i think that must be when the dice skip off the table is pompeys position as bad as that do you know what cicero says when he was in the wrong pompey always got his way now that hes in the right he fails completely caesar took them all by surprise not even his supporters believed that hed dare to cross into italy with his troops you saw the panic that resulted pompey led the stampede ever since hes been struggling to get a grip on the situation day by day in the morning hes elated and full of bluster come afternoon he falls into a funk and orders his troops to retreat farther south i looked at him wryly you seem to be awfully well informed for a man whos been lying in a sickbed in greece since november he smiled tiro is still in that sickbed and will be for some time yet im soscarides an alexandrian philosopher thrown out of work and cast adrift by the crisis whats the point of this elaborate deception cicero and i concocted the scheme together on the trip back from cilicia at every stage of the journey the news from rome was more and more disturbing caesar mocking the constitution refusing to give up his troops in gaul demanding to be allowed to stand for the consulship without coming back to rome pompey likewise digging in his heels refusing more concessions to caesar brooding outside the city gates and clinging to his own legions in spain and the senate our pathetic confused cowardly grasping greedy collection of the socalled best men in rome breaking down into acrimonious debates on the verge of open violence you didnt have to be cassandra to see that the situation was drawing to a crisis cicero decided it would be prudent if i were to arrive in rome ahead of him there was no one else he could trust to send back accurate reports but why incognito so as to gather information without drawing attention to cicero the disguise is simple a beard a change of coloring thats all but youre slender again as thin as when i first met you it changes the shape of your face as it happened i did fall ill on the way back from cilicia early on and lost quite a bit of weight i decided to keep myself slim as part of the charade no more sesame and honey cakes for me im afraid altogether the changes hardly constitute a disguise but the combined effect suffices no one seems to recognize me at a distance or if they do they decide they must be mistaken because cicero made a point of letting everyone know that his beloved tiro is suffering a prolonged illness back in greece people put more faith in what they know than in what they see except for you gordianus i should have known youd be the one to find me out since you got back have you spent the whole time here in the city by hercules no ive been all over italy visiting caesars garrisons scouting antonys movements checking on domitiuss situation in corfinium relaying messages between cicero and pompey youve become ciceros secret agent tiro shrugged i rehearsed for the role during his term as governor of cilicia no one would talk to tiro the governors secretary soscarides the alexandrian on the other hand was everyones friend i gazed at him over my wine cup why are you telling me this having made up your mind youd seen me back in rome youd have figured it out for yourself sooner or later and you might have jumped to some wrong conclusions you could have refused to see me today while you shouted my name in the street and set those two little boys to dog my every step no gordianus i know how tenacious you can be like a hound who cant remember where he buried a bone better to point you straight to it than have you digging holes all over the place holes are dangerous they can hurt innocent people so can jumping to wrong conclusions our host brought more wine the second cup was better than the first but only by a little my eyes had adjusted to the darkness in the orange haze of the smoky lamps i could make out faces but only vaguely the noise would keep anyone from overhearing us i thought of something the guards told me that cicero writes letters to you all the time back in greece so he does our host in patrae who supposedly is nursing me back to health is in on the scheme as soon as he receives the letters he posts back false ones bearing my name so ciceros letters to you are blank hardly theyre full of gossip quotations from plays exhortations to get better you see he always has the letters done in duplicate nothing unusual about that except that he posts both copies one goes by regular messenger all the way back to patrae to keep up the deception the other is sent by secret messenger to me wherever i actually happen to be but if the messages are identical cicero is merely sending you gossip and getwell wishes on the surface yes safer that way he smiled seemed to mull something over then produced a pouch from his tunic from the pouch he pulled out a folded piece of parchment he called for one of the serving girls to unhook a hanging lamp and bring it to our table by its sputtering glow i read the letter it was dated the first day of the month some fifteen days previous at formiae on the kalends of februarius marcus tullius cicero to marcus tullius tiro at patrae i remain very anxious about your health the news that your complaint is not dangerous consoles me but its lingering nature worries me the absence of my skillful secretary vexes me but more vexing is the absence of one dear to me yet though i long to see you i urge you not to stir until you are fully recovered especially as long as harsh weather prevails even in snug houses it is difficult to escape the cold to say nothing of enduring wet windy weather at sea as euripides says cold to tender skin is deadliest foe caesar continues to make pretense of negotiating with pompey even as he plays invader like hannibal sending diplomats ahead of his elephants he says now that he will give up gaul to domitius and come to rome to stand for the consulship in person as the law requires but only if pompey will disband all the loyalist forces recently levied in italy and depart at once to spain caesar says nothing of giving up the garrisons seized since he crossed the rubicon our hope is that the gauls among caesars troops may desert him for they certainly have reason to hate him after all the pain he inflicted in conquering gaul to the north he would have a rebellious gaul to the west pompeys six legions in spain and to the east the provinces which pompey pacified long ago and where the great one is still held in high esteem if only the center can hold long enough to keep caesar from sacking rome terentia asks are you wearing the yellow scarf she gave you when we left for cilicia do all you can to ward off the chill i looked up from the letter his hope that the gauls will desert caesar seems farfetched to me my son meto tells me they cling to caesar with the fervor of religious converts otherwise the letter seems straightforward enough yes doesnt it what do you mean words can carry more than one meaning i frowned and scrutinized the text under the flickering light are you saying that the letter is in some sort of code it was tiro during ciceros consulship who had invented and introduced the use of an abbreviated writing system for recording debates in the senate but this was not tironian shorthand nor was it ciphered tiro smiled we all know what the word blue means for instance but if i say to you ahead of time use blue to mean a legion and red to mean a cohort and later you write to me about a blue scarf then only the two us know what you truly mean i see and if cicero quotes a line from euripides it might mean something very different than if he had cited ennius the actual content of the quotation is irrelevant if he mentions sea travel it might mean that pompey has a head cold snug houses might refer to a particular senator who bears watching even the mention of elephants might have a secret meaning i shook my head you and cicero make quite a team what need for swords when you have words for weapons weve been together a long time gordianus i helped cicero write every speech hes ever given ive transcribed his treatises edited all his commentaries i often know what hell say next even before he knows it wasnt hard for the two of us to concoct an invisible language to use between ourselves everyone can see the words no one but us can see the meaning i gazed into the dim corners of the room i wonder if meto and caesar were ever that close he seemed not to notice the rueful tone in my voice he tapped his forehead perhaps great men like cicero even caesar i suppose need more than one head to store their intellects freedom hasnt changed you tiro you still underestimate yourself and overestimate your former master we shall see as he refolded the letter and slipped it back into his pouch i had a sudden realization it was cicero wasnt it what do you mean gordianus it was cicero who wrote that confidential report for pompey about me and my family tiro hesitated what report you know what im talking about do i tiro you can hide behind words but you cant hide behind your face not with me you do know what im talking about perhaps it all makes sense if pompey wanted an intelligence report on various men in rome and needed it on short notice and from someone he trusts who better than cicero whos been seeing phantoms under beds ever since he sniffed out the socalled conspiracy of catilina ciceros probably kept a dossier on me for years that remark about my lack of roman values the dig at me about adopting slaves out of habit oh yes thats cicero looking down his nose at me as usual and who better to help cicero transcribe his confidential report into ciphered code than you tiro his trusted secretary the inventor of shorthand the other half of his brain you were in town that day werent you the day numerius died i caught a glimpse of you in the street after i left ciceros house was that numeriuss last errand for the great one to pick up ciceros secret loyalty report tiro looked at me shrewdly if there ever was such a report the copy cicero gave numerius went missing pompey was never able to find it even though he turned numeriuss clothing inside out and tore open the stitches he assumed that whoever murdered numerius must have absconded with it how did you come to know about it gordianus i read it the part about myself anyway i found it on numeriuss body inside a hidden compartment in the heel of his shoe his shoe tiro laughed thats something new but what did you do with the report do you still have it i burned it but you said you read only the part about yourself you burned it without having read it all the cipher wasnt that complicated pompey arrived at the house unexpectedly i had no time to replace it in numeriuss shoe if pompey found it in my study i see well theres a riddle solved cicero and i have been wondering where that report ended up when you write to him about this meeting as i presume you will i suppose youll have to mention the rosycolored dawn or whatever passed between the two of you for secret report went up in flames that would be a particular quotation from sophocles actually do you think numerius was murdered because someone knew he was carrying ciceros loyalty list as you call it i hesitated there may have been other reasons that someone wanted him dead such as his mother seems to think he had a secret livelihood working as a paid spy perhaps tiro frowned for someone other than pompey yes shes ashamed of the possibility but she told me her suspicions nonetheless the poor woman is desperate to know the truth about her sons death tiro nodded i met maecia once an extraordinary woman did she hire you to look into numeriuss murder no pompey did or rather the great one ordered me to investigate ordered you hes not our dictator yet nonetheless he was very persuasive he forced my soninlaw into his service against davuss will but following the letter of the law pompey was explicit he wont return davus to us unless and until im able to name his kinsmans killer my daughter is distraught davus could end up in greece or spain or even egypt and if pompey loses patience with me i shook my head generals assign dangerous duties to men they dont like davus is at his mercy tiro looked pensively into his wine cup which was made of cheap yellow earthenware he ran his finger over the chipped rim youve been very candid with me gordianus and youve been candid with me tiro the two of us have never been enemies we never shall be i hope im going to tell you a secret gordianus something i probably shouldnt he lowered his voice i had to strain my ears to hear him above the bursts of laughter and the clatter of thrown dice only a few days before his death i met with numerius pompeius we had messages to exchange between pompey and cicero we met here in the salacious tavern in this very corner as a matter of fact his corner he called it i got the impression he transacted quite a bit of business from the very spot where youre sitting i shivered at the thought of the dead mans lemur sitting beside me what sort of business tiro hesitated so far as i know numerius was loyal to pompey i never had reason to believe otherwise but the last time i met with him he claimed to know some interesting things dangerous things go on tiro you have my attention numerius drank more than he should have that loosened his tongue and he was very excited about what about some documents hed acquired im sitting on something enormous he told me smiling like a fox something so big it could get me killed if you breathe a word of this to anyone what was it tiro something to do with a plot to kill caesar i managed a grim laugh concocted by pompey no a conspiracy inside caesars own camp involving men close to him how numerius could know of such a plot and what sort of documents he had obtained i dont know but thats what he told me when was this assassination supposed to take place it was supposed to have happened when caesar crossed the rubicon the moment he invaded the motherland and showed his true intentions for some reason it didnt come off but this was the thing numerius seemed to think it still had a chance of happening wishful thinking i scoffed maybe but he claimed to have proof of the plot in the form of documents tiro leaned closer to me you wouldnt know about that would you gordianus what do you mean you say you found ciceros report to pompey in numeriuss shoe what else did you find there be honest with me gordianus ive been honest with you i took a deep breath i found exactly five pieces of parchment all of the same color and quality all written in the same hand and the same sort of cipher tiro nodded that would have been ciceros entire report there were five pages in all and you found nothing else that was all i found in numeriuss shoe tiro sat back after a moment he raised his cup and called for more wine and a decent cup as well with a smooth lip he added in a tone harsh enough to cause the eunuchs grin to vanish i suddenly realized why he had been so generous with his information he had hoped i would give him information in return about the conspiracy documents i had disappointed him we waited for our wine then drank in silence across the room someone shouted gaius julius dice clattered and the gambler jumped from his seat the caesar throw the caesar throw beats all the man did a victory dance and scooped up his winnings not a gracious winner i muttered i wonder if caesar will be tiro muttered back this talk you had with numerius here in the tavern about a plot to kill caesar that was a few days before he died yes but on the day he died it was the documents from cicero he was carrying and wasnt there i had to tread carefully wasnt there some sort of altercation that day between cicero and numerius just before he left ciceros house and came to mine altercation shouting loud enough to be heard in the street those damned guards did they tell you that i hate to get them in trouble tiro shrugged cicero may have raised his voice to numerius that day raised his voice he was practically screaming according to the guards something about a debt owed to caesar was it numerius who owed money to caesar or was it cicero tiros face told me i had touched on something sensitive lots of people owe money to caesar that hardly compromises their loyalty to pompey or the senate i nodded its only i got the impression from his mother that numerius might have been blackmailing someone tiro shifted in his seat i think ive had enough of this wretched wine after a certain point it gets worse not better and this damned cup has more chips than the last you were in rome that day tiro the day numerius died did you happen to follow him after he left ciceros house i dont think i like the tone of your voice gordianus did he think i suspected him of the murder i only wondered if you did happen to follow numerius whether you might have seen anything significant someone besides yourself following him for instance or someone to whom he might have passed documents before he entered my house tiro looked at me squarely yes i followed numerius cicero was curious to know where he was headed next so i followed him along the rim road to your house i waited so long for him to leave that i finally assumed hed given me the slip how was i to know that he was dead inside and no i didnt see him pass anything to anyone nor did i notice anyone else following him and before you ask no i didnt see anyone climb over the roof into your garden either though i could hardly have seen all four sides of your house at once could i i smiled and dont even think of asking if i climbed over the roof and into your garden he tried to inject some levity into his voice you saw how carefully i had to climb down that rickety ladder at ciceros house yes still you do manage to climb up and down that ladder dont you i likewise tried to keep my tone light i excused myself to go to the privy which was out the back door and across an alley in a little leanto there were several holes in the paved floor but the drunken patrons of the salacious tavern were poor marksmen and the place stank of standing urine it occurred to me that the cloaca maxima the central sewer line into the tiber was probably located just beneath my feet when i returned to the corner bench tiro had vanished i stayed and drank another cup of wine in no hurry to go home the interview had yielded more than i expected where were the documents of which numerius had boasted to tiro only days before his death who else knew about them like poor numerius i felt i was sitting on something enormous if only i could lay my hands on it ix the remaining days of februarius brought despair for pompeys supporters joy for caesars flush with an unbroken chain of victories caesar continued his southward advance and surrounded corfinium domitius ahenobarbus trapped in the city sent desperate messages to pompey begging for reinforcements pompey curtly replied that he had no intention of relieving corfinium because domitius had no business making a stand there in the first place domitius concealed the contents of the letter from his officers and claimed that pompey was on his way but his agitated demeanor fooled no one behind his back his officers decided to hand the city over to caesar without a fight domitiuss longstanding grudge against caesar was personal domitiuss grandfather and father had begun the settlement of southern gaul conquering the allobroges and the arverni building roads establishing roman colonies on the coast and along the way amassing an enormous family fortune the family had come to think of the region as their personal domain to which domitius should be heir caesar they considered an upstart who had built on their achievements to launch his own conquests when domitius made his first bid to acquire governorship of southern gaul six years ago caesar successfully thwarted him and held on to command of the region now caesars tenure had at last expired legally he was obliged to relinquish gaul and let domitius succeed him caesars answer had been to cross the rubicon with his army domitius had good reason to hate him and better reason to fear him finding himself betrayed and despairing of an ignoble death at the hands of caesar or even more ignobly at the hands of his own rebellious men domitius asked his physician to give him poison no sooner had domitius swallowed the dose than word arrived that caesar was treating all captives even his bitterest enemies with mercy and respect domitius wailed and tore his hair and cursed himself for acting too soon until the physician who knew his master better than his master knew himself revealed that the dose was not poison but a harmless narcotic domitius surrendered to caesar and was allowed to keep his head in rome copies of caesars public pronouncement on entering corfinium were posted in the forum by his supporters i did not leave my province with intent to harm anybody i merely want to protect myself against the slanders of my enemies to restore to their rightful positions the tribunes of the people who have been expelled because of their involvement in my cause and to reclaim for myself and for the roman people independence from the domination of a small clique fencesitters among the rich and powerful were heartened by the news of caesars clemency some who had fled now began to return to the city his army swelled by the troops of domitius ahenobarbus and by fresh reinforcements from gaul caesar continued his southward advance pompey fell back and ordered all loyalist troops to rendezvous at brundisium in the heel of italy davus will die there diana said hell die in brundisium trapped with the rest of pompeys men caesar will put his foot into the boot of italy and grind them all beneath his heel caesar has shown mercy so far i said cautiously he took corfinium without spilling a drop of blood but this is different this is pompey hell never surrender to caesar perhaps pompey will flee rather than fight across the sea but davus cant swim i tried not to smile i imagine theyll take ships diana i know that im thinking of the weather no one sails at this time of year if they can help it its too dangerous especially crossing the adriatic storms and shipwrecks i keep seeing davus clinging to a scrap of flotsam waves crashing over his head lightning all around the curse of an overactive imagination was something she inherited from her mother davus is cleverer than you think i said he can take care of himself thats not true hes sweet as honey on a cold morning and just as slow and you know it and what if pompey doesnt flee and there is a battle caesars men against pompeys davus would never do the sensible thing and run away hell feel obliged to stay and fight for the sake of the other soldiers its like that for men in battle isnt it comrades and loyalty to the last drop of blood i had no answer to that i had been in one battle in my life fighting with catilina at pistoria what she said was true diana grimaced meto says you dont even feel the wounds when they happen you just keep fighting until you cant fight anymore she looked at me with sudden horror in her eyes davus and meto could be in the same battle on different sides they could kill each other now her imagination was definitely getting the better of her i rose from my chair and crossed my study i laid my hands on her shoulders she leaned back against me and i circled her with my arms davus was trained to be a bodyguard not a soldier you know that diana thats how pompey will use him to guard his person hell keep davus close to him day and night now i ask you where could davus be safer pompey is no fool look how cautious hes been so far retreating two steps every time caesar advances one davus is probably safer with pompey than he would be in rome but what if there is a battle and pompey is at the head of the charge leading his men caesar does that meto says so davus would be doomed then its as you say he was trained to be a bodyguard hell sacrifice himself rather than let pompey be harmed he wont even stop and think if theres a sword aimed for pompeys heart hell throw himself on it diana diana you must stop imagining such things i sighed listen i want you to close your eyes now picture davus whats he doing this very instant ill tell you hes standing at attention outside pompeys tent bored out of his mind struggling not to yawn there can you see him i can i can even see the fly buzzing about his head if he yawns it may fly into his mouth oh papa diana sniffled and laughed in spite of herself i held her close what do you suppose davus is thinking about right now i said quietly she laughed his next meal probably no hes thinking about you diana about you and little aulus diana sighed and snuggled against me i congratulated myself on having successfully comforted her prematurely as it happened for the next moment she trembled and burst into tears and pulled herself from my embrace diana what now oh papa i cant stand to think of davus like that so far from home so lonely for us he must be utterly miserable and theres nothing he can do about it papa you must promise me that youll get him back you must do whatever it takes to bring him back to us but diana you must find whoever killed pompeys kinsman and tell pompey and make him give back davus i shook my head you dont know what youre asking daughter she gave me a puzzled dissatisfied desperate look in her eyes i saw something i had never seen before for the first time it occurred to her that her beloved father upon whom she had always relied as upon a rock might simply be too old now too far past his prime to keep his family safe i wanted to assure her that nothing could be further from the truth but my tongue was like lead in my mouth that particular day the first day of martius seemed to be my day to deal with distraught young women diana had hardly left my study when mopsus ran in in my irritable state of mind it occurred to me that he and his brother never seemed to walk anywhere indoors or out they had only two states of being at rest or scampering like hounds master theres a visitor for you does he have a name its not a he its a she i leaned back still i imagine she has a name he frowned and i saw that between the foyer and my study he had forgotten the visitors name humans are like aesops animals i thought they never change their essential nature davus would always be a bodyguard my son meto would always be a scholar and a soldier and mopsus raised in a stable to look after beasts would never make a decent door slave what sort of woman is she i asked high or low he thought she has bodyguards otherwise its hard to tell from how shes dressed all in black could it be maecia come to inquire after my progress or lack of progress into her sons murder i didnt relish the idea of seeing her again unless she had found in her house new evidence of numeriuss activities perhaps even the documents which gave details of the plot on caesars life old or young mopsus thought young maybe dianas age not maecia then but dressed in black nonetheless i frowned numerius had not been married nor had there been a sister but perhaps show her in i said and her bodyguards they must remain outside of course mopsus grinned theres three of them but i bet even three couldnt get past scarface of late mopsus and his brother had grown rather fond of cicatrix curiously the ugly monster seemed to return the sentiment i often heard the three of them laughing in the foyer or outside the front door cicatrixs harsh bark making odd counterpoint to the boys giggles i remained suspicious of the fellow and would gladly have been rid of him but i was not as afraid of him as i had been at first he did an excellent job of guarding the front door his demeanor to bethesda and diana was sullen but not threatening he clearly preferred guarding the great one and considered service in the household of a nonentity such as myself to be beneath him but the two of us had worked out a begrudging means of communicating i gave curt orders cicatrix scowled and grunted but did as he was told mopsus ran from my study i stepped into the garden thinking it a more suitable place to greet a young woman the weather was mild for the kalends of martius with little wind and only a few high fleecy bands of clouds streaking the cold blue sky a few moments later the visitor entered she wore not a married womans stola but a maidens long tunic all in black and covered by a heavy cloak as black as her hair which was done up with pins and combs atop her head in a fashion too mature for her face her perfume seemed too mature for her as well i caught a whiff of jasmine and spikenard mopsus had estimated her to be dianas age she looked younger to me no more than seventeen or eighteen her hands and face were as white as a doves breast she looked at me warily from beneath her dark brows are you gordianus i am who are you my name is aemilia the daughter of titus aemilius i looked expectantly at the door through which she had come where is your chaperone aemilia looked uncomfortable and lowered her eyes i came alone a girl of your age and station walking about rome without a companion i brought bodyguards even so does your father know youre out my father is away with pompey of course your mother we returned to rome only a few days ago we were at our villa on the coast but mother says its probably safer here in rome now shes busy today visiting the shops and markets i was supposed to go with her i told her i felt unwell and needed to stay at home but instead you came here yes are you unwell you look pale she didnt answer but looked nervously about the garden until her eyes fixed on the minerva behind me the sight of the goddess seemed to give her strength it was minervas face she looked at while she spoke not mine she probably had little experience addressing a grown man directly i just came from maecias house she told me about you what did maecia say that you were looking into her nerve seemed to falter she lowered her eyes to the ground is this where it happened i took a deep breath if you mean the death of numerius pompeius yes it happened in this garden she shuddered and clutched the black cloak to her throat were you kin to him i said no yet youre dressed in mourning she bit her lips which looked blood red against her pale cheeks he was he and i we were to marry i shook my head i didnt know no one did i dont understand no one knew pompey had plans for him to marry someone else but i was the one he chose numerius chose me from the way she touched herself one hand unconsciously coming to rest above her belly i suddenly understood i see do you her face registered a confusion of pride and alarm maecia could tell too is it that obvious i shook my head it doesnt show yet if thats what you mean not here she looked down and touched her belly but it must show on my face and why not i should have been his widow the baby should have been born with his name but now why did you come here aemilia to see the place where he died she grimaced no i dont like to think about that then why are you here what do you want from me her eyes met mine for an instant then she looked beyond me to minerva as she struggled to put her thoughts into words i raised my hand never mind i know already you want from me what everyone else wants pompey maecia even diana i shook my head why was i able to tell at once with you and yet with my own daughter i practically had to be struck by lightning before i saw the obvious and people think gordianus is so clever able to see what others dont aemilia looked at me mystified i sighed how long have you known about the baby i knew before mother and i left rome i wasnt certain but i knew since then the moon waxed and waned and waxes again and now theres no doubt i can feel it inside me i know its too early for that but i swear i feel it sometimes his child i said like aemilia imagining she felt the new life inside her i seemed to sense another very different kind of presence in the garden what stronger lure than his unborn child might serve to call back the lemur of a murdered man to the spot where he was killed i turned about and gave a start almost certain i saw a shadow move behind the statue of minerva it was only a trick of the light did he know did you tell numerius she nodded the last time i saw him the day before he died we had a secret place to meet she lowered her eyes we afterward i told him i was afraid hed be angry but he wasnt he was happy id never seen him so happy he said now pompey will have to give up his plans for me and let us marry ill tell him tonight the next day numerius was supposed to meet me again to tell me what pompey said but he never came she bit her lip that was the day everyone thought caesar was coming and pompey decided to leave rome and my father decided to send mother and me to the villa and we spent the whole night madly packing our things and i didnt sleep at all she took a breath lifted her eyes and stared hard at the face of minerva the next morning we were in our wagon lined up with all the other wagons to leave through the capena gate a friend of mothers came over they talked about whether caesar was really coming and who was taking sides and then it was just another bit of gossip to her the woman said did you hear numerius pompeius was murdered yesterday strangled she said it so quickly then moved on to something else so fast i thought i must have imagined it but i knew i hadnt i knew it was true i felt something sharp in my chest like a jagged stone i think i must have fainted the next thing i knew we were out on the appian way for an instant i thought id dreamed it but i knew better the stone was still in my chest it hurt to breathe who else knows about the baby i kept it from my mother as long as i could she knew something was wrong but she thought i was only worried for father and upset by all that was going on but once we started back to rome i couldnt keep it from her she wasnt as angry as i thought shed be then your father doesnt know she lowered her face mother says he must never know but how can that be even if pompey leaves italy and takes your father with him they may return before you come to term and when you have the child someone will talk someone always does you can hardly expect then i fell silent because i understood what she had told me this morning when i went to see her i told maecia everything about numerius and me about the baby we wept together she says i mustnt get rid of it she says its all thats left of her little boy her son but its not her choice to make its not my choice either mother says i must get rid of it my mouth was dry its not your mother but your father who has legal power over you and the baby inside you if father knew he could put me to death that would be legal and proper wouldnt it surely hed never do that what if hes gone for a year and comes back to find you and the child he might still get rid of the baby expose it on a hill outside the city to let it starve or be eaten by jackals then hed put me away somewhere the way you hide a cracked vessel at the back of a cabinet she swallowed hard no mother is right if father were here hed demand that i get rid of the baby while i can they may yet be able to find a husband for me dont you see mother says it wouldnt be right anyway to bring a child without a father into such a world she began to weep i resisted the urge to comfort her i stiffened my arms and clenched my fists i glanced over my shoulder and it seemed to me that minerva regarded me with a mocking smile aemilia why have you come to me i dont know except that maecia said you were the last to see him and that everything depends on you now but aemilia theres nothing i can do to help you you can at least find out who killed him who killed my baby she saw the confusion on my face dont you see if numerius hadnt been murdered he would have found a way to marry me im certain of it i could have had our child then even if numerius was taken from me killed in battle or lost at sea i would have had the baby and the baby would have had his name but now now therell be no baby dont you see whoever murdered numerius might as well have stuck a knife in my womb her grief erupted in a long keening wail that carried all the way to the front of the house i heard banging noises and a scuffle and a few heartbeats later her three bodyguards rushed into the garden one by one their swords drawn cicatrix followed after them bellowing furiously brandishing his own sword the scar across his face was livid like a fresh brand he circled the bodyguards and ran to my side where he assumed a defensive crouch his arms extended and his knees bent to spring the three armed men approached us with wild looks in their eyes aemilia spun about dazed and realized what was happening she stifled her sobs and held up her arms calling her bodyguards to heel they drew back and surrounded her one of them exchanged whispers with her then with his companions the threat of bloodshed lingered in the air like a raw pungent smell aemilia stepped toward me her face lowered her bodyguards advanced with her swords drawn eying me warily forgive me she whispered i never meant i nodded ill go now i dont know why i came i only thought i hoped you might i dont know she turned away her bodyguards withdrew with her the hindmost walking backward and keeping his eyes on cicatrix and me wait i said she stopped and looked over her shoulder i stepped toward her getting as close as i dared it was too close for cicatrix who gripped my arm to hold me back aemilia you said something about a secret meeting place her face already flushed grew even redder yes did this place belong to numerius it belonged to his family they own a lot of property in the carinae district and this place where is it she stepped toward me and motioned for her bodyguards to stand back i gestured for cicatrix to move away it was a tenement building said aemilia keeping her voice low an awful smelly place but there was a vacant apartment on the uppermost floor from the window you could see a bit of the capitoline hill she gazed into space her eyes glittering with tears and only you and numerius knew about this meeting place i dont know i think he inherited the building from his father but his uncle maecius had a say in running it but the room it was numeriuss secret place yes he kept a few things there a lamp some clothing some poems i gave him poems greek love poems i copied out for him we used to read them to one another i nodded so this was a place where he might have kept other secret things i dont know why do you ask some documents may be there she shook her head i dont think so there was no scroll cabinet not even a chest for keeping papers he had to keep my poems beneath the bed even so i need to see this place she bit her lip then shook her head please aemilia it may be very important i may find the documents that were responsible for numeriuss death she looked at minerva then at me her gaze was steady the building is at the corner of the street of the basketmakers and a little alley that runs off it to the north its covered in a red wash but the red is starting to wear off to show a yellow wash beneath the room is on the fourth floor in the southwest corner the door has a lock but the key is under a loose floorboard with a deep scratch across it three paces up the hall i nodded ill find it she touched my arm if you go there youll find the love poems id be grateful if you could of course ill find some way to return them to you she shook her head no i could never have them in the house but i cant bear to think of anyone else reading them burn them she turned and rejoined her bodyguards i followed them through the house just before we reached the foyer little aulus appeared from nowhere and went stamping across the atrium laughing and clapping his hands directly in front of aemilia mopsus and androcles came running after him but not before aemilia gave a shudder and fled weeping through the foyer and out of the house her guards trailing after her that night i tossed and turned at last bethesda rolled toward me cant you sleep husband the moonlight picked out glints of silver in her undone hair but left her eyes in shadow im thinking about the girl who came to visit me today i had told her aemilias story over dinner very sad said bethesda yes i was wondering i dont know much about how its done what how a baby is gotten rid of bethesda sighed in the darkness its one of those things most men dont care to know much about there are several ways sometimes a willow wand willow with the bark stripped off it needs to be thin and flexible to reach into the uterus i nodded or the girl may take poison poison something strong enough to kill the child and expel it from her body you brew a strong tea using roots and herbs and fungi rue nightshade ergot but isnt that likely to kill the mother as well sometimes that happens i saw the girl on her way out she looked rather frail to me bethesda sighed wearily and rolled away i stared at the ceiling aemilia believed that the killer of numerius was equally responsible for the destruction of her unborn child if aemilia died aborting the baby would numeriuss killer then be responsible for three deaths i wondered did men like caesar in the cold dark hours of the night ever ponder such chains of responsibility to kill a man on the battlefield caesar would consider an honorable act but what of the mans widow and child left to starve or the parents who die of grief or the lover who kills himself in despair or the whole villages that perish to famine and disease in the wake of war how many such chains of suffering and death radiated from every battlefield in gaul how many such casualties would there be in italy now that caesar had crossed the rubicon i tossed and turned unable to sleep x the next day taking mopsus and androcles with me i made my way to the carinae district i had forgotten exactly where the street of the basketmakers was located mopsus thought he knew so did androcles to the right said mopsus to the left said androcles while they squabbled i asked directions of a slave who passed by carrying an armload of baskets he pointed straight ahead i followed and was nearly around a bend when the boys noticed and came running after me the narrow curving street was lined with shops all with doors flung open and wares on display baskets spilled out onto little tripod tables more baskets hung suspended from ropes that crisscrossed overhead many were local products but the best and most expensive came from egypt made of nile reeds with dyed strands woven into the fabric to make intricate patterns and repeating pictures i made the mistake of pausing to look at a curious specimen decorated with a circular band of nile riverhorses the shop owner descended on me at once those are called hippopotami he said yes i know i lived in egypt for a while when i was young then youll want the basket as a souvenir it was made for you i smiled shook my head and hurried on the man followed me down the street badgering me and waving the basket when i refused to bargain he threw down the basket with a curse times were hard on the street of the basketmakers it was not hard to locate the mottled red and yellow tenement aemilia had described it had a seedy rundown appearance with chipped plaster and broken shutters hanging from the windows someone was stewing cabbage inside a baby was crying the sound made me think of aemilia some tenement landlords post a slave at the front door to keep out thieves and troublemakers but there was no slave at the entrance and when i tested the door i found it had no lock either it was hard to imagine anything inside such a building to tempt a burglar mopsus i said i want you to stand across the street while androcles and i go inside try not to look like a runaway slave up to no good ill stand watch said mopsus eagerly if anybody dangerouslooking goes in after you ill run up and tell you i shook my head no mopsus i imagine any number of dangerouslooking men and women for that matter are likely to live in this building this is a dangerous neighborhood but tenement dwellers must come and go how could you possibly know who has legitimate business in this building and who does not mopsus scratched his head and if some assassin were to enter this building intending to do me harm how could you get past him to warn me mopsus frowned androcles covered his mouth laughing at his older brothers consternation i put my hands on their shoulders and walked them both across the street mopsus i want you to stand precisely here now do you see that corner window up on the fourth floor the one with the shutters intact i want you to watch that window in a moment if all goes well ill open those shutters and give you a wave dont wave back but keep watching the window if something should go wrong youll see me or androcles at that window again if we scream for help i want you to run to ecos house and tell him do you think you could find your way to ecos house from here its just up the esquiline hill mopsus nodded mutely his eyes wide at the gravity of his post good now keep your eyes on that window i crossed the street with androcles and entered the tenement the narrow hallway was deserted and except for the crying baby quiet the tenants like most people in rome were out in the markets searching for the necessities of life which became harder to find each day a stairway at one end of the hall led to the upper floors i ascended and androcles followed we shall be visiting a secret room androcles where we have no business being i shall need you to keep watch in the hall outside he mimicked his brothers grave nod and i may need you for something even more important what master i shall be searching for something it may be well hidden and hard to reach a pair of tiny hands could turn out to be very useful my hands are smaller than mopsuss he boasted holding them up for me to see so they are we reached the landing of the third floor the sound of the crying baby receded the smell of cabbage grew stronger mingled now with other smells onions perfume lamp oil stale urine what had the daughter of titus aemilius thought of such a place we came to the top floor the hallway was empty and dim i motioned to androcles to tread quietly i located the loose floorboard just where aemilia had described it wedged in a narrow space beneath was the key it was not one of those stout keys with notches to be inserted into a lock and given a strong turn but a thin bronze rod which curved eccentrically this way and that as if it might have been accidentally bent beneath a wagon wheel at one end there was a tiny hook finding such a key is only half the trick in using it the eccentric shape allows it to slip through the equally eccentric passage inside the keyhole once through the hook at the end needs to find the eye it was fashioned for which unless the user has used that particular lock before can require a considerable amount of trial and error i replaced the floorboard and stepped to the door the lock was a bronze box bolted to the wood from inside in such a neglected insecure building the elaborate mechanism seemed conspicuously out of place i slipped the key in twisted it this way and that to negotiate the hole then tried to imagine in my minds eye what the hook needed to catch against up or down farther in or farther out a jiggle or a twist i tried various motions then finally removed the key and started over again i had no luck my patience nearing an end i pulled out and tried once more this time i seemed to locate a divergent keyhole the key entered in a different direction the hook caught on something i held my breath turned the key and pulled toward me the lock gave a satisfying click the door opened behind me i heard androcles release a pentup breath i looked over my shoulder and nodded toward the stairs stand watch on the landing i whispered if anyone starts up come quietly and let me know can you do that he nodded and tiptoed toward the stairs i stepped inside and pulled the door not quite shut behind me the room was even darker than the hallway i found my way to the window at the southwest corner which was covered with heavy winter drapes made of a fabric far superior i wagered to anything to be found in the other apartments i pulled them apart and opened the shutters above the rooftops as aemilia had said i could see the sacred temples atop the capitoline hill mopsus stood across the street leaning against a wall his arms crossed idly kicking his heels against the ground he looked up at the sound of the shutters opening i waved he uncrossed his arms and started to wave back then caught himself he peered up and down the street hardening his posture and trying to look formidable i shook my head if i had specifically asked him to look like an errant slave bent on getting into mischief he could not have delivered a better performance i turned around and surveyed the room it was sparsely furnished with a low sleeping couch and a little trunk against one wall perhaps it was nothing more than a love nest after all lovers needs were simple atop the trunk there was a simple oil lamp a vessel containing spare oil and a small round mirror i peered inside the lamp and the vessel and poured oil back and forth between them until i was satisfied that they contained nothing else the mirror was of solid silver and had no secret parts i glanced at my reflection i saw a bearded man with furrowed brow but clear eyes not yet entirely gray and youthfullooking for his years a sign of the gods favor the fact that it was aemilias mirror made me uneasy i put it aside the trunk was not locked inside i found a few pieces of clothing a mans loincloth and tunic a cloak that might have been worn by either sex there was also a spare coverlet for the bed at the very bottom there was a small dagger that was all the trunk appeared to contain nothing of significance but remembering that numerius pompeius had carried confidential reports in his shoe i looked at each item again satisfied that the dagger had no secret compartments i used it to cut open the stitches of each garment i had brought my own knife for the purpose but this one looked sharper i found nothing i examined the empty trunk i used the dagger to undo the hinges and cut into the leather i turned it over and rapped on the bottom listening for the hollow echo of a hidden compartment the trunk was nothing more than an ordinary trunk i turned my attention to the bed it was a fine piece of furniture like the drapes surely finer than anything to be found in the humble apartments down the hall or on the floors below the frame was made entirely of ebony with ornately carved legs against the wall an ebony sideboard inlaid with ivory ran the length of the frame from head to foot aemilia would have lain on the inner side next to the board and the wall numerius would have lain on the outside as men typically do i once explained to bethesda that this arrangement was so because the man protects the woman in sleep she laughed and said it was because men needed to get up and pass water more often during the night but i imagined the lovers had done little sleeping in this bed they would have met here in the day it seemed doubtful that aemilia could have escaped her parents vigilance after dark it was a bed for the waking hours a bed for loving not sleeping the bed where their baby was made the thick mattress was covered with a linen sheet haphazardly tucked at the corners a woolen coverlet was thrown over it several pillows were scattered about the bed had a rumpled used look both numerius and aemilia were no doubt used to having their beds made by a slave and either did not know how to do it themselves or did not care to keeping house was not how they spent their time in this room i pulled off the coverlet and cut open the stitches there was nothing hidden inside i pulled off the linen sheet it was too sheer to conceal anything it gave off a faint odor i held it to my nose and smelled jasmine spikenard the scent of warm bodies for an instant i imagined it wrapped around aemilia clinging to her i imagined the two of them lying side by side with only the sheet to cover them i shook my head to clear it the pillows and the mattress were the most likely places to conceal something i pulled them off the bed and saw several pieces of parchment hidden beneath the mattress atop the webbing of straps strung between the sideposts if they were aemilias greek love poems copied out in her own hand i had no desire to read them but how could i determine what they were unless i examined them i looked at the first poem the handwriting was selfconsciously fancy painfully childish the words were not when i look at you i can no longer speak my tongue is broken a thin flame runs under my skin i see nothing my ears roar sweat pours down me a trembling seizes me all over i am greener than grass i feel close to dying somehow this can be endured when i look at you sappho of course what lovesmitten teenage girl could resist the poet of lesbos i forced myself to read the other poems one by one the words made my face flush hotly finally having read them all i examined the pieces of parchment front and back i walked to the window and held each one to the light looking for signs of invisible lemon ink or perforations that could be a code but saw nothing of the sort the love poems were only that bits of sappho and my old friend catullus copied out by a daydreaming girl to pass the hours between visits to her lover incriminating to be sure but only if shown to her parents standing at the window from the corner of my eye i noticed mopsus down on the street corner he waved at me i glowered shook my head and refused to look back at him i had specifically told him not to wave which would only attract attention to us both when i ignored him he only seemed to wave more frantically i determined to thrash him with my tongue when i was done i stepped away from the window beneath the bed i noticed a wide shallow bowl i moved the bowl to the floor in the middle of the room i knelt and dropped the poems into it i reached into my tunic for the flint box i had brought for the purpose and concentrated so hard on striking a spark that i didnt hear androcless footsteps in the hall outside i gave a start when he pushed open the door and stuck his head inside master theres a man coming up the stairs i suddenly understood why mopsus waved so frantically i looked back to androcles come inside then quickly i whispered androcles slipped inside then turned to shut the door he was too late the door caught on something androcles pushed hard but to no avail a mans foot was thrust into the breach androcles gave a little squeal of panic fingers wrapped around the edge of the door androcles threw his whole body against it but he was no match for the man on the other side the door relentlessly began to open i dropped my flint box i reached for the knife i rose to my feet and braced myself my heart pounding master i cant stop him cried androcles slowly but steadily the door opened until the sunlight from the window fell upon the quizzical artificially darkened face of my old friend tiro xi a rather good view of the capitoline tiro noted gazing out the window i wonder how much an apartment like this lets for on the open market after stepping inside and patting a startled androcles on the head tiro had made a leisurely circuit of the room noting the emptied trunk and stepping over the mattress and pillows strewn on the floor and came to rest at the window tiro what are you doing here he lowered his gaze that boy down there staring up at me as if i were a gorgon isnt he one of yours gordianus i walked to the window and waved to mopsus to show that all was well visibly relieved he pantomimed coming up to join us but i shook my head and signaled that he should continue keeping watch androcles i said go back to the head of the stairs and stand guard as you did before perhaps we can avoid being surprised a second time but master androcles protested isnt this the assassin you had us follow for you the other day tiro raised an eyebrow i never told them any such thing the boys have more imagination than common sense go androcles but master i shall be perfectly safe at least i think i will be it was my turn to raise an eyebrow at tiro once androcles was out of the room i repeated the question i had asked him before what are you doing here he tapped his nose the same thing you are i imagine following my nose following me you mean perhaps do you make a habit of trailing after me every time i leave the house no more often than you follow me i imagine why today then because yesterday numeriuss young lover paid you a visit how do you know they were lovers i know all sorts of things and how did you know she came to see me yesterday were you watching my house or were you following her he shook his head gordianus you cant expect me to tell you everything any more than i expect you to tell me all you know still i think it might serve both our interests if we were to pool our knowledge about numerius i mean youre looking for the documents he told you about arent you arent you as well gordianus since were looking for the same thing why not help each other find it i didnt answer tiro stepped to the middle of the room and knelt beside the bowl with aemilias poems the flint box lay beside it you were about to burn these before i arrived he observed what are they nothing to interest you how can you be sure of that i sighed theyre erotic poems copied out by a lovesick girl aemilia told me they were here she asked me to burn them i see no reason to do otherwise but they might not be what they seem theyre not what either of us is looking for tiro how do you know that i know but youll let me take them wont you what harm could there be in that gordianus ill burn them myself once ive had a chance to thoroughly examine them no one else will ever see them no tiro we looked at one another for a long moment neither willing to look away at last he rose to his feet and stepped away from the bowl very well gordianus i can see that you wont be swayed what obligation do you owe to this girl i didnt answer but knelt by the bowl and recommenced striking the flint a spark flew into the bowl the dry parchment ignited the flame was tiny at first then spread along the edge of the parchment i watched the words catch fire a thin flame runs under my skin i see nothing i looked up to see the glow reflected off tiros swarthy features nothing is as fascinating as fire dont you think he said smiling faintly after the flames nothing is left but a bit of ash which crumbles to nothing if you touch it where does the flame come from where does the parchment go no one knows now it will be as if the girl never copied those poems and numerius never heard her read them numerius might as well never have existed but he did and aemilia loved him inside her a part of numerius still existed i thought at least for a while the baby too soon would be ashes tiro made a scoffing noise she loved him perhaps but did he love her he was determined to marry her despite pompeys wishes aemilia was certain of that was she no doubt she imagined all sorts of things lying on that bed with him after an hour of making love gazing out the window at the temples on the capitoline no doubt he told her all sorts of lies whatever he needed to tell her to keep her coming back to meet him here a life spent with cicero has made you a stodgy moralist tiro nonsense but when i see a love nest like this and ive seen just how young and tender the girl was its no mystery what sort of young man numerius must have been a perfect specimen of his generation selfish without morals out to take whatever he can with no thought to the consequences if it werent for his kinship to pompey hed have been just the sort to join caesar i looked at tiro steadily you make him sound the sort of man that no one should regret killing tiro gave me a sour look dont mock me gordianus and dont accuse me of murder even in jest i wasnt im only saying that if numerius really loved the girl hed have done the right thing and taken her for a wife with or without the great ones blessing instead of taking her for a lover in a squalid hole like this tiro have you forgotten the love affair that you were carrying on behind ciceros back when i first met you you were a slave then and she was the daughter of your masters client and the consequences could have been terrible for both of you not to mention for any child that might have resulted unfair gordianus i was young and stupid and numerius wasnt tiro stared at the ashes in the bowl every man likes to remember youthful indiscretions but no man likes to be reminded of them i said quietly ennius said tiro recognizing the quotation he managed a weak smile youre right were not here to pass judgment on numerius were here to discover his secrets shall we work together gordianus or not there are two knives i said holding up the one i had brought and offering him the one i had found in the trunk i brought my own he said but this one looks sharper together we set to cutting open the pillows and the mattress they contained at least one surprise instead of common straw or wool they were stuffed with swans down mixed with enough dried herbs to faintly scent the whole room i had been wondering where the smell came from numerius had not been one to stint himself of luxury when it came to lovemaking each time we cut into a pillow feathers came bursting out soon the room was adrift in white fluff bits of down floated in the air like snowflakes the absurdity of it made us both laugh the tension between us leaked away perhaps it would have been otherwise if we had found what we were seeking but as we sifted and searched it quickly became evident that nothing was hidden among the stuffing ive searched everywhere i can think of i told tiro why dont you have a look yourself starting with the trunk perhaps youll notice something ive overlooked he carefully examined every item in the room including the bedposts searching for hollow chambers together we examined every floorboard looking for one that might be loose we ran our hands over the plastered walls and poked at the ceiling we found nothing if there ever were some documents regarding a plot to kill caesar they arent here said tiro sticking out his tongue to blow a bit of down from his upper lip nor were they hidden at numeriuss house his mother told me she made a thorough search for just such material and found nothing yet numerius told me he was sitting on something enormous something so dangerous it could get him killed which it did i said lowering my eyes tiro walked about the room stirring up eddies of swans down so im no closer to finding what i was looking for and youre no closer to discovering who murdered numerius and getting your soninlaw back from pompey listen gordianus im leaving rome tomorrow come with me i cocked an eyebrow why not he said im sick of traveling alone surely youll take a bodyguard for the road yes one of those idiots at ciceros house the older ones brighter i said not quite as stupid anyway fortex you mean if thats his name fortex wont make much of a traveling companion i could have better conversations with my horse youre good company gordianus you want me to go with you simply to keep you amused tiro someone has to look after my family youve got that cyclops from pompey at your front door havent you and your son eco can look in from time to time perhaps still what reason have i to leave rome tiro looked at me gravely you want to get your soninlaw back dont you theres not much time left for that gordianus pompeys withdrawn to brundisium with his back to the sea caesar is pursuing him it can only be a matter of days now if you have any intention of bringing davus back to rome i see your point what about you tiro why are you leaving rome i received a message from cicero today he wants me to stop at his villa in formiae on my way and carry some letters to pompey formiae cicero is still down the coast yes but pompey ordered all loyalist senators to rendezvous at brundisium yes well tiros expression became guarded dont tell me cicero is still vacillating is he waiting for the war to be over before he takes sides its not like that gordianus not as bad as you make it sound cicero sees himself as how to put it uniquely positioned to play a special role what other man of his eminence can still communicate with both sides cicero is still in contact with caesar cicero and caesar never stopped corresponding pompey knows that cicero hasnt misled him now that the crisis is entering a new stage cicero may be in a position to act as gobetween as peacemaker in order to do that he must maintain a delicate balance nonsense cicero simply hasnt the nerve to throw his lot with pompey he detests caesar but he fears that caesar may win so he secretly cozies up to both sides hes the worst sort of coward tiro grimaced whos being the stodgy moralist now gordianus we all find ourselves in a situation not of our choosing every man has to steer his own course itll be a lucky man who comes out of this alive without a bit of tarnish on his conscience i had no answer for that he took a deep breath well then gordianus will you come with me to brundisium or not on the way home i bought the egyptian basket ringed with hippopotami as a gift for bethesda i needed something to soften the news that i was leaving rome as it turned out it was a wise choice for a gift since a reed basket can be thrown across the room and not break unlike her mother diana seemed to receive the news with enthusiasm anything that might result in the return of davus was a welcome development but that night as i packed a saddlebag with things i would need for the journey diana came into the room she spoke without looking at me i think its a brave thing youre doing papa going off like this the countryside must be terribly dangerous no more so than the city these days i imagine she watched me fold a tunic i did such a poor job that she felt obliged to take it from me and fold it herself papa i know that youre doing this for me even though i mean to say i know that you were never pleased by my marriage yet now youre willing to she fought back sudden tears and i worry that i may never see either of you again the folded tunic came undone in her hands i put my arm around her she reached up to touch my fingers on her shoulder i dont know whats wrong with me papa every since davus left everyones nerves are as frayed as a beggars cloak diana what do you want to bet that cicero breaks out in tears twice a day she smiled i doubt that caesar does perhaps not but pompey may theres a picture for you davus yawning outside the great ones tent and pompey inside crying like a baby and tearing his hair like a scene from plautus exactly sometimes it helps to think of life as a comedy on a stage the way the gods must see it the gods can be cruel as often as not we were silent for a while i felt a great sense of peace standing next to her with my arm around her but papa she said quietly how will you manage to get davus from pompey if you havent discovered who killed numerius pompey will never let him go dont worry i have a plan do you tell me no diana she shrugged my arm from her shoulder and stepped away why not papa you used to tell me everything you dont need to know diana she pursed her lips dont tell me your plan then papa perhaps i dont believe you have one i took her hands and kissed her forehead oh i assure you daughter i do have a plan and i did although using it might mean that i would never come back from brundisium alive part two mars xii horses were hard to come by the best had been taken by those who fled the city in the first wave of panic or requisitioned by pompeys forces tiro promised to meet me outside the capena gate before dawn the next day with fresh mounts but what could possibly be left in the stables i had visions of myself atop a swaybacked nag with knobby joints and a hide worn to leather but i underestimated tiros resourcefulness i found him waiting for me with fortex the bodyguard both of them mounted a third horse stood idly by munching at the grass between two mosscovered funeral shrines alongside the road all three beasts were as sleek and fit as any rider could wish we set out at once the sun was no more than an intimation of fiery gold not yet cresting the low hills to the east patches of darkness lingered like vestiges of nights trailing shroud in such uncertain light there was something eerie about that stretch of road flanked on either side by so many tombs of the dead the appian way itself is as smooth as a tabletop with polygonal paving stones fitted so tightly that not a grain of sand could be passed between them there is something reassuring about the solid immutability of a roman road meto once told me of venturing on a reconnaissance mission into the wild woods of gaul alien gods seemed to peer from gnarled roots lemures flitted among shadows unseen creatures scurried amid moldering leaves then in a place where he never expected it meto came upon a road built at caesars instigation a gleaming ribbon of stone cutting through the heart of the forest letting in fresh air and sunlight the appian way is surrounded not by wilderness but by tombs for miles along either side some monuments are large and elaborate like miniature temples others are no more than a simple marker an upright stone pole with a bit of engraving some freshscrubbed and beautifully tended surrounded by flowers and shrubbery others have fallen into disrepair with columns knocked askew and cracked foundations choked by weeds even in broad daylight there is something melancholy about a trip down the appian way in that tenuous predawn light where unsettled spirits seemed to lurk in the shadows the road beneath our feet meant more than roman order and ingenuity it was a path by which the living could traverse the city of the dead every clop of our horses hooves against the stones was a note of reassurance that we were just passing through we came to the shrine of publius clodius set among those of his ancestors the last time i had traveled any great length on the appian way it had been to investigate the murder of clodius he had been the darling and the hope of the urban rabble his assassination sparked riots in rome a mob with torches made the senate house his funeral pyre desperate for order the senate had called on pompey and the great one had used emergency powers to instigate what he called judicial reforms the result had been the prosecution and exile of a great many powerful men who now saw in caesar their only hope to ever return the ruling class was irreparably fragmented the rabble more disaffected than ever in hindsight was the murder of clodius on the appian way the true beginning of civil war the opening skirmish the first casualty his shrine was simple as befitted a patrician with pretensions to the common touch atop a plain pedestal sat a tenfoottall marble stele carved with sheaves of wheat a reminder of the grain dole that clodius established the sun cleared the hills by the growing light i was able to see that the pedestal was littered all about with humble votive offerings burnt tapers and plugs of incense bouquets of sweet herbs and early spring flowers but there was also a pile of something that looked and smelled like human excrement and a graffito smeared in the same stuff on the base of the pedestal clodius fucked his sister tiro wrinkled his nose fortex barked out a laugh we rode on a little farther on the opposite side of the road we passed the pompeius family plot the tomb of pompeys father was a gaudy elaborate affair all the gods of olympus were crowded into the pediment as if jealous of the honor painted in lifelike colors and surrounded by a gilded border that glimmered red in the rays of the rising sun the tomb looked recently painted and refurbished but lately neglected weeds had grown about the base in the time since pompey and his household had fled south otherwise everything seemed perfect until i noticed that heaps of horse dung easy enough to collect on the road had been deposited on the bronze roof by midmorning of a sunny day as this promised to be travelers would smell the shrine to the elder pompey long before they saw it fortex snickered outrageous muttered tiro when i was young men fought for power just as viciously as they do today but nobody would have dared to desecrate a tomb not even as an act of war what must the gods think we deserve whatever misery they thrust upon us here you climb up there and get rid of that stuff who me said fortex yes do it at once fortex made a face then dismounted muttering and looked about for something to use as a shovel while we waited i let my horse wander idly along the edge of the road looking for tender grass amid the tombs of the pompeii i shut my eyes feeling the warmth of morning sunlight on my eyelids and enjoying the casual uncontrolled movements of the beast beneath me behind me i heard the slave climb onto the brazen roof then the sound of scraping followed by the soft impact of dung hitting the road i must have dozed the moment slid out of ordinary time when i opened my eyes before me i saw the tomb of numerius pompeius it was a simple stele of the readymade sort engraved with a horses head symbol of deaths departure it was a little way off the road behind a row of more conspicuous tombs compared to its neighbors it was small and insignificant i would never have noticed it passing by on the road how strange that the horse should have brought me directly to it and that the first thing i should see when i opened my eyes were the words newly chiseled in the narrow fiveline space reserved for personalizing the monument numerius pompeius gift of the gods who jealously reclaimed him after twentythree years among the living those words would have come from his mother having no one else to blame for his death maecia blamed the gods i felt a twinge of shame i looked down it was not so inexplicable after all that my mount had wandered to this spot at the foot of the stele someone maecia of course had planted flowers not yet budding the horse found the tender foliage to his liking and had already eaten most of it to the ground i pulled on the rein and scolded him at the same moment i saw a movement from the corner of my eye a figure emerged from behind a nearby monument my heart lurched inside my chest the shadows had lifted with the dawn but something uncanny seemed still to lurk amid the tombs perversely it seemed somehow appropriate that the lemur of numerius would emerge from the underworld to confront me just as birds began to sing and the whole world stirred to life but the ragged creature who emerged from behind the monument was not a lemur nor were the others three at least who quickly joined him i wheeled my horse about in the difficult space between the crowded monuments tiro i shouted bandits certain stretches of the appian way are notoriously unsafe the area around the tomb of basilius situated far beyond the city wall and marking the true beginning of the countryside is especially dangerous i myself had been ambushed there once and kidnapped but we had not gone nearly that far and i had never heard of bandits this close to the capena gate how desperate men were these and how little order was left in rome that they should dare to attack travelers practically within shouting distance of the city it was our own fault tiro should never have sent our single bodyguard on a fools errand to shovel horse dung i should never have shut my eyes and allowed my horse to wander the bandits saw us lower our guard and decided to strike i frantically attempted to guide my mount back onto the road just a moment before i had been scolding him for eating maecias flowers now he balked confused a hand gripped my ankle i kicked and lost my balance i swayed nearly fell and grazed my head against a stone obelisk another hand gripped my foot i turned and saw an ugly gaptoothed face glaring up at me there is a certain look a man has when hes worked himself up to kill if necessary i saw that look in his eyes an instant later a scrap of dung sunhardened to make a suitable missile struck the man square between the eyes he gave a squeal and released his grip on me finally sure of himself my mount galloped between the monuments and onto the road tiro was wheeling about a long dagger in his hand fortex gave a whoop leaped off the roof of the shrine and mounted his horse in a single fluid motion one of the bandits came up behind him the startled horse kicked the man in the chest he flew through the air like a thrown doll struck his head against the wall of the shrine and crumpled lifeless to the ground they came at us from both sides of the road a gang of ten men at least maybe more in the next instant they might have swarmed over us and pulled us from our horses but they seemed to have no leader and the sight of one of their number lying dead caused them to hesitate as one the three of us turned our horses and set off with a great clattering of hooves some of the bandits ran after us one of them managed to grab tiros ankle i saw a glint of steel felt drops of blood strike my face and heard a scream that rapidly receded i turned my head the stricken man stood clutching his arm several of his companions kept running after us none of them seemed to have weapons except stones one of which struck fortexs mount on the rump the beast neighed and lurched but never slowed its pace one by one the men gave up the chase i watched them grow distant and dwindle like the capena gate beyond them like the shrines of clodius and the elder pompey the stele of numerius pompeius was lost amid so many others alongside me fortex suddenly laughed and gave a whoop a moment later tiro broke into a grin and did the same what excuse had they for joy what had just occurred could be read as an omen and a very bad omen at that only moments into a journey of many days we had let down our guard and very nearly lost out lives the gods had pointed me to the tomb of numerius pompeius and then unleashed a desperate horde upon us it had been a grim episode ending in bloodshed and death but the exhilaration was contagious a moment later i began to laugh and whoop along with them it was the morning of a new day the sun shone brightly across the fields and we were alive not only alive but putting rome behind us leaving behind numeriuss mourning mother and his pregnant lover leaving behind my weeping daughter and scolding wife leaving behind the glum shopkeepers and the daily panics in the forum shaking off the chilly gloom of the city and galloping into the future with the bracing wind in our faces i knew that such a feeling of freedom couldnt last it never does but i knew too that it might be the last time i ever tasted such exhilaration i urged my horse to gallop even faster i drew ahead of tiro and fortex until i had the illusion of being alone on the road a single rider invincible unrestrainable i threw back my head and cried out to heaven past the tomb of basilius we slackened our pace to rest the horses as the plain began to slope upward into the foothills of mount alba we came to the village of bovillae and passed the spot where clodius had been killed the terrain grew hillier the way less straight we passed the road leading up to clodiuss fortresslike mountain villa never to be finished now the place where i first met mopsus and androcles in the town of aricia we obtained fresh mounts at the local stable where tiro produced an official document a diplomatic couriers passport signed by pompey himself and stamped with the great ones seal ring the piece of parchment entitled the bearer to exchange horses at no charge by order of the senates emergency decree while tiro haggled over the quality of horses the stabler offered in exchange i heard my stomach growling and noticed there was a tavern across the way crossing the road i looked toward the hills and caught a glimpse of the villa of senator sextus tedius where the secret of clodiuss death had been revealed to me over stale bread and mutton stew i struck up a conversation with a local freeholder i asked him what old senator tedius was up to gone off to fight with pompey the man said you must be mistaken i said sextus tedius is far too old and feeble the mans a cripple no mistake citizen said the man laughing hes left his spinster daughter in charge of the villa and gone off to war i know that for a fact because before he left he called everyone together at the town forum and made a long speech saying we all ought to do the same and shame on any man who stayed behind and us no more than farmers and the planting season almost on us who does he think feeds the soldiers crazy old coot the man shook his head and lowered his voice maybe things will be different when its caesar in charge what do you think citizen past mount alba the way sloped steadily downward as twilight was falling tiro led us off the main road to a trading post called forum appii on the edge of the pontine marshes i thought he intended to seek accommodations for the night the couriers passport entitled its bearers to room and board as well as fresh horses but we rode past several inns and didnt stop until the road ended at the terminus of a broad canal where a cluster of buildings included warehouses stables a tavern and a boarding platform for the canal barge tiro explained that the canal ran through the marshes with an elevated road alongside it the barge was a long flat vessel with a waisthigh railing all around it was pulled by a team of mules on the road guided by boatmen with stout poles theres a pen for livestock at the back of the barge so we can bring the horses with us tiro explained well pay our fare get settled on board and set out at nightfall well eat dinner at our leisure and travel while we sleep in the morning well be almost to tarracina rested and ready to push onto formiae its the most civilized way in the world to travel it sounded reasonable enough there were only a few drawbacks that tiro failed to mention such as the exorbitant price of bread and wine at every nearby tavern provisions sold on the barge turned out to be even more expensive and doubled in price after it started moving the crammed conditions the ticket seller kept loading more and more passengers until the head boatman finally drove away some of the latecomers saying they might swamp the vessel the incompetence of the mule driver who took an hour to hitch up his team after the last passenger was boarded the near impossibility of eating amid the combined smells of swamp and barnyard the animals were penned at the rear and the wind was at our backs the invisible buzzing insects gnats in the nose midges in the eyes the torturous sleeping conditions everyone side by side and head to toe like corpses laid out after a battle except that corpses do not fart snore or drunkenly sing all night and the sheer perversity of the boatmen who seemed to think it amusing if they could jolt everyone awake every few minutes by banging the barge against the side of the canal and even better if they could get us well and truly snagged which meant an hour of hammering banging and yelling back and forth in the darkest hour of the night i managed to get about an hour of sleep that night when we docked the next morning i stumbled off with everyone else to bathe at a spring in a nearby grove sacred to the nymph feronia patron goddess of freedmen the water revived me a little then we were off again at tarracina we rejoined the appian way i felt the pains of the previous days ride in my buttocks and thighs and so did fortex i think for i kept seeing him wince and scowl perhaps he was simply testing ferocious faces in case we encountered more bandits tiro well broken in to the rigors of travel was in high spirits in a matter of hours he would see cicero we arrived at formiae that afternoon tiro not wanting to be observed avoided the town and the main road to ciceros villa instead we took an alternative route through uncleared woodland the road dwindled to a bridle path the path to a trail the trail to a faint trace amid briars and brambles twilight was falling shadows gathered in the woods i feared we might become lost but tiro knew the way just as the sun was sinking we emerged from the woods into a vineyard beyond the vines i caught glimpses of a handsome villa with white walls and a red roof there was a little covered porch along the back of the house where a man in a long white tunic sat with a scroll on his lap he was turned sideways in his chair with a hand raised instructing a young slave where to hang a lamp so that he might continue reading the slave saw us approaching through the vineyards he gave a shout and pointed the man turned about and rose with a start the scroll tumbled to his feet and unfurled i had never before seen such a look of panic on any mans face nor such a complete transformation when he recognized his visitors he smiled and laughed and strode out to greet us leaving the slave to gather up the scroll we had arrived at ciceros retreat xiii after the travails of the night barge the simple accommodations at ciceros villa seemed luxurious beyond measure i suspected that our host and his family left to themselves that night would have eaten only casually but for our arrival a formal dinner was hastily prepared we dined on couches in a spacious room off the central garden and cicero gave me the place of honor to his left ciceros wife terentia seemed to be in a foul mood and said little except to give orders to the serving girls young marcus not quite sixteen had been out hunting all day with the manager of the estate and ate ravenously the years of my increasing estrangement from cicero had coincided with the boys growth to manhood and i would hardly have recognized him tullias appetite was as voracious as her younger brothers and cicero made a joke of it saying his daughter was eating for two her pregnancy was beginning to show and cicero seemed rather pleased to show her off a grandchild is a grandchild his expression seemed to say even if the marriage had taken place behind his back and the father was a dissolute wastrel and a partisan of caesar every time i looked at the girl with her beaming face and gently swollen belly i thought of aemilia back in rome the food was simple but better than anything i had eaten for quite some time in rome where fresh meat and spices were hard to come by young marcus had killed two rabbits that day and they provided the main course there was also asparagus stewed in raisin wine and a chickpea soup heavily spiced with black pepper and dill weed the talk was simple as well mostly about our journey marcus was especially eager for details of the ambush outside the city tiro described the skirmish and praised fortex who was off eating in the kitchen the man saved gordianuss life i have no doubt its true i said one of the wretches was about to pull me off my horse when your man fortex threw a piece of hardened dung from the roof of the shrine he must have been what at least thirty feet away struck the bandit right between the eyes young marcus laughed and clapped his hands cicero shrugged the slave did no more than he should have hes a bodyguard after all when i bought him i was assured he had quick reflexes and excellent aim i made a wise purchase after the sleepless night on the barge and the long days ride i was exhausted as soon as the dessert of aniseed cakes with raisins had been offered to everyone i excused myself a slave showed me to my room and helped me change into a sleeping tunic i fell onto the bed and was asleep almost at once as happens sometimes on a journey my sleep was easily disrupted i suddenly woke needing to pass water and having no idea what time it was my little room was pitchdark and i assumed i had slept for hours but when i opened my door hoping for a bit of stray moonlight to help me locate my chamber bowl i saw light from an open door across the garden i heard low voices someone was still up i found the chamber bowl and relieved myself i went back to bed but was no longer sleepy after a while i got up and opened my door again the light still shone from the room across the way i heard quiet laughter i stepped out of my room under the shadow of the colonnade i peered across the moonlit garden the room opposite mine was evidently ciceros study by the flickering light of the brazier within i could see a pigeonhole bookcase stuffed with scrolls one voice was ciceros the other tiros the two of them were up late talking probably sharing a bit of midnight wine all their lives they had been master and slave then statesman and secretary now spymaster and spy no doubt they had a great deal to catch up on the night was still ciceros trained orators voice carried like a bell on the crisp air i distinctly heard my name tiro said something in response but his voice carried less clearly and i didnt catch it they both laughed then were silent for a while i imagined them sipping from their cups when cicero spoke again his tone was serious do you think he knows who killed numerius i strained to hear tiros reply but caught only a mumble but he must know something said cicero why else is he going all the way to brundisium with you to see pompey ah but is he going to brundisium said tiro somewhere between here and there is caesar said cicero and with caesar gordianuss son meto i see your point what is gordianus up to does it really matter i heard the shrug in tiros voice i dont like surprises tiro ive had far too many over the past year tullias marriage to dolabella caesar crossing the rubicon this unsavory business with numerius pompeius no more nasty shocks especially not from gordianus find out what he knows tiro he may know nothing gordianus always knows more than he lets on hes hiding something from you im sure of it i heard footsteps and drew back into the shadows a slave crossed the garden carrying something in each hand and went into the study good the extra lamps cicero exclaimed light yours tiro and i shall light mine every year that passes my eyes grow weaker there now we have light enough to read have a look at this latest letter from pompey nothing but a long rant against domitius ahenobarbus for losing corfinium the glow from the open doorway was strong enough now to dispel the concealing shadows of the colonnade i stepped back into my room so as not to be seen by the departing slave i lay on the bed and closed my eyes thinking to rest for just a moment before going back to listen and slept until noon of the following day i woke to the smell of roasting pork an hour earlier another guest had arrived at ciceros villa accompanied by a sizable retinue cicero had ordered a pig butchered to feed the lot of them after i splashed my face with water and dressed i found my way to the roasting pit behind the house where a crowd of men passed a wineskin and watched the carcass as it was slowly turned on a spit they appeared to be a ragtag bodyguard of freedmen and slaves their tents pitched outside the house were tattered and patched and their stacks of mismatched weapons and armor looked to be of poor quality some of the men were playing trigon in a clearing by the vineyard young marcus was among them laughing and monopolizing the leather ball an enthusiastic athlete and hunter was quite the opposite of what i would have expected of ciceros son i wondered if his father approved of his consorting with such lowly types i found tiro and asked him what personage worthy of ciceros hospitality had arrived accompanied by such a shabby retinue before tiro could answer i saw the visitor emerge from the little bathhouse connected by a covered walkway to the main building he wore nothing but a large towel wrapped around his waist his florid face and fleshy arms were flushed from the heat his rustcolored beard and the wiry hair on his chest sparkled with beads of water he disappeared into the house but that cant be i began tiro nodded lucius domitius ahenobarbus but i thought caesar captured redbeard at corfinium captured him yes but couldnt hold him or so domitius tells it tiro lowered his voice personally i suspect caesar simply let him go as a gesture of clemency but domitius has his own version of events several versions actually according to cicero in the hour since he arrived hes already told three different tales of his hairbreadth escape im sure he wouldnt mind telling yet another if you care to listen but dont ask him about his botched suicide hes liable to burst into tears i looked at tiro sidelong unable to tell whether he was joking and whatever you do dont mention that im here he went on domitius isnt privy to the secret of your return to italy no we want to keep it that way for now why dont we resume our journey then and get away from here im rested and eager to get started tiro smiled and shook his head cicero may have new instructions for me after hes spoken with domitius well leave tomorrow get some more rest gordianus relax while you can the way between here and brundisium may be hard going a little later cicero and domitius set out on a leisurely ride around the estate to discuss their affairs away from prying ears tiro seemed to vanish young marcus spent the afternoon playing trigon as for me i passed the day pleasantly enough in my hosts study cicero had instructed his slaves to give me access to his library but he also must have warned them that i might snoop for a slave was always present in the room adding columns on a wax tablet or scrolling through a ledger keeping an eye on me i would have preferred to rifle through ciceros correspondence instead i reread the first book of the gallic wars ciceros copy was personally inscribed to m tullius cicero who has expressed approval of the authors prose if not his politics g julius caesar that night while domitiuss bodyguards feasted outside and sang camp songs i was again invited to the formal dining room where i found myself demoted from the place of honor in favor of domitius tiro was not present we dined on the choicest cuts of the roast pig served with a rosemary gravy there was more asparagus marinated in herbs and olive oil and fried carrots tossed with cumin seeds and dressed with a fishpickle sauce that cicero claimed had just been unearthed after fermenting for ten years in a clay jar buried in his cellar domitiuss mood was as changeable as a comet he was boisterous and talkative one moment and sullen the next he behaved as men will who have suffered a rapid series of shocks and reversals he had boldly broken from pompey to make a stand at corfinium then been betrayed to caesar by his own men he had screwed up the courage to kill himself rather than face a humiliating death then learned too late that caesar intended mercy he had wept in the face of certain death then discovered that his physician had given him not poison but a narcotic to calm his nerves he had been captured by caesar then just as abruptly had been released for no matter how often or variously domitius told the story of his escape the truth was evident barely escaped with my life domitius said to me pleased to have two fresh ears for the tale oh caesar pretended that i was free to go but he intended an ambush from the start but why an ambush i asked so that caesar could spare himself the ugly business of executing his legal successor to the governorship of gaul he could claim that the perimeter guard mistook us for deserters and killed me by accident or some such nonsense he offered me a choice first youre free to join with me lucius perhaps i could even post you to gaul with your family connections there you could be of great value as if the decision were his to make as if the senate hadnt already appointed me governor as if gaul were his private kingdom not the property of the senate and people of rome to administer as they please according to the law cicero of course had heard this earlier domitius sensed his waning attention and directed his words chiefly to me and to young marcus sparing hardly a glance for the women i told the scoundrel no absolutely not that i would never serve under him at any time or in any capacity very well he said in that cool supercilious ohsosuperior ohsodisappointed manner he affects run to pompey if you must ill even allow you to take bodyguards no regular soldiers though i cant spare them choose a few from among the freedmen and slaves whove been attending your household in corfinium theyll have to make do with odds and ends i need the best weapons and armor for my own men my own men meaning the cohorts he stole from me soldiers i recruited trained and equipped with my own money so i found a few brave men willing to go with me that night we barely eluded one of caesars scouting parties he must have sent them after us we hid in the brush alongside the road they passed so close i could hear the breath in their nostrils why didnt you fight them asked marcus eagerly and give caesar the satisfaction of tricking me into a battle i couldnt possibly win no i didnt play his game that was always his way with enemies in the senate pretend to want a settlement negotiate the fine points until their eyes glaze over and then he grabbed the carving knife from the serving platter and thrust it into the pork stab them in the back cicero bit the head off a piece of asparagus and nodded in agreement no one has ever been more adept at political chicanery than caesar domitius lapsed into one of his moody silences i saw his lips move engaging in some internal debate or recrimination and wondered what he was rehashing the decision to stand at corfinium the betrayal of his men the bungled suicide but if you left caesar to join with pompey why arent you there asked young marcus innocently youve come in the opposite direction i saw his father wince join pompey why should i do that said domitius without men to command what purpose could i serve pompey can fend for himself does pompey mean to make a stand at brundisium asked marcus or will he sail across the adriatic domitius managed a bitter laugh every man in italy would like to know the answer to that question my boy im afraid that the great one is not in the habit of making his secret strategies known to my humble self but we shall all know soon enough caesar moves with such speed hell be at brundisium in a matter of days then pompey will see what hes up against and without me to help him the fool should have joined me in corfinium that was the place to make a stand cicero shifted uneasily weve all been puzzled by pompeys apparent lack of he plans to head east of course said domitius suddenly that must be what he was planning all along well let him if he can lure caesar into a trap in greece or asia good for him for myself i intend to head for gaul and carry out my duty to the senate governor of gaul they appointed me and governor of gaul i shall be if you go by land wont the way be blocked by troops loyal to caesar asked marcus i intend to take ships if i can find ships to hire and sail directly to massilia the massilians arent like the rest of gaul their citystate was founded by greek colonists hundreds of years ago theyre remarkable people not barbarians like their neighbors but will they welcome you i asked of course they will their treaties are with the senate not with caesar the massilians know caesar theyve had to deal with him all these years during his illegal tenure as governor theyve seen firsthand what caesar is a preening pretender pompous vain covering himself with glory every time he managed to conquer another tribe of dimwits and toothless crones i cleared my throat i happened to be reading his memoir of the gallic wars today you cant deny the mans what his military genius yes i can deny it and i do that book is pure rubbish nothing but nauseating selfglorification from start to finish propaganda posing as history he writes about himself in the third person so insufferably pretentious but did you ever see a book so full of vanity no mention of the great men who came before him who settled the southern coast of gaul and built the roads that got him there no bow to those in the senate who voted against their better judgment to extend his command youd think he won the whole province in a dice game with vercingetorix ill tell you this any competent roman commander given the same resources and advantages that the senate gave to caesar could have accomplished the same thing and probably in less time this was too much even for cicero i think lucius we must give caesar his due in military matters at least domitius scoffed please marcus tullius you can hardly expect me to defer to your judgment of military matters cicero looked at him sourly even so i cleared my throat again actually you misunderstood me domitius i wasnt going to say that you cant deny caesars military genius i was going to say that you cant deny the mans literary genius on the contrary i can deny it and i do said domitius as a stylist hes completely inept an amateur his prose has no ornament no style its as bald as his head they say he dictates from horseback given the grunts he produces i believe it cicero smiled some find caesars lean prose to be elegant rather than undernourished our friend gordianus can be excused for having a prejudice in the matter whatever virtues caesars writing may possess some credit must go to the son of gordianus domitius looked at me blankly i dont follow you cicero gordianuss adopted son meto is rather famous for his editorial services to caesar as important to caesar some say as tiro has been to me comprehension dawned in domitiuss eyes he smiled thinly oh i see youre that gordianus yes i see his smile became a leer but surely cicero you dont mean to suggest that tiro ever performed for you some of the services that one hears this meto performs in private for his beloved commander terentia huffed young marcus tittered tullia drew in a breath and looked at me sympathetically cicero actually blushed had everyone in rome heard and given credence to these rumors about caesar and my son while i ground my teeth and considered how best to answer domitius he moved to another subject very well purely for the sake of argument ill concede that caesar is the military genius his own prose makes him out to be helped along by his starryeyed amanuensis in that case whatever shall become of our pompey do you know i almost hope that caesar does trap pompey in brundisium let him strip the great one of his legions and give him the same slaves choice he gave to me pompey would have to commit suicide after all his blunders there could be no other honorable course then where would we be domitius laced his fingers beneath his chin and stroked his red beard the senate will need another champion a savior from the west not the east the right man could summon pompeys troops from spain and rally the gauls against their wouldbe king massilia would be the ideal place to carry out such a plan dont you think yes rally spain and gaul then march directly into italy a second crossing of the rubicon a second invasion of armed men not to destroy the constitution and the senate but to restore them given proper resources the right man could put that scoundrel caesar on the run domitius fell to ruminating and peered into the middle distance in the meantime what shall i do about my triumph said cicero now theres a dilemma your triumph i said puzzled by the sudden change of subject yes the triumphal procession due to me for my successful military campaigns in cilicia in the normal course of things i should have been voted a triumph by the senate directly upon my return i should have entered the city gates in a chariot with blaring trumpets whats the point of being a provincial governor if theres no triumph at the end of it but of course this hasnt been a normal year i decided to forgo my triumph in light of the crisis but now well i must celebrate it sooner or later i cant postpone it forever but what if caesar drives pompey from italy and then occupies rome if i celebrate my triumph while caesar is in command of the city it may be read as an endorsement of his tyranny i suppose i shouldnt return to rome at all not while caesars there i should make a point of refusing to take my seat in the senate cicero paused for a sip of wine terentia spoke up it was bad enough that you postponed your triumph which may never happen now but what about your sons toga day marcus turns sixteen this year all the best families mark their sons coming of age during the feast of liberalia just after the ides of march will we be back in rome by then to celebrate marcuss majority or not from the way the children cringed i sensed this was an ongoing family argument cicero released a heavy breath you know that would be impossible terentia the liberalia is only twelve days off why must you bring this up you know how fervently i hoped for marcus to celebrate the donning of his manly toga in rome with all the best people in attendance but it cannot be for one thing the best people are scattered to the four corners of the earth for another i cant return to rome with honor not yet and wherever we celebrate his toga day arrangements cant possibly be made in time for the liberalia but the liberalia is the proper day insisted terentia on the feast of father freedom the priests carry the phallus of dionysus from the fields into the city streets and the young men in their manly togas follow behind singing bawdy songs its a religious act the symbol of a boys emergence to manhood in the company of his peers its all right mother really said marcus turning red and frowning at his plate weve discussed this before it doesnt have to be the liberalia another day will do and we can do it in arpinum instead of rome it is the familys hometown hometown to your fathers family marcus said terentia with frost in her voice we can hardly expect your relatives on the terentius side to trek all the way to arpinum with brigands and runaway soldiers stalking the highways besides the villa at arpinum is in no condition to receive visitors the roof leaks the kitchens too small and there arent enough beds at least here in formiae ive managed to get the household up and running surely youre not suggesting that we celebrate his toga day here protested cicero weve no family in the area i scarcely know the members of the local town senate no if not rome then arpinum i dont see why we cant just go back to rome tomorrow tullia sighed and looked to her mother for support everyone else is your cousin gaius returned and my friend aufelia and her husband are on their way back fathers friend atticus never left as the table talk degenerated into a family squabble i waited for a pause in the conversation to excuse myself domitius i noticed paid no attention he held an asparagus spear between his thumb and forefinger and seemed to be interrogating it how pathetic the man seemed with his delusions of military glory and his obsessive jealousy of caesar yet he seemed to me no more pathetic than cicero the great orator reduced to agonizing over his postponed triumph and his sons toga day how irrelevant even ridiculous they both seemed but as i lay in bed that night kept awake by a disagreement between the fishpickle sauce and my stomach i wondered uneasily if i was not as deluded in my own way as cicero and domitius what was the exact relationship between julius caesar and my son once i had thought i understood it but it appeared there might be a complicating factor which i had not accounted for in such parlous times i could not afford such a miscalculation as we continued the journey and grew closer to the camps of caesar and pompey i could afford it even less sleep finally came and with it nightmare there was no narrative only a series of wrenching horrors i had misunderstood something and made a terrible mistake someone was dead i was covered with blood bethesda and diana wore shrouds and wept the ground shook and the sky rained fire i woke drenched with sweat and swore never to touch fishpickle sauce again xiv we set out before dawn i was tired from lack of sleep and my stomach was out of sorts but tiro was in high spirits i take it you didnt have the fishpickle sauce last night i said did cicero break open a new jar he must have been trying to impress domitius no i ate simple fare nothing but millet porridge and roast pork off the spit you ate outside with domitiuss men of course how else could i have gathered information from them i posed as a freedman attached to the villa you spied on domitius i thought he was ciceros ally i didnt spy on him i simply talked to his men they had a lot to say about the morale of domitiuss former troops the size of caesars forces the condition of the roads and so on what about the ambush caesar supposedly set for domitius after letting him go tiro smiled according to the men there was an incident a mail carrier passed them on the road just outside corfinium a mail carrier yes a lone man on horseback domitius panicked he made his men hide in the bushes they thought he might die of a heart attack the ambush was entirely in his imagination rather like the welcome thats waiting for him in massilia i suspect a sphinxlike expression crossed tiros face i wouldnt be too surprised if the massilians welcome him with open arms open hands anyway what do you mean tiro slowed his mount and let fortex ride ahead i appreciate your discretion last night gordianus you said nothing to domitius about me even when my name was mentioned i only did as you asked and i thank you i would appreciate it if you could be just as discreet about domitiuss visit to cicero cicero wants it kept secret why he has his reasons i snorted cicero wont join pompey he doesnt want it known that hes hosted domitius is he so fearful of offending caesar tiro grimaced its not that all right ill tell you domitius didnt leave corfinium emptyhanded he was stripped of his legions yes but not of his gold when domitius arrived in corfinium he deposited six million sesterces in the city treasury most of it was public money he brought from rome for military expenses caesar could have seized it for himself but i suppose he doesnt want to be seen as a thief he returned the entire amount to domitius when he set him free i sucked in a breath you mean domitius and that ragtag retinue are transporting six million sesterces in trunks loaded in wagons you see now why he was so suspicious of caesar and so fearful on the road what will he do with all that money return it to the treasury in rome tiro laughed hell use it to go to massilia and win over the massilians of course but you see why cicero doesnt want his visit made public if the money vanishes and who knows what might happen in the coming days and the trail leads back to formiae someone might presume that domitius left it here with cicero for safekeeping these are desperate times that kind of rumor could draw cutthroats like grasshoppers to the green leaf whole households have been slaughtered for considerably less than six million sesterces gordianus cicero isnt ashamed of playing host to domitius and he isnt fearful for himself but he has his family to think of surely you can understand that that day we rode fortyfour miles and reached capua the next day we covered thirtythree miles and stopped at beneventum at various stables along the way tiro exchanged our horses always producing his couriers passport signed by pompey some stablers honored it without question others treated us with barely concealed contempt and tried to give us inferior mounts one stabler refused to deal with us at all he took a long look at the document gave us a cold stare and told us to move on tiro was furious do you realize the penalty for flouting a document issued under the senates ultimate decree he asked the man the penalty is death the stabler swallowed hard but said nothing we went in search of another stable after a good nights sleep in beneventum tiro decided that we should leave the appian way and strike out on an old mountain road that cut directly west to east across the apennines a shortcut tiro called it he insisted that we exchange our horses for a wagon and a slave to drive it the stabler in beneventum wrinkled his nose when he saw pompeys seal on the document he tried to resist the trade but tiro was in no mood to haggle at last the man gave us a wagon with a canvas top and a toothless slave to drive it the wagon seemed unnecessary to me saddlebags were adequate for our provisions and our progress on steep winding roads would be faster on horseback as we set out that morning i said as much to tiro he shook his head and pointed toward the dull gray clouds that wreathed the mountaintops later that day his judgment was confirmed a few miles into the foothills the sky opened and poured rain then sleet then hail while we sat in the covered wagon bundled in dry blankets the miserable driver shivered and sneezed and urged the horses on the storm grew worse until at last we had to stop at a little inn beside the road we spent the night there and the next three fretful days as well as the storm continued to howl and bluster recriminations were pointless but i still felt obliged to suggest to tiro that we would have done better to stay on the appian way he said the same storm would likely have trapped us no matter what route we took and we were lucky to have found a snug place to pass the time to combat the tedium the innkeeper had a small library of wellworn scrolls trashy greek novels and dubious erotic poetry as well as a supply of board games after three days i decided i could die happy if i never read another story of shipwrecked lovers i envied fortex and the wagon driver who both seemed content to sleep day and night in the stable like hibernating bears occasionally over a game of circus maximus or pharaohs down the nile i sensed that tiro was trying to draw me out following ciceros instructions to discover my intentions and any secrets i might know about the death of numerius pompeius as subtly as i could i always deflected him and changed the subject at last the storm passed a full day of travel brought us to the eastern slopes of the mountains we slept that night at an inn nestled amid rocky bluffs and pine forests the following morning watching the sunrise from the window of our room on the upper floor i glimpsed a smudge of silver and blue in the distance that tiro declared to be the adriatic it was our eleventh day out of rome the sky was cloudless we set out with the wagon uncovered after an hour or so descending through a narrow mountain pass we encountered the soldiers we heard them first the low booming of marching drums echoed up through the folds of the mountain tiro told the wagon driver to stop i listened closely along with the drums i heard the stamp of feet and a muffled clatter of armor tiro and i left the driver and fortex in the wagon we climbed to the top of a rocky knob and gazed down thousands of men were marching up from the coastal plain their helmets in the morning sunlight merged into a glittering ribbon that snaked sinuously up the mountainside over crests through saddles around bends filling the width of the road as water fills a river channel caesars men or pompeys i said tiro squinted im not sure i know the insignia of every cohort and legion but theyre not close enough for me to tell they soon will be at the speed theyre marching there must be thousands of them the column goes on for miles i cant see the end of it i looked back at the wagon i suppose well have to pull off the road as best we can and wait for the whole army to pass that could take all day tiro fretfully shook his head what does it mean they dont have the look of a defeated army thats for sure too disciplined too many of them if theyre pompeys men they cant have reached the mountains without encountering caesar that can only mean that caesars been defeated pompeys crushed him and now pompey and the senators who fled are heading back to rome the crisis is over if this is pompey i nodded wondering what that would mean to davus to meto the tramping and clattering grew louder moment by moment booming and bouncing across the rarefied mountain air until it seemed to emanate from the empty sky like constant thunder and if theyre caesars men i asked tiro shook his head i dont know maybe pompey escaped from brundisium before caesar could reach him and now caesar has turned back emptyhanded or did caesar trap him there annihilate his forces and then turn back toward rome but there cant have been time enough for a siege it makes no sense these must be pompeys men he sucked in a breath numas balls tiro cursed so rarely that i stared at him in wonder his face was ashen of course not pompeys men and not caesars either tiro youre making no sense there do you see those advance scouts riding ahead of the rest see the band of polished copper around their helmets i squinted i cant quite im sure of it a copper band and the officers will have copper disks on their breastplates showing a lions head domitius owns copper mines these are his cohorts the men who betrayed him in corfinium coming after domitius to claim lost pay i suggested tiro was not amused perhaps theyve turned against caesar but no surely theyd be marching to join pompey if that were the case he looked frantically back at the wagon where the driver and fortex stared up at us perplexed infernal pluto theres no way we can hide the wagon the roads hemmed by boulders and trees and we havent passed a branch road for miles he shook his head i should have traded the driver and wagon for horses this morning on horseback we might have had some chance to hide ourselves does it matter we could simply be innocent travelers crossing the mountains on this road gordianus there are no innocent travelers he seemed close to panic i tried to calm him well hide among the rocks tiro the driver can stay with the wagon and tell them hes traveling alone the driver would tell them everything at the first rattle of a sword take the driver with us then and leave an abandoned wagon by the side of the road that would be even more suspicious theyd be sure to search for us then and theyd find us in minutes how would that look four men with something to hide skulking in the woods youre right we have no choice but to stay with the wagon when the advance scouts arrive well wave and smile and remark on what fine weather were having tiro took a deep breath youre right we must simply brazen it out youll be the master and ill be your slave why shouldnt you be heading for caesars camp you have a son under his command yes thats the story all the better because its partly true first i suggest we leave this hilltop peering down at them like this it makes us look like spies dont you think he managed a crooked smile start back without me i need to relieve myself go ahead dont be shy he winced no gordianus its not my bladder a fright like this it goes straight to my bowels tiro hurried into the woods i cast a final look at the endless stream of men pouring up the mountain then scrambled down the hillside and rejoined the others tiro arrived at the wagon just before the first scout on horseback came through the pass the soldier rode slowly toward us warily scanning the trees and boulders behind us he stopped several paces away he noted the iron ring on my finger who are you citizen what business do you have on this road my name is gordianus im traveling from rome are you one of caesars men ill ask the questions citizen who are these others the driver comes with the wagon i hired both from his master at an inn on the other side of the mountains we weathered a nasty storm let me tell you may the gods grant you fairer skies than we had and these others slaves that ones a bodyguard as you can tell by the look of him a good thing i brought him along we werent a mile out of rome when some bandits attacked us would have killed us if they had the chance im sure but we havent had a bit of trouble since and the dark one another slave a philosopher his name is soscarides the scout looked at us disdainfully he was the sort who had little use for civilians you still havent stated your purpose for being on this road i looked at the copper band around his helmet and cleared my throat he and his fellows had once been loyal to domitius now he had sworn allegiance to caesar or so we presumed what if we were wrong what if domitiuss troops had turned on their new master caesar might be dead for all we knew and these troops might be marching back to rome with his head on a stake but i had to give the man an answer i thought of the gamblers in the salacious tavern back in rome casting dice and crying caesar for luck and i took a deep breath i have a son in caesars service on his personal staff soscarides here was the boys tutor when he was young call me soft but i cant stand the worry any longer cant stand waiting idly in rome for news so here i am youre looking for caesar then yes the man looked at me sternly for a long moment then came to a decision he smiled just keep following the road then citizen youll find him his tone changed as completely as his face like an actor putting aside a mask at brundisium thats the rumor along the road he smiled but didnt answer he was ready to be friendly but not that friendly a second scout rode up the two of them withdrew to the far side of the road and conferred casting glances at us the second scout rode on the first returned you might as well get comfortable if you can youll be here for a bit some troops will be marching past are there many he laughed youll see ill stay here with you until the head of the column arrives no need for you to answer the same questions for my commander hell decide whether or not to cut your heads off he grinned to let me know it was a joke i glanced at fortex who snorted to show that he wasnt impressed tiro looked calm philosophical even the driver looked nervous the column came up through the pass we saw horsehaircrested helmets first then the officers who wore them mounted atop magnificent chargers they were followed by drummers the steady tattoo of the marching beat reverberated between the steep hillsides the officer wearing the helmet with the most elaborate crest signaled to the others to proceed while he broke from the column and cantered over to the wagon a lions head roared from the copper disk on his breastplate report he said to the scout who saluted him crisply a traveler from rome and three slaves cohort commander the mans name is gordianus the officer looked at me keenly gordianus why does that sound familiar he says he has a son on caesars personal staff of course gordianus meto the freedman i met him in corfinium so youre metos father are you you dont look a thing like him but of course you wouldnt would you im marcus otacilius cohort commander what in hades are you doing here im eager to see my son is he well well enough when i last saw him hes not with you then is this not caesars army this is caesars army yes every man you see has sworn allegiance to gaius julius caesar while caesar tends to business down on the coast hes dispatched these cohorts to sicily to secure his interests there it was exactly the sort of strategic decision that caesar would make not to immediately test the loyalty of troops acquired from a hostile general by throwing them into the chase after pompey but to post them elsewhere my son is with caesar then where are they otacilius hesitated then nodded to the scout ride on ill handle this the scout saluted and galloped toward the head of the column soldiers poured through the pass in endless rows and proceeded up the mountain winter cloaks thrown behind them like capes scale armor glinting across their chests the officer smiled i dont suppose theres any harm telling you what caesars up to hes already the driver suddenly jumped from the wagon spun about and pointed at us theyre lying otaciliuss horse cantered skittishly startled by the sudden movement even before he gave a signal with his hand two rows of men broke from the passing column in the space of a heartbeat the wagon was circled by a ring of spears otacilius regained control of his mount he looked from me to the toothless driver what is this about theyre lying the driver pointed at tiro that ones up to something my master back in beneventum told me to keep an eye on him he carries some sort of document with the seal of pompey the great the officer looked at me coolly is this true i felt hackles rise on the back of my neck i opened my mouth wondering how to answer tiro spoke up master may i speak for myself please do soscarides he addressed the officer that worthless driver is the liar he and i have been quarreling ever since my master hired him from the stabler in beneventum hes got a grudge against me thinks i have it too easy because i stayed dry while he was wet and miserable driving through the mountains i think the cold must have settled in his brain give him a few lashes and see if he sticks to his tale the drivers mouth formed a toothless circle of outrage no no theyre all pompeys men i tell you my master said so he didnt like giving them the wagon but he had to on account of that document the lying one carries search him if you dont believe me the officer looked genuinely distressed he and i shared a bond of friendship through meto but only if i was telling the truth about being metos father what do you have to say about this document gordianus i looked at tiro by hercules soscarides what is the slave talking about tiro looked back at me calmly i have no idea master let the officer search me if it pleases him i shall have to search you all im afraid otacilius confiscated our weapons first tiro and i each carried a dagger and fortex carried two we were forbidden to leave the wagon while the soldiers sorted through our saddlebags they found nothing of interest then we were made to stand in the wagon and strip off our garments layer by layer our loincloths as well i asked trying to play the outraged citizen im afraid so said otacilius wincing he turned his head and caught some of the troops sniggering as they passed by eyes straight ahead he barked i stood naked and held up my empty palms as you can see cohort commander i have nothing to hide nor do the two slaves otacilius looked appropriately chagrined return their clothing what do you say to this he barked at the driver who quailed in speechless confusion i felt better with my loincloth covering me i pulled my tunic over my head i only hope cohort commander as compensation for this embarrassment that youll lend me adequate men and appropriate utensils to see that the lying driver is appropriately punished no the man wailed return me to my master in beneventum only he has the right to punish me nonsense i said sternly you were let to me along with the wagon while youre in my service i have every right to chastise you actually for deceiving an officer of the roman army in time of military crisis this slave is liable to be executed by military law and his master fined at the very least said otacilius coldly i felt a stab of pity for the cringing driver who was now the one ringed by soldiers with spears if only he had kept his mouth shut no wait he lunged desperately toward otacilius one of the soldiers gave him a vicious poke with his spear a blossom of blood stained his shoulder he clutched the wound and wailed up on that knob the two of them climbed up there before the troops arrived spying on you theres no crime in curiosity said otacilius but dont you see thats when they must have hidden the document or destroyed it they saw you coming and they got rid of it go look up on that hill youll find it there tiro rolled his eyes in disgust the lying slave will have you searching every stretch of road from here back to beneventum if you listen to him stupid lout perhaps if you stop lying and tell the truth the cohort commander will at least allow you a quick and merciful death otacilius worked his jaw back and forth and stared at me i played the affronted citizen and stared back at him i realized that he had not given back our daggers that meant he had not made up his mind about us at last he called another row of troops from the column you men go search that hilltop bring back anything you find that a traveler might have left there any sort of bag or pouch and any scrap of parchment no matter how small or burnt surely they would find nothing i thought tiro had been with me atop the knob he hadnt mentioned the couriers passport and i hadnt seen him hide it the only sign of a human that the soldiers were likely to come across i thought ruefully was the deposit left by tiro when he stole away to relieve himself i suddenly realized that tiro had not lingered behind on account of his nervous bowels he had gone off to dispose of the document parchment burns easily parchment could also be torn ground underfoot chewed even swallowed but had tiro destroyed it beyond trace or merely hidden it thinking to retrieve it after caesars troops passed by i avoided looking at him fearful that my expression might give me away instead i watched the soldiers scramble up the hillside at last i could stand it no longer i glanced in tiros direction in the instant our eyes met i knew as surely as if he had spoken that he had not obliterated the document but had only hidden it my heart sank i drew a deep breath perhaps i thought the soldiers would be content to search the bare hilltop but i knew it was a vain hope these men were trained to follow tracks watch for signs of passage ferret out hiding places their commander had ordered them to search and retrieve that was what they would do tiro fortex and i stood in the wagon and waited the driver clutched his wounded shoulder and sobbed row after row of soldiers marched past i felt the suspense one feels in the theater awaiting a reversal of fortune at last the soldiers came scrambling down the hillside they had found not one artifact but several what roman road is without litter there was part of a castoff shoe chewed on by some animal with pointed teeth there was a bit of ivory which appeared to be a broken strigil used for scraping oneself clean at the baths there was a tattered scrap of cloth which might once have been a childs soiled discarded loincloth the most valuable find was an old greek drachma the silver tarnished black we also found this cohort commander it was rolled up tight and stuffed between some rocks on the far side of the hill the soldier handed a piece of parchment to otacilius who unrolled it his face grew long a couriers passport he said quietly issued by authority of the ultimate decree signed by pompey himself stamped with his seal ring otacilius peered at me above the parchment how do you explain this gordianus if in fact you are gordianus xv row after row of soldiers marched past face after face peered sidelong at us some scornful some merely curious a few even looked at us with pity we must have made a sorry sight four men with arms bound behind their backs tethered to one another by their ankles being led down the mountain in single file along the side of the road by a cohort commander on horseback a foot soldier followed behind using his spear for a prod the wagon driver was hindmost in the group the wound at his shoulder had rendered him faint and weak he had a hard time keeping up the footpath alongside the paved road was rough and uneven occasionally he stumbled sending a jerk through the tether that connected our ankles making fortex trip forward into tiro who tripped forward into me the foot soldier would prod at the stumbling slave with his spear the slave would let out a yelp the soldiers marching past would laugh as if we were performing a roadside mime show for their amusement otacilius peered at me over his shoulder occasionally his face inscrutable another tether connected the two of us one end tied around my throat the other wound around his forearm and clutched in his fist despite my best efforts to keep up and maintain some slack in the tether my neck was soon wrenched and sore the flesh chafed and raw i was lucky to still have a head connected to my shoulders we might have died within moments after otacilius discovered our lies we were an unexpected anomaly encountered on the road a hindrance to the armys progress a problem to be disposed of he might have had us all executed where we stood as soon as the passport from pompey was produced i braced myself for that possibility to avoid the horror of it i let a great tide of recriminations flood my thoughts if only tiro had had the sense to destroy the passport rather than hide it if only we had stayed on the appian way instead of taking tiros shortcut if only we had dragged the driver into the woods and cut out his tongue before the first scout arrived if only we had left the wagon behind that morning and the driver with it the list of regrets circled endlessly in my mind as we trudged downhill the monotony interrupted only by the occasional stumble by the driver followed by more stumbling up the line and a jerk at the tether around my throat then the squeal of the driver as he was poked and the laughter of the soldiers passing by who are those wretches said one soldier spies said another what will they do to them hang them upside down and flay them alive that elicited a squeal of terror from the wagon driver who stumbled again the humiliating sequence repeated itself the passing soldiers howled with laughter not even the most stumblebum troupe of alexandrian mimes could have put on a funnier show what did otacilius intend to do with us the fact that he hadnt yet killed us offered some hope or did it he assumed we were spies spies knew secrets secrets might be valuable therefore we might be valuable but i suspected that the roman military in regard to spies like the roman judiciary in regard to slaves recognized only one credible means of obtaining secrets through torture we had been spared our lives but toward what end we were being led down the mountain toward the rear of the army but for what purpose i found it easier to scroll mentally through endless recriminations and regrets than to contemplate those questions gordianus tiro whispered behind me when we arrive wherever theyre taking us silence otacilius looked over his shoulder and glared down at us a crueler man might have given a wrench to the tether around my throat for good measure but i saw that his gaze was clouded by doubt if i was the man i claimed to be then i was the father of a personal confidant of caesar a man otacilius knew on the other hand i had lied about the couriers passport which linked us directly to pompey and if the wagon driver was truthful tiro was not my slave soscarides but the actual leader of our little traveling party had i lied about being metos father as well otacilius faced a dilemma his soldiers instinct was to pass the dilemma along to someone higher up it occurred to me that i might possibly escape with my neck intact if i kept doggedly proclaiming my identity but only if i betrayed tiro how else to explain the passport once he was known to be tiro higher ranking officers could probably be called forward to identify him despite his disguised appearance as ciceros secretary tiro was well known in the forum what would be done to him would he be released as domitius had been released and sent back to cicero unharmed i doubted it tiro was not domitius he was a citizen and a member of a senators household but only by dint of having been manumitted by cicero what would be done to a former slave traveling incognito as a spy who had brazenly lied to a roman officer i couldnt believe that he would simply be set free this vexing train of doubts and apprehensions served at least to keep my mind off the more and more frequent stumbling from behind the tug of the tether at my neck and the raucous laughter of the marching soldiers i was weary and thirsty my head buzzed as if there were a swarm of bees inside it down and down we trudged until at last we arrived at a broad high meadow that overlooked the coastal plain and the glimmering adriatic in the distance the meadow appeared to be the site of the previous nights camp a single large tent was still standing we passed the staging area where the last cohort was assembling in ranks to begin the march up the mountain in my dazed state i wondered how many soldiers i had seen in the last few hours if the army consisted of domitiuss entire force from corfinium they amounted to thirty cohorts in all with six hundred men in each cohort and i had passed every one of them now i knew what a body of eighteen thousand armed men looked like how many men did caesar have in italy that he could spare so many troops for sicily otacilius led us toward the tent where a team of campstrikers had begun to pull up stakes a young officer in splendid armor stepped out carrying under his arm a helmet with an elegant horsehair crest there was no copper disk with a lions head on his breastplate he was not one of domitiuss men yet otacilius was quick to jump from his horse and salute him as a superior numas balls i heard tiro mutter behind me i peered at the officer more closely it must have been fear and fatigue that kept me from recognizing him at once for there was no mistaking his curiously brutish yet babyish face his profile was the brute seen from the side his dented nose jutting chin and craggy brows made him look like an angry boxer seen straight on his full cheeks gentle mouth and soulful eyes made him look like a homely poet at every angle between his face was a mixture of contradictions it was a face women found fascinating and men trusted or feared instinctively otacilius conferred with him in a low voice i heard my name spoken the man looked toward me his eyebrows registered surprise then shock he shoved otacilius roughly aside and strode toward us casting aside his helmet and drawing his short sword from its scabbard he grabbed my shoulder and put the blade to my neck i sucked in a breath and closed my eyes an instant later his bearish arms were around me crushing me to his barrel chest the tether that had been around my throat lay on the ground cut in two gordianus he bellowed pulling back to give me the full effect of his homely features at close quarters marc antony i whispered and fainted to the ground i heard voices and gradually realized that i was in an enclosed space not a room exactly but a shelter of some sort full of soft light a citizen his age led by his neck on a forced march the prisoners had to be bound tribune standard procedure for suspected insurgents and spies its a wonder you didnt kill him that wouldnt mark an auspicious beginning for you in caesars army cohort commander killing gordianus metos father i only followed regulations tribune i realized i was in a large tent and remembered the tent in the meadow from which antony had emerged i lay on a hard pallet with a thin blanket over me hes waking up a good thing for you youre dismissed marcus otacilius go back and rejoin your cohort but the sight of you is likely to send him straight to hades youve made your report get out there was a rustling noise a flicker of light from a parted tent flap and then the face of marc antony abruptly loomed over me gordianus are you all right thirsty hungry my feet hurt antony laughed you sound like any soldier at the end of a hard march i managed to sit up my head whirled i fainted it happens a forced march no food or water and from the marks on your neck it looks like that fool otacilius halfstrangled you i felt my throat the flesh was tender and bruised but not bleeding for a moment up at the pass i thought he was going to execute me hes not that big a fool well talk about it later after youve had something to eat and drink dont get up sit on the cot ill have something brought to you but eat quickly the tent needs to come down i intend to set out within the hour what about me youll come with me of course i groaned not back up the mountain no to brundisium caesar needs me to close in for the kill antonys company consisted of a hundred mounted soldiers he had been dispatched by caesar to escort the troops bound for sicily as far as the foot of the apennines then to rejoin the main force his contingent was kept small so that he could move swiftly every man was a battlehardened veteran of the gallic wars antony boasted that his handpicked century was the equal of any two cohorts he invited me to ride alongside him at the head of the company the slaves were allowed to ride in the baggage wagon fortex he presumed to be my personal bodyguard tiro he failed to recognize even at close quarters this surprised me because there was no man in rome whom antony hated more than cicero and i feared that he might recognize ciceros secretary even disguised but antony accepted the explanation that tiro was metos old tutor soscarides with hardly a glance antony isnt simple meto had once told me but hes as clear and plain to read as caesars latin apparently he expected others to be equally transparent as for the wagon driver the poor slave had arrived at the meadow exhausted and feverish from his shoulder wound too delirious to answer questions or to speak for himself he was loaded into the baggage wagon along with tiro and fortex i found it convenient to pretend that his delirium preceded our encounter with otacilius the wretched slave caught a fever coming over the mountains i told antony as we rode out i think he must have been out of his wits from the moment he woke up this morning all that nonsense he told the cohort commander he was raving still he was right about that couriers passport wasnt he antony looked ahead showing me his fierce boxers profile ah yes thats a bit embarrassing i told my man soscarides to hide it until the troops passed foolish of me perhaps but i thought i might save myself some trouble instead i was caught lying i cant blame the cohort commander for being suspicious of me after that but gordianus how in hades did you ever get your hands on such a document signed by pompey himself i decided to evade rather than lie i dont know how else i could have obtained fresh horses at every stop along the way i was able to take advantage of it thanks to cicero that was not a lie exactly i stayed at his villa at formiae for a couple of nights that piece of cow dung antony turned to face me his features straight on had grown as fearsome as his profile do you know what id most like to see come out of all this ciceros head on a stake ever since the bastard murdered my stepfather putting down catilinas socalled conspiracy hes made a career of slandering me i dont know how a fine fellow like yourself can stay friends with such a creature cicero and i arent exactly friends tribune you neednt explain caesar is the same every time the subject of cicero comes up we argue he tells me to stop ranting i ask why he coddles such a scorpion useful he says as if that won the argument some day cicero may prove useful antony laughed well he proved useful to you i suppose if he gave you that couriers passport from pompey but it landed you in trouble in the end didnt it you rode up one side of italy but you had to walk down the other youre lucky marcus otacilius brought you straight to me or you might very well have lost your head but youve always been lucky to live as long as you have imagine the father of gordianus meto suspected of spying for pompey the world has become a strange place perhaps stranger than you think i said under my breath well we shall sort everything out when we reach brundisium he seemed relieved to be done with the subject but his words left me unsettled what remained to be sorted out if antony had accepted my story there was the problem of the wagon driver of course what would happen when his delirium receded and what if tiro were recognized how could i explain my complicity in his masquerade as soscarides betraying tiro now was out of the question he could not possibly fall into worse hands i could all too easily imagine antony taking out his hatred of cicero against ciceros righthand man you look pensive gordianus antony reached over and squeezed my leg dont worry you shall see meto soon enough after tonight well have three days of hard riding to reach brundisium if your luck holds we should arrive just in time to witness pompeys last stand we camped that night half a mile off the road in a shallow valley amid low hills antony pointed out the sites defensibility is there really any danger of attack tribune i asked the mountains are to our right the sea to our left behind us is corfinium securely garrisoned by caesars men before us is brundisium which i presume to be surrounded by caesars main force i should think were as safe as a spider on a roof of course we are its all my years in gaul i can never pitch camp without thinking something unseen might be lurking in plain sight in that case could i have my dagger back the one that otacilius confiscated he took daggers from my slaves as well certainly as soon as weve made camp the men shucked off their armor and set to work pitching tents digging a pit for the latrine kindling a fire i went in search of the baggage wagon a small knot of men surrounded it looking down at something on the ground talking the fever must have taken him it can happen that quickly with a wound like that ive seen stronger men bleed less and die faster he was just an old slave anyway and from what i heard a troublemaker ah heres the tribunes friend let him through the crowd parted for me i stepped closer and saw the body of the wagon driver on the ground someone had crossed his arms over his chest and closed his eyes he must have died during the day explained a soldier who stood over the body he was dead when we came to unload the wagon i looked about where are the others the two slaves who were in the wagon with him tiro and fortex stepped into sight neither said a word the soldiers were summoned to another duty and dispersed i knelt beside the body in death the slaves face was even more haggard than in life his cheeks sunken around his toothless mouth i had never even asked his name when i wanted something from him i had simply called him driver i rolled him over besides the wound at the shoulder there were several others where he had been poked and prodded during the march but they appeared to be superficial his shoes were thin his feet blistered and bloody the tether had worn the skin around his ankles there appeared to be faint bruises around his throat as well in the fading light it was hard to tell instinctively i felt my own throat where the tether had chafed it but there had been no tether around the slaves throat tiro and fortex stood over me i looked up at them i spoke in a low voice he was strangled wasnt he tiro raised an eyebrow you heard the soldiers he died of fever from his wound he was old and weak the march down the mountain killed him that was his own fault these discolorations at his throat liver spots said tiro i stood and looked him in the eye i think he was strangled by your hand tiro of course not fortex is trained for that type of thing i glanced at fortex he wouldnt meet my gaze it had to be done gordianus whispered tiro what if he had recovered and started talking again i stared at him dont judge me gordianus in times like these a man has to do things against his own nature can you say that you wouldnt have done the same i turned away and walked toward the campfire xvi antony never questioned the untimely death of the wagon driver he was used to seeing men die suddenly from wounds that did not appear fatal he had other things on his mind the next morning the soldiers threw the body into the latrine pit and covered it the death of a slave merited no more ceremony than that as we rode out antonys only comment was that i might contact the slaves owner when i had the chance to let him know what had become of his wagon and driver if you suspect hes the litigious type you could offer him a token settlement the slave obviously wasnt worth much and since the owner was honoring your couriers passport technically you dont owe him anything let him sue pompey antony laughed then shook his head civilians always suffer losses in wartime property ruined slaves running off in a place like gaul the locals have to patch things up for themselves here in italy itll be different once things get back to normal therell be a flood of litigation suits for damages pleas for reparations petitions for tax relief the courts will be jammed caesar will have his hands full so will advocates like cicero i said if cicero still has his hands said antony the coastal road was mostly straight and flat but not in the best condition winter storms had damaged some sections dislodging stones and washing out the foundation normally such damage would have been repaired promptly by gangs of slaves working under a local magistrate but the chaos in the region had prevented that the recent passage of so many men vehicles and horses first pompeys army then caesars had aggravated the situation but despite the mud and the muck we traveled well over forty miles that day and did the same the next day and the next i had traveled with antony a few years before from ravenna to rome and again found his company enjoyable he was a notorious carouser whether the arena was a battlefield in gaul a wild party on the palatine or the floor of the roman senate he had plenty of stories to tell and he enjoyed hearing mine as long as they involved scandalous women political chicanery or trials for murder or best all three together i hardly saw tiro who traveled in the baggage wagon and stayed out of antonys sight it was in the hour before twilight of the third day one day after the ides of march one day before the feast of the liberalia that we arrived in the vicinity of brundisium we were spotted by lookouts posted atop a low hill east of the road a centurion rode out to greet antony the man was flushed with excitement tribune youve arrived just in time for what im not sure but the men posted on the other side of the hill are whooping and cheering somethings happening down in the harbor show us the way barked antony i hesitated to follow uncertain of my place now that we had reached the theater of battle antony peered back at me arent you coming gordianus we rode to the top of the low hill where several tents had been pitched and a sizable contingent of soldiers had been posted as lookouts toward the north in the direction we had come the site commanded a sweeping view of the beach and the coastal road for miles the centurion had seen us approaching for hours toward the south the site overlooked the city the harbor and the sea the centurion led us to a vantage point with an unobstructed view they say this was the very spot where caesar stood when he planned the siege he said proudly the walled city of brundisium is situated on a peninsula surrounded by a semicircular harbor a narrow strait links this protected harbor to the adriatic sea the easiest way to visualize the city as it might appear on a map is to hold up your right hand and form a reverse letter c the space enclosed by your forefinger and thumb represents the peninsula upon which the city is built your forefinger and thumb represent the northern and southern channels of the harbor your wrist represents the strait through which ships must sail to reach the sea from our vantage point the city on the peninsula appeared as a cluster of tenements warehouses and temples crowded within high walls pompeys soldiers were clearly visible on the towers and parapets their helmets and spears glinting in the westering sun along the landward western wall which ran between the north and south channels of the inner harbor the besieging army of caesar was encamped the force appeared to my eye enormous row upon row of catapults and ballistic machines had been assembled along with several siege towers on wheels which rose even higher than the city walls but i saw nothing to cause a commotion among the watchers on the hillside the siege towers and war machines were unengaged no smoke rose from the city and i saw no sign of fighting along the wall there antony pointed away from the city toward the entrance to the harbor and beyond a fleet of large ships was approaching from the open sea several had already reached the harbor entrance and appeared to be maneuvering to sail through in single file i found this curious as i had sailed in and out of brundisium myself in the past and knew that the harbor entrance was deep and wide enough for several ships to sail abreast yet these were apparently endeavoring to enter one at a time keeping as close to the center as possible as the first ship entered the straits i saw the reason for such a course the sight was so strange i had trouble believing my eyes at the narrowest part of the entrance to the harbor great piers of some sort had been built out from both promontories extending far into the water this breakwater very nearly met in the middle or so it appeared at a distance almost closing off the entrance to the harbor short towers had been built at intervals along both arms of the structure and these were equipped with catapults and ballistic machines by my ancestor hercules what are we seeing muttered antony as puzzled by the sight as i was he turned his head and scanned the other soldiers watching along the hillside a bearded little fellow was standing atop a boulder nearby viewing the scene intently with his arms crossed mumbling to himself antony called out to him engineer vitruvius the man blinked and looked in our direction engineer vitruvius report the man scrambled down from the rock and came running he saluted antony tribune youve rejoined us you state the obvious marcus vitruvius whats not so obvious is what were witnessing down there what in hades is going on ah vitruvius looked toward the harbor but was so short that the tops of some trees down the hillside blocked his view if we may retire to higher ground tribune we followed him back to the boulder he scrambled atop it crossed his arms and gazed down at the harbor now tribune if i may explain the situation his tone was typical of the condescending manner of builders and engineers even when dealing with superiors if those superiors know less than they do of construction and mathematics vitruvius cleared his throat seven days ago we arrived outside brundisium caesar moved at once to encircle the city and the harbor placing the greatest part of his six legions before the city wall but also securing the promontories north and south of the harbor entrance our commander hoped to trap not only pompey but also the two consuls and the many senators with him so as to force immediate negotiations and a settlement of the crisis but prompted antony a bad sign our advance intelligence indicated that pompey had assembled a considerable fleet yet there were only a few ships in the harbor where had the fleet gone alas before we arrived pompey had already sent the consuls senators and a substantial part of his army across the adriatic to dyrrachium out of harms way always seeking peace our commander endeavored to negotiate directly with pompey the great one sent back word that no lawful settlement could possibly be concluded in the absence of the consuls hence no negotiations our intelligence from within brundisium pompey has treated the locals with contempt and theyre eager to help caesar informed us that pompey kept twenty cohorts with him not to hold the city indefinitely how could he with only twelve thousand men against three times that number but long enough for his fleet to reach dyrrachium unload the first round of passengers then return to brundisium to pick up pompey and his men our commander having pursued pompey this far had no intention of allowing him to slip away he came to me they must be stopped engineer vitruvius we must prevent pompeys ships from reentering the harbor when they return or if they manage to do so we must prevent them from leaving but i have no ships of my own and my men cannot march on water this strikes me as an engineering problem marcus vitruvius can you blockade the harbor i said i could then make it thus engineer vitruvius the little man waved his arm in the direction of the harbor you can see the result from here we began by building great breakwaters of earth and stone on either side of the harbor entrance where the water is shallow unfortunately as the work progressed and we reached deeper water it became impossible to keep the earthworks together at that point we built a raft thirty feet square at the end of each breakwater and moored each raft with anchors at all four corners to keep them still in the waves once these platforms were in position we added more rafts joined them firmly together and covered them with a causeway of earth so that they were as steady as an actual breakwater even though they float atop the waves if you squint you can see that screens and mantlets have been put up all along both sides of the causeways to protect the soldiers coming and going on every fourth raft we constructed a tower two stories high to defend against attacks by sea the goal of course was close off the harbor completely antony grunted all this was your idea vitruvius beamed actually if you believe the greek historians xerxes the king of persia did something like this when he bridged the hellespont and led his army from asia into europe ive always wondered how such a feat was accomplished i suspect he must have used a similar technique anchoring rafts and linking them together meto had often told me of great feats of engineering conjured by caesar in his battles against the gauls under caesars command men bridged rivers and chasms dug vast trenches and canals and tunnels and constructed great towers and siege engines but an attempt to close off a harbor was something new antony nodded clearly impressed what was pompeys response to all this construction dont tell me he watched idly from the city walls once he realized what was happening of course not said vitruvius after he stopped gaping in wonder the great one commandeered the largest merchant vessels remaining in the harbor and outfitted them with siege towers three stories tall the ships have been making sorties out to the harbor entrance every day trying to break up our rafts theyve managed to slow the work but not destroy it its been a daily spectacle watching our towers on the rafts and their towers on the ships fire missiles and fireballs and arrows back and forth blood on the water trails of reeking smoke explosions of steam antony frowned but the blockade remains unfinished the channel is still open vitruvius crossed his arms and assumed the impregnable expression of every builder whose project has fallen behind deadline alas we simply didnt have time to finish especially with pompeys ships hectoring us but the idea was sound given another five days or even three vitruvius shook his head and now the fleet has returned those are pompeys ships you see lining up to enter the harbor and there see the commandeered merchant vessels with their towers sailing out from the city to harass our men on the rafts and run interference for the incoming ships as the sun dropped behind the hills to the west we watched the sea battle unfold one by one pompeys transport ships slipped through the gap in the breakwater and ran the gauntlet boulders flew through the air hurled by catapults on the rafts most missed the mark and landed in the water creating prodigious splashes some struck masts or prows shredded sails and sent splinters flying one catapulted stone landed squarely on the deck of a ship and appeared to break through at least to the rowers deck below but the ship failed to sink at the same time atop the towers on the rafts men loaded giant missiles into ballistics engines and sent them flying toward the ships the missiles looked to me like arrows carved from entire tree trunks and the machines to hurl them were like enormous bows with winches on either side to set the tension some of the missiles were set afire before they were shot and went hurling through the air streaming flames and smoke the aim of the ballistics engines seemed more accurate than that of the catapults they caused more damage to the incoming ships yet still failed to sink any meanwhile the fighting vessels from the city returned the fire hurling missiles and stones at the rafts and even attempting to board them as they might an enemy ship at sea caesars men on the rafts managed to repel these attacks but in so doing were distracted from their own assaults on the transport ships unceasingly soldiers ran back and forth on the causeway atop the rafts toting fresh missiles to the ballistics engines and rolling boulders to the catapults archers on both sides choked the air with arrows and the waves grew congested with a flotsam of spent missiles and bodies from a distance all this commotion seemed utterly chaotic a great stirring together of earth sea fire and smoke yet at the same time it appeared to be an orderly if hectic operation carried out by purposeful men using every ingenious device and method they could conceive and construct for the purpose of mutual destruction it was thrilling to watch as a lightning storm is thrilling the battle proceeded with compelling inevitability we seemed to be watching a single vast machine of many parts which once set into motion no power on heaven or earth could prevent from completing its manifold operations as the sun went down and the reek of smoke and steam thickened the battle became increasingly obscure it appeared that every one of pompeys transport ships would win through to the harbor at the same time caesars rafts had withstood the assault against them and remained in place at last only one transport ship remained outside the harbor entrance the wind had risen and the vessel was having difficulty maneuvering there was a lull in the battle i sensed the energy of both sides flagging the operation of the catapults and ballistic machines grew more sporadic the constant hail of arrows ceased perhaps both sides had run low on ammunition or perhaps the increasing darkness made it difficult to take aim then there occurred one of those incidents which prove the madness of battle which give the lie to any vision of warfare as an orderly operation one of pompeys assault vessels shot an incendiary missile from its catapult to carry flammable material on board a ship must have been terribly dangerous and none of the ships had hurled such a fireball before why did the captain hurl it then as a flippant parting gesture to use up the last of his ammunition before the close of battle or was it a calculated lastditch attempt to destroy the rafts whatever the intention the result could not have been what the captain intended the fireball greatly overshot the rafts like a comet it flew over the heads of caesars men descended in a precipitous arc and crashed onto the deck of the last of pompeys transport ships waiting to enter the strait why did the ship catch fire so quickly and so completely when its sisters had not despite similar fireballs hurled by caesars catapults perhaps the flaming ball of pitch landed on a cache of something flammable perhaps it was the action of the rising wind whatever the cause with stunning rapidity the whole ship was engulfed in flames from the waterline to the top of the sail flaming bodies leaped off the deck even on the hillside we heard the screams of the rowers trapped below the deck their cries were drowned out by the triumphant cheering of caesars men along the breakwater who jumped up and down in their excitement then their cheering abruptly ceased out of control buffeted by the wind the flaming ship suddenly listed toward the nearest stretch of caesars rafts heading for the very tower which had been the intended target of the fireball the men in the tower poured out like ants from a hill moments later the ship crashed into the line of rafts the mast shattered from the impact and fell onto the breakwater the fleeing soldiers were trapped beneath the sail which descended on them like a fluttering sheet of flame soldiers who had previously carried ammunition along the causeway now relayed buckets of seawater as they desperately tried to douse the fire and keep it from spreading pompeys assault ships might have taken advantage of the confusion but they had already turned away from the enemy and retreated toward the city escorting the transport vessels safe within the harbor night fell the battle was over xvii we made camp and dined that night with the man stationed at the overlook i had thought antony would be as eager to report to caesar as i was to find meto now that we had at last reached brundisium but antony was not a man to be stinted of his supper even if it consisted of nothing more than a soldiers ration of gruel or of his wine at the end of three hard days of riding we ate on the hillside beneath the open sky seated on little canvas folding chairs the wind died the sea and the harbor grew as still as a black mirror reflecting the mantle of stars overhead the flames of the ship wrecked against the breakwater gradually died down within its high walls the compact little city of brundisium seemed to glow from the bottom up as if the ground itself were illuminated one by one runners lit torches atop the towers and along the parapets until the whole course of the wall was outlined like a coiled serpent outside the landward wall caesars army was dotted with hundreds of twinkling campfires beyond the besieging army farther west the foothills of the apennines brooded in darkness the ridgeline faintly aglow with the last intimations of light from the setting sun today we saw a battle said antony who seemed greatly cheered despite the fact that pompeys fleet had won through and tomorrow well likely see a siege noted vitruvius antony had invited him to dine with us to continue explaining the feats of engineering involved in construction of the breakwater now vitruvius fell to cataloguing for my benefit the various engines and strategies that might be deployed when caesar threw his forces against the defenders of brundisium scaling ladders wheeled siege towers battering rams sappers who would dig under the foundations to weaken the walls soldiers who would advance in tortoise formations surrounded by shields and bristling with spears i fell to wondering about davus where was he at that very moment did pompey still keep him among his personal bodyguards that was my hope but who knew where he might have ended up thanks to pompeys whim or simple expediency perhaps davus was guarding the city walls striding even now among the tiny figures illuminated by the torches along the parapets heavily cloaked for the night watch and anxiously counting the hours to dawn or perhaps he had taken part in the sea battle that day manning one of pompeys assault ships davus couldnt swim diana had said nor could i for that matter what terror could be greater than being trapped aboard a ship deliberately sailing toward danger the sight of wounded men struggling in the waves that day had horrified me more than anything else more even than the flaming transport ship had davus been among those tiny figures flailing and screaming amid the flotsam of the battle and what of meto i saw again the flaming sail descending on the fleeing soldiers could my son have been among them it seemed unlikely caesar kept him close at hand probably at that moment he was encamped with the main part of the army outside the city walls dining in the commanders private mess taking careful notes as caesar discussed with his lieutenants the next days strategy who was in greater danger davus or meto to judge from the surface of things anyone would have said davus i suppose i was not so sure long after his bowl of gruel was empty antony kept holding up his cup for more wine once he was properly drunk he insisted that vitruvius and the centurion of the night watch join him in a round of bawdy songs most were simply vulgar but one was actually rather funny about a mincingly effeminate officer whod rather be at home trying on his wifes dresses but who turns out to be the bravest fighter of all so much for military humor i thought men need a bit of nonsense to divert them and wine to wash it down after witnessing carnage such as we had seen that day antony was still singing lustily when i took my leave and went to the officers tent where i had been allotted a space i fell on my pallet but couldnt sleep fretting over meto and davus and wondering what the next few days would bring when i set out from rome i thought i had a plan now worn down by the journey and faced with the realities of the situation it seemed to me that whatever vague notion i had in mind had vanished like morning mist i was out of my element i felt tiny and insignificant overwhelmed by the forces around me now that the critical moment was fast approaching i did not feel as brave as i had hoped the flap rustled someone stole into the tent and moved uncertainly among the cots i heard a whisper gordianus it was tiro i rose from my bed wrapped my blanket around me and ushered him outside cant you sleep either isnt the baggage wagon comfortable enough lumpy growled tiro fortex and i take turns dozing im still not convinced that antony hasnt recognized me antony hasnt even looked at you nobody notices slaves unless theyre young and beautiful still each night i expect to be strangled in my sleep i thought of the wagon driver strangled in his delirium but said nothing what happens tomorrow gordianus i dont know if im lucky ill see meto and caesar as well perhaps take me with you i frowned i thought you came all this way to see pompey not caesar so i did this is my exit from italy gordianus i intend to be on pompeys ship when he sets sail for dyrrhachium you never told me that you didnt need to know but before i go as long as the opportunity presents itself i should like to have a peek inside caesars tent so that you can assassinate him dont joke gordianus i only want to have a look one never knows what might be useful later you want me to help you spy on caesar you owe me a favor gordianus could you have traveled all the way from rome this quickly without me could you have survived the last four days without me lying for you tiro i think were even then do this for me as a favor and ill do a favor for you isnt it your intention to get into brundisium to retrieve your soninlaw from pompey if i can how do you plan to get inside the city walls with caesars army on one side and pompeys on the other im not sure i admitted i can get you inside alive and in one piece youll come with me and fortex but in return for that favor i want you to take me along when you see meto and caesar i shook my head impossible caesar is even more likely than antony to recognize you caesar has dined in ciceros house he must have seen you many times and not just taking shorthand in the senate seen me yes but never really looked at me you said it yourself gordianus nobody notices slaves caesar notices everything youre risking your head tiro perhaps not what if he does recognize me caesar is eager to be known for his clemency clemency for senators and generals tiro not for freedmen and spies ill take my chances if anyone asks who i am youll say im soscarides metos old tutor and what about meto is he supposed to go along with the lie as well do this for me gordianus if you want to get into brundisium before your soninlaw is dead on the ramparts or sailing off to dyrrhachium do me this favor ill sleep on it i said suddenly very weary i yawned when i opened my eyes tiro had disappeared i returned to the tent despite my worries despite the horrors i had witnessed that day sleep came swiftly but not without dreams it was not flames or drowning water or mountain passes and forced marches i dreamed about it was the girl aemilia numeriuss lover i saw her with a baby in her arms smiling and content i felt a great sense of relief and stepped closer to have a look but stumbled against something at my feet i looked down to see the body of numerius which somehow was also the body of the wagon driver a garrote twisted tight around his throat aemilias baby had vanished she shuddered and wept the front of her gown was soaked with blood between her legs i woke with a start antony loomed above me his eyes bloodshot dawn gordianus time for me to report to caesar and for you to see your son piss if you need to then round up those two slaves of yours and were off before we rode down to the main camp antony wanted a last look at the breakwater from the hill there were clouds overhead but the horizon was clear the rising sun in our eyes and its scintillating reflection on the water made it difficult to see but the wreckage of the flaming ship appeared to have been removed during the night men were busy repairing the damage to the breakwater and construction continued vitruvius is down there now said antony he told me last night that he hopes to add another raft to each end of the breakwater by the end of the day to further close the gap the ships that sailed in yesterday will have a harder time sailing out we rode down onto the plain antony was attended by a small staff of officers i was accompanied by tiro and fortex for whom horses were found the camp was like a city probably more populous than the city being besieged and surely more orderly with its row upon row of precisely spaced tents some of the soldiers stood in lines awaiting morning rations others already fed and outfitted for battle were marching off to man the trenches and earthworks and siege machines below the city walls i was astounded by the speed with which caesar had been able to move such vast numbers of men and equipment ten days before the plain outside brundisium had been empty now it was home to thirtysix thousand men every one of whom appeared to know exactly where he should be and what he should be doing at that moment thirty days before not one of these men had been within two hundred miles of brundisium and domitius still held corfinium sixty days before caesar had only just crossed the rubicon the scale and swiftness of the operation was awesome i pitied the gauls who had confronted such a force i despaired for pompey we passed a guarded checkpoint where antony vouched for me as we drew closer to the center of the camp he fell back beside me i saw him cast a wary glance at tiro and fortex as if seeing them for the first time you are sure gordianus that you can vouch for your two slaves i barely hesitated of course why do you ask no reason really its only ever since we crossed the rubicon before that actually theres been a rumor what sort of rumor a plot to assassinate caesar wild talk of course i felt a chill up my spine does caesar take it seriously caesar thinks hes immortal but what man isnt made of flesh and blood he groaned from his hangover and massaged his temples its only you see every time i vouch for you im vouching for your slaves as well of course youre above suspicion gordianus that goes without saying but the slaves who travel with you i take complete responsibility for my slaves tribune i kept my eyes straight ahead of course gordianus i meant no offense he gave me a firm slap on the back then rode up to rejoin his men he didnt give tiro and fortex another look i steadied myself with a deep breath then looked sidelong at tiro it seemed to me that he clutched his reins too tightly but his face betrayed no expression he had overheard of course antony was not the sort to lower his voice for the benefit of slaves i thought of daniel in the lions den a tale bethesda told handed down by her hebrew father was that how tiro felt riding into caesars camp led by a tribune who would gladly flay him alive yet here he was despite his fear i wondered if i could summon as much courage in the coming hours we came to a large tent more elaborate than the others made of red canvas embroidered with gold and decorated with pennants messengers on horseback waited in a line outside the entrance as we approached a soldier stepped out of the tent conveyed an order to the first messenger and the man was off meanwhile another messenger came riding up dismounted and rushed into the tent morning reconnaissance explained antony intelligence reports come in orders go out its a beehive in there perhaps i should wait outside nonsense just mind that you dont get trampled he climbed off his horse and offered me a hand leave your slaves outside i looked at tiro and shrugged i had done my part he was not to see the inside of caesars tent after all but i underestimated his persistence tiro jumped from his horse please master let me come with you you heard the tribune soscarides but you brought me all this way to surprise meto to see the look on his face if you talk to meto first and let it slip that im here wheres the surprise and the longer you wait the more hectic the day may become even an hour from now if theres to be a battle the tutor is right said antony swiftly done is best done who said that tutor he looked at tiro keenly euripides said tiro antony frowned are you sure i once heard cicero say it on the floor of the senate house tiros face stiffened no doubt tribune but euripides said it first antony laughed spoken like a true tutor i suppose youre not a spy or an assassin after all bring him along gordianus give meto a surprise yes master please said tiro either that or have the slave beaten for his insolence suggested antony he wasnt joking i glowered at tiro and seriously considered the option i could see wheels spinning behind his eyes the date he suddenly said antony looked at him quizzically its two days past the ides said tiro liberalia day i remembered cicero and his wife arguing over the upcoming liberalia and their sons toga ceremony you cant beat a slave for speaking his mind on the feast day of father freedom master letting slaves speak freely is part of the holiday tiro looked quite pleased with himself is it liberalia already antony grunted i always lose track of holidays during a military campaign we count on augurs to watch the calendar and make the proper sacrifices and leave it at that well i celebrated the god of the grape in my own way last night and im all for parading a giant phallus through the camp and singing bawdy songs though i doubt well have time for it but the slaves right gordianus you should indulge him we must court the favor of all the gods including dionysus tiro looked at me archly i looked back at him coolly very well soscarides come along fortex youll stay here with the horses inside the tent messengers rushed about and the crowd of officers buzzed with conversation but the scene was more orderly than i expected antonys metaphor was fitting not the frenzied scramble of a stirred antbed but the steady swarm of a beehive most of the officers appeared to be about antonys age in their early thirties or younger a few i recognized though i was more used to seeing them in senatorial togas outfitted in armor they looked like boys to me their faces were radiant with excitement i thought of the crippled old senator sextus tedius dragging himself off to make a stand with pompey the contrast was devastating a flash of red caught my eye through the crowd i glimpsed a bald head singular amid so many full heads of hair and spotted the king bee himself caesar was in the process of being strapped into a gilded breastplate even more elaborate than the one antony wore the flash of color was his cape caesar was famous for his red cape which he wore on the battlefield so that he could always be seen by his own men and those of the enemy as well even as he was being dressed he appeared to be listening to three messengers at once his deepset eyes stared straight ahead he nodded occasionally absently brushing his fingers over his brow combing forward the thin hair at his temples his expression was composed determined attentive but aloof on his thin lips there was the faintest intimation of a smile i was ten years older than caesar and by habit still thought of him in terms of his early reputation in the senate as an aristocratic radical young troublemaker he was a troublemaker still but now in his fifties to the ambitious vibrant young men in that tent he must have seemed a father figure the brilliant man of action they all aspired to emulate the commander who would lead them into the future what appeal could musty relics like pompey and domitius hold for such young men pompeys conquests were all in the past domitiuss glory was secondhand inherited from a dead generation caesar embodied the moment the fire in his eyes was the divine spark of destiny i looked about tiro stood behind me taking in everything but antony had disappeared i spotted him across the tent embracing another man in nearly identical armor when they relaxed the embrace i saw that the man in antonys arms was his fellow tribune curio the two had been lifelong friends more than friends some said when their boyhood attachment became the stuff of gossip cicero had urged curios father to separate them saying antony was corrupting curio antony was banned from curios house but it did no good he sneaked into curios bedroom through the ceiling so the story went and antony had never denied it now they were seasoned soldiers and in the last year both had been elected tribunes when the crisis came they fled from rome together to join with caesar before he crossed the rubicon the tent seemed full of such men all bursting with energy and passion all projecting the bright invincibility of youth they made me feel old and very unsure of myself i turned about seeking the face i longed to see i gave a start meto stood before me a look of utter consternation on his face my son did not looked pleased to see me xviii papa what are you doing here like the officers around us meto looked like a boy to me though he was now almost thirty and had streaks of premature gray at his temples he had the eyes of a scholar but the weathered hands and rugged brow of a seasoned campaigner the scar across his face which he had received at the age of sixteen fighting for catilina had almost been erased by the winds and rain and burning sun of gaul as always when i saw him after an absence of months i looked him quickly up and down and whispered a prayer of thanks to mars that his body appeared whole and his limbs intact i felt such a flood of emotion that i couldnt speak i reached for him he was stiff for a moment then returned the embrace remembering the boy he had once been i was amazed at his strength when he pulled back he was smiling ruefully what are you doing here papa you must have been traveling for days the danger im here for davus davus hes with pompey at least i hope he still is and not already across in dyrrhachium or with pompey dont tell me davus ran off to fight with his old master we former slaves are entirely too sentimental there was a bitterness in his voice i was not used to hearing no pompey took davus with him by force by force pompey claimed he had a legal right something to do with the transfer of ownership and the terms of davuss manumission legal or not there was no way i could stop him but why should pompey steal davus from you partly for spite partly to have a hold over me metos face stiffened is the rest of the family all right eco bethesda diana the children i left them all in good health thank the gods what does pompey want from you i looked at the crowd pressed close around us i was acutely aware of tiro standing silently behind me straining to hear everything it was impossible to say all i wanted to say i lowered my voice the day before pompey left rome a kinsman of his was killed in my house and pompey accused you of the crime i shook my head no no but he held me responsible he charged me with finding the killer i told him i couldnt i tried to refuse but pompey was in a state on a whim he took davus to coerce me poor diana whispered meto thats why ive come to brundisium to get davus back while i still can how ill find a way what about you meto ive been sick with worry for you meto suddenly pulled back tiro had taken a step closer and meto seemed to notice him for the first time is this man with you papa yes one of your slaves i dont know him let me explain wait a moment meto stared hard at tiro by hercules its at that moment i felt a slap on my shoulder and gave such a start i thought my heart had bounded from my chest it was antony here they are father and son off whispering and conspiring among themselves he said i blinked beside antony i saw a blur of gold and crimson surmounted by the serene countenance of julius caesar gordianus when did we last meet in ravenna i think you were investigating the murder of our friend publius clodius you were then in the employ of pompey as i recall he always remembered me which always surprised me since he knew me chiefly as metos father and the two of us had never had a conversation of real significance meto had told me that caesars memory for names and faces was part of his charm he could meet a foot soldier in the heat of battle exchange no more than a few words and years later greet the man by name and ask for news from his hometown imperator i said with a deferential nod the slave with him is an old tutor of metos explained antony meto raised his eyebrows but said nothing caesar glanced past my shoulder at tiro i held my breath his expression registered no change his eyes reconnected with mine he raised an eyebrow i hope youre not still in the employ of pompey gordianus antony tells me that youve been traveling on a diplomatic passport signed by the great one himself i took a deep breath that document came to me by way of cicero not directly from pompey despite appearances imperator i assure you that the great one and i are hardly even on speaking terms caesar flashed a wry smile that rather describes my own relationship with pompey at the moment youre an intrepid man gordianus to have journeyed all this way and a good father if you did it to inquire after meto but i assure you i take good care of him hes as dear to me as he is to you i suggest you return now to the lookout where you camped last night out of harms way observe developments from a safe distance this could turn out to be a very interesting day in particular watch the rooftops of the city the rooftops imperator the citizens of brundisium are angry at the way theyve been treated by pompeys troops pompey never did learn to discipline his men properly as a result there are townspeople quite willing even eager to let us know when pompey begins his nautical retreat they will signal us from the rooftops that will be the moment we strike theres nothing harder to manage than a tactical withdrawal from a besieged city even by ship when he turns his back and begins to flee that will be the moment of pompeys greatest vulnerability the gods willing he shall not escape me i nodded and felt a trickle of sweat run down my spine feeling the presence of tiro close behind me listening to every word in his enthusiasm caesar himself was telling me secrets treating me with complete trust while a spy i had brought into his tent stood close enough to touch him i felt lightheaded as i had at the end of the forced march down the mountain when i fainted at antonys feet are you well gordianus said caesar take a day of rest but no rest for me the signal to attack may come at any moment come antony meto bring your stylus and wax tablets i cleared my throat perhaps imperator my son might stay behind for just a moment ive come a long way to see him weve barely had time to talk not today gordianus caesar smiled at meto and put his arm around him then reached up to tug at his earlobe affectionately i thought i saw meto stiffen at the mans touch caesar seemed not to notice today your son is mine every hour every minute my eyes and my ears my witness my memory he must see all hear all record everything later therell be time to talk come meto he slipped his arm from metos shoulder the tent rapidly began to empty like a swarm leaving the hive meto followed caesar for a few steps then hung back he looked over his shoulder at tiro then at me he frowned papa whats going on i wanted to ask you the same question i said meto come on antony barked my son gave me a last cryptic look then departed with the rest i wished i had given him one more embrace i suppose youre quite pleased with yourself i said to tiro along with fortex we were making our second circuit of the camp on horseback tiro was all eyes and ears taking in every detail as we had left caesars tent one of his aides handed me a copper disk stamped with an image of venus the man told me i could show it as a passport to anyone who questioned us the disk signified that i was a guest of the imperator himself allowed to come and go and move freely about the camp as long as i stayed out of the way the disk was even good for obtaining rations at the mess tent had it been up to me we would have spent no more time in the camp than it took to leave it i was eager to get into brundisium once pompey began his nautical retreat and the siege commenced everything would be in chaos any hope of finding davus could slip away in an instant i wanted to know tiros plan but tiro insisted on taking full advantage of caesars hospitality first you traveled on pompeys passport he said with a smile now i shall travel a bit on caesars tiro we must get inside the walls quickly indulge me gordianus today is liberalia you know i should like to indulge you by sitting you down on one of those giant phalli the priests of dionysus carry fortex yelped at the idea tiro hooted he was in high spirits almost giddy why not he had carried off his charade with spectacular success he had slipped through antonys hands unscathed slipped in and out of caesars tent undetected and had even garnered valuable information from the lips of the imperator himself now he was skimming a last bit of intelligence observing the numbers and dispositions of caesars troops and siege machines after some morning cloudiness the sky had cleared an offshore wind was rising it was a perfect day for sailing at any moment pompey might begin his retreat the transport ships might be loading at that very moment what will be the use of all this information youre gathering tiro if we wait too long to get into brundisium pompey may leave without you or he may become trapped for lack of what you might have told him youre right gordianus we must be getting on but first something to quiet the rumbling in my belly who knows what sort of rations pompeys troops have been reduced to inside the city i suggest we eat at caesars expense and slip into brundisium with full stomachs wheres the mess tent then i grumbled three up and two over tiro had memorized the layout of the camp we were given steaming millet porridge sweetened with a dollop of honey i even found a few raisins in my portion fortex grumbled at the lack of any meat meto tells me that a soldier fights best with grain in his belly i said too much beef bloats a man makes him sluggish turns his bowels to mud once in gaul caesars troops ran out of grain for days on end they had nothing to eat but cattle requisitioned from the natives they hated it to the point of becoming mutinous they demanded their porridge your son must be a remarkable person said tiro why do you say that meto was born a slave wasnt he so were you tiro yes but i was educated and groomed to be ciceros companion from early on i had the life of a scribe theres room for a slave to prove himself in that kind of position to show off his natural talents and rise in the world but meto was born a slave to marcus crassus wasnt he a bad man to have for a master crassus may have been the richest man in the world but he never knew the true value of anything i nodded meto wasnt even in crassuss household properly speaking he was an errand boy in one of crassuss villas on the coast in baiae thats where i first met him during the slave revolt of spartacus there had been a murder presumably by some runaway slaves crassus intended to kill every slave in the household in retribution including meto imagine slaughtering an innocent child in the arena roman justice is sometimes hard agreed tiro crassus wasnt entirely pleased with the way things turned out when it was all over he sent meto off to an estate in sicily do you know what meto was doing when i finally tracked him down he was a scarecrow it was terrible for him endless days in the hot sun the buzz of insects in the grain the hungry crows always coming back the foreman beating him if any of the crop was eaten he had nightmares about it for years afterward perhaps he still does i should think by now hes seen enough horrors as a soldier to drive out that nightmare and replace it with others observed tiro what made him want to become a soldier catilina i saw tiro wrinkle his nose at the mention of the radical insurgent who had been ciceros enemy when he was sixteen he fell in love with catilina or the idea of catilina and ran off to fight for him i was there too at the battle of pistoria when catilinas dreams ended meto and i survived by the favor of the gods that taste of battle was more than enough to satisfy any curiosity i ever had about warfare and slaughter but meto wanted more he needed another leader to follow more battles to fight it has something to do with being born a slave i think i freed him i made him my son and never treated him as anything less than my own flesh and blood but he never quite felt a sense of birthright a sureness of belonging the night before his toga day when he was sixteen i caught myself why i was speaking so candidly the mood of an army camp on the brink of battle has a way of loosening a mans tongue on the eve of his toga day meto had the nightmare the scarecrow nightmare i told him that was all in the past he knew that but he didnt feel it becoming my son becoming a citizen it all felt unreal to him in his heart he was still a frightened helpless slaveboy it wasnt until he went off to gaul and found favor with caesar that he seemed finally to put his beginnings behind him he found the place where he belonged and the leader he was looking for and yet now i stopped myself from going further i dont pretend to understand him tiro not completely but i am his father as surely as if he came from my seed you love him very much said tiro quietly more than anything else too much perhaps xix im not a swimmer i said after eating we had returned to the lookout post on the hill north of the city tiro fortex and i sat on horseback surveying the view it was much as i had seen it the day before except that the harbor was now crowded with moored transport ships and the harbor entrance had been pinched a bit tighter thanks to new rafts hastily added to the end of each breakwater tiro had said he wanted a final look at the lay of the land and the disposition of caesars forces but i was beginning to suspect that he had no idea of what to do next and was searching for a way to get inside the city walls lacking the wings of daedalus this could be done in only two ways by land or by water entry by land would require getting past the front line of caesars heavily manned trenches traversing the no mans land before the city wall and then penetrating or scaling the wall itself we could hardly do any of this in secret long before we crossed the front line the attackers would order us to stop or be killed as defectors even if we crossed the no mans land alive the defenders might fire upon us long before we could explain ourselves and they could hardly be expected to open the gates or let down ladders even if they wanted to help us that left the possibility of approaching brundisium by water the city wall that fronted the harbor was shorter and less heavily guarded than the landward wall but scarcely less formidable to three men without wings outside this wall a narrow road ran along the waterfront and gave access to the port situated at the tip of the peninsula but the entire length of this road had been covered with a veritable thicket of spikes and caltrops to make passage impossible and discourage even small boats from landing there was only one point of possible ingress the port itself where gates in the walls opened onto a wide boardwalk and several large quays projected into the water the gates to the port were open and there seemed to be a great deal of activity on the quays but as yet there was no sign that the ships moored there were being readied for departure what did you say gordianus mumbled tiro gazing intently at the prospect i said im not a swimmer ive always been a city boy you know born and raised in rome tiro blinked people swim in the tiber all the time upstream from the cloaca maxima anyway no tiro people splash in the tiber and float across on planks and in dry years they wade across thats not the same as swimming across a harbor with arrows falling around you who said anything about swimming said tiro do you see those little fishermens huts down there on our side of the channel just a stones throw away facing the city across the harbor i nodded the huts were few and spaced well apart i hadnt even noticed them in the twilight of the previous day distracted by the battle at the harbor entrance the huts looked abandoned said tiro no signs of life the fishermen have all retreated inside the city walls but they left their boats behind theyre only skiffs too small to be of any use to caesar so theyve just been left there pulled up on the sandy beach i can see five or six of them from here we have our choice i have my eye on that one with the white sail less visible than say the one with the orange sail do you know anything about sailing a vessel like that you might be surprised by the things i know gordianus once were out in the harbor what then we sail directly for the quay the channel cant be more than a quarter of a mile across what if the currents against us what if caesars men come after us then fortex shall have to row harder said tiro fortex rubbed his jaw and you may have to swim added tiro i didnt like the sound of that we were halfway down the hillside our horses picking their own path through the bramble when a voice called out from the ridge behind us you cant go down there its offlimits it was the centurion in charge of the lookout tiro turned and waved he held a hand to his ear flashed a stupid grin and shrugged as if to say he couldnt make out what the man was saying ride on he whispered look straight ahead ignore him head directly for the skiff faster we urged our mounts down the hillside and reached the narrow beach behind us i heard the galloping footfall of a horse how many said tiro keeping his eyes ahead fortex glanced over his shoulder just the one good he thinks were harmless then well allow him to go on thinking that as long as possible you know what to do fortex at the strip of beach between the hut and the skiff we dismounted the centurion was closing on us i drew close to tiro what do you mean to do to him what do you think does it have to be like this we made a bargain gordianus you took me into caesars tent and im to get you into brundisium do you want to come along or not this is war did you think thered be no bloodshed just be glad its not your blood about to be spilled its murder tiro as surely as the death of that wagon driver was murder murder is a legal term gordianus it doesnt apply to slaves and it has no meaning on a battlefield perhaps we can simply knock him unconscious drag him into the hut tiro made a face you muddied your mind reading those greek novels while we sat out the storm in the mountains all hairbreadth escapes and happy endings this is the real world gordianus theres only one sure way to get rid of this fellow fortex will see to it its what hes trained for now smile we have company the centurion rode up he dismounted and walked toward us there was a spring in his step the short brisk ride had exhilarated him his smile was a little disdainful but not hostile i was only an ignorant civilian after all a sheep that needed herding not a wolf he addressed me and ignored the others no civilians are allowed along the shoreline i held up the copper disk but caesar himself gave the imperator has issued explicit orders regarding the shoreline no exceptions he raised his voice apparently thinking i might be a little deaf i only wanted to have a look at this quaint fishermans hut the centurion shook his head and smirked a bit i was like a doddering grandfather who had to be indulged but only to a point he took no notice of fortex who circled behind him blood pounded in my ears in a matter of seconds it would be done the young centurion all flushed and smugly smiling would be gripped from behind fortex would slit his throat a flash of steel a spurt of blood his eyes would widen in shock and then go blind a living man would become a corpse while i watched beyond the centurions shoulder i had only a partial view of fortex but from his movements i could see that he was stealthily drawing his dagger tiro stood off to one side playing the dutiful retiring slave holding his breath i reached for the centurions shoulder and drew him toward me fortex uncertain held back do you have a grandfather i said two said the centurion i thought so i walked him away from the skiff away from fortex and toward the hut is one of them a little deaf a bit doddering both of them actually he grinned crookedly i had made him think of home far away i nodded well young man im neither doddering nor deaf i can hear you perfectly well my eyes are good too the reason i rode down here was because i saw someone go into this hut he frowned the hut was crudely built with a thatched roof the thin door hung on rusty hinges are you sure absolutely i saw a man in rags skulking down here on the beach behaving suspiciously i saw him go into this hut i thought i should come to investigate you should have called me at once the centurion rolled his eyes exasperated but i know how busy you must be it hardly seemed worth bothering you probably its the owner of the hut come back to fetch something a looter more likely the centurion drew his sword he walked up to the door and pulled it open with such force that the top hinge broke you inside come out he took a step closer peering into the darkness i followed behind pulling my dagger from its scabbard with one hand i knocked his helmet forward over his eyes with the other i raised the dagger and struck him hard with the pommel at the base of his skull he fell in a heap at my feet i sheathed my dagger make yourself useful fortex pull him inside the hut and dont harm him i stepped back and scanned the ridge i dont think anyone up there could have seen that do you tiro the hut shielded me from view besides theyre all too busy watching the city and the harbor entrance ive managed to buy us a little time but before long theyll miss him or start wondering about our horses on the beach what are you waiting for pull the skiff into the water and lets get going tiro looked chagrined gordianus i you should read more greek novels tiro and less of that insipid poetry cicero produces within moments we were in the skiff and away from the beach tiro unfurled the white sail fortex pulled hard at the oars i sat in the prow shivering i had wet my feet getting into the boat the water was colder than i expected i watched the shoreline the centurion suddenly appeared at the doorway of the hut looking dazed and rubbing the back of his head i waved to him and returned the smug smile he had given me earlier he staggered out of the hut shook his fist and yelled something i couldnt make out fortex laughed i should like to have cut his throat ive never killed a centurion ah well perhaps another time the wind was with us so was the current we skimmed across the smooth water the shoreline receded and the walls of the city loomed higher our course was a bit ragged tiro was not quite the sailor he made himself out to be but despite some zigzagging we kept heading in the general direction of the port it seemed almost absurdly easy considering how daunting the task of getting into brundisium had appeared to me the previous night the other skiff was upon us so quickly that it seemed to materialize from thin air tiro was busy with the sail fortex was rowing with strong steady strokes it was i who saw the skiff first but not until it was almost within arrowshot of us it was a long sleek boat larger than ours with two rowers and two archers both of whom already held their bows aloft with arrows notched aimed in our direction i looked to see where the skiff had come from and noticed a strip of shoreline directly across from the port a considerable contingent of soldiers was gathered there along with a few small boats another skiff was heading out to join the first in pursuing us i nudged tiro and pointed just as he turned to look one of the bowmen released an arrow we both flinched but the arrow fell well short into the water it was a test shot to gauge the wind and measure the distance the second bowman released a shot that came substantially closer meanwhile with two rowers to our one the skiff steadily gained on us by hercules tiro cant you keep to a straight course i shouted if you keep zigzagging back and forth theyre bound to catch us before we reach the quay tiro made no answer perversely it seemed to me he veered off course heading directly toward the city wall instead of continuing at a more oblique angle toward the port the skiff gained on us rapidly i heard a noise like a hornets buzz and ducked an arrow flew over my head and tore into the sail where it snagged and caught the shaft flapping against the taut canvas we were at their mercy with no way to defend ourselves i gazed at the cold water bracing myself for the moment we would have to abandon the boat debating whether drowning was preferable to death by arrows suddenly i heard shouting above our heads and looked up to see soldiers manning the harbor wall i saw the strategy of tiros navigation to bring us close enough to the wall to put our pursuers in range of arrows from the citys defenders the fact that we were pursued by caesars men was enough to bring pompeys soldiers to our defense with a whoosh like carrion birds taking flight a hail of arrows descended from the wall some fell closer to us than to the pursuing skiff the water was dotted with little vertical splashes none of the arrows struck a target but the point was made caesars men stopped closing in on us tiro sailed parallel to the wall heading for the quay the pursuers likewise turned and sailed parallel to us keeping their distance trying to edge close enough to shoot us with their arrows without being shot themselves by the archers on the wall i lay back and crouched as low in the boat as i could not only to avoid arrows but to give tiro room to move as he struggled with the sail i heard a scream from the other boat and saw that one of the archers had been struck by an arrow in his shoulder he lost his balance and fell into the water i hoped our pursuers would turn about but they left the mans rescue to the boat that followed behind them we drew closer and closer to the port a crowd had gathered on the quay to watch cheering like spectators at a race gazing up from the bottom of the boat i caught glimpses of the archers who trotted along the parapet keeping up with us they hooted and laughed whenever they paused to notch an arrow take aim and fire they were above harm in no danger of return fire from our pursuers to them the exchange was a lark a diversion how different it felt to me hunkering down in the boat watching arrows fly overhead a hornets buzz was followed by a splintering crash and i felt something tickle my nostrils an arrow had pierced the side of our boat and stopped just short of splicing my nose suddenly the skiff gave a lurch we abruptly slowed and angled about my first thought was that tiro had been struck and had lost control of the sail but he was still upright almost on top of me then i saw fortex he still gripped the oars his knuckles fishbelly white but he had stopped rowing his eyes were open his lips trembled as if he wanted to speak but all that emerged from his mouth was a bloody cough an arrow had pierced his neck clear through the metal point protruded from one side the feathered shaft from the other tiro was frantically working the sail and unable to see what had happened row fortex he yelled row damn you the oars dipped in the water and held rigidly in place by fortexs grip acted as rudders causing us to spin tiro cursed a moment later the boat struck something with an impact that rattled my teeth tiro tumbled overboard the splash stung my eyes and sent cold water up my nostrils i heard cheering and realized it was the quay we had struck i blinked and peered over the bow our pursuers had kept up the chase until the last possible moment now they turned about and headed back a final double volley of arrows followed after them as the archers on the wall were joined by more archers firing from the quay i had reached the port of brundisium unscathed xx everyone in the crowd around us seemed to have an opinion hell probably die if you pull out that arrow hell die for sure if you leave it in are you certain hes still alive fortex lay flat on his back on the boardwalk his eyes open and unblinking his beard thickly matted with coughedup blood more blood coated the shaft of the arrow protruding from either side of his neck his body was absolutely rigid every muscle quivering with tension his fingers remained curled in a whiteknuckled grip it had been a struggle to pry them from the oars it had been a greater struggle to lift him out of the boat and onto the quay the front of the tunic was smeared with blood i stood at his feet gazing down unable to take my eyes off him tiro stood beside me shivering and soaking wet what do you think gordianus hes your man tiro we were in pompeys domain now i saw no point in maintaining the charade that tiro was my slave tiro replied in a whisper his teeth chattering the merciful thing might be to put him out of his misery fortex gave no sign that he heard his wideopen eyes stared up at heaven the tension in his body was excruciating to witness as if every muscle were defiantly clenched was it fear or bravery or simple animal instinct that caused him to hold on so desperately to life we had called for a physician but none had come i looked at the arrow and wondered what we should do about it if we cut off one end the shaft could be removed but would that only cause more bleeding perhaps the arrow was the only thing preventing his jugulars from spurting fountains of blood onto the boardwalk it was impossible to watch him quivering in silent agony and do nothing i made up my mind to remove the arrow i reached for my dagger i gritted my teeth trying not to envision the mess i might make of it before i could move the crisis ended the tension in fortexs body abruptly subsided his fingers uncurled his eyes rolled upward a sigh escaped his lips like a low note from a flute he crossed his own rubicon and departed for the river styx the crowd relaxed with a collective murmur of relief people went about their business a living man with an arrow through his neck was something to see a dead man was not funny said tiro how sometimes a man lives precisely as long as he needs to and no more what do you mean fortex it was his task to get me safely to pompey if hed been shot a minute sooner wed never have made it to the quay you and i would have died in the boat with him instead it happened just so and here we are as if the gods decreed it you believe every man has a destiny then even slaves tiro shrugged i dont know great men have a destiny perhaps the rest of us have one only insofar as we cross their paths and play a part in their destinies is that what makes you so brave tiro belief in destiny brave on the mountain facing otacilius in antonys camp in caesars tent in the boat standing up to work the sail with arrows whizzing past your nose tiro shrugged i looked past him to the gates that opened from the boardwalk into the city a determinedlooking centurion and a company of soldiers were marching directly toward us this journey weve taken together tiro did i facilitate your destiny or did your facilitate mine it would seem to have been mutual and the role of fortex was simply to get us here what else i wonder if fortex would have seen it that way what about that nameless wagon driver he got us over the mountains didnt he it all worked out for the best not for him still if youre right the gods have seen us safe thus far if they intend for me to accomplish what i came for then i shall live a little longer at least i shall try to be as brave as youve been tiro gave me a puzzled frown then stepped forward to meet the soldiers the centurion asked his name soscarides i expect youve been briefed to look for my arrival quite a show from what the archers tell me the centurion was a grizzled veteran with a big homely face and a tight little smile im to report directly to the great one himself and to no one else said tiro the centurion nodded whos the dead man a slave my bodyguard and this one another slave tiro laughed hold up your hand and show your citizens ring gordianus centurion this man is also known to the great one hell come with me the centurion grunted well you cant report to the imperator as you are you soaking wet and this one with blood all down his tunic ill see what we can do about a change of clothes theres no time said tiro you must take us to pompey at once castor and pollux hold your horses the centurion scanned the loiterers on the boardwalk and pointed to a welldressed civilian you there yes you and your friend both of you come here when the two men hung back the centurion snapped his fingers soldiers ran and fetched them by force the centurion looked the two men up and down yes you both look about the right size and your clothes arent too shabby strip the mens jaws dropped the centurion snapped his fingers the soldiers assisted the men in taking off their clothes not so rough yelled the centurion dont tear the tunics which one do you prefer soscarides tiro blinked the yellow i suppose good enough you who were in the yellow take off your loincloth as well go on my friend soscarides here is wet to the balls and needs a dry one he turned to tiro and me go on fellows take off those things youre wearing and put on your new clothes i pulled my bloody tunic over my head what is this predilection these military types have for making other men strip i said to tiro under my breath thinking of our humiliation by otacilius on the mountainside caesar had said that pompeys men had alienated the citizens of brundisium i could see how the centurion looked at our feet shoes too he shouted at the two hapless civilians they both gave a start then obediently knelt and began untying the straps at their ankles i can bear to let my own shoes dry on my feet said tiro standing naked for a moment as he exchanged his wet loincloth for the dry one the centurion shook his head take it from me ive marched men to the pillars of hercules and back im an expert on feet youll be glad of having a pair of dry shoes once things start moving moving said tiro slipping the yellow tunic over his head it was an excellent fit the centurion squinted at the westering sun above the city skyline suns sinking where do the hours go once its dark things will start to move fast and furious believe me youll be glad youre wearing clean clothes and dry shoes remember me then friend soscarides and say a prayer for the centurion who looked after you as sweetly as your own dear mother to slow the progress of caesars men once they entered the city pompey had barricaded all the major streets at various points and had also laid traps these were trenches dug across the width of a street lined across the bottom with sharpened stakes covered with wicker screens and concealed by a thin layer of earth our progress to the city center was necessarily restricted to a course which meandered through secondary streets and alleyways the centurion led the way while his soldiers formed a cordon around tiro and me officially the townspeople had been confined to their homes but in fact they were everywhere in the streets yelling frantically rushing about wearing expressions of thinly suppressed panic if caesars camp had seemed a beehive abuzz with orderly movement then brundisium was an antbed turned by the farmers plow i came to appreciate the calm determination of our centurion who seemed unfazed by it all we finally emerged from the maze of narrow byways into the city forum where civic buildings and temples faced an open square here there was at once a greater sense of order and a greater sense of chaos centurions shouted commands and troops stood at rigid attention in the square at the same time weeping women and ashenfaced men thronged the temple steps from their open doors i caught the smell of burning incense and myrrh and heard the echo of prayers wailed not in latin but in the strange ululating language of the messapians the race that settled the heel of italy at the beginning of time and built the city of brundisium the messapians fought against sparta in ancient days they fought against pyrrhus who conquered them for rome the seafaring cosmopolitan people of brundisium worship all the deities worshiped in rome but they also pay homage to their own gods ancient messapic deities unknown in rome with unpronounceable names those were the gods they called on in their moment of despair when the fate of their city hung in the balance we came to the municipal senate building on the east side of the forum where pompey had made his headquarters the centurion told us to wait on the steps while he went inside his soldiers maintained their cordon around us whether they were protecting us or holding us prisoner i wasnt sure exhausted i sat on the cold hard steps tiro joined me the atmosphere of the city under siege had dispirited me but seemed to have stimulated tiro if pompey can pull this off he said hell truly be the greatest military genius of the age i frowned pull what off a successful retreat from brundisium hes already sent part of his army to dyrrhachium along with the consuls and the greater part of the senate now comes the tricky part with caesar ready to scale the walls and throw all his might against the city can pompey manage an orderly organized retreat through the streets onto the ships and out the harbor entrance the tactical challenge must be staggering the risk is enormous i see what you mean how and when does the last defender climb down from the parapet cede his ground to the invader and board the last departing ship it could turn into a stampede which could turn into a rout tiro gazed about the forum with its jarring mixture of rigid military order and barely contained religious panic then theres the unknown uncontrollable element of the civilian population we know theyve had their fill of pompey but can they be certain that caesar wont slaughter them for harboring his enemy the locals are liable to split into factions divided by old grudges who knows how theyll take advantage of the chaos some may unbar the gates and lead caesars men safely around the barricades and traps while others may throw stones at them from the rooftops some may panic and try to board pompeys ships the sheer numbers of them could jam the streets and make escape impossible a commander is judged by his success at surmounting challenges if pompey can get all his men safely out of italy to fight another day hell have earned anew his right to be called great one do you think so it seems to me he could have better demonstrated his genius by avoiding such a trap in the first place pompey did as well as any man could considering the situation no one foresaw that caesar would dare to cross the rubicon that took caesars own lieutenants by surprise i think he surprised even himself committing such hubris and the disaster at corfinium pompey had no control over that he told domitius to fall back and join him but domitius let vanity run away with his common sense of which he has little enough to start compare domitius to pompey in every decision since the crisis began pompey has acted strictly from reason hes never shown a trace of vanity or foolish pride some would say he hasnt shown much nerve either it takes nerve to look an enemy in the eye and fall back step by step if he can see this orderly retreat through to the end pompey will have shown that his spine is made of steel and then what thats the brilliance of it pompey has allies all through the east thats where his greatest strength lies and where caesar is weakest while pompey rallies those reinforcements from his stronghold in greece he can blockade italy and cut off all shipping from the east including the grain harvest from egypt let caesar have italy for the time being with egypt closed to him and the east rising against him with starvation looming in italy and pompeys troops in spain at his back well see how long caesar can last as king of rome it was just possible i thought that everything tiro said made sense did caesar have any inkling of such a scenario i thought of the infinitely confident man i had seen that morning but perhaps that was only a part of his genius as a leader never to show doubt or betray the nightmares that haunted him in the dark perhaps it would all go pompeys way in the end but that could happen only if he successfully escaped from brundisium we had come to a nexus in the great contest in the next few hours pompey would cast a throw sufficient to let him play another round or lose the game altogether the centurion returned the great one will see you i started to get up but he laid a hand on my shoulder not you soscarides i reached for tiros arm when you see pompey ask him to grant me an audience ill do my best gordianus but in the midst of a military action you can hardly expect remind him of the task he gave me in rome tell him tell him i know the answer tiro raised an eyebrow perhaps you should tell me gordianus i can pass the news on to pompey and ask for davus to be set free thats what you want isnt it i shook my head no ill reveal the truth about numeriuss murder only to pompey and only if he releases davus first if he wants to know what happened to numerius he must agree to those terms otherwise he may never know tiro frowned if i tell him all this and its only a ruse to gain you an audience please tiro he gave me a last dubious look then followed the centurion inside the sun dipped beyond the western hills a chilly twilight descended on the forum bringing a curious sense of calm even the shrill ululations from the temples seemed oddly comforting torches were lit and passed among the troops i understood now why pompey waited for nightfall to make his exit in the darkness the barricades and pitfalls in the streets would be doubly dangerous while the besiegers backtracked and stumbled over each other pompeys men drilled in the escape route would be able to circumvent the hazards and quickly reach the ships the centurion returned soscarides i said still with pompey no message for me not yet there was a clanging of brazen doors and a commotion at the top of the steps i got to my feet a large group of officers poured out of the building and onto the porch the centurion and his soldiers sprang to attention pompey walked at the head of the group dressed in full armor plated with gold the precious metal glistened and shimmered reflecting the light of the torches in the square below under his arm he carried a goldplated helmet with a yellow horsehair plume below the neck thanks to the muscular torso molded upon his breastplate he appeared to have the physique of a young gladiator the illusion was belied by a pair of spindly legs which goldplated greaves could not disguise i looked for tiro in the retinue but didnt see him nor did i see davus great one i shouted hoping to get his attention i reacted as any citizen in the forum might petitioning a magistrate but this was not rome and the man before me was not pompey the politician obliged to ingratiate himself with every marcus who could vote this was pompey the great imperator of the spanish legions the man who believed in carrying swords not quoting laws quiet snapped the centurion he remained at attention his glaring eyes demanded the same of me pompey halted at the top of the steps the officers fanned out behind him a trumpeter blew a fanfare for attention i was no more than twenty feet away pompey looked tired and haggard his eyes were puffy and bloodshot but the soldiers in the square below must have seen a very different pompey a powerfully built goldensheathed almost godlike figure a statue of mars come to life soldiers of rome defenders of the senate and the people tonight you will carry out the exercise for which youve been drilled over the last few days each of you has a role to play you all know what to do act quickly and efficiently obey the orders of your centurions and there will be no problems the enemy has been frustrated at every turn a handful of veteran archers and slingers have successfully kept him away from the city walls he has no ships his efforts to block the harbor have proven futile typically his ambition oversteps his ability in the long run he shall be sorry for it there was a murmur of laughter among the troops in the square i had always been blind to whatever charm pompey possessed but these men seemed to appreciate it perhaps one had to be a military man we are about to leave italy and cross over the sea pompey continued some of you may feel misgivings about this do not we are moving forward not falling back rome lies across the water now we go to join her a city is made of men not buildings we go to where the true heart of rome resides with the duly elected consuls let the enemy take over empty buildings if he wishes and invest himself with whatever empty titles his imagination can devise i think perhaps he has dwelled for too long north of the rubicon among primitive barbarians who worship kings having conquered those petty monarchs he thinks he should become one himself he should remember instead the fate of every despot who ever raised arms against the senate and the people of rome a murmur among the troops swelled into a cheer pompey cut it short by raising his hands soldiers remember the first order of the day silence the enemys ear is pressed to the city gates we must carry out this operation with an absolute minimum of noise it starts now cohort commanders begin evacuation he gave a gesture to the officers behind him like a circus master signaling the commencement of a race as they moved forward pompey stepped back withdrawing from the sight of the troops in the square like a golden deus ex machina disappearing at the theater the ranks of his retinue were thinned by the dispatch of the cohort commanders and i was now able to spot tiro who walked to pompeys side the great ones personal bodyguards closed around him among them i saw a lumbering hulk with a familiar gait even before he turned to show the profile of his boyish face i knew it was davus i tried to catch tiros eye but he was busily conferring with pompey suddenly i saw him gesture in my direction pompey nodded and turned he looked straight at me then stepped past his bodyguards and walked directly to me the centurion beside me snapped to attention i heard you shout at me earlier finder pompey sounded tired and irritable did you great one you gave no sign a trained orator lets nothing distract him tiro says you have news for me yes great one good centurion dont you have evacuation orders yes imperator then off with you imperator i should tell you that this man is armed hes carrying a dagger shall i disarm him pompey managed a weary smile worried about an assassination attempt centurion killing people is hardly gordianuss style is it finder he didnt wait for me to answer but dismissed the centurion and his men with a curt wave come along finder i suppose youll want to say hello to that soninlaw of yours since you dragged yourself across half of italy to find him i cant imagine why i never met a fellow so thick hard to imagine that i once paid good silver for him i drew a deep breath and my report great one he made a face not here not now cant you see theres a fire at my feet save your report until were safely on the water xxi i cant believe it i just cant believe it davus not so hard youre squeezing the life out of me sorry davus released me and stepped back i reached up to rub my cheek where the links of his mail shirt had pressed a tattoo into the soft flesh outfitted all in leather and steel the sight of him was as overpowering as the hug he had just given me yet the broad grin across his face made him look as harmless as a child i just cant believe it he said again laughing you came all this way over the mountains and everything how on earth did you get inside the city its a long story davus ill tell you another time one of pompeys officers gave a shout he raised his arm and pointed at a tall building across the square up on the rooftop someone was running back and forth waving a torch pompey squinted by hades you were right tiro damn these townspeople thats a clear signal to caesar to commence his attack scribonius order an archer to shoot that man down the officer who had pointed stepped forward hes out of range imperator then send someone up there the way to the roof will almost surely be blockaded imperator is it really worth our time then send some archers onto a neighboring rooftop and shoot at him from there imperator the evacuation has begun by the time our archers i dont care look at that ape waving his torch laughing at us the men in the square can see the brave soldiers manning the wall can see terrible for morale i want that mans head and bring me his hand as well with the torch still in it scribonius summoned archers but in the next moment pompeys order was rendered moot all around the city civilians appeared on rooftops some waved torches others danced in the flickering torchlight like celebrants at a festival pompey was furious damn these people when i retake brundisium i shall burn the city to the ground ill sell every man woman and child into slavery he paced back and forth gazing westward above the rooftops we could see the towers flanking the city gate engineer magius has the gate been sufficiently blocked another officer stepped forward you know it has imperator there are tons of rubble piled against it no battering ram will budge it the only way caesars men can get into the city is by climbing over the walls scribonius will the line of archers and slingers along the parapet hold every ones a seasoned veteran imperator theyll hold at that moment we heard the first sounds of battle carried across the cold air there was only shouting at first then the eerie echo of steel clanging against steel and the dull boom of a battering ram the square below rapidly emptied the last of the soldiers filed out in silence heading for the ships the forum grew dark except for glowing patches of light from open temple doors i found myself wishing i understood messapic it seemed to me that the ululations from the temples had gradually changed tenor from songs of terror and lamentation to songs of deliverance the chants mixed with the distant sounds of battle there was a signal for pompeys retinue to commence evacuation suddenly everyone around me was moving down the steps the officer called scribonius handed davus a torch and told him to follow as rear guard we headed toward the port by a different route than the one the centurion had taken earlier this street was wider and the way more direct i wondered that it hadnt been blockaded and said as much to davus who told me to wait and see at the first intersection we came to the engineer magius called a brief halt he and a few other men gripped some ropes hanging from the buildings on either side in an instant tons of rubble poured into the street behind us an ingenious system of pulleys had been installed connected to wooden sluices and caches full of debris stored in the upper floors of the buildings facing the street the same operation was repeated at the next intersection and the next magius was blockading the street as we passed at other places magius gave a signal for caution and led the company in single file along one side of the street keeping close to the wall trenches with spikes had been dug across the street and covered over only magius knew exactly where they were and on which side to bypass them the traps were impossible to see in the darkness the dirt spread above the wicker blinds blended imperceptibly with the rest of the street now and again i heard faint echoing sounds of battle from behind us shouts and screams mixed with the chanting from the temples the darkness of the narrow streets the flickering torchlight the manmade avalanches of rubble the unseen traps beneath our feet all seemed like elements from a mad dream images of the day flashed through my overwrought mind arrows crisscrossing in the blue sky above my head the cold still water of the harbor promising death fortex on the quay quivering with tension gripping invisible oars and staring agape at the boatman charon coming for him across the river styx i seemed to be trapped in a waking nightmare then i chanced to look at davus beside me he was grinning from ear to ear for him it was all a grand adventure i gripped his arm davus when we arrive at pompeys ship youll stay behind he furrowed his brow davus i have the information that pompey wanted about numerius but i shall give it to him only if he agrees to leave you behind leave me behind listen davus and try to understand i shall be going with pompey but you shall not its the only way i can make this work well leave you behind on the pier as soon as the ship casts off you must take off all your armor do you understand keep your sword to protect yourself but strip down to your tunic and throw everything else in the water there must be nothing to identify you as one of pompeys men the townspeople are likely to kill you out of spite if caesars men dont kill you first stay behind davus still didnt comprehend dont you want to go back to rome dont you want to see diana and little aulus again of course then do as i say for a while the city will be in chaos but youre a big man no one will bother you unless they have a reason dont pick any fights try to pass as one of the townspeople at least until you can hand yourself over to caesars men hand myself over theyll kill me no they wont caesar is doing everything he can to appear merciful you wont be harmed as long as you throw down your sword and dont resist demand to see meto and if meto should be if for any reason you cant find meto ask for marc antony the tribune tell him who you are ask for his protection what about you fatherinlaw i shall take care of myself i dont understand youll end up with pompey over in greece how will you get home dont worry about me but diana and bethesda tell them not to worry tell them i love them this isnt right i should go with you to protect you no the whole point is to get you away from pompey and back to rome dont spoil all my efforts now davus do as i tell you suddenly there was a tremendous crash ahead of us rubble poured into the street for a moment i thought pompey had been struck but he emerged from the dust cursing and coughing someone had set off one of magiuss barricading devices in an attempt to ambush us pompeys men immediately swarmed over the rubble looking for the culprits shrieks of laughter were followed by shrill screams the soldiers returned with their squirming prisoners four boys the soldiers restrained them by twisting their arms behind their backs and clutching fistfuls of hair the oldest looked about the same age as mopsus the others looked even younger i was amazed they had the strength to pull down the rubble their success was a testament to magiuss engineering for pompey this was the final straw he walked up to the oldest boy and slapped him across the face the boys defiance crumbled he looked terrified blood trickled from his nose he started to weep so did his companions pompey snapped his fingers bodyguards come executing partisans isnt a job fit for soldiers davus responded at once i gripped his arm but he pulled free i hissed his name he looked back at me and shrugged as if to say he had no choice tie their arms behind their backs and lay them on the rubble ordered pompey davus held up his torch while the other bodyguards ripped apart the boys tunics and used the strips to bind them gag them pompey ordered i dont want to hear any screams for mercy then cut off their heads the boys weeping abruptly turned to shrieks more cloth was ripped and the shrieks were abruptly muffled well execute them on the spot and leave them as an example let the people of brundisium see the price for betraying pompey the great let them think about that while they await my return it happened so swiftly it seemed unreal in seconds the boys were stripped to their loincloths bound and gagged and ready to be beheaded tiro drew back into the shadows keeping his eyes down davus hung back pompey noticed davus youll cut off the head of the ringleader davus swallowed hard he glanced in my direction but quickly lowered his eyes he handed his torch to a soldier and slowly drew his sword he shifted nervously from foot to foot great one no pompey turned to see who shouted finder i should have known great one let the boys go let them go they very nearly killed me it was a prank theyre boys not soldiers i doubt they even know you were at the head of the retinue all the worse how should that have looked in rome pompey the great killed by accident by a gang of street rats pulling a prank theyll pay with their heads but how would that look in rome boys mere children their heads cut off and left for their parents to find if these were barbarians in the hinterlands yes but this is italy we could as easily be in corfinium or rome pompey bit his lower lip he stared at me for what seemed a long time put away your swords he finally said leave the boys as they are bound and gagged let the people see that they were captured and spared if caesar can show mercy so can i by hades lets get out of this godforsaken place davuss shoulders slumped forward in relief pompey gave me a last furious glance then held out his arms to his bodyguards who helped him over the pile of rubble davus fell back to resume his post as rear guard he helped me pick my way step by step over the debris the last of the barricades and traps was behind us we pressed on toward the port saying not another word to each other as soon as we passed through the city gates and onto the boardwalk one of the soldiers gathered up all the torches ran to the quayside and threw them into the water the port was clearly visible to caesars forces ringing the harbor darkness was as vital as silence to the success of pompeys operation the quay was lined with men waiting to board their assigned ships we hurried past them heading for the end of the quay the uncanny quiet was suddenly broken by cheering that began ahead of us and spread down the length of the quay i thought at first that pompeys arrival had been noticed and the cheer was for him then i heard a shout theyre through theyve made it the first of the transport ships to cast off had passed safely beyond the breakwaters at the harbor entrance and had reached the sea masts creaked and sails billowed and more ships cast off as we neared the end of the quay i had a clear view of the harbor entrance the breakwaters were as dark as the quay horizontal smudges that seemed to rise barely above the waterline a captain without keen night vision might easily run aground trying to pass between them i felt more out of my element than ever plunged into a shadowy world ruled by the likes of pompey and caesar where men manufactured avalanches moved mountains of earth built atop water and made even darkness their weapon at the end of the quay pompeys ship waited it was a smaller sleeker faster vessel than the big transport ships a boarding plank was quickly laid in place pompey headed straight for it i summoned my nerve and quickened my pace to catch up with him great one he abruptly halted and turned about without torchlight it was hard to read his expression i saw only deep shadows where his eyes should be the hard line of his mouth turned down sharply at the corners hades take you finder what do you want now great one my soninlaw i want you to release him from your service leave him behind why its the price for what i have to tell you not here not now you said on board your ship then when time allows ill go with you but you must leave davus here pompey was silent he seemed to be staring at me but i couldnt see his eyes finally he gestured for the rest of the party to commence boarding then turned back to me finder why do i have the feeling that this is a trick of some sort a ruse to trade places with your boneheaded soninlaw i spared those street rats for trifling with me i wont do the same for you its not a trick great one i know who killed your kinsman and why then tell me now i glanced at davus who stood awkwardly by while the others boarded tiro also hung back waiting to see what would happen no ill tell you after we cast off after davus is out of my reach you mean dont you trust me finder we must trust one another great one he cocked his head what a peculiar fellow you are finder to dare to talk to me this way go on then board the ship he turned about you too tiro stop gawking as for you davus im done with you off away to hades with you davus looked to me i stepped forward reached into my tunic and pressed my moneybag into his hands he looked down at the pouch and frowned it was heavy with silver thanks to tiros largesse i had spent almost nothing during the journey there was more than enough to see him safely home but fatherinlaw he whispered you cant give me all this youll need it just take it davus and go he looked into my eyes then at his pouch in his hands then into my eyes again his shoulders rose and fell as he drew a deep breath finally he turned but still hesitated go davus now without looking back he began walking down the quay back toward the city tiro boarded the ship i waited for pompey but he gestured that i should go first he followed after me the boarding plank was withdrawn orders were given in hushed voices the sails snapped and billowed the deck moved under me and the quay wheeled away i peered back the way we had come and saw a figure i thought must be davus standing alone at the far end of the quay framed by the gateway into the city then the ship turned and i lost sight of him xxii i quickly lost sight of both tiro and pompey on the dark crowded deck no one questioned my presence no one seemed to take any notice of me at all the soldiers were ordered into battle formation but there was considerable confusion with frantic movements back and forth and a great deal of arguing and cursing after all pompeys careful planning and what had appeared to be a perfect evacuation i thought how ironic it would be if all his ships should escape except his own for want of adequate naval drills among his handpicked elite but the confusion was only temporary catapults and ballistic machines were rolled into position and clamped in place then loaded and cocked by means of large wheels with ratchets infantrymen sheathed their swords took up spears and formed a tight cordon along the rail their shields creating an unbroken barricade at elevated positions behind them archers took their places other soldiers attended the archers standing by to shield them and supply them with arrows i found a place to stand atop an elevated platform amidship all around us in the darkness loomed the big transport ships some were sailing for the harbor entrance while others hung back such a coordinated operation without benefit of lights or other signals meant they were following a precise order of evacuation determined beforehand the acoustics on the harbor were baffling i heard indistinct shouts and the faraway clatter of battle but couldnt tell which noises came from the city and which echoed across the water from the harbor entrance ship after ship sailed past the breakwaters and into the open sea i thought i could see exchanges of arrows and missiles between the ships and the men on the breakwaters but the darkness and the distance made it impossible to discern any details as pompeys ship drew nearer to the harbor entrance queuing up to run the gauntlet the incendiary assault began from both breakwaters catapults hurled flaming missiles toward the ship passing between by their illumination i saw a bizarre sight caesars men were frantically dismantling their own defenses on the breakwaters tearing down the towers and mantlets and casting the debris into the water the missiles fell short more incendiary missiles were fired these too fell short but the terrific splashes created great explosions of steam at the same time some of the debris cast into the waves caught fire dotting the harbor entrance with points of flame the wrack of smoke and steam posed a hazard to the ship ahead of us obscuring the captains sightlines he sailed off course veering sharply toward the northern breakwater i heard a loud curse behind me and looked over my shoulder pompey was only a few paces away he seemed not to notice me all his attention was on the battle the ship ahead of us veered farther off course bedeviled now by a sudden change in the wind it sailed directly toward the tip of the northern breakwater until from our perspective a collision appeared imminent i heard pompey suck in a breath but there was no collision the ship skimmed past for a moment because of the confusion of the smoke the ship appeared to have sailed safely outside the breakwater on the seaward side then i heard a groan from pompey and realized the truth the ship was still inside the harbor sailing close alongside the breakwater barely managing to avoid a scraping collision and apparently unable to pull back into the open harbor it came to a standstill held in place by the change in the wind trapped against the breakwater easily within range of arrows and missiles from caesars men who let out a cheer that echoed across the water the vulnerable ship easily might have been deluged with incendiary missiles but the enemy apparently preferred to take it intact as we discovered in the next moment they had the means to do so the officer scribonius came running to pompey imperator look behind us back toward the city the last of the transport ships had set sail which meant that the last of pompeys covering guard had safely withdrawn from the city walls and taken flight but that also meant that the city was now completely open to caesars men given the barricades and traps in the streets it was reasonable to assume that they should still be making their way through the city yet the quays behind us glittered with torchlight not only had caesars men already taken the port but some had manned fishing vessels and were boldly sailing toward the breakwater evidently planning to board the trapped transport ship scribonius gripped pompeys arm imperator shall we turn about and engage them we might fend them off and buy more time for the ship trapped against the breakwater no we cant risk running afoul of the breakwater ourselves that ship is lost to us now theres no saving it if i could id set fire to it myself to keep caesar from having it sail straight on scribonius withdrew how can he do it pompey pounded his fist against the mast how can he move so fast what sort of pact has caesar made with the gods it isnt humanly possible even if the damned townspeople showed his soldiers safely past every barricade and trap how can so many of them already be at the port and what madness impels them to set out after us in those small ships caesar himself must be there urging them on i gazed back at the port and imagined caesar standing at the end of the quay in the very spot where pompey had stood only moments before his red cape fluttering in the breeze gazing out at pompeys ship as we vanished into the clouds of smoke and vapor at the harbor entrance i shut my eyes and prayed that meto was there with caesar safe and whole and that davus was there as well regretting not too bitterly that he had done as i told him i imagined my son and my soninlaw together and safe on the quay and clung to that image damn you finder i opened my eyes to see pompey glaring at me flames from burning flotsam in the water all around us pierced the smoke and lit up his eyes youre caesars man arent you i shook my head not understanding pompey scowled that slave you adopted your precious son meto hes been caesars cozy tentmate for years and youre one of caesars spies hes always had your loyalty admit it not even caesar could have gotten so many men through the city so quickly without spies to help him how long have you been in contact with the townspeople how well did you know those street rats who almost killed me was it you who put them up to it no wonder you begged for their lives great one youre mistaken what youre suggesting is impossible ask tiro he came with me all the way from rome yes you managed to leech onto tiro and fool even him davus he must have been your inside man spying on me all this time and i thought he was an idiot great one this is madness firelight danced across pompeys face i would not have recognized him he seemed to be possessed by something not human a god or a demon i couldnt tell which hackles rose on the back of my neck ahead of us loomed more smoke and flames i heard shouting from either side taunts and curses from the men on the breakwaters i heard the creak and snap of catapults and ballistic engines fireballs hurtled toward us shrieking like harpies scribonius screamed orders catapults return fire archers return fire pompey stared at me oblivious to the battle commencing around us great one i havent deceived you theres no plot im not caesars man he clutched my throat in his grip i felt all the fury that must have been growing in him day by day ever since he fled rome my vision dimmed his face swam before my eyes above the pounding blood in my ears the screams and shouts around us seemed hardly more than whispers a fireball landed so close that we were doused with cold water followed by steaming mist soldiers cried out broke ranks and hastily reformed pompeys grip never loosened i struggled to pry his fingers from my throat if youre not caesars spy then tell me what you came to tell me who murdered numerius all along i had known it would come to this in my mind especially on sleepless nights i had rehearsed this moment many times i had come almost to look forward to it the secret was heavy i wanted to lay it down the shame was bitter like wormwood on the tongue i wanted to be cleansed of it but in my imagination the time and place of my confession had always been quiet and dignified in some private council chamber with all ears pricked to hear me out like oedipus on the stage never like this in the heat of battle with death and darkness all around and pompey already furious and ready to strangle me i was barely able to force the words past the hands around my throat i killed him what happened was the opposite of what i expected pompey abruptly released his grip and drew back why do you say such a thing finder why do you lie do you know who killed numerius or not i killed him i whispered i swallowed hard and rubbed the bruises on my throat how peculiar i thought why bother to soothe the little irritations of a body that has no future beyond the next few moments i had known when i stepped aboard pompeys ship that i would die there though i hadnt expected the end to come so quickly i had known when i set out from rome that i would never come back from the start i had hoped somehow to trade myself for davus and so gain some value from my death beyond an end to my own shame scribonius ran the length of the ship waving a sword over his head starboard catapults fire at will all archers fire to starboard we had sailed perilously close to the southern breakwater so close that a fireball overshot and flew screaming over our heads trailing streamers of smoke and a shower of sparks why said pompey his madness turning to confusion if you did such a thing why confess in the veils of smoke around us i saw numeriuss bulging eyes and bloated lifeless face above the roar of the battle i heard his mothers tremulous voice and the sobs of aemilia weeping for a child never to be born to be rid of the regret i said the remorse the guilt pompey shook his head skeptically as if he had heard of such emotions but had no firsthand knowledge of them but why would you kill numerius the question contained another unspoken had he overlooked something obvious been made a fool of numerius came to my house that morning to blackmail me never numerius was mine he worked only for me numerius worked for himself he was a schemer a blackmailer he had a document evidence of a plot to kill caesar a pact signed by the conspirators my sons was the first signature the document was written in metos own hand even the grammar was his i lowered my eyes your son caesars favorite when and why meto turned against caesar i dont know numerius said he had other incriminating documents hidden somewhere he demanded money far more than i could pay he refused to lower his price he said he was about to leave rome unless i paid he would send the documents at once to caesar caesar knows metos handwriting as well as i do it would have been the end of him i had only a moment to decide pompey curled his upper lip the garrote around his neck a souvenir from a past investigation numerius waited in the garden i went to fetch money from my study but i brought back the garrote instead he was standing at the foot of minerva with his back to me whistling at the sky so arrogant he was young strong i doubted my strength but it wasnt as hard as i thought it would be another fireball shrieked above our heads so close i flinched by its lurid glare i saw the growing rage on pompeys face what happened to the document he showed you i took it to my study i burned it in the brazier that was when davus came into the garden and found the body then davus knew the truth all along no i told him nothing of the blackmail or the murder i told no one not even my wife or daughter to protect them if theyd known and you suspected but that wasnt the real reason it was shame guilt i had come full circle how could i expect a man like pompey to understand to slaughter hundreds or thousands in battle was a glorious thing pleasing to the gods to kill a single man was murder a crime against heaven i had killed men before but only in desperate selfdefense when the choice was no choice at all my life or anothers never from behind never in cold blood when i killed numerius something in me died i had always secretly imagined myself to be better than other men men like pompey or caesar or cicero would doubtless look down at me and laugh at such a conceit but i had always taken pride and comfort from knowing that while others might be richer or stronger or higherborn still i was better gordianus freed slaves and adopted them gordianus stood aloof to the greed and grubby passions that drove respectable romans into the law courts where they tore at one another like vicious beasts gordianus did not cheat or steal and seldom lied gordianus knew right from wrong by some infallible internal moral sense yet had compassion for those who struggled with shades of gray gordianus would never murder as pompey had said killing people was not his style yet gordianus had done just that strangling the life out of another man in his own garden in doing so i had forfeited the thing which set me apart from other men i had lost the favor of the gods i felt it the instant numerius pompeius crumpled lifeless at my feet the sun withdrew behind a cloud the world became colder and darker that moment had brought me directly inevitably to this moment i was prepared for whatever happened next i resigned myself to the fates davus was rescued i had seen meto alive and well bethesda and diana and eco and their children were all safe or as safe as anyone could be in a broken world if it was true that numerius had other documents that compromised meto hidden away somewhere my only regret was that i had not been able to find them and destroy them for metos sake in my mind along with my confession i had also pictured what would follow i had imagined pompey summoning henchmen to dispose of me out of his sight i had never imagined him leaping on me like a wild beast his hands tearing at my face i covered my eyes he seized me by the hair and knocked my head against the mast my ears rang i tasted blood in my mouth he threw me to the deck he screamed and kicked me wildly i somehow scrambled to my feet i ran blindly stumbling and tripping over coils of rope colliding with cold armor cutting my cheeks and arms and shoulders on arrows and spears amid the smoke and sea spray faces looked back at me aghast they were frightened not of me but of the madman behind me every man on the ship teetered on the swords edge of mars poised between life and death the sight of their commander reduced to an insane rage unnerved them a fireball flew over the ship it grazed the mainsail tracing a fringe of flame along the top edge soldiers panicked scribonius cried out cut it loose cut it loose men scurried up the mast daggers flashing between their teeth hands clutched my shoulders i gave a start then saw it was tiro gordianus what have you done what did you say to him by the light of the leaping flames above our heads i saw pompey no more than five paces distant the look on his face turned my blood to water in another instant he would be close enough for me to see my reflection in his eyes it was a dead man i would see there i broke from tiro turned and ran somehow i sprouted wings how else can i explain the leap that took me over the heads of the men who stood in close formation along the ships rail for a moment i thought i would fall short and be impaled on their spears a spearpoint did pierce my shin and rip through the flesh scraping the bone i screamed at the pain an instant later i plunged facefirst into water so cold it stopped my heart and froze the scream between my lips a powerful current sucked me deep beneath the surface this was the end neptune not mars would claim me my crime would be purified by water not fire the cold was excruciating the darkness was infinite the current twisted me this way and that it spun me about almost playfully as if to prove i was powerless to resist i lost all sense of direction suddenly i was startled to see brightly flickering spots ahead of me like sheets of yellow flame had the current sucked me all the way down to the seabed to a fissure that opened into hades that seemed impossible for my senses told me that i was traveling upward not down the frigid current drew me closer and closer to the flames until i felt the heat of the burning flotsam on my face done with me the hand of neptune expelled me from the water i emerged into a scorching airless void of flame i sucked in a desperate burning breath i was to be purified by water and fire alike part three dionysus xxiii hunched forward in a chair pulled close to my bedside davus propped his chin on his hands and stared at me i wondered what profound thought was crossing his mind speak i said the single word exacted an excruciating price bubbles of molten lead seemed to burst in my throat i felt an urge to cough and struggled against it coughing caused unspeakable agony i swallowed instead swallowing was a torment but bearable davus tilted his head and frowned i was only thinking fatherinlaw how much better you looked when you had eyebrows during endless hours of drifting in and out of consciousness i had noticed a little mirror of polished silver hung on one of the walls the rooms only ornament i had not yet asked davus to take it down so that i could have a look at myself perhaps it was just as well i closed my eyes and drifted back into oblivion when i opened my eyes davus was just as he had been before i breathed in through my nose my sinuses seemed to be lined with suppurating blisters still it was less painful than breathing through my mouth how long davus cocked his head attentively since i was last awake i managed to say the pain of speaking brought tears to my eyes nonetheless it seemed slightly less painful than before yesterday davus said yesterday you woke up for a while you said speak thats the most youve said since they pulled you out of the harbor when was that davus counted on his fingers one two three days ago three days had passed and i remembered nothing not even dreams nothing except endless water black and cold flames smoke a floating plank fireballs careening overhead the stench of singed hair and burning flesh men screaming a sudden jolt jagged rocks beneath the water coming to rest half in the water half out the sky above cold and black and endless but mantled with stars growing lighter each time i woke from fitful dozing iron gray then palest blue then oyster pink voices arms lifting me aloft useless someone said why bother hes not one of ours that big fellow knows him and the big fellows got silver in his pouch wrapped in linen laid in a wagon other bodies in the wagon alive or dead davus leaning over me looking down his face almost unrecognizable i had never seen him weep before an endless journey of bumps and jolts then finally coming to rest upon a bed unimaginably soft in a cool dim quiet room a womans voice if you need anything else another voice i could use something to eat that was davus i felt hungry too but was too weak to speak and when the food came the smell of charred flesh sickened me what else could i remember pompeys face contorted with rage tiros face alarmed and confused i tried to push those images aside and see other faces bethesda diana meto i said no its me davus misunderstanding leaned over me and smiled i shook my head but where ah davus understood hes with caesar on their way back to rome when they left the day after pompey fled caesar made a speech in the town forum thanked the citizens for their help left a garrison in charge and then headed north on the appian way meto went with him that was three days ago you saw meto oh yes should i tell you about it are you up for listening i nodded well then after i left you not half an hour passed before i found meto easy enough since he was with caesar hard to miss that red cape i met them coming from the forum on the same street we took with pompey caesars bodyguards might have killed me but i did as you said and threw down my sword meto was glad to see me i told him what youd done leaving with pompey caesar was in a hurry to get to the port i showed them how to avoid the traps we got to the quay just as the last of pompeys men were casting off from the end of the quay i recognized pompeys ship just starting to sail out the harbor entrance i pointed it out to meto he pointed it out to caesar we watched the ship run the gauntlet for a while it looked like pompey was in big trouble veering toward the southern breakwater i said a prayer to neptune for you it was hard to see much on account of the darkness and the smoke but i could swear i saw someone jump overboard meto didnt see it neither did anybody else they told me i imagined it that no one could have seen such a thing at that distance but i was sure would you like some water i nodded davus fetched a pitcher and poured water into a clay cup i took it from him there were cuts and burns on my hands but nothing crippling swallowing was not as painful as i expected my stomach growled hungry i said davus nodded ill get the cook to make you something easy to eat maybe some cold gruel the food here is pretty good should be for what were paying people say this is the best inn in brundisium too much seafood for my taste i gestured for him to get on with the story where was i oh yes pompeys ship it got through all right but just barely you should have seen the look on caesars face thinking he might have caught the great one after all like a cat staring at a bird but in the end pompeys ship squeezed out of the harbor smooth as a dropping from a sheeps bottom so did the rest except for a couple of ships that ran afoul of the breakwater caesar sent little boats to board them and take the men prisoner what a night that was everything a mad scramble and meto always in the middle of things davus frowned he wasnt as upset as i thought he would be about you sailing off with pompey he got that look on his face you know where you cant imagine what hes thinking or at least i cant and he said maybe it was all for the best you running off with pompey and tiro he asked me if i intended to go back to rome with him because if i did id have to keep my mouth shut he didnt want caesar or antony to know that youd gone with pompey not yet i suppose he thought it would make him look bad having his father sail off with the enemy i showed him the money you gave me and told him i didnt need his help getting home i think he was glad to be rid of me that was that the next day after his speech in the forum caesar was off just as well i wanted to stay around here for a while longer anyway i took another sip of water why because i was sure i saw somebody jump off pompeys ship or get pushed off and you thought it was me why i just had a feeling i cant explain it i knew something wasnt right the way you gave me all that money the way you talked as if you didnt expect to ever come back he shook his head i had to make sure the afternoon after caesar and meto left i decided to walk all the way around the harbor starting at the southern breakwater since that was the end pompeys ship sailed nearest to some of caesars men from the garrison were posted to watch for bodies washing up on shore so thered be no looting most of the men they found were dead some had arrows in them some were horribly burned to tell you the truth i never expected to find you alive when i saw your face and you opened your eyes his voice became husky he lowered his eyes i nodded then meto doesnt know no he thinks youre with pompey wont it be a surprise when we get back to rome and he lays eyes on you maybe by then your eyebrows will have grown back the cold gruel from the kitchen was actually rather soothing to swallow i was famished but davus was careful to keep me from eating too much too quickly eventually i had the courage to ask him for the mirror i was not horribly disfigured after all my eyebrows had been singed off and the effect was not flattering but there were no serious scars or burns on my face i had inhaled more seawater and smoke and fiery vapors than was good for a man i was covered with nicks burns blisters and bruises especially around my neck where pompey had choked me and there was a nasty pusfilled wound at my shin inflicted by the spearpoint i scraped against when i leaped off pompeys boat i had been feverish and delirious when davus found me but once the fever broke i recuperated swiftly some men in my position might have imagined that they had been saved by divine intervention spared from oblivion for the sake of a special destiny i saw myself instead as a minnow too small to be caught in neptunes net or a sodden twig thrown onto hadess brazier that had sputtered but failed to catch fire i was anxious to get back to rome i was even more anxious to see meto again in caesars camp it had been impossible to speak to him candidly there was much i wanted to tell him and to ask him we eschewed tiros shortcut through the mountains and set out on the appian way following in caesars wake he traveled at a pace that seemed almost impossible considering the size of his army press as i might i soon realized that we couldnt possibly match his speed much less catch up with him i would have to wait until we reached rome to see meto again at every town along the appian way arriving a few days after caesar we found the people in the taverns and markets and stables talking of nothing else wherever he appeared caesar had been greeted with thanksgiving local magistrates pledged loyalty to his cause if there were those who would have preferred to see pompey triumphant they kept their mouths shut the weather was mild at beneventum my fever recurred and we lost a day of travel but otherwise we made good time we returned to rome through the capena gate as the sun set on the nones the fifth day of aprilis diana wept at the sight of davus bethesda wept at the sight of me mopsus and androcles did not weep but laughed with joy meto had been to see the family only once the day after he arrived in rome he had told them that davus was on his way but that i had gone off to dyrrhachium with pompey my homecoming was unexpected by all concerned not least myself and all the sweeter for that one face was gone from the household but missed by no one except perhaps androcles and mopsus the bodyguard cicatrix posted by pompey to watch my household had been ordered by meto to leave and never return with his master across the sea and caesar in charge of rome the slave had meekly obeyed glad to keep his head no one knew where he had gone eco and his family came to the house that night after a boisterous dinner the two of us withdrew to my study and drank watered wine long into the night i feared he would press me to explain how i had arranged for davuss release and managed to escape from pompey myself but like the rest of the family he seemed to assume i had resorted to simple trickery for the time being i continued to keep secret the truth about numeriuss murder and metos treachery eco apprised me of the latest gossip from the forum news of pompeys flight followed almost at once by caesars arrival had sent alternating tremors of dread and jubilation through the city the senate or what remained of it had been summoned by caesar to meet on the kalends of aprilis exactly what caesar had demanded and how the senators had responded was the subject of much speculation but it was obvious that no senator with the stature or the will to stand up to caesar remained in rome there were persistent rumors that caesar would appear in the forum to speak to the citizenry but so far that had not happened it might be that he feared a hostile reception even a riot rumblings of discontent had begun when caesar broke into the sacred treasury in the temple of saturn which was the peoples security against foreign invasion the huge stores of gold and silver ingots had been set aside for use only in case of barbarian invasion and had remained intact for as long as anyone could remember the fleeing consuls had debated whether to open it and had decided to leave it untouched caesar had pilfered it like a common thief his excuse the sacred treasury was originally established by our ancestors to be used in case of attack by the gauls having personally eliminated any such threat by conquering gaul i now remove the gold the tribune metellus attempted to stop the illegal plunder he barred the sealed doorway with his own body caesar told him if i must metellus i shall have you killed believe me to threaten such a thing pains me considerably more than would the actual doing of it metellus withdrew caesar had stolen the sacred treasury he had threatened the life of a tribune in the performance of his duties for all his continuing rhetoric about negotiating with pompey and restoring the constitution the message was clear caesar was prepared to break any law that restrained him and to kill any man who opposed him what of cicero on his way to rome caesar had visited him at formiae he asked cicero to return to the city and attend the senate cicero delicately refused and made a point of going to his hometown of arpinum instead to celebrate his sons belated toga day caesar was tolerating ciceros neutrality for now would pompey be as understanding if he came sweeping back through italy with fire and sword poor cicero trapped like aesops rabbit between the lion and the fox what of your brother meto i asked i understand he paid the family a visit the day after caesar arrived and thats the only time any of us have seen him said eco too busy to leave caesars side i suppose theyll be off again any day now if rumors are true caesar is leaving antony in military command of italy and hurrying off to spain to fend with pompeys legions there i shook my head i must see meto before he leaves of course papa caesar and his staff are housed in the regia in the middle of the forum as pontifex maximus thats his official residence you and i will stroll down there tomorrow i want to be there to see metos face hell be as surprised to see you as the rest of us were no i want to see meto alone in a place where the two of us can speak privately i pondered the problem and had an idea ill send him a message tonight ill ask him to meet me tomorrow certainly eco reached for a stylus and wax tablet dictate and ill write it for you no ill write it myself eco looked at me curiously but handed me the stylus and tablet i wrote to gordianus meto from his father beloved son i am back in rome i am well no doubt you are curious about my peregrinations as i am curious about yours meet me tomorrow at midday at the salacious tavern i closed the wooden cover of the tablet tied the ribbon and sealed the ribbon with wax i handed it to eco would you see that one of the slaves delivers it im too exhausted to keep my eyes open for another minute of course papa eco looked at the sealed letter and frowned but made no comment xxiv in contrast to the brilliant sunshine outside the gloom of the salacious tavern was nearly impenetrable the unnatural darkness lit here and there by the lurid glow of lamps filled me with a vague unease that mounted quickly and explicably into a kind of panic i almost fled back to the street until i realized what i was reminded of the cold murky waters beneath the flaming flotsam at brundisium i took a deep breath managed to return the smile of the fawning proprietor and walked across the room bumping my knees against hard wooden benches the place was empty except for a few silent patrons who sat hunched over their cups drinking alone i found my way to the bench built into the corner at the far side of the room it was where i had sat when i last visited the tavern to meet with tiro according to both the tavernkeeper and tiro it was also where numerius pompeius liked to sit when negotiating his shady transactions his corner he called it tiro had told me did the lemur of numerius lurk in the shadows of the salacious tavern on my last visit i had felt a twinge of uneasiness at occupying the place where numerius had sat and schemed now i felt nothing i suddenly realized that i had not seen his face in my dreams nor thought much about him at all since the night i confessed to pompey and leaped from his ship expecting to die with the murder of numerius my pretensions to moral superiority had died at brundisium my feelings of guilt had likewise died i was not proud of the fact nor did i question it i was stripped of both selfrighteousness and selfrecrimination i was like a man without gods no longer sure what i felt or thought or believed or where i belonged in the scheme of things according to a public sundial not far from the tavern entrance i had arrived a little early with the punctuality born of his military training meto arrived exactly on time his eyes were younger than mine and adapted more quickly he peered into the darkness for only a brief moment before spotting me and crossing the room with a firm stride not bumping into a single bench it was hard to read his face in the dimness but there was something stiff and uneasy in his manner before either of us could speak our host descended on us i asked for two cups of his best meto protested that he never drank wine so early in the day i called after the tavernkeeper to bring water as well meto smiled this is becoming a habit papa turning up where youre least expected the last i heard i was sailing to dyrrhachium with pompey himself davus says you werent entirely displeased at the news meto grunted hardly a fair trade if you ask me you taking the place of davus i didnt quite understand the point pompey had a kinsman murdered and forced you under protest to look for the killer and davus was taken as a sort of surety he shook his head awfully petty behavior for the great one truly hes lost his wits it was rather more complicated than that meto did davus not tell you the name of pompeys murdered kinsman no it was a young man named numerius pompeius even in the dim light i saw the tension that creased metos face does that name mean something to you perhaps the tavernkeeper brought two cups of wine and a pitcher of water meto on the day before pompey fled rome numerius came to my house he showed me a document a kind of pact written in your hand in your style for that matter signed by yourself and a few others you must know what im talking about meto ran a fingertip around the rim of his cup numerius had this document yes what became of it i burned it but how i took it from him he tried to blackmail me meto he threatened to send the document to caesar to expose your part in plotting caesars assassination meto turned his face so that a shadow fell across his eyes but i could see the hard line of his mouth and the scar he had received at pistoria and numerius was murdered he never left my house alive you i did it for you meto his shoulders slumped he shifted uneasily he picked up his cup and drained it he shook his head papa i never imagined numerius told me he had other documents equally compromising also in your handwriting could that be true were there other such documents papa answer me he wiped his mouth yes meto meto how in hades could you have been so careless to let such documents fall into the hands of such a man numerius told me he hid them somewhere i searched i wanted to destroy them but i never found them i sighed what became of the plot meto did the others lose their nerve i know you didnt youre anything but a coward did it become impossible to carry out are you still planning to do it or have you had a change of heart he didnt answer why did you turn against him after all these years meto did you finally see him for what he is men like caesar and pompey theyre not heroes meto theyre monsters they call their greed and ambition honor and to satisfy their socalled honor theyll tear the world apart i grunted but who am i to judge them every man does what he must to protect his share of the world whats the difference between killing whole villages and armies and killing a single man caesars reasons and mine are different only in degree the consequences and the suffering still spread to the innocent papa perhaps you became too close to him meto intimacy can turn to bitterness people say that you and he did he slight you in some way was that the break between you a fallingout between lovers papa it isnt what you think then tell me he shook his head i cant explain it doesnt matter what matters is this as long as caesar remains alive and those documents still exist somewhere youre in terrible danger should they ever be discovered and brought to his attention papa what happened on pompeys ship in the harbor at brundisium it was as davus told you i took his place by telling pompey that i knew who killed numerius as we were about to run the gauntlet pompey demanded that i tell him then and there so i did i told him everything he was like a raging animal i went aboard his ship never expecting to leave alive meto but i leaped overboard and somehow survived and davus found me the next day thank the gods for that papa he took a long breath you say that you told pompey everything did you tell him about the plot to kill caesar yes and about my part in it yes did he believe you not at first but in the end yes meto fell silent for a long moment you must believe papa that i never intended for you to be drawn into this he turned toward me lamplight illuminated his eyes the look on his face was so miserable that i reached for his hand and covered it with mine he allowed the touch for a moment then abruptly stood up papa i have to go now but meto his eyes glimmered brightly papa whatever happens dont be ashamed of me forgive me meto he turned and left bumping blindly against the maze of benches his silhouette reached the foyer and vanished what had i expected from our meeting more than this meto had told me nothing he was trying to protect me of course as i had tried to protect him i was left with the same unanswered questions and blind conjectures that had been spinning in my head for months i had not yet touched my wine i reached for the cup and drank slowly gazing into the dark corners of the room the murkiness that had unnerved me when i entered the tavern i now found comforting the tavernkeeper ambled over with a pitcher more wine why not he refilled the cup and ambled off i sat and drank and thought what would become of meto what would become of caesar and pompey and cicero and tiro and maecia and aemilia the warmth of the wine spread through me i found myself staring at one of the uncertain silhouettes across the room and imagining that it was the lemur of numerius pompeius the fantasy became so powerful that i could almost feel him staring back at me i felt no fear instead i thought what a fine thing it would be if i could wave him over and invite him to share a cup if lemures drink what would i ask him that was obvious had he lived would he have married aemilia after all despite the fact that pompey had plans for him to marry someone else or would he have spurned her dooming the unborn child as surely as his death had doomed it and of course i would ask him where in hades he had hidden the other documents where in hades indeed i laughed a bit tipsily at the notion i had eaten no breakfast that morning and like meto i wasnt used to drinking in the middle of the day my thoughts wandered aimlessly thanks to the wine thanks i thought to dionysus the god of wine looser of loins emancipator of minds liberator of tongues even slaves could speak freely on the liberalia the day of dionysus because the sacred power of wine transcended all earthly shackles through wine dionysus illuminated the minds of men as could no other god not even minerva so it was there in the salacious tavern that dionysus gave me wisdom how else to explain the chain of thoughts that led me to the thing i sought something tiro had said about numerius popped into my head in the very spot where i sat numerius had boasted to tiro of certain documents he had come by the evidence of the plot to assassinate caesar the sheer danger of possessing them and the lucrative possibilities for blackmail had exhilarated him he had told tiro im sitting on something enormous where were those documents numeriuss mother had searched the family house i had searched his secret love nest numerius must have had some other hiding place for the documents im sitting on something enormous numerius had been drunk when he made that boast to tiro perhaps only a man equally drunk could see that he meant exactly what he said with my fingers i examined the bench beneath me the seat was worn smooth from long use the boards seamlessly joined i leaned forward reached between my legs and rapped my knuckles against the boards which formed the upright the bench sounded hollow i remained bent over and blindly ran my fingertips over the flat surface behind my calves the wood there was not as smooth and polished as the seat there were little splinters and rough spots made by kicking heels but no loose boards except for one spot near the corner where a board was split my finger discovered an empty nail hole youre not throwing up on the floor are you the tavernkeeper alarmed at my posture suddenly stood over me gods man if you need a pot ask for one i ignored him and pushed at the loose bit of board to no effect i wriggled my little finger into the empty nail hole and pulled instead slowly but surely a part of the split board yielded just enough to allow me to slip my forefinger then my middle finger behind it the hidden recess was small and narrow but with two fingertips i was able to pinch the tip of something wedged within i pulled too quickly and lost my purchase i tried again making grunts that further alarmed the tavernkeeper slowly painstakingly i extracted several pieces of parchment very tightly rolled into a cylinder the circumference of my little finger i sat upright and sucked in a deep breath gripping the parchments in my fist the tavernkeeper loomed over me a lumpy silhouette with hands on hips i think perhaps you should go now he said yes i said i think perhaps i should i longed to find meto at once the regia was not far away just across from the house of the vestals then i realized even as inebriated as i was how foolish i would be to carry incriminating material into caesars residence i had to destroy the documents first but before i did that i wanted to take a look at them the only safe place to do so was in my own home i made my way through a maze of alleys to the ramp and trudged up the palatine hill imagining i might be stopped at any moment by caesars spies davus met me at the door i told him to bar it behind me and rushed to my study i unrolled the parchments and scanned them quickly curious to see if they were as incriminating as numerius had suggested they were the handwriting was indisputably metos to judge by the dates the plot to kill caesar had been devised even before he crossed the rubicon one sheet was a manifesto of sorts enumerating reasons why caesar must be put to death chief among them was the absolute necessity to avoid a civil war that could end only in the destruction of the republic the men named in the documents were the same staff officers who had signed the pact numerius had shown me on the day of his death which i had taken from his dead body and burned i laid the documents in the brazier and set them aflame i watched them burn and held my breath until the last bit of parchment withered to ashes the fear that had gripped me ever since my visit from numerius came to an end in the place where it began now i needed to tell meto i called for davus together we made our way down to the forum outside the regia the line of citizens waiting to be seen by caesar stretched almost to the capitoline hill among them i recognized senators bankers and foreign diplomats some wore widebrimmed hats others were attended by slaves who held parasols aloft to protect their masters from the glare of the sun and from the gaze of gods who would be ashamed to look down and see what could only be described as supplicants awaiting audience with a king i went to the head of the line i told a guard that i was the father of gordianus meto ive come to see my son i said not here went out on some errand a little before midday yes he came to see me i need to see him again hasnt come back yet no do you know where he might be should be here but hes not nobodys seen him i know because the imperator was just asking for him i see when he comes back will you give him a message certainly tell him its urgent that i talk to him as soon as possible i shall be at home waiting to hear from him no reply from meto came that day the next morning i went down to the regia again i found the same guard i asked to see meto not here the man stared straight ahead with a stony countenance where is he couldnt say did you give him my message yesterday the guard hesitated couldnt say what do you mean you couldnt i mean that i shouldnt be talking to you at all i suggest you go home now i felt a cold weight on my chest something was wrong i want to find my son if i have to ill stand in this line and wait my turn to see caesar himself i wouldnt suggest it you wont get in to see him why not the guard finally looked me in the eye go home lock your door talk to no one if the imperator wants to see you hell send for you soon enough i hope for your sake he doesnt what do you mean the guard refused to answer and stared stonily ahead i lowered my voice do you know my son i thought i did whats become of him please tell me the guard worked his jaw back and forth gone he finally said gone where he looked at me his eyes were almost sympathetic word is hes run off to massilia to join up with lucius domitius you didnt know i lowered my eyes my face flushed hotly meto a traitor whod have thought it the guard spoke without rancor he felt sorry for me i did as the guard advised i went home i barred the door i spoke to no one was metos flight to massilia the result of long deliberation or was it the act of a desperate man a wouldbe assassin who feared he might be discovered at any moment if i had found numeriuss hiding place only moments earlier while meto was still with me would he still have fled to massilia i stirred the ashes in the brazier in my study and wondered at the joke the gods had played on me xxv a few days later caesar left rome headed for spain his route would take him along the mediterranean coast of gaul and past the citystate of massilia which was now defended by lucius domitius with his six million sesterces and some semblance of an army domitius had lost corfinium to caesar without a struggle would he do better at massilia if caesar took the city would he pardon domitius a second time what sort of mercy would he mete out to the massilians what mercy would he show to a defector who had plotted to kill him to save meto i had done something unspeakable now he would have to save himself i felt like an actor who leaves the stage before the final scene with no more lines to speak while the drama goes on was this how lemures felt observing the living i felt abandoned by the fates the snarled thread of my life had come unraveled from their tapestry and dangled in the void i felt mocked by the gods who were not yet done with me one morning about the middle of aprilis a stranger came to the door he told davus that he had olive oil to sell davus told him that the mistress of the house was out bethesda having gone with diana to the fish market the man asked if he might leave a sample of his product he handed davus a small round clay jar and departed the incident seemed innocuous enough but i had told davus to report all visitors to me without exception he came at once to the garden where i sat brooding beneath the statue of minerva whats that i said a jar of olive oil at least thats what the man said what man davus explained i took the jar and examined it a piece of cloth had been pulled over the short narrow spout at the top tied with twine and sealed with wax the jar itself appeared unremarkable near the base two words were etched into the clay on one side was the word olivum on the other massilia olive oil of massilia i said a fine product but a curious coincidence i wonder davus bring an empty jar while he was gone i untied the string and broke the wax seal the cloth covering the spout appeared to be nothing more than a swatch of white linen i removed the cork it too appeared unremarkable even so i cut it open it was solid all through when davus returned i slowly decanted the contents into the empty jar scrutinizing the thin stream that glistened with golden highlights do you think it might be poisoned asked davus i touched my finger to the stream and sniffed it it pours looks and smells like olive oil to me i finished emptying the little jar then held it so that sunlight shone into the spout i peered inside but saw only flashes of oily residue i shook the jar and turned it upside down nothing came out but a few more drops of oil curious i said but why shouldnt a merchant of fine imported olive oil leave us a free sample of his wares stranger things have happened what about this fatherinlaw davus held up the other jar now brimming with golden oil well offer it to minerva it seemed a logical solution if the oil was what it was purported to be it was of the highest quality and fit for an offering to the goddess if it was what davus feared it could do no harm to a goddess made of bronze i took the jar from davus and set it on the pedestal at her feet accept this offering and grant us wisdom i whispered it couldnt hurt the jar which had originally held the oil now empty i placed on the paving stone beside my chair i sat and closed my eyes letting the warm sunlight of aprilis warm my face my thoughts wandered i dozed suddenly i was wide awake i went to my study among the scrolls in my pigeonhole bookcase i located the memoirs of the dictator sulla i scrolled past political scandals slaughters looted cities visits to oracles homages to favorite actors sexual braggadocio and finally found the passage i was looking for a military commander and political leader must often resort to sending secret messages i credit myself with having invented a few clever methods of my own once when i needed to send secret orders to a confederate i took the urinary bladder of a pig inflated it stoutly and let it dry that way while it was still inflated i wrote upon it with encaustic ink after the ink was dry i deflated the bladder and inserted it into a jar then filled the jar with oil which reinflated the bladder within i sealed the jar and sent it as if it were a culinary gift to the recipient who knew beforehand to open and empty the jar in private then break the jar to retrieve the bladder upon which the message remained perfectly intact i dimly recollected having read the passage long ago i had no recollection of ever having discussed it with meto but i presumed he had read every volume in my small library besides that sullas autobiography was exactly the sort of thing that caesar would have pored over while composing his own memoirs and dictating them to meto the fact that the jar was manufactured in massilia could hardly be a coincidence i returned to the garden minerva seemed to smile down sardonically as i struck the jar against the paving stones it broke neatly in two and fell apart the bladder within held the shape of the jar i carefully unwrinkled the creases then fully inflated it with my breath the glistening coating of oil made the tiny wax letters appear still warm and pliant as if meto had just painted them the message began at the top of the bladder and wound around it in a spiral i turned it slowly as i read papa after you read this message destroy it at once i should not be writing to you at all but i cannot let you go on believing a lie the truth has always mattered so much to you i have always been loyal to c i still am no matter what you may hear the plot against cs life was a fiction the documents which n obtained were false contrived with cs knowledge and at his behest they were deliberately passed to n through an intermediary whom n trusted the intent was for n to pass them on to p believing them to be genuine so as to convince p that i and some others were hostile to c and could be suborned by the opposition thus we could infiltrate the enemys higher circles but instead of passing them on to p n decided to use them for his own purpose i never foresaw that he would blackmail you and draw you into the deceit when i think of what you did meaning to protect me i feel hot with shame i know how deeply that act went against your nature yet your confession to p of my part in the fictitious plot may have done more to convince him of my disloyalty to c than my original scheme would have done thanks to you my mission is at last feasible excuse these crude sentences i write in haste for my sake destroy this message at once there was a crowded postscript added in a corner in letters so small it made my eyes ache to read them the night before c crossed the rubicon he dreamed that he committed incest with his mother i think the dream was a message from the gods to pursue his destiny he would be compelled to commit terrible acts of impiety he chose destiny over conscience so it is with me papa to follow my duty i dishonored the man who freed me from slavery and made me his son i kept secrets from you i let you believe a lie i am an impious son but i made a choice as c did and once the rubicon is crossed there can be no turning back forgive me papa i read the entire message again slowly to be sure i understood it then i took it to the brazier in my study the burning oil and pigs flesh gave off a smell that reminded me of brundisium the crime i committed thinking to save my son had actually served to thwart his secret plans the confession i made to pompey thinking to cleanse my own conscience had actually served to let meto proceed with his scheme the world believed my son had fled to massilia as a traitor to caesar in fact he was caesars spy now deep in the enemys camp was his peril less than i had thought or greater i returned to the garden i sat and gazed at minerva i had prayed for wisdom and received it but instead of making things simpler each new piece of knowledge only made the world more mystifying from the front of the house i heard the sounds of bethesda and diana returning from the fish market i called their names a moment later they appeared in the garden daughter bring davus wife send for eco its time for this family to have a meeting its time for me to tell my family the truth aprilis passed the month of maius brought clear skies and mild sunshine trees came into leaf weeds sprang up and wildflowers bloomed amid gaps in the paving stones the coming of spring brought a sense of relief however illusory from the dreadful uncertainties of war from gaul came word that massilia had closed her gates to caesar who left behind officers to mount a siege while he pressed on to spain old soldiers in the forum argued over how long the siege would last the massilians were stubborn fiercely proud people some thought they could easily fend off any army for however long it took for reinforcements to arrive from pompey others argued that fortune was with caesar and the siege would be over in a matter of days rather than months could the massilians expect the same clemency caesar had shown in italy or would the city be leveled its defenders slaughtered and its people sold into slavery i tried not to imagine what might happen to a spy discovered in such desperate circumstances or mistaken for the enemy by his own side one morning as i headed down the ramp with mopsus and androcles the sheer perfection of the spring day banished all gloomy thoughts my spirits rose on a zephyr of warm sundrenched air on a sudden whim i decided to tend to a task i had been putting off ever since my return we walked straight through the forum without pausing i wanted no rumors of catastrophe to spoil my mood the daily dose of fear and mayhem could wait for another hour the boys didnt ask where we were going they didnt care to be out and about in the city on such a glorious morning was its own reward vendors hawked their wares slaves carried baskets to market matrons flung open their shutters to let in the mild sweet air of spring we came to the carinae district on the lower slopes of the esquiline hill and walked down the quiet street to the blue and yellow house where maecia lived the black wreath of mourning still hung on the door my buoyant mood faltered but i took a deep breath and gave the door a few polite knocks with the side of my foot an eye peered at us through the peephole before i had time to state my name the door swung open mopsus and androcles emitted squeals of delight the noise startled me almost as much as the sight of cicatrix abruptly towering over me my heart raced i braced myself for one last joke from the gods had i unwittingly on a perfect spring morning delivered myself to nemesis in the form of one of pompeys trained killers but the thought was irrational a guilty reflex at the sight of the black wreath unless some secret network of messengers had relayed the news directly from pompey cicatrix knew nothing about my crime nor did maecia i cleared my throat so this is where you ended up it made sense all of pompeys other relatives had left town cicatrix raised an eyebrow which further contorted the scars on his face until the great one comes home i grunted and made no comment cicatrix glowered at me then helplessly cracked a grin as he lowered his gaze to mopsus and androcles but i left these two spies behind to take my place he crouched and playfully boxed at the two of them the boys jabbed back at him and burst out laughing cicatrix whos there the voice came from within he straightened immediately a visitor mistress gordianus he stepped aside maecia appeared in the foyer the light from the atrium silhouetted her slender figure and haloed her sheer blue stola and the great shelllike fan of hair arranged atop her head with her green eyes and creamy skin without makeup or adornment she had been beautiful when i last saw her now she took my breath away more than anything else it was her smile that transformed her i had not seen her smile before gordianus i understood from cicatrix that you sailed to dyrrhachium with pompey i looked sidelong at cicatrix an untrue rumor i said there are so many circulating these days come in as for your slave boys i think theyd like to visit with cicatrix if that wont compromise his duties of course not they can help him guard the door we stepped into the atrium where previously the corpse of numerius had been displayed upon its bier there was only bright sunshine through a colonnade i could see into the garden at the heart of the house i caught a glimpse of another woman seated amid flowering shrubs do you have a visitor maecia if im intruding no im glad youve come well sit and talk in the garden for a while the days too beautiful to do anything else but i want to speak to you privately first she led me to a little room off the atrium she lowered her voice before he was expelled from your house cicatrix overheard your son say that youd gone with pompey a misunderstanding but you did go to brundisium yes you saw pompey i did she hesitated did you ever find out why my son was murdered i drew a breath perhaps eventually pompey would tell her if pompey ever came back to rome alive but there was no way i could tell maecia the whole truth i could however answer this question yes i know why numerius was killed he was attempting to blackmail someone using information that he should have passed directly to pompey and the gold i found he may have blackmailed others i knew it was something like that but it wasnt pompey who i shook my head no pompey was in no way responsible for numeriuss death she sighed good that was what i feared most that numerius betrayed pompey and pompey found out if my son had been a traitor and pompey put him to death for it i could endure anything but the shame of that then you must never think of it again maecia i cant tell you who killed numerius but i know beyond any doubt that it wasnt pompey your son wasnt as loyal to the great one as he might have been but he never betrayed him thank you gordianus you comfort me she touched my hand my face flushed hotly maecia noticed you need a cool drink gordianus come into the garden were drinking honeyed wine she led me down a hallway and through a colonnade into bright sunlight the woman in the garden sat with her back to me she wore a matronly stola and her hair was styled much like maecias she looked over her shoulder for a moment i failed to recognize her smiling face i sucked in a breath when i realized it was aemilia maecia sat beside her and the two linked hands a slave brought another chair and poured me a cup of wine for which i was grateful my face was still flushed and my mouth was suddenly dry i had come prepared to see numeriuss mother but not his lover the two of them seemed to be in unaccountably high spirits holding hands and practically beaming perhaps it was simply the weather i thought perhaps it was the honeyed wine but why was aemilia dressed as a married woman as i observed the loose folds of her stola i noticed a telltale swelling at her belly aemilia saw the expression on my face she grinned you kept the baby i said my voice hardly more than a whisper she patted her belly proudly yes but how i thought my mother insisted that i get rid of it at first but maecia wanted me to keep it its numeriuss child after all maecia went to see my mother it wasnt easy but the three of us found a solution maecia explained we devised a little fiction numerius and aemilia were secretly married you see behind everyones backs why not theres no one to say that they werent i even had the marriage recorded officially the bribe was ridiculously cheap as numeriuss widow theres no reason aemilia shouldnt have his child thats why shes living with me now as my daughterinlaw and when pompey and aemilias father and my brother and sons all come back her eyes misted and there was a catch in her voice when they come back they may not be happy with what happened behind their backs but what can they do but accept it she sighed these things are so much easier to work out with all the men out of the way i nodded dumbly another conspiracy more deceits and secrets and schemes but meant to save life not destroy it from the foyer i heard mopsus and androcles burst into giggles joined by cicatrixs braying laughter the noise was infectious maecia patted aemilias belly and the two of them laughed as well i sipped my honeyed wine and heard the echo of gods laughing
