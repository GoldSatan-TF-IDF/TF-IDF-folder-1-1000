allan mallinson a call to arms foreword in some officers and men all regulars were stationed in britain for domestic security which meant since the possibility of invasion had receded beyond imagination for law and order but after the threat of major disorder of revolution even receded too and by the number of troops in britain had fallen to financial retrenchment generally was the order of the day the army estimates in had been million in they were less than a quarter of that and by the end of the decade they had fallen even further for by then the army was less than half the size of its high point at the time of waterloo and yet as today the army found itself called on to do more not less as imperial commitments began to mount i have been surprised by remarks by otherwise kind reviewers on the question of what captain matthew hervey and the th light dragoons would find to do after waterloo the inference being that the world was at peace the answer then as today is that the british army is never at peace not one year has gone by since that great battle without a british soldier dying by hostile hand no other army in the world save perhaps that of india can claim such a testimony the army of today has been shaped over a long age and some of the most important shapers have been small wars in distant places they gave british officers and ncos the habit the unrivalled habit of decisionmaking and responsibility at junior level in other words of command but the lessons were sometimes learned hard the memory of victory over the french was like a dead hand at the horse guards as far as reform and innovation were concerned in the colonial engagements of the three decades after waterloo superior british discipline and firepower the same musket volleys as at waterloo were enough to see off the enemy in the one arena that might have tested the armys readiness for largescale war india jealousies and assumptions of innate superiority led to a general despising of indian experience for which the army was to pay dearly in the crimea and indeed in india itself at times so where did hervey and his brother officers of the postwaterloo army blood their swords or at least draw them in a regimental affair we saw the sixth at police work in the midlands to counter luddite and nascent chartist violence and then in british north america in the wake of the war of where fear of territorial aggrandizement by the united states tied down troops for years to come and saw a costly programme of fortifications and canals and although angloamerican relations developed harmoniously for the most part there were periodic disputes and indeed the occasional rebellion in canada itself the settlements in africa at the cape and the gold coast drew the army into action in the s and s there were flareups throughout the caribbean expanding trade led to conflict with china the troubles between settlers and maoris in new zealand were to occupy troops at one point small wars in distant places the sun never set on the british army and throughout there was india where an increasing number of kings and later queens regiments was needed to supplement the largely native army of the honourable east india company and if it is true that for the most part all these distant imperial commitments were those of in the duke of wellingtons words the best of all instruments british infantry in the s and s up to seventyfive per cent of the british infantry were stationed abroad or were in transit nowhere was the mounted arm more valuable than in the presidencies of bombay madras and bengal where speed of response could pay dividends out of all proportion i commend the essay on soldiery in this period by professor peter burroughs coeditor of the journal of imperial and commonwealth history in the oxford illustrated history of the british army it gives a sobering picture of the conditions of service for the men whom later kipling would call beggars in red i am as usual indebted to several people in this the fourth of my cavalry tales and i am very fortunate that they remain the same people as before i record here my continuing and sincere appreciation of their enthusiasm patience and wisdom i would make particular mention this time of anthony turner who has worked on each of the manuscripts in the series i am especially grateful for his keen and questioning eye and so after the simple certainties of the napoleonic wars and the year or two that it took for the congress of vienna to establish the new world order we begin to observe how officers young and old had to settle to the new reality just as they had to do in the decade that followed the end of the cold war prospects for promotion were blighted they knew the army was not the place it was yet somehow these men carried the day in battles around the globe but then as in the aftermath of the cold war it was not so much the army that pulled them through as that accidental act of genius the regiment in captain matthew hervey had left the army not by submitting his resignation to the horse guards but by writing to the colonel of the th light dragoons and then by sending his regimental commission to the sixths agents to be sold on that was the regimental system curse god and die he swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet he saith among the trumpets ha ha and he smelleth the battle afar off the thunder of the captains and the shouting the book of job part one england an old mad blind despised and dying king

would transform the parade from extended line into a military amphitheatre the timebeaters of the regimental band and all the brass and woodwind could not muffle the crunch of gravel and the ringing of spurs bonnie nell the sixth marched to this morning herr hampers choice of music was always enigmatic a year ago they had paraded for private hopwoods flogging to the strains of seventeen come sunday indeed there were many on parade this fine autumn morning who were minded of that day the last time the regiment had formed hollow square standfast number two squadron remainder inwaaards dress the regimental serjeantmajors voice echoed about the barracks as if he were shouting from a dozen places at once heads and eyes in the flank squadrons shot right or left boots shuffled forwards and rear until the ranks were straight and aligned with the left and right markers of second squadron the rsm turned right about advanced ten paces and halted in front of the major saluting sharply with his right hand sir there are two hundred and eightyfive men on parade sir the major made no reply the rsm turned to his right saluted and marched towards the right marker and thence for the rear of the centre squadron fall in the officers the majors words of command were more than an invitation but feeble compared with those of the stentorrsm when the officers had taken post the major turned about in a little circling movement unlike the rsms emphatic pivot and advanced ten paces to where the general officer commanding the london district stood with the sixths adjutant at his side my lord there are twentytwo officers and two hundred and eightyfive other ranks on parade thank you eustace said the general quietly he walked towards the open side of the hollow square the major falling in beside him and halted a few paces before it by command of the horse guards it is my duty to have read before the whole regiment on parade the following despatch from the commanderinchief not a word was spoken but there was a distinct buzz in the ranks the adjutant took a pace forward opened the red portfolio he was carrying under his scabbard arm and began to read his royal highness the prince regent has been pleased to confirm the findings of the court martial convened on september the fifth eighteen hundred and eighteen to try the evidence against lieutenantcolonel the earl of towcester of the unnecessary hazarding of his command in the americas and for conduct unbecoming an officer contrary to the articles of war the court finds that lieutenantcolonel the earl of towcester is guilty of the grossest negligence in exercising his command in the face of hostile irregulars and of conduct on numerous occasions beforehand revolting to every proper and honourable feeling of a gentleman the buzz returned the rsm threw his head to left and right and though not a man could have seen him the noise stopped abruptly his royal highness directs that lieutenantcolonel the earl of towcester be dismissed from the service the buzz returned louder than ever the rsm maintained his eyes front and the general waited patiently be dismissed from the service with disgrace the buzz continued until the rsm silenced it again the commanderinchief directs that these findings be read out at the head of every regiment in the kings service this last brought so great a shock that the buzz did not recur for some moments but louder still was the noise when it did come as you were the rsm brought three hundred heads back to attention in an instant the general would now have his say after waiting for the silence to have its effect this is an unhappy day for a regiment it is an unhappy day for our country when an officer fails to do his duty it falls now to every man of the sixth light dragoons to do his duty to the utmost as indeed you have done it in the past conscious that the rest of the service looks at you let it see not the unhappy example of an officer unfit for his position but the regiment of corunna salamanca albura and orthès and of waterloo he paused to a silent count of three god save the king god save the king came the reply but none too fullthroated major joynson suddenly saw his duty light dragoons god save the king he roared startling the rsm as much as anyone god save the king bellowed the sixth the general saluted and turned away carry on major joynson he barked sir adjutant carry on sir regiment to your duties diiismiss at once the parade ground was a cacophony of words of command from the captains and serjeantmajors as each troop took itself off to stables skillatarms or fatigues whatever was the order of the day a troop more than the others could be forgiven if its collective thoughts were on what was past rather than on what lay ahead serjeant collins perhaps spoke for them all as he fell in beside the troop serjeantmajor theres two men i shouldve liked to hear that ay and its an empty place as well without armstrong replied the serjeantmajor fred its going to take more than mr lincoln to get things as they were ay an rsm can only do so much i suppose joynsonll become colonel collins hesitated i suppose he will chapter two paradise of exiles the caffè greco rome six months later who is the severe fellow there the enquirer a boyishlooking man of about twentyfive stood at the bancone of the meeting place of romes literati and artisti drinking strong arabica i do not know replied his companion save that he is english or that he reads english at least for i saw him with an english newspaper yesterday the younger man brushed a dark curl from his forehead and took another sip of his coffee but now he is reading goethe so by that reckoning he might equally be german his companion gave a prolonged shrug i have observed him here several times this week continued the younger man draining his cup he has a decidedly melancholic air he takes not the slightest interest in anyone around him he seems wholly absorbed in himself and that my dear friend is singular in this city even for an englishman then he would be dull company and not worth your regrets declared his companion giuseppe he said to the cameriere on the other side of the bancone nodding to the object of their curiosity il penseroso lá chiè the italian was without the accent of the country the cameriere shrugged his shoulders unufficiale inglese dicono ma con me parla solo francese the younger man nodded does he have any companions giuseppe ha amici the cameriere said something by reply but fair though his italian was his questioner did not catch the sense he says that a young woman joined him yesterday explained the other handsome but not dressed with fashion english too then certainly said the younger man raising his eyebrows but had she been german she would likely as not have been neither fashionable nor handsome replied the older one smiling oh rome is a harsh court in such matters but in any event an english officer reading goethe has a sensibility i can respect dicono che ha combattuto nella battaglia di waterloo added the cameriere helpfully the boyishlooking mans ears pricked now that is worth my regrets he declared glancing again at the seated reader he surely has a tale to tell but i would not disturb his engagement with goethe for all that we shall see him at an assembly soon no doubt i am surprised indeed that we have not done so already perhaps both he and his lady companion are of an unsocial disposition perhaps the younger man placed a few scudi on the counter grazie tante giuseppe he said with an air of a man who had learned something of advantage grazie a lei signor shelley replied the cameriere as the two men turned to leave matthew hervey for more than a year plain mister and for more than a week an habitué of the caffè greco still owned to mixed feelings at being in the city of the popes one at least of his fathers profession the rector of the neighbouring parish had called the city the whore of babylon when hervey and his sister had announced their intention to visit and although there was nothing like so vehement a despising of rome in his fathers parish hervey possessed the englishmans instincts he did not care for the picture of black spectres pursuing temporal ambitions especially usurping ones his history he knew very well indeed and yet there was no doubting that he liked the easy ways of this city he had seen no especial excess of luxury or vice even in the pages of goethe he saw little that might seriously offend an unprejudiced conscience what he did see in rome was gaiety in large measure and he was most glad of it and his sister too always a sure weathercock of propriety seemed as glad as he that he was still himself restrained from joining with that gaiety did not diminish his appreciation of it one of the things that contrived to diminish any tendency to gaiety on his part this morning was the knowledge that he must go to the post office the rome post office which stood halfway along the via del corso from where he now sat was to his mind a true representation of bedlam his two previous visits to send letters to england and to collect others restantes had been tedious in the extreme and he now braced himself for another unedifying morning spent in what passed for a queue in this city he paid for his coffee tipped the cameriere too generously why should someone not be pleased with his day and said arrivederla to the grecos overstarched proprietor the sky was without a cloud and the sun was already hot he found it uncomfortable to walk any faster than a stroll and he resolved to press his tailor to finish the two linen coats he had ordered a few days before if he and elizabeth were to stay here through july he would need at least two more and it was as well to know the cutters capabilities as soon as possible and elizabeth too would need new clothes he wondered if he would be able to persuade her of it as he made his way along the corso he saw one exquisite female after another going in and out of the palazzi he knew he simply had to persuade her when he reached the post office he was at first afraid that it might be closed innumerable saints days could catch out even the romani for there was no press at its doors only a mandolinplayer with whom an official was noisily remonstrating hervey edged past them carefully it was all too easy to be hailed as witness by one or other parties in a roman dispute to enter the cool marbled hall there he was cheered further to see only a dozen or so people waiting and he took up his place where he judged the queue to end deciding there was little need to open his volume of goethe to help the time pass indeed not many minutes passed before his attention was arrested by a tall powerfully built man in a military cloak who suddenly turned to the man beside him at the counter and said very loudly in english what are you that damned atheist shelley the man to whom the charge was directed turned to face his challenger and in that instant was struck by him with such force that he fell to the floor stunned hervey sprang forward at once seizing the assailants cane with his right hand he jabbed his left fist into the mans face so hard that both nose and upper lip split bloodily but still the attacker struggled violently to wrest the cane free until hervey drove his knee into the mans groin and followed through with his right fist to nose and lip again the man reeled brought both hands up to his face and dropped the cane hervey snatched it up and grabbed him by the collar threatening to bring the cane down on his head if he resisted more the man yielded and hervey pushed him to his knees others in the post office had remained bystanders but someone had sent for help and two gendarmi now arrived a swiss gentleman helped the victim of the assault to his feet and hervey cursing himself for being so out of breath was pleased to surrender custody of the assailant to the agents of the law wiping the blood from his hand and concealing the stinging pain in his knuckles he turned to the innocent party are you well sir he asked with more composure than the native bystanders could believe i thank you sir i am quite well enough the man brushed the curl from off his forehead dusted down the arms of his coat and bowed briskly shelley sir at your service hervey returned the bow hervey sir may i enquire as to what induced that assault you did not hear i am afraid i did not i stood accused of the infamous crime of atheism shelleys face was white there was blood about his lips and tears in his eyes i have been knocked down before but never with so little forewarning i wish id my pistols they would have done you no good before the blow and might have caused you trouble afterwards replied hervey stooping to pick up shelleys hat i thank you again sir it is the very devil of a business when an englishman is assaulted by another in a foreign place the gendarmi were trying to tell them something without success until the official from the altercation with the mandolinplayer intervened signori the gendarmi wish you to accompany them to the office of the questura there are papers which must be signed shelley dabbed at his lips with a handkerchief and then at his eyes i am sorry sir he said to hervey i am not given to such emotion but the blow stung horribly hervey smiled think nothing of it sir it was a brutal assault i shall be glad to give what evidence i can it took an hour and more for the questura to complete the investigation when it was done the two men left together shelley seemed recovered you will permit me to give you a glass of wine sir i should like that yes said hervey at least he did not have to go back to the post office for the official had obligingly brought his letters to the questura they set off back along the corso you went at that wretch like a tiger hervey hervey raised his eyebrows it is the only way if one is forced to fight i assure you there is little profit in dancing about you evidently have considerable experience in the matter and yet you have not the look of a pug hervey nodded obliged you are very kind sir you are a very soldierly man for all your sensibility hervey was startled by the intimacy of his companions knowledge he did not reply shelley frowned come sir i am reliably informed that you are one of the duke of wellingtons men yet i saw you lately in the caffè greco with a volume of goethe hervey nodded very slightly again as if taking the measure of what he had heard you should not be so reliant on your informants i am no longer in the kings service as you wish sighed shelley indulgently and you sir you have served of late i have not shelley said it with what might have passed for disdain of the notion but ought i then to think meanly of myself for never having been a soldier i cannot say what you should think your time has in all likelihood been spent honourably the wretch who assailed me would not share that view perhaps he does not know you so well he does not know me at all hervey and i know even littler of him hervey was wholly mystified but he objected to you most strongly by your account as well as the evidence of my own eyes he had evidently formed an opinion of me at a remove only very slowly did it begin to dawn on hervey who his new companion might be the man himself had given no clues save for the implication that he had a reputation beyond his range of acquaintances hervey knew that reputation only a little and largely through his late wife he had not himself read any of the work forgive me sir are you the poet shelley shelley smiled for the first time his face was transformed you have the soldiers directness hervey what is there to forgive i am indeed that atheist poet shelley hervey felt the warmth of both smile and words and you have the candour of your reputation sir ah my reputation are we not all prisoners to what we would have the world think of us it was my understanding sir that your reputation was for not caring what the world thought shelley smiled again though not so full and your opinion of me will have been formed by the organs of crown and church and you will not have read a word of what i have written i confess i have not but neither has my opinion been so formed as to tend to anything hervey might have explained that his sister had read his poetry and henrietta but such confidences were not possible in ten times this intimacy they talked of the city for the rest of the way to the caffè greco they passed any number of places in which they might have taken wine but the greco was familiar to shelley and the familiar was comforting giuseppe looked surprised by shelleys reappearance and in the company of the man who only an hour or two before had been a professed stranger the inglesi were a strange people always polite but cool even cold in their manner except signor shelley he was a gentiluomo like the others certainly but signor shelley was also simpatico shelley called for a bottle of his favoured rosso from the castelli romani come he said conspiratorially to hervey let us sit in the seclusion of one of these arches i would know a little more of what brings you to rome you may learn of my reasons from any number of people i dare say they took up seats beneath a particularly vivid depiction of the rape of the sabine women hervey sipped the thin red wine which they drank chilled and eyed his companion carefully there was nothing he feared but he was not inclined to vouchsafe anything either no matter how inconsequential to someone who might use it frivolously i am here on indefinite vacation good a promising beginning and do you find goethe informative regarding the eternal city where is your book by the way hervey looked surprised and frowned i recall that i have left it at the questura never mind we can go there tomorrow to retrieve it but first tell me of it hervey was again surprised at shelleys presumption of intimacy though that was not to say he found it unwelcome i find it a very faithful guide then you have a keen understanding of german i would that there were a passable translation hervey was now conscious that his conversation lacked the spontaneity of his companions and unusually it troubled him and you sir what do you do here he tried though sensing at once its inadequacy shelley put down his glass and swept a hand about the room i delve for the glory that was rome and seek in it inspiration the words seemed entirely unaffected on shelleys lips hervey searched for something by way of return and are you here in company was all that the muse could summon a wife and child and you my sister shelley nodded you were at waterloo were you not that is my understanding i cannot think how you might know sir for i have not spoken of it since leaving england i should very much like to hear account of it i have not met with any who was there hervey gave a sort of sigh to indicate the difficulty of obliging him it was a very long day and the field was enormous but shelley was not put off he thought for a moment or two and then asked would you join us this evening we shall be a small party but an attentive one it was the first invitation hervey had received since arriving in the city ten days before but he was still not greatly inclined to accept i think i must decline sir as i told you i am accompanied by my sister and she then it would be doubly delightful and not only for me but for my other companions of her sex hervey was severely discomfited he had no desire of excessive female company shall we say nine oclock our lodgings are at the palazzo verospi on the corso number near the post office im afraid the mention of the post office engendered just the degree of sympathy necessary for hervey to conclude that his declining would be an unkindness i am much obliged i can answer for my sister since we have no fixed engagements we shall come at nine good so let us take a little more of this wine then for our stomachs sake as st paul would have us believe hervey frowned even though he surmised the show of scepticism was for his benefit but he took another glass and there they stayed a full hour speaking of rome and her glories later in his lodgings in via del babuino il ghetto inglese hervey reflected on the mornings turn of events he had befriended was it not too strong a word an atheist revolutionary and libertine elizabeth had lost no time in reminding him of the history of mr shelley and his elopements halfremembered from henriettas teasing accounts and the rest he had pieced together for himself recalling the usual tattlers during the years that his attention had been distracted by those who would destroy the kingdom by the sword rather than by the pen shelley had by all accounts brought to bed two if not three or even four women girls indeed so that there was issue out of wedlock unacknowledged perhaps and this the poet would defend as a right way of living would propagate it even who knew therefore what were shelleys arrangements at present and what dissipation he hervey and elizabeth might soon be a prey to he could only ponder on what a journey he had made these past months from honourable rank in his majestys light dragoons some would say a primmish captain to supper companion of a dangerous and amoral poetaster was he prepared to pay any price to put elizabeth and himself an evenings distance from painful memories he shrugged he wished he had at least read some of shelleys poetry it would surely tell him more of the man than mere gossip could but his own tastes in that direction had advanced only slowly so that hitherto he had remained devoted above all to the milton of his schoolroom through henrietta he had read coleridge and with her keats but shelley had not so far engaged him elizabeth had not objected to suppering with the shelleys however elizabeths pleasure was her journal and it had often been her lament that its pages were full of things that no one could have the least interest in but herself not that she harboured literary ambitions rather was she occasionally in despair of being at no longer five and twenty without anything more to record than domestic trifles if only she could write of her time at the workhouse or in the hovels of warminster common her memoir might stand as something of real consequence but good works were one thing to itemize the meanness and dissipation of rural life in a ladys journal was quite another italy had seen her able to write infinitely more interesting pages already but of the countryside and art of people her entries were as yet restricted save in the case of her brother whose progress she noted with anxious attention and of henrietta whom she missed so much more than any but her journal knew sometimes through tear marks rather than ink at nine oclock they took a carriage to shelleys lodgings for although it was not far elizabeth had been at pains to dress and hervey had no wish to take the edge off her success by chancing to their feet when they arrived at number via del corso they found their host agitated i am very glad to meet you miss hervey shelley replied after herveys introduction but my wife is unwell im afraid and makes her regrets we shall go instead to signora dionigis she holds a conversazione this evening it will be very diverting now hervey was troubled but we do not know signora dionigi that will not matter in the least the signora likes nothing more than to meet new people elizabeth whose face was suffused by a colour far from her usual assured their host that they would be delighted to go to the signoras for in truth mr shelley we have not been much in company these past months hervey did not care for the idea of this conversazione which sounded like nothing so much as the flummery of some ageing widows salon even the black humour which could descend on him of an evening might be preferable but he could not deny his sister her diversion even if he himself had no inclination for festive company signora marianna dionigi was no dilettante however ageing she might be but she was also a painter of some distinction an antiquary of impressive learning and therefore unlikely to be seduced by worthless flattery she was tall upright her face to herveys mind was a little too farded but her features were very fine her dress was distinctly italian rather than french above all she had kind eyes she took elizabeths arm and introduced her to the room first in french then in english elizabeths shot silk was perhaps a little out of place among the dresses of the foreign ladies but it did not matter greatly for hervey observed that she was as handsome in essentials as any in the room and with expert assistance might outshine at least half of them for a quarter of an hour before supper began shelley tried in vain to engage hervey in conversation to draw from him some response to a question of fact or some opinion on this or that perhaps he thought it was that hervey watched too keenly for his sister or that the liveliness of the company made it difficult for him to be at ease at any rate shelley saw enough not to persist and with the utmost politeness left him to himself as they made for the dining room there hervey was relieved to find a table from which the guests helped themselves so that he was able to slip unnoticed into the library he had no appetite and he could pass an hour or so pleasurably there now elizabeth was at her ease and engaged in conversation but he was not long allowed his solitude for signora dionigi was an attentive hostess and she sought him out after a while may i bring you some wine mr hervey she asked in french hervey had in his hand a book of engravings of roman antiquities oh i beg your pardon signora i did not wish to appear the signora smiled the more mr hervey we do not follow a formula at these gatherings i had rather you took your pleasure in a book if it were not to be had elsewhere you are very kind signora i am not averse to company as a rule but it is your business alone mr hervey we romans are not nearly so constrained by obligation now hervey smiled gratified by her discernment thank you signora and yes i should like a little wine if i may the signora despatched her attendant have you known mr shelley long she asked now in english we met only this morning signora but you admire his poetry he hesitated i am very much afraid that i have never read any of it would you like to he had expected a tone of surprise of disapproval even the signora was indeed the most considerate of hostesses as well as attentive i would of course madam so obliging had been her reply that he could not have said otherwise she took a small volume from the drawer of a writing desk here mr hervey you will see what a great poet is our friend mr shelley do not hurry he will repay proper study join us only if you feel inclined that should be the way with conversazione hervey bowed in appreciation he truly felt disinclined to the gaiety of the room next door and the signora had sensed it and he did wish to read a little of shelleys poetry for he had a mind that it might tell him something of the man their time together that morning although short had endeared the poet to him to an uncommon degree half an hour passed perhaps more during which hervey was interrupted only by a manservant bringing him champagne and from the first moments with alastor the demon spirit of solitude he recognized that the poetry stood comparison to any he had read equal certainly to coleridge and keats in the pleasure the words themselves gave and equal in some respects even to milton in heroic invention he did not know how much it truly told him of the man however it seemed in fact to speak most aptly to his own condition and so well that he found himself reading lines aloud twice over wildly he wandered on day after day a weary waste of hours bearing within his life the brooding care that ever fed on its decaying flame and he marvelled at the poets economy in describing what he himself could barely admit and now his limbs were lean his scattered hair sered by the autumn of strange suffering sung dirges in the wind his listless hand hung like dead bone within its withered skin he shivered almost as he spoke this last life and the lustre that consumed it shone but it was shelley himself who spoke the culminating lines as in a furnace burning secretly from his dark eyes alone hervey looked up you approve of my philosophy captain hervey asked the poet smiling with some pride i am no longer captain as i explained this morning and i should have to read much more before i were able to make any worthy remark even as he spoke hervey heard the stuffed shirt and inwardly he groaned but shelley seemed only diverted by his reserve and by what he considered to be further evidence of sensibility come with me tomorrow he said on an impulse to my favourite place in all of rome hervey was intrigued where the place i hide from the world and work shelleys eagerness could compel indeed hervey did not imagine he had met a more compelling man i must make sure my sister will be content in my absence but for myself i should say that i would deem it an honour that compelling way also took hervey into the music room where he saw that elizabeth was very agreeably engaged and smiling and he told himself if elizabeth could be so diverted then perhaps his previous withdrawal was needless as well as selfish next morning hervey left his lodgings in via babuino a little before a quarter to nine to walk by way of the piazza di spagna and via frattina to the via del corso all along frattina the sun was full in his eyes and his progress was slow as a rule he found frattina an easier street to negotiate at this hour than condotti or borgognona with their shops and stalls and hawkers but even by this route he could advance but slowly this morning so that he had to step out along the corso to make his appointment on time only when he collided at full tilt with a ribbonseller did it occur to him that he was not bound by any military obligation to be so exactly punctual he caught but little of what the woman said except that some of the ribbons having fallen to the ground were ruined he stumbled in french and his few words of italian to make amends watched by a growing number of passersby and soon found himself with a good number of the fallen ribbons in exchange for more scudi than he supposed was strictly necessary the immediate outcome was that he reached the palazzo verospi at ten minutes past nine his hands and pockets full of brightly coloured streamers shelley greeted him with an eager smile and an extravagant handshake i was afeard you would come very precisely on your hour as a military man and find me illprepared for i could not lay hands on my notebook but now i have it and we may leave at once what do you intend with those ribbons hervey explained their provenance i thought i might take them for my sister she was complaining of a want of colour in her wardrobe how italians do love ribbons declared shelley taking a broad yellow and white one and draping it across his chest to resemble some papal order more so even than the french i heard tell that napoleon was a little too italian in his love of them bonaparte the imperial name was still unutterable to hervey perhaps i could not safely say i should not imagine you to be so easily seduced hervey frowned you were very dull last night not a word of waterloo did you utter within my hearing shall you be dull again today hervey could not find it in him to bridle against the remark it is not my intention good then let us be away perhaps i may leave some of these for your wife said hervey taking another handful of ribbons from a pocket shelley seemed dismissive you may but it will be some days before she is in humour to be gay hervey laid them on a table without remark he had not been so selfabsorbed at the signoras not to have heard the speculation there the shelleys had had a turbulent time in naples it seemed and the precise status of their travelling companion was evidently of some moment where do we go to the baths of caracalla ill warrant you never saw such a place in your life the wager just permitted for hervey to have seen them already but in truth he had not yet explored them seeing them only distantly and very indistinctly from the palatine it had been his intention to engage a guide and go there with elizabeth in a day or so he would not spoil shelleys enthusiasm in the sharing of a secret however and he therefore made no reply indeed hervey said little throughout their approach march but it was not dullness that made him silent only that the poet was a most zealous guide and there was little to say beyond an appreciative word here or an interrogatory one there they tramped the forum skirted the colosseum briefly traced the line of the ruined walls of romulus explored the circus maximus for a while where shelley was keen to hear herveys opinion of the turning circles and speeds of the chariots that had once raced there and then followed the stream called acqua crabra for half a mile until they reached the object of their excursion they came on it curiously abruptly though the baths were as massive as any structure in the city now hervey what think you tell me your thoughts ere i tell you mine herveys immediate thoughts were of india the jungled ruins of the great terme of the emperor marcus aurelius antoninus known as caracalla for he favoured that gaulish mantle above the roman toga looked for all the world like the palace at chintalpore overrun by the forest he could therefore picture what must have been in this place rather than seeing merely crumbling brick and tangled bines nature is remorseless i should say it was a prosaic response perhaps but shelley was heartened by it and expressed his approval freely nature is the ultimate barbarian hervey the goths cut the aqueducts which gave the baths their spirit and others stripped the place of its marble but it is nature that overwhelms it in the end crushes and devours it like an enormous serpent never was any desolation more sublime and lovely though hervey nodded slowly it thrills me more than i can say indeed it is a scene which overpowers expression but hervey was not so transported that he did not see the paradox if it overpowers expression why does a poet seek inspiration here is there not other seclusion where you might summon the muse shelley smiled captain hervey you would have me believe your heart is of stone or lead no not lead for that is the soldiers precious metal come theres a winding staircase here like a mountain path we can reach the summit of these towers and so wonderfully overgrown with myrtle is it that you will have no thoughts but of the wilderness he rushed ahead hervey followed as if it were indeed a mountain path having a care to place a hand at all times on something which might save him were the stones beneath his feet to expire after their sixteen long centuries of trampling shelley climbed carelessly however like a boy who knows the boughs of a great oak well and wishes to display that knowledge to another except that hervey was certain there was no such intention in his guide for a man less affected in his fervour he could scarcely imagine all about them was nature reclaiming a thick entanglement of myrtle and bay and whiteflowering laurustinus of wild fig and countless nameless plants which the four winds had sown high above circled buzzards as if patrolling the via appia sentinels to the two friends solitude and below them flapped hooded crows which brought to herveys mind a happy boyhood at horningsham its jackdaws and their prankish flight there were indeed special places and this he would readily concede was one shelley sat in an arch a hundred feet and more above the ground and took a black leather notebook from his pocket shall you write asked hervey wondering whether he should explore elsewhere in the ruins to give the poet his peace i mean shall you compose something as we sit no not at once replied shelley removing the seal from an ink bottle i shall sketch a little first i like to compose the place when later i contemplate the lines hervey settled on the other side of the arch and took out his own leatherbound volume much smaller now shelley was curious what is that my prayer book and what will you find there i had it with me throughout the war so you find consolation i generally try to read the offices of a morning and evening do you indeed are you bent on ordination hervey simply smiled it has been a habit for so long shelley made careful pen strokes looking up occasionally at the arch tell me something of yourself hervey who are your people hervey placed the marker at the open page though he did not close the book my father is archdeacon of sarum archdeacon of sarum said shelley not looking up this time that is a preferment which speaks volumes ordinarily perhaps but in my fathers case it does not he is only very recently translated thus from an exceedingly poor country living i beg you do not think us fattened by tithes and extensive glebe shelley chuckled still intent only upon the arch and his sketchbook i am glad he was not so poor that you could not come to rome that expense was my own said hervey mildly insistent the spoils of war only in a manner of speaking everything is but the manner of its speaking hervey i was lately in india and was rewarded for service to one of its princes india a vast plunderinghouse for the honourable company hervey would not be drawn and we know there is a sister of spirit and education said shelley sketching still who else i had an older brother in holy orders he died five years ago i am sorry for it how did he die perhaps it was shelleys concentration on the pen strokes that made him so direct hervey supposed but it startled him nevertheless he died of a winter ague in oxford fellow of which college hervey hesitated he was curate of a parish thereabouts a poor one i understand shelley stopped his sketching momentarily to look across at his companion i am sorry he was a truly good man but shelley would not allow the mood to be sombre beyond the moment and no female has secured this sensible military man and his fortune coming so soon after mention of john hervey it was as if a spent ball had struck him square in the breast knocking out the wind it did not matter that he knew it must come at some time i was bereaved of my wife but a year ago shelley looked up again his expression horrified you too my dear fellow my dear dear fellow he placed his hand on herveys forearm squeezing hard to impart his sympathy hervey knew of shelleys circumstances for elizabeth had told him harriet shelleys estranged wife had taken her own life scarcely two years before the circumstances could not have been more different from his own and yet he was not inclined to imagine anothers heartache was less than his but although he might concede that he was not yet inclined to entrust this man with his grief he made no response now i see the cause of last nights melancholy and the distance generally in your air i pray you would tell me more of it shelley had laid aside his book and he now looked him in the eye with a directness which spoke of candour hervey saw in that instant that if he did not now trust his grief to this man he might never do so to any he closed his prayer book took a deep figurative breath and began his story he told of the earliest days of henrietta in the schoolroom of his first going on campaign of his returns and his fumbling courtship of their becoming wed and their shortlived bliss and of the fruit of that passionate union he told how he had struggled for half a year with his conscience respecting a craven and vindictive commanding officer and the obligation of loyalty to a superior and then he related the circumstances and manner of henriettas dying a cold lonely affair terrifying knowing above all needless in the course of not one half of one hour hervey supposed he had spoken of more with this man than with any living soul when he was finished shelley who had sat throughout with arms clasped about his knees like a rapt schoolboy hearing some dorrying tale gazed silently into herveys eyes and saw what was left unsaid yet which he knew must not remain so and your loves cold grave is of your bringing you believe it is i could own to no others accountability not even your craven commanding officer his guilt seems amply proven and that is the opinion of everyone at his court martial he was censured for it though there was no culpability in law his destruction has given me no relief though shelley looked out across the roman plain countless thousands must have died by the hand of others there and might do so again why was a single life worth repining over i would read you some fragments of verse i am composing when you have the inclination to hear them hervey would not have wished for the consolation of scripture at that moment he returned the kindness with a thankful smile shelley reached into his pocket for a second notebook you have read goethe so you will know the legend of prometheus that is to make of my erudition what it is not warned hervey frowning but yes i know the legend you were reading last night of defying power which seems omnipotent hervey nodded and convincing it sounded i write of promethean resistance to the furies the ministers of pain and fear disappointment mistrust and hate i write of the terrible alternative of giving way to jupiters tyranny hervey saw a lofty analogy yet was not dismayed for shelleys was a wholly honest candour when you are ready to read it i would listen shelley grasped his arm again my dear friend the eagle tore at prometheus vitals by day and by night those vitals were restored so that the evisceration could begin anew in the morning shelleys warning perhaps for its intensity startled him do you tell me the pain must endure then is that how your verse shall end no said shelley shaking his head decidedly jupiter shall be dethroned and prometheus unbound though i own i am undecided yet by what means but until that day prometheus shall defy the furies or else it can never come here let me read a little roughhewn as it still is shelley read him fragments turning many pages at a time to find what he thought was most apt or diverting hervey sat spellbound and this is how i conclude perhaps you might recognize now of what it is i speak to suffer woes which hope thinks infinite to forgive wrongs darker than death or night to defy power which seems omnipotent to love and bear to hope till hope creates from its own wreck the thing it contemplates neither to change nor falter nor repent this like thy glory titan is to be good great and joyous beautiful and free this is alone life joy empire and victory hervey did not know by what providence he had come to trust this man so different in every doctrine and practice was shelley to himself but for the first time since henriettas passing he wanted to speak his heart freely and it seemed that here he might find the means to do so chapter three hearts of oak two weeks later elizabeth hervey kept her journal indefatigably certain that no one in her lifetime should read it but mindful that god knew her heart and consequently the truth of her entries she took pleasure in her writing and pride too for it allowed her the exercise of free thought as well as literary enterprise however the discovery that shelleys wife was an author with work already published had at first shaken her confidence she felt somehow intimidated that not ten minutes walk from the hervey lodgings sat a woman younger than her with far greater accomplishments but mary shelley was a sick woman of that elizabeth was certain they had formed an attachment at once rather as her brother had with marys husband but womens matters perforce drew women into greater intimacy and more quickly than men elizabeth knew about sickness she had seen a lifetimes fill of it in the warminster workhouse and against her fathers will in the hovels of the fencing crib that was warminster common and she knew that marys sickness was as much of the spirit as of the body mary had lost children elizabeth was not sure whether one or two her infant son was far from well and her husband had treated her with such indifference on occasions that elizabeth wondered what love there might truly be between them and then yesterday while shelley and hervey rambled once more about the terme and their womenfolk took tea together mary had told elizabeth she was pregnant that she had been so since february and had not yet told her husband this morning after a breakfast of oranges and very sweet chocolate elizabeth sat at the open window of her sitting room with its pleasant aspect on the garden slopes of the pincio and made her longest journal entry in a month after recording her fears for marys condition she gave her opinion that her husband was nevertheless a very engaging man whose manners belie all that i had previously read or supposed and whose regard for matthew in his bereavement is evident and genuine for they share something in this respect i believe though matthews is infinitely more noble matthew for his part takes strength in their fellowship and it is notable how freely he discourses on all manner of things that are novel and radical for mr shelley is as eloquent in his speech in radical affairs as he is on the page and he is very practised in the latter as we have known these several past years it is a strange twist of fate that the two should meet and become intimates and it could not have happened in england where our relative positions would first have precluded it and then disallowed it perhaps it is one of the benefits of foreign travel as is often said there are many that one is propelled into intercourse with those whose society would otherwise be denied yet matthew is far still from wholly sloughing off the melancholy and i do so fear that our coming here will ultimately be to no purpose other than as a temporary amelioration hervey knocked at the door elizabeth rose and went to it ah brother have you changed your mind are you not meeting mr shelley then yes but later i came to see how you were we hardly had an opportunity to speak yesterday i am very well you know it mary shelley is engaging company so you do not mind my spending so little time with you at present i had not accounted it matthew we are here on indefinite vacation as you have said allow me to address these letters i wrote last evening and then i shall be all attention hervey sat and contemplated his sister as she attended to her familial duties her defiant good spirits had been his support for so many years unsung unrecognized even that he marvelled at her constancy and not only that henrietta had been her companion long before she had been his elizabeths only companion her society since then had been the aged the sick the poor and the infirm he her brother had shown scant regard for her bereavement she held herself ready to assume whatever duties he asked of her in respect of his infant daughter or indeed of himself a brother had no right to expect such devotion the more so when it went uncherished shall we go to the opera tonight elizabeth turned why matthew you have not once suggested we go to the opera since we came here i should like nothing more are the shelleys to go too i was not intending that we ask them when elizabeth showed surprise her eyebrows arched so much that the eyes themselves seemed to grow larger they had always been kind but hervey could also see they were eyes that might attract and now that she had given up her ringlets she ought to make mens heads at least pause if not quite turn as indeed he had observed at signora dionigis conversazione what suitors she had had in wiltshire truly he was not sure for in spite of his mothers lamenting that elizabeth had willed herself into her unmarried state there was no objective evidence that there had been any actual proposals one way or another he had better have a care of his sister matthew oh i i beg your pardon i was quite preoccupied i asked what is the opera this evening that i dont remember save that the composer is italian elizabeth frowned i had not imagined otherwise but you are very good to me to commit yourself to an entertainment about which you know nothing hervey nodded perhaps he had made a beginning and now you shall spend the day climbing the ruins of the baths again no not today im meeting shelley in an hour but then i intend visiting the english college i dont suppose he will agree to come with me i have resolved to move from the corso shelley announced hervey sipped more of his cooling white wine diluted and made frizzante by water from a sulphur spring near the city walls for what reason i think your arrangements there are admirable they are but i confess to being out of sorts with the place ever since that business in the post office hervey sighed and not without sympathy although it had been the assault that had effected their introduction i still turn over in my mind what could so animate a man to strike another without warning was it really dislike of your philosophy does such a thing move rational men to common assault it was shelleys turn to sigh the magistrate was not inclined to examine his mental state so we cannot be sure in england you know we were subject to such social hatred as was impossible to bear hervey shook his head you know that i dispute every bit of that part of your philosophy yet i could never harry a man for it tolerance is the english virtue is it not shelley smiled you and i are so very far separated indeed that i marvel we do sit here peaceably i hope it would be so in england too shelleys expression changed to one of grim determination i shall never go back to england hervey looked shocked you must never say that you cannot have so poor an opinion of your country for as long as theres a crowned head i shall never set foot there but nor a church established there is no institution on earth that can claim to be without fault shelley the church of england is not so much without fault as without god and certainly her religion is without christ hervey frowned now you are being controversial am i am i indeed you forget i was first at eton and then at oxford hervey prolonged his frown there is a little more to the world than those places shelley i speak of institutions and i count the church in england no less corrupt than that here in rome hervey would not respond there seemed little point in addressing so vehement an opinion at the present you are a queer fellow hervey you would call me a godless revolutionary and yet you choose to hazard your soul in my company i would call you more but only to your face but if you own to godlessness then the other sins are merely consequential christ alive i half believe you mean it what makes you so sure of your religion youve had cause enough for a whole charterhouse to doubt it shelley touched deep at that moment and not solely on account of henrietta hervey said nothing then shelleys demeanour changed altogether he gave a shrug i myself contemplated ordination lately hervey fixed him with a disapproving look and what decided you against so outlandish a notion shelley laughed and clasped his hand on herveys you are i think the saying is steady under fire hervey poured more wine feigning not to take notice i have a mind to visit the english college this afternoon shall you come you surprise me hervey replied shelley with a distinctly mock expression of it why should so unbending a son of the established church want to see the english college why should i not want to see it it has a claim to great antiquity it is connected with king alfred since rome is nothing but antiquity how can that be any particular recommendation hervey was determined not to be drawn milton visited there so i do not see that i may not and though there was no point in saying it john keble had insisted he did shelley looked sceptical he visited did he sacred milton i am sure of it then it is settled i owe milton too much to disregard his example hervey nodded though in truth shelleys contrariness could exasperate do you know his lines on the massacre in piedmont indeed i do said hervey pouring more sulphur water into his glass i have often wondered in what manner milton wished god to avenge his slaughtered saints hervey was disinclined to discuss eschatology however you know i can admire your cromwell for the stand he took in the affair shelley looked wary expecting a trick did you not know he wrote to the emperor and others on behalf of the protestants urging all sorts of visitations on the duke of savoy if he did not stop persecuting them and it worked it seemed it is curious to imagine there are any protestants in italy the country is so unsuited to fervour in such matters shelley took a sip of his wine guardedly well i may tell you that there are and very proud too and called valdensians though i cant recall why there is an englishman who now ministers to them who lost a leg at waterloo a general i saw him carried from the field elizabeth and i thought we might call upon him on our way home shelley smiled you have a very charming way of avoiding the material issue but not an entirely effective one i asked how you supposed that milton wished vengeance to be accomplished hervey did not hesitate perhaps the wrath of god as well as the peace passes all understanding shelley raised his eyebrows and inclined his head resigned to the knowledge that he could provoke his friend to no more however hervey was unsure whether the expression meant that shelley acknowledged the reasoning or that it was just the sort of rhetoric he had expected in any case you surely cannot lay blame at the door of the english college no but it must have given rise to some very contrary sentiments we all live with those shelley now looked at him intently truly you are a man of very decided certainties even as regards contrary sentiments i never had any thoughts of the army as coleridge and southey had but i think that were i ever to have served i should have wished to do so with an officer like you certainty can move mountains ha i assure you my dear shelley certainty in very senior officers is more often the cause of getting lost in mountains now here indeed is someone who at last speaks his own mind rather than the institutions shelley at times you speak absurdities very well then let us speak not of absurdities where do we go this evening i confess i shall be in need of gaiety after all the martyrdom at the english college i am taking elizabeth to the opera and you did not ask me to accompany you i call that dashed uncivil have you tired of me hervey frowned i have neglected elizabeth of late shelley was about to protest further when the grecos proprietor approached their table accompanied by a postal messenger signor ervey una lettera molto urgente said the messenger and there were twenty scudi to pay hervey gave over the money and a further three for his trouble in searching him out when they had gone hervey began to examine the envelope it intrigues me why men tarry so long in contemplating an envelope when a moments address with a paper knife would reveal what they puzzle over said shelley but hervey scarcely noticed i do believe it to be from a most gallant acquaintance of mine it is sent from naples only three days ago he opened it and read the contents quickly it is indeed from him and it appears he is made commodore he says he will be in naples for a month and more and would see me in rome as soon as i am able to receive him and who is this gallant commodore you have not told me of him i would need many an evening to do him justice i sailed to india and home in his frigate he is uncommonly good company an officer of the wooden walls another high tory in that you suppose wrongly theres a radical heart beating in commodore petos breast as well as one of oak and you would not deride the latter im sure no no i should not deride a brave heart wherever it beat how did he know you were here hervey put the letter in his pocket and stood up i knew his station was the mediterranean and so sent word to the embassy in naples asking that the letter be forwarded when there was intelligence of his ship i shall go to the post office at once and send him word to come at his pleasure you will like him a radical you say i did not quite say that he has a radical bent i would hardly think him a subscriber to the black hand or whatever it is you revolutionaries read dwarf hervey black dwarf just so shall you come with me to the college then no on second thoughts im a little weary my eyes are aching again i have not slept well these past nights and i want to engage someone at once to find other lodgings you do not forget signora dionigis party tomorrow evening no indeed hervey brushed the dust from his hat and placed it on his head a shade more carelessly than usual shelley looked at him quizzically i perceive a sudden spring to your step at last hervey failed to hear more than an easy remark very well then do we meet at the same time tomorrow shelley nodded and with a wry grin he had no words and as he watched hervey walk from the caffè greco he wondered at the comradeship which black powder so evidently made there had been a night of rain and the tiber had risen so that the sewers were stagnant again and enterprising hawkers were doing a brisk trade in nosegays hervey made do without though now the stench was so bad that he clutched a handkerchief to his face and consoled himself with the thought that there would be incense enough to cover this rankness at the college he quickened his pace too almost to double time so that it was not long before he was pulling the bell handle at the ironclad doors of the english college the venerable college of st thomas de urbe the portiere opened them but he spoke no english much to herveys surprise disappointment even for john keble had said the place was truly a piece of england in the heart of the old city though he had not himself been to rome at length there came a tall man in a black cassock and by the portieres manner and a few of his words hervey supposed this must be the rector which indeed the man confirmed as he held out a hand in welcome father robert gradwell was striking in both appearance and bearing eyes that felt as if they pierced to the soul albeit with gentleness at once engaged the visitor and when hervey had detached himself from their hold he saw a face that might have been the duke of wellingtons own for the features were spare hawklike fervent indeed so arresting was the comparison that hervey made a very faltering introduction for himself and took a little time to explain that he would deem it a great privilege if he might see inside the seminary he half expected to be asked for what purpose but father gradwell did not enquire he simply welcomed him warmly and without condition although it seemed otherwise hervey knew that the rector could not have had long experience of showing the college to chance visitors such as he the house had only lately reopened following bonapartes long occupation of what had variously been described as the roman republic or the vassal kingdom of frances but mercifully the evidence was not as great as it might have been although horses had been stabled where the venerabili prayed and the tombs had been opened for their imagined treasure least spoiled of all was the little garden a very singular feature according to the rector for where in other palazzi there would be a cortile with pots and running water perhaps here was a place where in but a few moments an englishman might think himself at home hervey certainly was able to cast his mind to horningsham and to conjure an image of his parents his father especially for in no man could there be a closer unity of chancel and garden than in the reverend indeed now the venerable thomas hervey when the garden had pleased enough the rector showed him some of the colleges treasures memorials rather than fine plate and then conducted him to what he called the chapel of the martyrs i expect you shall wish to be in peace here it is our custom to offer hospitality to any visitor please come to the refectory when you are quite ready hervey murmured his thanks and the rector took his leave he stood at the chapel door for some time before he felt ready to enter for here was a place where the remembrance of english blood was as real as in the chapelsturneddressingposts he had seen too often in the neverending war at length he went inside got to his knees and closed his eyes a quarter of an hour he remained thus his prayers a ramble of pleas for the living and the dead and for himself above all for he could not in his heart believe that henrietta needed his oration nor yet that the living had more need of divine help than he in his minds eye he held the picture of henrietta before him it was a picture that no other had seen even in this most sacred place he had no scruple in conjuring the picture of passion which had transformed her face and then when he could no longer bear it he opened his eyes and fixed them instead on albertis commanding allegory of persecution so vivid a reredos so prized a survivor of bonapartes occupation father gradwell had said so vivid indeed as to overpower hervey transferred his gaze to the crucifix on the high altar wanting all the strength it could give but he was not practised enough and tears began to flow gently at first and then almost with convulsions so that he had to take out a handkerchief and clutch it to his eyes he sat back and picked up one of the cards from the pew on it were the names of the venerabili for whom a te deum was sung periodically such ordinary names they were so very english unlikelysounding martyrs ralph sherwin john wall thomas cottam edward james too long a list to contemplate without wondering what guilt for their deaths remained perhaps he should not have come he had wanted to see if a place of so much willing sacrifice might have some secret message some hidden power to ease the pain which every day visited him no matter how determinedly he sought diversions but there was no message nor any power to dull the pain those who might know of these things john keble daniel coates his father even had said that only time could ease that a search for an opiate was at best futile and at worst destructive and that what would see him through time was god and his own strength of character the trouble was that god did not come to his aid and that his own strength looked increasingly illmatched with the trial hervey closed his eyes once more and sought the simplicity of st mark lord i believe he murmured help thou mine unbelief chapter four the fellowship of black powder a week later when commodore peto arrived elizabeth recorded in her journal a distinct and immediate rise in her brothers spirits shelley noted it too and was at first discouraged that his own company had evidently been deficient but shelley could not even if he had been so minded hold any part of that against the commodore whose direct manner and decidedly radical sentiments he found altogether engaging their company in the first days was delightful to each the evening peto arrived had been a private affair between the two old friends however not even elizabeth joined them for supper for she knew her brother would only speak were she elsewhere tell me then peto had demanded when they took their table at his lodgings the albergo dinghilterra what was done with towcester for you were silent on the matter in your letters perhaps most men would first have expressed sadness at the loss of a wife even at the semiorphaning of an infant for the two had not met since the day of herveys wedding but peto knew he did not have to speak of it long days weeks months together in those close quarters of the frigate nisus had made for an understanding between the two men and mere sentiment would have been repugnant to them both i sent you the report in the london gazette hervey replied a very dry account i want to know how things went the cameriere had come to the table again and asked them in english what they wished to order peto did not hesitate indeed he had not even consulted the blackboard which the cameriere had previously brought trippa hervey looked surprised petos taste he knew to be choice almost fastidious three months at sea gives a man a powerful taste for the byre was the commodores explanation other occupants of the dining room were now looking towards their table though only hervey noticed he thought he had better share petos taste the cameriere began speaking excitedly and in italian hervey caught the word trastevere but little else eventually one of the albergos men in authority came he spoke with the cameriere and then explained in english and with great politeness that it was not the practice of the albergo dinghilterra to prepare dishes from the fifth quarter as the romans called it but that if they were to cross the river to the trastevere they could indulge their pleasure at liberty peto looked at hervey as if his longer time in rome might effect a change of practice hervey sought to accommodate both sides what do you recommend in its place signor the man in authority was certain vitello signori you will not taste finer in this city peto looked at him blankly capital said hervey keen to close the dispute the fatted calf is that not appropriate peto peto might have wondered who was the prodigal but his hunger got the better of his curiosity ay it will do nicely hervey thought to distance matters further from the affront to the commodores culinary discernment and to begin with i believe we should try the little marrow flowers which they do here in a light batter they are very fine good good but not too insubstantial i hope im fair famished the problem was that petos voice was cast permanently to overcome the roar of the waves the shrill of the wind the groaning of canvas and the creaking of timber he lowered it in company such as this naturally but from so high a volume that he never quite judged the decrescendo aptly more heads turned towards their table but peto was still wholly oblivious to them by design or not hervey was unable to say all he could do was pipe his own voice down still lower in an effort to have peto follow him wine barolo the whole room turned peto at last noticed he nodded in turn to each table with an indulgent smile they love a blue coat he said turning back to hervey his voice now lowered to below the level of the wind and waves and canvas as if he were at table in his own steerage indeed and at anchor now the court martial i want to know all of it where should i begin replied hervey raising an eyebrow it was a sorry business where was it held who were the members at the royal hospital it seems that the commanderinchief wished to have it within london district but not too close to the horse guards i would suppose it afforded the pensioners good sport hervey raised both eyebrows they packed one of the galleries some of them had been in holland when his lordship had first taken french leave they tuttutted throughout and jeered terribly when it was revealed good in circumstances such as this an officer should be left in no doubt as to what his inferiors think of him what did the president do who was it the earl of rotheram the senior majorgeneral it was extraordinary he merely asked them very politely if they would not make comment until after the proceedings were finished wise move making one earl the president of anothers court martial who were the others general sir horace shawcross a very choleric man indeed from lancashire i think with one arm he glowered at towcester so ill throughout the trial that i could almost feel sorry for him the others three colonels none of whom id set eyes on as i suppose was right and so how was he charged hervey took a large gulp of the barolo as if to fortify himself i remember the words as if they were only just spoken lieutenantcolonel the earl of towcester is charged with the unnecessary hazarding of his command in the americas and for conduct unbecoming an officer contrary to the articles of war peto looked puzzled the conduct unbecoming being that in holland no the holland business was not revealed until the end hervey said it rather flatly prompting peto to another quizzical look it seems the judge advocate general took the view that sending henrietta away from the fort was ungallant beyond sufferance there wouldnt be many that could gainsay that i wonder that he did not bring a charge of cowardice hervey tried hard to stick with the facts of the case it seems he did not believe such a charge had sufficient evidence and towcesters counsel were very active beforehand threatening proceedings on vexatious grounds peto knew as much about military law as the next man what he would try suing the crown he would try suing me infamous devil why did you not call him out hervey huffed how might one settle so with a dishonourable man he would have found a way to prevail shot at you in the back i dont doubt and how did he plead not guilty for sure just so the case against him was then put in summary to the court by one of the judge advocate generals staff and then the witnesses were called who gave evidence you of course you were i presume the principal witness yes and great play did towcesters counsel make of supposed disloyalty and therefore unreliability but in the material facts there were corroborating witnesses your serjeant principally hervey sighed regrettably not he was still insufficiently well to give evidence though he came to london for the purpose the poor devil lost his senses a day or so beforehand i even thought he had died he fell so still in the hospital no the corroboration came from my lieutenant seton canning and private johnson both of whom said far more than was strictly required to answer the questions towcesters counsel protested frequently but so much did they reveal of his character that any predisposition to sympathy on the part of the court must have been wholly worn away very satisfying said peto taking up the last of his marrow flowers and pulling apart another piece of bread what else i believe the most damning evidence came from the strangest place of all there were two indian guides who were with us the time when towcester lost his head in the forest when he thought we might be attacked they made depositions to the officer in charge of the indian department and these were admitted in evidence towcesters counsel protested vigorously that the testimony of savages against a peer of the realm could not be borne curiously this appeared to vex both lord rotheram and sir horace shawcross equally no doubt too they felt affront that an englishman could display such recreancy in that company no doubt agreed hervey shaking his head with the pity of it how long were the proceedings three days at the end of the second morning the members retired but the court reassembled in little more than a halfhour and pronounced his lordship guilty lord rotheram then adjourned the proceedings until the following morning so that lord towcesters counsel could prepare a plea in mitigation of punishment this was heard on the third morning along with evidence as to character which was given by the prosecution of course all the business in holland came out and it was then that the gallery roared its disapproval lord john howard you remember him the adc told me later that the duke of york himself had ordered that the facts be revealed in open court peto nodded approvingly the old fools not in want of sense at all times and with the gallery still jeering the members then retired to consider sentence the cameriere brought two large plates of veal to the table to petos obvious delight and to herveys relief the commodore sprinkled black pepper over his in prodigious quantities and set about it lustily how long were they out he managed between the first and second mouthful it seemed no more than a dozen minutes a quarter of an hour at most always a sign theyd made their mind up even before the plea and then the president announced the sentence to be dismissed from his majestys service with disgrace peto remained silent for the moment weighing the words that must have given you satisfaction more so than calling him out hervey looked pensive again i confess i was astonished how in so very few words was the earl of towcesters destruction so utterly completed indeed said peto laying down knife and fork so profound was the notion i cannot think that a capital sentence could have dealt him a greater blow at that instant the president then had to say the findings and sentence were subject to confirmation of course which drew the sting somewhat but no one other than his lordship could have had any thought but that both would be confirmed who was the reviewing officer in the normal course of things it should have been the general officer commanding the london district but the commanderinchief had reserved the appointment for himself apparently and how long did it take hervey now smiled a little evidence at last of his satisfaction in the proceedings that is the extraordinary thing it was said seven days but the next evening there came confirmation of both findings and sentence from the horse guards and with it the order that the judgment be read out before every regiment on parade every regiment it would have gone very hard with the duke of york that a peer proved to be a coward for all his faults i imagine the old scoundrel holds to noblesse oblige i imagine so and i wished for a moment that i was still under orders for i should have relished being on the parade at which the sixth had the findings read to them peto beckoned for their glasses to be refilled and looked at hervey a shade sceptically are you so sure of that a ships company becomes very low when the captain is dishonoured not often that that is thank god even when he is thoroughly despised there is some feeling that every man bears some part of it and is shamed it will be the same in a regiment will it not hervey nodded he knew full well it was so he had thought about it often indeed guilt had gnawed at him that when his troops spirits must be at their lowest he was not with them had deserted them some might say and he had been an instrument in the sorry business had he not if he had confronted lord towcester even in canada late then the terrible end might not have been he had scarcely needed more evidence of towcesters incompetence and cowardice surely you have not thought of rejoining hervey sighed frequently i cannot help it but in truth i am entirely repelled by a system in which such a thing might happen peto look pained he lowered his voice as if the table were a confessional hervey my good fellow we spoke long of these things during the indian voyages i do not believe it is necessary for an honourable man to quit a corrupt institution so long as he himself is able to serve honourably in it that may be so i think it more than may be you recall those hours spent in talking of the right conduct of war you said that aquinas had ruled that a soldier might still take part in unlawful war as long as he comported himself lawfully i see your present difficulties in that same light again the argument was not new to him indeed hervey had been the first to rehearse it his appetite now seemed suddenly to leave him and he pushed his plate to one side it is more than that my daughter is without a mother would it be right for her to be without a father too peto did not answer these were waters in which he had no sailing experience and no right instinct but he did have one more challenge for his friend and he squared up to it direct hervey are you in any degree fearful of having lost some aptness for command hervey was stung more deeply than by anything in months no one had ever suggested this or anything like it only laughton peto could have imagined such a thing not even daniel coates could read him thus peto did not press his question instead he said simply such a thing would go ill with me and would remain until next i had the chance to show otherwise isnt that the way with men under orders those at least who take their profession seriously it was the first time that hervey had seen peto let slip the mask of command and that a man as proud as he should have done so was high testimony indeed to their mutual regard and friendship hervey simply breathed deep and resolved on a different path to their discourse lets leave it for the morning tell me how was your journey we ourselves are intending to visit naples ha exclaimed peto his voice rising above the waves again youd do as well to take a ship we were stopped interminably everywhere the talk was of carbonari you were stopped by carbonari no by that ass ferdinands troops king of the two sicilies indeed i can think nothing of a man who requires foreign troops lest his own people try to depose him hervey looked askance there were precedents closer to home had we not better have a care in frances regard therefore perhaps so but at least theirs is a french king and our troops are in barracks there ferdinand would not have a throne if it werent for habsburg troops tramping the roads i doubt that bonaparte would have been worsted without the austrians tried hervey i dont doubt it but we didnt fight one tyrant only to replace him with another well i for one shall be pleased if it means we reach naples without molestation by bandits even if they do wear pretty ribbons said hervey most emphatically the cameriere had returned and peto was taking more of the veal with appreciative noises by the way how is your sister hervey smiled pleased with the further evidence of petos approval of the veal and at the thought of happy reports to be made of elizabeth she is very well the country suits her even if her heart is still at home you shall see for yourself tomorrow i look forward to it and have you any other acquaintances in rome i heard english spoken all along the street indeed we have the poet shelley no less peto was all attention but his eyes were narrowed an intriguing man indeed perhaps in both senses of the word i have read some of his essays his sentiments sound for much of it but he goes altogether too far hervey smiled again i should not be able to share even your limited generosity but hes a great admirer of the carbonari and the most engaging of company off the page and elizabeths journal recorded that peto found it just so in the days that followed and an altogether more agreeable occupation it was for her to write than before they speak of martial things all the time and even mr shelley seems much taken by it she noted at the end of the first week i confess too there is much to admire about commodore peto he is such a commanding man he speaks plainly yet is not without sensibility the pines on the janiculum gave the little reconnaissance party shade and therefore they supposed some cover from observation as they scanned the great fortress of castel santangelo below well commodore could you reach it from here just i think two thousand yards id say one of my long twentyfours full charge and with the quoin out what damage it would do those walls though i couldnt vouch for the shot would be plunging itd make a pretty mess of the roofs but little else i fancy how close would you have to come to breach the parapet wall peto peered again through his telescope i cant judge their thickness its not as if they were ships timbers i shouldnt trust to more than five hundred yards playing on the same point with a whole gun deck but how would you overcome the outer ramparts and the moat hervey nodded acknowledging the problem was no little one ive been considering that a while since first seeing them indeedi dont believe they could be overcome in any direct assault every angle is covered too well then how the weaker flank is the river i think a storming party could get under those embanked walls and then scale them while sharpshooters kept the tops clear i could see henry locke going at it couldnt you peto agreed lieutenant locke and his marines had never been concerned with tactics only with audacious frontal assault though he had paid dear for it first with his fine looks and then with his life do we suppose the bridge is no longer standing i think we must though even if it were i think it would be given the most severe raking by the defenders the other weak point is what they call the passetto running through the borgo a tunnel no it looks rather like an aqueduct it runs from the popes palace right into the northwest bastion for sorties the opposite a bolt route then it would surely be blown as soon as they were safe in the bastion elizabeth hervey standing behind them a little way smiled you see mr shelley my brother is restored to his former spirits i do not know if he truly loves fighting but he is wholly absorbed by the study of it he cannot traverse a piece of country no matter how pretty without observing on its aptness to defend or attack there is a farmer in our parts in wiltshire who used to be a generals trumpeter many years ago and he and matthew will ride all day on the downs spying out the land shelley had observed the deeper change too having had heed of it at the first meeting with peto i own to very great pleasure in your brothers company miss hervey but his true heart is always elsewhere and i do not mean that it grieves the while for his lost love does that seem cruel elizabeth sighed i do not think that any of us can say what is his heart or his mind nor matthew himself even for there is such a confusion of sentiment but painful though it is to say it i am of the opinion that matthew could only be free of his slough of despond if he were to put on uniform again yes i do agree if a man quits the circumstances of his pain he only ever leaves the pain distant your brother i judge is hero enough to fight the demons on their own ground before their first meeting every evangelical instinct in elizabeth had tended to being appalled by shelley yet now she considered him a true friend indeed at their first meeting his very appearance and air had captivated her she wondered how it might have been had they all met in wiltshire and then concluded that since such a thing was unthinkable it was also pointless to imagine he has received two letters you know asking that he would return to his regiment but he will not entertain it they are for india that is half of the problem im sure then why cannot he go to another regiment that is not for the indies there are plenty about the shires alarming honest folk but that would not be the same at all mr shelley replied elizabeth ignoring his barb his attachment is to his regiment not to any uniform he would feel it a betrayal in any circumstances let alone these then i very much fear miss hervey that your brother will cease to be a pilgrim in any sense and i am very sorry for him at signora dionigis that evening they dined formally à la russe on account said shelley beforehand of the presence of an english duchess they were twenty at table and hervey was pleased to be seated at the furthest end from the lady they did not sit promiscuously for she seemed to eye him with a look that might have been disapproval she had arrived late after the signora had given up hope of her attending and they had taken their places and there had been no introductions hervey could not imagine what offence he might have given her and had first supposed that she mistook him for shelley except that the latter had then begun to speak of her in terms that indicated they were congenially acquainted do you not know the family asked shelley when hervey had confided his discomfort not really i know the present duke whom i suppose this lady must be stepmother to but i only knew him after he had succeeded to the title in truth he would rather speak of other things for the devonshire acquaintance distant though it was brought only painful thoughts she married the late duke only a little time before he died she is a very generous patroness of letters you should be kind to her shelley smiled as if suggesting something faintly disreputable conversation then became difficult because of a noisy troupe of mandolinplayers gaudily dressed and exuberant in curious contrast to the formality hitherto they put hervey in mind of the feast at chintalpore when the hijdas had brought the dignity of the palace banquet to a raucous end napolitani boomed peto from across the table we had em aboard my ship a week or so past not these but dressed the same hands mocked them something terrible to begin with then they played so well they wouldnt let em leave a sudden fermata left the commodores words exposed and heads turned his way hervey smiled for peto seemed not to notice i recall your being fond enough of music to engage an orchestra for the nisus shelley looked interested music calms the seamans savage breast does it commodore peto saw no irony in the proposition nor in truth did shelley intend any you should come and see for yourself sir a squadron of frigates in naples bay is a sight to stir any heart let alone a poets shelley looked tempted but there was an objection i have affairs overdue in the north im afraid else i should very much like to see them we passed some months in naples last year and the bay was empty the while i should certainly like to see them said hervey the mandolins crescendo forcing him to raise his voice a little how long shall you be there peto consciously lowered his voice a month probably we are waiting on some american frigates and then together we shall make a sortie against the barbary pirates hervey was all attention when last they had spoken peto had despaired of ever getting command of a seventyfour let alone of a squadron of frigates with their guns run out do they offend us it seems they do very much especially the americans the barbary states have made grave depredations on their merchantmen these past few years did you know we bombarded algiers together while you and i were in india hervey did not shall you do so again we shall stand ready to but our actions will be directed on the ships themselves i hope to cut out a good many and that would bring a further small fortune for commodore peto mused hervey i half wish i were coming with you peto frowned half wishings no good to me hervey hervey was cut and could make no reply for the moment it was made all the worse by the mandolins unexpected finale but he was saved by the signora who stood and invited the duchess to take coffee on the balcony of her drawing room the little procession of ladies left the men to their cigars although hervey himself declined his disheartened still by petos reproof was peto unconsciously at least impatient of him now that his life was no longer mortgaged in the kings service hervey was as shelley would have put it very dull in the ensuing conversation when they rejoined their hostess it was for her to present each of them to her principal guest she was a handsome woman the duchess of devonshire not yet sixty hervey supposed and time had not been at all unkind to her and this is captain hervey duchess said the signora in english although i regret that he prefers to be called plain mister i tell him that here in italy it will not do that every man has rank or title or both but he will not oblige me the signoras happy prating did not induce the duchess to smile she continued as at dinner to eye hervey in an altogether unnerving manner hervey she pronounced the e as if it were an a are you family dull though his spirits may have been hervey was quick enough to make the connection and he rallied so distantly maam that you had never known of mine the duchess looked at him quizzically i did hear tell of a hervey who married a lindsay thynnes ward indeed i once met her at my sisters in bath that would not be you a sick feeling came on him only his mind seemed to remain whole henrietta lindsay was my late wife maam she died but a year ago the duchesss expression changed to one of dismay my dear dear boy how perfectly dreadful had i but known mr hervey had i known too added the signora but hervey stayed both their protestations i have not been inclined to speak of it there is no reason for your distress the duchess took his arm and led him a little to one side was there issue my dear hervey told her she is called georgiana the duchess smiled a good devonshire name just so he nodded managing a little of a smile but not seeing shelleys more knowing one indeed a godmother is lady camilla cavendish the duchess nodded we were not close im afraid the duke died but three years after we were married not as cruel a severing as yours mr hervey and at our time of life these things are to be expected but hervey put his hand to hers there was no saying that the pain of such things was any the less with the years the duchess seemed to know his thoughts yes my dear but i would not have had it any other way even had i known what was to be its outcome it was a simple truth and hervey saw that it applied to him in equal measure his own surprise silenced him for the moment so i give thanks daily to the almighty for those few years my dear continued the duchess now placing her hand on his for they might never have been when it came for them to leave shelley told hervey he would not be able to join them the following morning for there were lodgings by the spanish steps that he wished to look at the two friends exchanged a few words on the suitability of the location before bowing and bidding each other goodnight when hervey had retrieved his hat he found he had fallen behind his sister in their farewells and so he hurried past one or two dawdlers on the staircase to see elizabeth at the door with peto the commodore had evidently said something amusing for elizabeth threw her head back and smiled broadly laughed a little indeed hervey checked an instinct saying he should not intrude it was the first time he had seen elizabeth smile quite like that and the first he had seen peto looking anything other than a man of the quarterdeck truly it took him by surprise and how foolish he would think himself later that evening when he turned the thought over in his mind for of what property did he imagine elizabeth and peto to be beneath what they were obliged to show to the world peto was not married to the sea for all the poetic attraction in that saying and indeed for all petos own protestations of it and neither was elizabeth his sister alone despite these notions however and the thoughts which the duchess had planted in his mind hervey slept uncommonly well that night he rose at seventhirty next morning and went with elizabeth to morning prayer at the reverend mr hues new meeting rooms in piazza colonna traiana it was the second anniversary of his marriage a union that had brought him unimaginable happiness and fulfilment and he intended to give unequivocal thanks to the almighty it was a holy day too the feast of saints philip and james and there was an infectious exuberance about the people in the corso even at this early hour hervey and his sister were the only congregation as mr hue began to read the sentences rend your heart and not your garments and turn unto the lord your god for he is gracious and merciful the rushseat chairs held their backs erect and the high ceiling was a sounding board for the minister whose voice made full use of it it was so far from the hushed ease of his fathers chancel and yet the words of cranmer spoke to them both in the popes very capital as if they had been in horningsham itself hervey was content as if he were somehow awaiting the arrival of his bride indeed he turned halfexpectantly when he heard the scrape of feet as two more brethren joined them at the general confession at the venite two sightseers joined them curious they all remained standing as the minister in stark white surplice began the old testament reading the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to comfort all that mourn to give unto them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning how apt did hervey find isaiah always wise always certain i will greatly rejoice in the lord my soul shall be joyful in my god for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels how little had henrietta needed to adorn herself with jewels he could see her before him now as plainly as he had that day in the chapel at longleat he could almost reach out to touch her as he had that day when he had found a warmth in her hand that spoke more than any words might for the rest of the office he heard little neither readings nor prayers nor psalms nor the comings of the faithful nor the goings of the sightseers only the familiar words of st chrysostom recalled him beseeching almighty god to fulfil the desires and petitions of thy servants as may be most expedient for them desires and petitions how he prayed for their fulfilment afterwards as they walked back to their lodgings elizabeth took careful note of her brothers mien without she hoped giving him the impression of study she concluded she hoped not overhastily that it spoke of something different in his heart so it seemed too for he announced with uncommon brio that they would take their breakfast at the caffè greco and at that place amid the greater than usual bustle of a roman festival elizabeth observed that her brother was indeed a blither spirit he took notice of what was about him and in an approving way whereas at times before when he had not been sunk in introspection he had seemed positively to despise the exuberance of the grecos less contemplative patrons shall you go to your secret garden with mr shelley today asked elizabeth brightly or does commodore peto command your attendance hervey returned her smile but wider mr shelley is looking at new lodgings this morning near the spanish steps he asked me to accompany him but i told him he would better take a sapper than a dragoon he will make up his own mind whatever it is that i say he cut into a crostata and none too neatly sugar and crumbs spread about the table so that elizabeth began sweeping them together with a napkin and a sisterly frown commodore peto wants to go and see the graves of some sailors apparently there was an affair on the tiber a few years ago when the navy saved the popes treasure from bonapartes men or something very like it i should like to see them too said elizabeth decidedly may i come with you is it far testaccio the other side of the aventine i thought we would walk since he wants also to see the circus maximus though i told him it was nothing but a cow meadow then i shall dress for a country walk it will be pleasant to spend a day out of the city do you not find the constant noise wearying hervey looked as though it was the first time he had considered the noise i quite confess to missing silence i had a mind indeed to seek out a convent for a few days hervey brushed more sugar and crumbs from his coat as he finished the crostata that might be apt for i had a mind to go to naples for a few days i should very much like to see petos command would that disappoint you you could join us there later the duchess said she would see naples and would welcome your company elizabeth was in truth disappointed but she readily understood that her brothers return to full spirits needed the attention of a man under orders and that she would break that peculiar fellowship if she travelled with them indeed her withdrawal to a convent for a few days had been designed principally with that fellowship in mind she nodded in agreement at her brothers proposal i do not want to leave this country without seeing pompeii and vesuvius though but there is plenty of time is there not did we not also speak of taking a ship from there to sicily en route for home when the time came we did and we shall goethe says it is not possible to understand italy without seeing sicily and i think we must discover why elizabeth smiled then i shall get me to a nunnery the duchess is bound to know which one is suitable ah sighed her brother the duchess has very decided opinions does she not she did indeed thought elizabeth and her decidedness though admirable had made of her an exile though it was of her own choosing and she was surrounded by attentive company if not actual friends and she was a widow not an old maid taking obvious comfort in her former state but elizabeth still shivered at the eternal image of the ageing friendless and as she thought childless singleton for it was a spectre that began visiting females such as she respectable women out in society beyond the usual time and still without a lace cap when they returned to their lodgings that evening around six elizabeth was tired and said she would take her supper in hervey said he would be glad to keep her company for peto had told him there were three days overdue in his log and he did not allow himself four and i suppose i must reply very soon to this he sighed taking a letter from the writing table a second from lord sussex in as many months he writes that the regiment is certain for india next year he asks me once again to take a troop elizabeth her bonnet already off and her hand on the door to her rooms hesitated only for an instant i believe you should hervey looked at her intently she narrowed her eyes just a little i believe you must hervey stood silent for the moment seemingly astonished how can i possibly how can you be here that is hardly the same there is a short end to italy india would be years how can i abandon my own daughter if you insist on the word abandon brother then i despair for you and not much less for georgiana i have thought about it a very great deal these past weeks and i am of the opinion that georgianas best future will not be served by any cloying proximity of yours i am sorry to speak so brutally matthew but that is my opinion hervey had been for so many years in awe of his sisters opinion that he at once checked the instinct to lash out against so hurtful a proposition elizabeth did not want to lose the initiative there are three options as i see them and none requires that you are in attendance georgiana may remain at the vicarage and we can find a governess when the time comes or else she can go to longleat or even to chatsworth it seems for the duchess suggested as much did she not i dont recall that she and the choice depends on what prospects you wish for georgiana another option occurred to him but he dismissed it at once as being the product of an entirely selfish impulse if elizabeth would accompany him to india with his daughter then most of the objects would be accomplished it was impossible of course elizabeth could not leave their ageing parents nor could any rightminded man submit his infant daughter to the trials of such a climate as indias the only prospect i can rightfully own to is her health and happiness he conceded we should all say amen to that matthew but you must make a choice as to how best that is secured still elizabeth remained with her hand to the door as if she would not let him go without a decision hervey had not felt himself so tried in a long time he knew he ought to have expected that elizabeth would not let him off lightly he had never flinched from decisions as a young cornet nor lieutenant nor even when first a captain but his indecision in the affair of lord towcester had cost him very dearly had he grown indulgent i believe the air at naples will do me good he said suddenly folding the letter and putting it in his pocket i think i shall take a walk and then call on shelley shall i ask for collops for you elizabeth sighed very well brother perhaps a whiff of sulphur in naples will be efficacious hervey looked at her unsure as to whether she intended any ambiguity and the collops no matthew she smiled i think that would be a little dull i might as well be in horningsham i should like some macaroni and some red wine and i shall sit with miss austen at hand she is never dull hervey smiled back he hoped profoundly he would never outlive his sister for he could not imagine how he might subsist without her good sense he kissed her forehead one day i shall read miss austen since she has held both you and henrietta in such thrall but not just yet i hope you wont be so soon gone that you maynt see my new lodgings theyre very pretty rooms near the spanish steps you say ay not a stones throw from the caffè greco i should be content to lodge there far longer than i have taken them it was curious thought hervey how shelley rarely spoke but in the singular gossip in many a conversazione held there to be an uncommon alliance between shelley his wife and her stepsister but elizabeth had warned her brother that all was not happy with mary with whom she had become quite intimate it was certainly not a matter that he and the poet might discuss you are intent on travelling north for the summer i hear shelley raised his eyebrows a little it is not settled where might you go pisa perhaps or leghorn but you would leave rome altogether if you did i should not keep the rooms no we might travel home by way of leghorn i wish that you would they sipped marsala for a while in silence the duchess is an engaging woman said hervey at length almost by way of something to break the silence shelley smiled oh engaging indeed you did not know she was a hervey there was no reason to i should be unable even to draw a design of our connection with her line you thought her handsome no doubt too handsome indeed replied hervey readily perhaps a little old for my taste shelley smiled again hervey frowned in mock disapproval my dear friend shelleys smile had turned indulgent i am only too glad to see that your impulses remain that of a man the duchess has always exercised a powerful attraction well very evidently it was so with the last duke but hervey she was his mistress for years and of lord knows how many other dukes she has so many children salted about europe that shelley i really do not think that and there was always talk of her association with georgiana the late duchess infamous shelley you would do well not to repeat such things but shelley merely smiled the more ah but see what a woman such as she wrought of your demeanour this evening and last hervey relented his smile broadening almost into laughter there is nothing about him that a good woman would not put right and more so even a bad one vero vero you see hervey what a few months away from that hypocritical land of ours does for the spirits hervey nodded but his smile was now one of some caution in the short run but how may we know if it endures hervey you exasperate me with that dogged faith of yours for thats what lies at the root of your melancholy you know when we walked around st peters together there was but one inscription that did not excite revulsion in me indeed said hervey trying to sound surprised that shelley had found even one indeed it was the memento mori above the entrance to the sacristy but not for the reason it was placed there rather because it reminded that our prospects of pleasure are limited hervey looked at him intently and the rest is silence yes hervey it is hervey sighed seeming to weigh his words a good deal shelley i might wish it were so chapter five quo vadis three days later despite the temptations they stopped only once along the via appia before it became wholly a country road ruined sepulchres on either side stood regular and imposing like streetliners for a procession here and there a man looking not much better than a vagabond would importune them to stop and descend some dank dark subterranean steps to view a catacomb but the duchess and others had warned hervey and peto very emphatically that banditi would fall on them with the utmost savagery if they did and so hervey had resolved to come another time in greater company to explore these holy vaults where they did stop at petos wish as much as his own was the tiny church of domine quo vadis indeed so compelling was it the turning of history in the turning of a single man upon this spot that to have passed without a prayer at least would have seemed to them both a blasphemy and commodore laughton peto for all his hardening years aboard menofwar stood awed and speechless at the spot for several minutes half expecting some command or apparition in the silence of the empty roman plain their carriage was a more compact affair than they would have had in england resembling a small hardroofed landau although it was well sprung even by english standards the carefully dressed stones that had once afforded the legions rapid marching between rome and capua were now worn uneven and broken so that at times the carriages progress was bonejangling and noisy to the point where talk gave way to nearshouting but when they were a dozen leagues from the city the road acquired a surface less cruel thus conversation was resumed for an hour or so before a halt for a collazione of spigola brought that very hour from the blue tyrrhenian which had been in and out of sight for the last dozen miles and the rough white wine of the hostarias own vineyard much stronger than either hervey or peto had expected soon induced slumber even as the carriage picked up into a good trot with the new horses they dozed for a long while in the growing heat of the afternoon the carriage stopped suddenly both men awoke abruptly to shouting angry and insistent hervey now fully alert to danger reached for the cavalry pistol on the seat by his side in an instant its muzzle was roofwards his thumb on the hammer ready to cock he had primed it as they passed through the city walls and with his left hand he pulled out his watch as he did instinctively at any alarm four oclock they could be anywhere peto sitting opposite facing forward was likewise ready for action at the offside what are they saying i cant tell not a word hervey crouched by the open window to see where the shouting came from do we get down were safer inside i think the driver may make a bolt for it any second but the driver had no such thoughts hervey saw him and the guard climb down from the box and raise their hands before he could even think what to do next the doors were wrenched open and big bearded men crowded both sides of the carriage they wore brown cloaks despite the heat of the afternoon and tall pointed hats with ribbons round the peaks red blue black fire smoke charcoal carbonari he asked defiantly si signori scendete per favore they were courteous enough thought hervey and curiously they did not appear to be armed but he was not minded to threaten his pistol he motioned to peto to do nothing but alight austrienni said the biggest of the carbonari taller by several inches and easily in excess of six feet it was a strange thing to enquire of a mans nationality before robbing him thought hervey inglesi the big man seemed impressed but then sceptical avete dei documenti per provarlo peto looked puzzled but hervey thought he caught the intention siamo officiers inglesi the big man seemed puzzled by the admixture of french caballeria hervey explained pointing at himself hoping the spanish would be near enough e marinare he added pointing at peto the big man turned and gave what was obviously an order to another behind him hervey now saw the butt of a musket sticking out of the bottom of the mans cloak he glanced at the others it was the same with them these were cool fellows indeed not at all anxious to be off with their booty still the big man looked wary of the two travellers non avete documenti but hervey could only shrug then a woman with fierce black eyes pushed her way to the front her dress as gaudy as the mens was plain with red blue and black ribbons tied around her waist parlezvous français monsieur she asked brusquely hervey sighed to himself no little relieved at being in a position to communicate at last oui madame nous sommes officiers anglais he went on to explain their exact qualifications taking care not to give any impression that his commission was sold a year ago the woman relayed all this to the big man who relaxed visibly smiled almost he asked her several things some of which she seemed to answer of her own accord others which she repeated to hervey in french the big man wanted to know why they were travelling this route it was not the usual one to naples hervey said he didnt know that the driver was charged with taking them to that city where his companions ship lay at anchor only as he said it did hervey realize he was upping the ransom price which these brigands might have in mind for that could be their only object if they were not simply to take all the travellers possessions and make off yet something in the big mans manner made him less menacing than he ought to have been not once had they threatened violence nor even revealed their arms who are you he asked in as unruffled a way as possible he asks who we are relayed the woman siamo carbonari replied the big man with so much pride that the others threw their heads up at the word first austrians and now carbonari groaned peto he thought to raise his voice for clarity you are very good fellows but we have no gold worth your taking we are english officers but the voice that from the quarterdeck could send hands aloft in a howling gale was greeted by indifference hervey turned to him they asked if we were austrian do you think were in naples already peto shrugged there was no customs post on the journey up as i recall hervey asked their interpreter she appeared to know but asked the big man nevertheless si he nodded sulla frontiera perhaps this explained the mens composure thought hervey they were abroad on the margins of the popes domain and the kingdom of the two sicilies where the writ of both monarchs ran weak and where the fastness of the mountains to the north offered rapid refuge but even so the leisure with which they now proceeded was curious in his military eyes since we are not austrian and you are honourable men he tried may we now continue on our way the woman stared at hervey a while before turning to the big man and explaining the man shook his head impassively venite con me he said beckoning and turning about the press of men behind parting for him hervey was vexed but he was no more than a shade apprehensive for somehow there seemed no menace in these carbonari he thought it strange that no attempt had been made to disarm the two of them perhaps they were covered by many more carbonari concealed about this lonely stretch of road it was certainly not a place to make a dash from a couple of hunting dogs lurcher types fell in beside them as well as several women none of them older than they themselves the growing band climbed the rocky hillside beneath pines and through scrubby bush hervey heard the carriage moving below and looked back ne vous inquiétez pas messieurs do not worry at all said the fierceeyed woman we take it away to hide that is all hervey was sure her french was not the natives but it was most convincing peto was becoming indignant he knew a little french and now was the time to deploy it i am commodore laughton peto of the royal navy and i demand to know your intention sir hervey winced a commodore in common parlance an admiral he would carry a heavy price if the carbonari were minded to ransom the big man bowed in acknowledgement when the woman translated the comandante says he is honoured to have so exalted an officer in his company and wishes to offer you our hospitality she explained throwing out a hand to indicate their encampment they had by now come up to the mouth of a cave big enough to enter without stooping a fire burned without smoke at the mouth and a pot hung above it on a tripod beyond that there was little sign of camp comforts why do you detain us sir asked hervey the man appeared to understand much of the french but he would not speak it and he waited each time for the woman to explain before replying in italian because if i had let you go on you would have run into austrian patrols and if you had gone back it would have been the same i could not risk you telling them of us he took the pot from the tripod with a piece of leather would you like coffee signori there seemed no reason to decline but we saw no troops of any sort on the road pressed hervey that is difficult to believe signori there are always pickets along that road and in strength i assure you sir replied hervey shaking his head we saw not a man although i confess we were sleeping for the past hour or so but they surely would have stopped us the comandante began hurried consultation with the halfdozen other men who had followed them to the cave his voice had turned more than a touch anxious he turned back to hervey do you swear sir by your soldiers honour that the road is free of troops hervey frowned i repeat sir that we saw none at all in our progress if they lay concealed in the trees or ditch or i know not then i cannot say clearly this intelligence had some effect on the plans of the carbonari but in what way hervey could neither understand nor deduce what dye think agitates them so asked peto becoming weary of the business i cant tell either theyre planning an ambuscade and their birds have flown or you will stay here signori said the comandante suddenly and you will stay with them maurizia the woman nodded looking anxious for the comandante venite he commanded the others when they had gone hervey glanced at peto the woman saw do not try to leave messieurs there are men posted they will shoot hervey and peto exchanged looks which postponed the notion of escape hervey sipped his coffee bitter though it was your french is excellent mademoiselle may i ask how you acquired it why do you wish to know she replied defiantly i have no motive other than curiosity mademoiselle mine i was taught by a frenchwoman who lived in england i did not set foot in france until i was three and twenty she smiled a little i have not even been to rome monsieur then you too had an able teacher king joachim hervey did not catch her meaning how so mademoiselle i was his mistress monsieur hervey was stunned here was both honesty and history in uncommon measure peto had followed the exchange and looked eagerly for the particulars not his only mistress of course but i believe he favoured me above the others for a time certainly among those who were not of the quality her candour was wholly disarming it was not difficult to appreciate what murat had seen for her fierce eyes could surely blaze in an altogether different light hervey and peto looked at each other in some confusion what are you doing here mademoiselle with these carbonari asked the former the carbonari fight for our liberty monsieur we want no other sovereign but our own italian and perhaps not even a king we make a beginning here in napoli but in time there will be carbonari in all of italy and you yourself mademoiselle she looked at hervey strangely i am carbonara too monsieur and my place is here with the comandante my man hervey was silenced by her passion from silk sheets to pine needles said peto just loud enough for him to hear and in a tone more of puzzled admiration than reproach hervey was inclined to admire her too though who could tell her true motives in being here perhaps she herself could not but the life must hold few comforts mademoiselle what is the comandantes intention here today her look at once became distant again why do you wish to know well he began with a smile we are detained by you and might wish to know what shall be our end and when you will come to no harm messieurs but why was the comandante so sure we had seen austrian troops on the road the woman hesitated at first there is a company in the town a mile or so along the road from here to napoli we intend capturing their weapons they send patrols along the road to the frontier each day they return about this time you should have seen them well we did not how many men does the comandante have mademoiselle she did not answer mademoiselle i am a soldier it is my interest to know that is all enough was all she would say hervey thought for a moment has the comandante placed pickets about the camp the woman looked uncomprehending i mean has he placed sentries all around the camp at a distance beyond the range of the camps noise again she looked as if she did not grasp the intent so that an enemys approach might be detected in time to have the comandantes men take post herveys question was answered in part by a distant welter of musketry he sprang up and past the woman in an instant from the mouth of the cave it was clear the firing came from the direction they had travelled but from up the hill rather than the road below the camp was now all alarm running cursing and shouting the order of the moment a posto avanti presto presto peto looked about with a disdain bordering on contempt drill was what they needed at a time like this and drill was very patently not what they had ever tried let alone perfected hervey moved instinctively to the protection of a tree trunk taking his pistol from his belt and porting it high he called and beckoned to peto who was still standing at the mouth of the cave as if on his quarterdeck for a naval officer did not seek cover in an engagement peto almost strolled to the tree as soon as theyre all atop that rise hervey pointed with the pistol to where carbonari were scrambling for all they were worth we can steal back down the hill and try to find the carriage very well said peto as if he were agreeing to nothing more exacting than a change of sail the firing was now intense perhaps no more than a hundred yards off it was volleying for the most part and regular enough for hervey to estimate there was a full company for no foreign troops could volley at that rate in a single rank shots peppered the silence between volleys the carbonari answering defiantly we must grant they have pluck said hervey to peto but peto was dismayed to find that sticky pine sap had dripped onto the shoulder of his coat i had this made only last month in naples he complained hervey turned to look but a ragged volley from atop the hill took him by surprise a ball hit the branches overhead sending down pine needles and bits of bark he looked back to see white coats coming over the crest carbonari until that moment unseen rushed forward past him taking cover behind the rocks and returning the fire determinedly he saw one whitecoat fall to what looked like a baker rifle now was the time to slip away he turned to search for his line but shots over to the right made him look back the fierceeyed woman fell as if dead not thirty yards from them as one hervey and peto sprinted to her she lay moaning blood spread the length of her back we cant move her said hervey i think we must insisted peto to the cave at least they made to take her by her arms and legs but lead whistled their way again and bark flew from the tree next to them christ cursed hervey reaching for his pistol he swung round to see a whitecoat rushing them with the bayonet twenty yards off another close behind had he any choice he levelled his pistol and fired in one movement the first man fell stone dead peto took aim at the second fired then cursed hervey dashed to the dead man seized up his musket and rushed at the second with the bayonet they met at the charge but the whitecoat flinched at the last minute and herveys blade drove in beneath the ribcage running the man back a full six feet before he fell out came the bayonet easily enough thank god and hervey stood on guard as other whitecoats came over the ridge shouting behind him italian shouting made him glance over his shoulder he flung himself to the ground just as the gun fired a hail of metal whistled over his head and scythed through half a dozen whitecoats who had left the cover of the trees he got up and scrambled back to find that peto had all but reached the cave with the woman carbonari were now swarming up the slope from the road three dozen of them perhaps more four giants of men hauled the gun back into alignment it looked as big as a carronade as women little more than girls carried powder from the cave a line of carbonari now faced the attack taking standing cover in the trees down the slope in a headlong rush came what was left of their picket half a dozen men to rally behind the firing line last man down was the comandante his cloak and hat still in place ribbons flying loose the lurchers loping along at his side as he reached the line he saw the woman lying at the caves mouth and peto kneeling over her trying to stem the bleeding he called to hervey save yourselves signori this is not your fight peto took no notice even if he understood hervey was repriming his pistol he looked up and called back have a care of your flank indicating the direction of his skirmish the comandante looked right saw the whitecoats lying dead and beckoned the picket to that quarter they were firing within the minute the comandante looked round and nodded to hervey grimly soon there were whitecoats the length of the crest not seventy yards away they presented fired as one but too high to have effect a shower of needles and bark fell on the carbonari line then the whitecoats gave point with the bayonets and began doubling down the slope aspete aspete called the comandante glancing left and right to reinforce the command hervey wondered where he had learned his nerve it took a practised eye to await a bayonet charge aspete aspete he continued as the whitecoats quickened their pace then at thirty yards fuoco the effect astonished hervey as much as it shocked the austrians hardly a ball failed to find its mark the few whitecoats not hit seemed to falter the touch of cloth now gone from left and right carbonari stepped boldly from behind the trees and began taking careful aim with pistols it was over in a minute there was no despatching of the wounded though as the spanish guerrilleros would have done hervey watched as carbonari who had fought desperately now sought out those of both sides with life remaining staunching blood offering water by rights they should have picked up their wounded and gone for there was no knowing what other troops were even now marching towards the sound of the gunfire having once been caught off guard it was thought hervey imprudent to remain she needs forceps called peto from a few yards away i can feel the ball but its tightlodged the woman was conscious but perfectly still making not a sound where he might find a surgeons bag hervey had not the first idea do not trouble signori said the comandante in broken french pushing new cartridges into the bandolier beneath his cloak the muli will come soon and maurizia she is strong hervey did not doubt it though he thought that neither mules nor the womans strength would be enough her colour had turned almost grey but the stretchers came soon and with a string of mules their sconci ran ahead with long lead ropes letting the animals extend up the uneven slope for maurizia they lashed a stretcher between two mules and peto hervey and the comandante lifted her into it and lay her face down head to one side she managed something which passed for a smile at her deliverers a smile which plainly said her thanks then she turned her eyes to her comandante they spoke of defiance still she coughed the words in bocca al lupo domiziano in bocca al lupo the comandante took the ribbons from beneath his cloak red blue and black and pressed them into her hand crepi il lupo maurizia crepi he said softly at his nod the sconci led the tandem off up the slope and towards the mountain fastness not for maurizia and the wounded carbonari the hospital of the town below that was for the whitecoats they would take them to the road and leave them for their comrades and better would be their chances than those of maurizia and her comrades hervey watched the comandante as the train of mules passed the mans lips moved but without a sound was he cursing or praying as the last mule passed him he made the sign of the cross then turned back to his unlikely comradesinarms signori you have done more than i can thank you for only it is time for you to leave now or you will be fighting more he spoke slowly and carefully his french well chosen hervey understood he held out his hand the comandante took it and petos then beckoned to a carbonaro and gave him instructions to take nostri amici to where the carriage had been concealed hervey looked about as the last carbonari began striking their meagre camp he wiped his brow with his sleeve it was strange to see the streaks of powder smoke after so long his clothes were bloodspattered his hands too he pulled the pistol from his waistband to draw the charge how strange it all felt but it felt strange because it was so familiar almost comfortable time for us to be hove off hervey said peto guessing his thoughts ay nodded hervey ive seen ghosts here they spent the night in an uncomfortable hostaria not two hours drive from naples the horses were tired and the coachman had had enough of a fright not to want to risk more by continuing in the dark and both hervey and peto felt the need of a bath it was nearly eleven the following day therefore when they reached the place just beyond capodimonte which first afforded a view of the bay peto was soon searching with his telescope for sight of his squadrons tops and hervey saw an already happy man become perfectly content when at last he saw his frigates ensigns he himself had already concluded that his only chance of peace lay ironically with his return to arms he would not say at once to peto why but he would ask him if they might go first to the post office before rowing out to nisus chapter six happy returns london two months later horse guards parade of a sunny july morning was a sight which both commanded attention and pleased the eye after all the grand places they had visited in rome hervey was unsure how the capital of the greatest military power in the world would compare with that which had once claimed the same title it was only his fourth or fifth visit he could hardly profess any certain knowledge but his sister had been not once and to her therefore he was an accomplished guide so this is where sits the duke of york she said remembering the mixed fortunes it had spelled for her brother in the past five years it is replied hervey taking out his hunter and not many minutes before we shall see the changing of the horse guards they had walked from their respective lodgings in charles street he at the new premises of the united service club elizabeth at a comfortable hotel for ladies and she had thrilled at the elegance and pulsation combined that was st jamess after crossing through the park to the parade they now waited to see the daily spectacle of colour and military discipline a company of foot guards to elizabeths disappointment her brother confessed that he could not tell from which regiment were drilling in the middle of the parade ground their band thirtystrong and more using the echo from the buildings on three sides to swell their music so that it rose above every competing sound from the busy thoroughfares nearby the march they played was irish thought hervey for he had heard it many a time in irish bivouacs in the peninsula but he could not put a name to it five minutes before the hour by the horse guards clock the old guard a cornet a corporal of horse carrying the cased standard a trumpeter and seven private men of his majestys life guards three remaining sentinel at the whitehall entrance filed through the arch below and formed up in line in close order to await their reliefs the horses were impatient for a good trot on the way home having been confined to the little yard of the headquarters for a full twentyfour hours they fidgeted and bobbed their heads until their riders managed one by one to collect them lets get a little closer said hervey oh may we enquired elizabeth rather surprised as close as we like come he smiled it will be the first time i have walked this ground entirely at my own volition i think i may like the feeling especially since it may be the last time for some years to come she replied smiling doubtfully at him he smiled back i suppose yes if there is no fault with the agents the clock began striking the hour as the reliefs arrived at the walk from the mall the same number exactly from the royal horse guards the oxford blues their trumpeter sounded the approach the life guards brought swords to the carry and the blues formed up facing them there followed a curious colloquy between the cornets rein to rein which hervey strained to hear but without success he supposed it must be a report of the foregoing twentyfour hours but after a while he came to think it was probably no more than idle chat a conceit to hold in thrall the onlookers is it the same in the sixth asked elizabeth when the ceremony was over and the guards began dismissing to their respective duties no he smiled im afraid you would be very disappointed on that account our guards are mounted dismounted what a contradictory locution she teased though we are as fine a sight on parade he added quickly if perhaps not so imposing these are bigger men on bigger horses for the most part matthew i am sure i should be equally mystified by what passes in the sixth as here she took his arm again do we proceed she asked turning away hervey arrested the turn through the arch through the arch i should have thought no you may walk right up to the door of the duke of yorks headquarters itself dont you think that is very english could you have imagined the same in paris in late years for all that talk of égalité i cannot imagine paris at all sighed elizabeth you would be disappointed after rome i am so pleased to have a brother who is a man of the world she said putting a hand to his forearm it makes me feel a little less provincial hervey was not sure of the precise measure of his sisters irony i should never call you provincial no more than i should call myself a man of the world i think it more than travel alone which makes the latter shelley was more a man of the world though he had but crossed the english channel and i two oceans elizabeths expression indicated that she agreed i do wish i had had a little more time with mary shelley i told you did i not that she asked me to winter with them in italy no you did not that would be very agreeable i think he hoped he sounded convincing but he had a care for her reputation and the prospect of joining the shelley household was not something to be viewed lightly and then there was the question of georgiana over which he had daily been growing more troubled he was relying on elizabeths supervision in great part silently though her brother had borne those troubles however elizabeth had sensed them i cannot of course do so there will be so much to detain me in the parish she said dismissively but detain in its ambiguity was not a comforting word for hervey elizabeth might well insist that parochial calls and the poorrelief committee were the principal demands on her liberty but he knew it would be otherwise he was about to reply when the dismounted sentry in the arch came to attention bringing his sword upright from its point of rest on the shoulder hervey raised his hat in acknowledgement elizabeth blushed at the salute matthew does that man know you she whispered hervey smiled indulgently no elizabeth he cannot know me lord john howard told me they are instructed to salute those whom they believe are officers which they guess by some process best known to them only i imagine i rather think it a little game they play lord john says that their own officers are not averse to strolling through the arch out of uniform with a lady whom they seek to impress elizabeth sighed and others would do the same had they the chance no doubt but you are not yet an officer ought you to have returned the salute he raised an eyebrow i could not have disappointed the man nor me she gave a wry smile he smiled too well i assure you i did not walk this way with that object soldiers they are all the same he thought it would be to no avail to dispute it with her at the premises of messrs greenwood cox and hammersly in craigs court behind scotland yard they were received with unusual civility unusual in that each time hervey had entered the establishment before he had found the insouciance of the clerks to be verging on the impudent but on this occasion he was received by one of the partners offered hospitality and made to feel a valued customer of the regimental agents rather than a mere bookkeeping item the papers have been prepared sir said mr cox a man of a type hervey did not meet as a rule a commercial man fiftyish of some substance certainly but perforce deferential the nearest he could imagine was the regiments surgeon paymaster or veterinarian not an officer in the usual sense but sharing an officers milieu they were never entirely at home being just a degree above the class of artisan in the minds of many it never worried hervey it always seemed to worry them and by what date shall the commission be effective mr cox three days hence mr hervey it is all explained in a memorandum i have had prepared at signature today you will forthwith be cornet in the th dragoon guards tomorrow that cornetcy will be sold on and you will advance by purchase to a lieutenancy in the nd foot it was the most expedient you will understand sir hervey had to suppress a smile at the agents need to apologize for having him gazetted to an infantry regiment even for a day and the day following the lieutenancy shall be sold and the captaincy in the sixth purchased there is no risk of misadventure not at all sir we hold the respective bids in bond it is an entirely regular affair hervey raised an eyebrow and smiled dubiously it was always my understanding that it was most irregular mr cox raised both hands just a little and bowed in ordinary it is irregular sir as you will know a year must be spent in each rank before the next may be purchased but in a case such as yours there are many precedents it is not something to which an objection would be raised of that i can assure you mr hervey i am gratified mr cox and when do you say i shall be gazetted the london gazette will publish the commissioning and first promotion on thursday and friday of this week and your captaincy on monday it would be amusing to spend friday with the eightysecond said hervey smiling again where are they i am very much afraid that i do not know sir i think they may be in the west indies ah said hervey frowning disagreeable as well as impractical quite and so mr hervey if i might be so bold as to trouble you for the draft hervey had been that morning to the st jamess offices of greshams bank and there made the arrangements to draw on his account the sum of being the price which by ruses best not known the regiments colonel the earl of sussex had struck with the seller it was he knew an expensive way to purchase an annuity of but so few were the commissions compared with but five years ago when the cavalry stood at more than twice the number of regiments that the price was the sellers for the asking they were supposedly regulated the official price for a captaincy in the cavalry was nine hundred pounds below what he was now paying but the horse guards turned a blind eye to the practice of overbidding it suited now that there was a general peace in europe to have the army returned to the proprietorship of those with considerable independent means for on the whole they were less ambitious and less troublesome hervey handed an envelope to the agent thank you sir said cox laying it to one side on his desk without of course opening it that completes the formalities as i imagine you will recall is there any other way that we might be of service there was and hervey handed him a list of requirements touching his pay and credit arrangements in india all of which the agent said would be arranged with very little trouble i am obliged to you then mr cox and if you will now excuse me my sister and i have certain other errands to be about i am staying at the united service club until tomorrow only i shall see tomorrows gazette there promptly but i should deem it a service if you would have my page sent down by express to wiltshire i have no doubt that the arrangements are made but i have come to value exactitude a little more than i formerly did he said it with a smile but he meant it they left the agents and took a chaise to piccadilly to the premises of mr gieve the tailor who held the sealed patterns for the uniform of the th light dragoons herveys pleasure in the anticipation of this was easily evident to elizabeth who had insisted on accompanying her brother on business he had scarcely imagined would interest her in the slightest despite what was commonly held to be a females inescapable captivation by regimentals they were greeted warmly by mr rippingale the same genial cutter who had refurbished his military wardrobe at the end of the war five years past and attended him since when there were changes to be made how very gratifying it is to see you again sir he said bowing we received your letter only a few days ago but we have made a beginning is this your good lady sir we read of your nuptials in the times with considerable pleasure hervey faltered only momentarily no mr rippingale the lady is my sister he turned to elizabeth my dear this is mr rippingale who can cut and stitch an overallstripe straighter than any i have observed mr rippingale beamed at the recognition good morning madam i am flattered by captain herveys approval though i must say my work is made easier by the captains having an exceedingly good leg for a stripe i have observed so mr rippingale replied elizabeth returning the smile well then captain hervey i may call you that may i not sir i do not see why not mr rippingale from monday i shall anyway be gazetted as such yes indeed sir and may i say how glad i am that you are returning to the colours so to speak as he did so he pulled aside the curtain of an openfront wardrobe revealing a rack of uniforms partmade your measurements we have had for many years in our order book sir he turned again to elizabeth they have not changed greatly with the passing of the years madam that it was genuine enough praise was without doubt and elizabeth saw in her brothers face the look of a man who might have received some approving remark from a superior officer she had perhaps learned more about the soldier in him in a single morning than in all the years before what simple precepts animated him at root simple yet not unexacting hervey first tried the jacket a good fit as mr rippingale had predicted as too was the pelisse not as dashing as the hussars elizabeth im afraid he said frowning a touch as the pelisse was hung on his shoulder to check the fall may i ask what it is for well i imagine it served originally as a surtout but ive never had my sleeves through one if it is cold we wear a cloak then it serves no purpose mr rippingale maintained a detached air during the exchange although with the suggestion of a smile useless embellishments were not unwelcome in his trade it serves the purpose of smartness i suppose replied hervey a little put out by elizabeths utilitarian questioning she nodded and the braided belt too oh he said puzzled as mr rippingale took the crossbelt from its brushed cotton wrapping that is not the sixth pattern ah replied mr rippingale there has been a change in the regulations there is no longer a red stripe indeed said hervey approvingly elizabeth looked curious why should that be do you suppose matthew her brother smiled the stripe was a bone of contention in the mess when first i joined some commanding officer come from another regiment had said he wanted his officers distinguished in some way so that he might recognize them instantly and so the stripe was added before that the uniform had no red whatsoever and of that the officers were inordinately proud and so your new lieutenantcolonel has obliged the former tradition it would seem so and i am disposed already to like him for it although it must have stung in the pocket rather and i understand sir if i may added mr rippingale diffidently that the red cloak has also been replaced by a blue one excellent said hervey smiling wide it was ever a nuisance for covert work and all because someone had bought so much red cloth years back i think i prefer red said elizabeth examining a scarlet coatee hanging nearby i thought the life guards looked much nicer than the others this morning hervey looked pained you sound like one of miss austens heroines elizabeth pulled a face how her brother was enjoying this it tokened well they were another half an hour at mr gieves with each minute hervey parted with yet more of his modest savings true there was a margin to his account before he would need to mortgage his pay and he had not yet received the past years rents of the chintal jagirs but he was still most conscious of the need for economy and half of him believed that to be a very good thing in a soldier for it would keep him lean so to speak while the other half craved the means to be an independentminded officer if only he had not so precipitately disposed of all his former uniform when they left hervey asked if they should look for dining rooms as elizabeth said she was not hungry he took her instead to see mr bullocks museum of natural curiosities a little way along piccadilly he thought to show her the elephant which stood as the centrepiece in the egyptian hall so that he might better give her an account of his struggle to save the rajah of chintals hunting elephant when that great beast had become stuck fast in the quicksands of the sukri river but bullocks was more than usually crowded the main exhibit being no less than bonapartes carriage the very same that had carried the great disturber from the field of waterloo when all was lost hervey paid over his two shillings for them both dismayed that the price had exactly doubled since his last visit three years before and made straight for the centre of attention but oh the scene before them over the carriage and into it were clambering all manner of sightseers each anxious to be able to crow some proximity to the tyrant like a child taunting a caged beast at a menagerie hervey was as revolted by it as he would have been by the childs prodding stick i own freely to never having had a moments admiration for the man but this disrespect is gross unseemly elizabeth was more philosophical you must not take against them we were all so afeard of the bogeyman of europe and for so long that it is but relief hervey relented with a raising of his eyebrows i hate to see any soldier dishonoured by those who would never have the courage to face him in life elizabeth put a hand to his arm you are not wrong brother dear but you must allow for differences of temperament as indeed you seemed more willing to do of late hervey was minded to dispute his sisters thought in this instead he simply took her arm and they walked about the exhibits for a while in welcome solitude the carriage having drawn most of the sightseers matthew said elizabeth suddenly starting at the python coiled round a palm tree yet trying not to be dismayed i saw a poster proclaiming the waterloo rooms in pall mall is that far from here would you like to see them hervey had seen the poster too theyre but five minutes walk though i have no very strong desire to see them ill warrant theyre full of gruesome pieces scavenged from the field taken from dead and dying alike or else fanciful pictures and accounts i confess i have no stomach for it i should rather go and see this new bridge they call waterloo it is very handsome i hear tell a full halfmile of granite elizabeth was disappointed it would be nice to have some notion of the battle that is all it is difficult to conceive of your part in it with so scant a knowledge as i possess but her brother seemed not to hear he had been studying a mounted knight in full armour for some minutes elizabeth wondered what it was that engrossed him so when he emerged from his thoughts it was as if he had been turning over some profound question elizabeth would you come with me to hounslow tomorrow on our way to wiltshire i mean it would be a courtesy to call on the lieutenantcolonel rather than merely to write elizabeth thought she knew her brothers mind better now than she had ever done she was certain of what the trouble was there were ghosts to lay in that place and although her brother would face them alone if need be a sister might be a powerful support but would it be any kindness would it not be better to plead some reason why she could not go with him thus making him face the ghosts alone there would certainly be others in time for it seemed to her that he had condemned himself to a perpetual haunting but it was not in elizabeths nature to abandon her brother on their journey from rome he had spoken a good deal about the change in the sixth of which the earl of sussex had written and yesterday when they had called on him at his set in albany the colonel had repeated his opinion that there was much work to be done this had fired hervey it was true but elizabeth sensed also a certain anxiety its root she could not tell for sure and this uncertainty combined with simple sibling loyalty determined her response shall your commanding officer not think it a trifle strange that you should bring me she asked thinking the question fair no matter what the other considerations hervey was quick to reassure her if he reveals it then i shall know i have made a grave error in returning it was so stark an opinion that it fair took elizabeth aback she had not supposed that the question was so contingent on the character of one man and she said so hervey now sensed her surprise and was dismayed that she had not seemed to grasp the essentials of what had gone before these past two years the commanding officer is everything to a regiments soundness and fortune he meant to say it kindly he was sure he had meant it kindly but he knew it must have sounded otherwise he felt a terrible rush of despair in elizabeths incomprehension henrietta would have understood next day was st swithuns and to general relief it was not raining indeed it was as fresh and bright a morning as any they could remember of late in italy matthew hervey had advanced overnight from cornet of the th dragoon guards the carabineers as some knew them to lieutenant of the nd foot the prince of waless volunteers he had not worn any uniform of the carabineers nor would he of the eightysecond he did not think of himself as an officer of either regiment this was a paper transaction only the means by which he was proprietorially reinstated with a captaincy in his former regiment it was a curious system by any measure indeed he was not himself fully aware of its intricacies he had tried with varying degrees of success to explain it to others as he did now to elizabeth but why there should be such a system he did not rightly know although it had served the country well these past twenty years on the whole it had not been without its scandals and shortcomings had not the duke of york himself fallen foul of it a little while ago an unedifying affair of dubious trading in commissions but of one thing hervey was sure it was a most expeditious way of restoring him to the sixth and as the travelling chariot he had engaged for the journey to wiltshire drew up to the gates of the cavalry barracks at hounslow his only care was whether he might sufficiently conceal his pleasure at being home he did not recognize the sentry nor the corporal of the guard but entrance was arranged easily enough he did not announce himself by rank a lieutenant of line infantry would only serve to confuse instead handing his card to the corporal and declaring that he was come to see the lieutenantcolonel the corporal did not even look at the card that was an officers business instead he gave it to an orderly with instructions to accompany the gentleman to regimental headquarters he did not recognize you matthew said elizabeth curious as they drove towards the singlestorey building on the far side of the square its been more than a year and before that we worked by troops in the main its possible we never saw each other before if he joined after waterloo but it is unusual he was recognized at once at the regimental headquarters however mr lincoln the serjeantmajor was just leaving for his second rounds with the usual attendant party of picketserjeant provostncos and orderlies in an instant he transferred his whip from his right hand to under his left arm and threw up a salute so sharp that it quite startled elizabeth good morning captain hervey sir we had word this morning you were to rejoin hervey raised his hat by return elizabeth this is mr lincoln the regimental sarntmajor mr lincoln my sister an honour maam replied the rsm saluting her in turn though not as violently captain hervey has been very much missed these past twelve months hervey smiled just enough to reveal his gratification is the commanding officer at orderly room mr lincoln he is sir replied the rsm turning to one of his orderlies wiles go and tell the adjutant that captain hervey is calling on the lieutenantcolonel hervey nodded good good then ill let you be about the lines mr lincoln and look forward to being back there myself soon he resisted hard the temptation to ask him which would be his own lines for that should properly come from the commanding officer the rsm took his leave with another salute of absolute precision and struck off for the horse lines followed by his attendant ncos each trying to emulate the master in the business of saluting hervey turned to elizabeth and smiled in a way that conceded it was all rather different elizabeth gave a smile and raised her eyebrows perfectly grasping his meaning but there was no sign of diffidence on her part and hervey was impressed by it she had visited the regiment before in ireland but she had not come so close to the heart of things as here this morning on the very steps of the headquarters hervey was glad she had come and so was elizabeth the first thing he saw inside the building well lit by its clerestories were the two guidons the lieutenantcolonels and the majors lodged against the far wall and flanked by a semiarch of oldpattern sabres it was a good display proud and telling of the business the regiment was about then the adjutant stepped from his office and hervey was surprised to see it was asshetonsmith the adjutant was as a rule from the ranks not a troopofficer but before either of them could say a word there came a voice from the door of the further office hervey my dear sir i am so glad you have come i am so very glad we meet at last a man perhaps ten years older than him about his height and build with the fine unmistakably patrician features of the brother who had once been his idol advanced with a broad smile and outstretched hand hervey took off his hat smiled as broadly and took the hand i am very glad to be back colonel may i present miss hervey i presume my brother spoke of you sir ivo lankester bowed elizabeth curtsied returning his easy smile she had met herveys erstwhile troopleader in ireland and had liked him very much his brother appeared to her to have all sir edwards good manners and perhaps even more of his charm she at once concluded that matthew need have no concerns on his commanding officers account at least would you care to come into my office hervey and miss hervey too if that would not be too tedious i shall send for coffee or perhaps you would prefer tea miss hervey elizabeth was sure she would not find it in the least tedious to accept the invitation i should be very glad of coffee sir capital sir ivo exclaimed turning to the side and indicating the open door it was elizabeths first encounter with so intensely masculine a room and she was evidently much taken with the buttoned leather chairs the sabres and spurs the drums the oils of bloody battles and illustrious officers for she quite failed to catch the commanding officers enquiry elizabeth prompted her brother oh yes er sir ivo smiled i merely asked miss hervey if your time in rome had been agreeable i myself was there for some months before oxford i own that i might never have returned home had war not resumed oh i liked it very much too sir very much she replied now repossessed of her former senses i liked its gaiety above all i think though they say it is nothing compared with naples but alas we were not able to travel there because of brigandage she glanced at her brother the explanation would suffice who are the captains colonel asked hervey briskly rose has a troop barrow has b strickland c and d is sold to a man from the bays whom i have not yet met yours will be e troop so there are to be five troops only herveys voice betrayed a certain disappointment five yes that is to be the indian establishment i confess it dismayed me to begin with but so it shall be hervey glanced at elizabeth who seemed not greatly to care about the indian establishment engaged as she was by the intricate wirework on a shabraque laid over a chairback settee and who shall be my lieutenant the commanding officer hesitated for a moment as if he could not recall there is none at present that need be no bad thing thought hervey he could soon have a new lieutenant on the bit cornets colonel colonel lankester looked discomfited i regret there are no cornets either hervey oh hervey could not conceal his surprise at the squadrons being without any officers whatsoever no well you see hervey im afraid there is no troop in being third squadron was disbanded nine months ago i rather thought you might know this i imagined that well no matter we must raise a full troop inside five months before we embark for hindoostan that is why the colonel was so very particular in wanting you to return to duty herveys heart sank fast a troop of widows men to command and five months only to find recruits and remounts he might as well be with the eightysecond and yellow jack in jamaica after all chapter seven the serjeantmajor they left the barracks an hour later elizabeth in good spirits her brother tolerably so he leaned out of the window when they were well clear of the gates and called to the postilion to ask if he knew the windsor road he did and so hervey bade him put the pair into a trot as soon as possible for the spread eagle at datchet well might elizabeth look pleased hervey mused she had received much flattering attention and seen the regiment in hale condition all he had been able to see was blank trooprolls and empty stalls true he had been told that he could draw on mr lincolns seniority list of corporals and that lincoln also had a promising list of chosen men and sir ivo lankester had been straight and fair with him i will sign any reasonable promotion order had he not said at once hervey had sought to probe what was reasonable to sir ivos mind i should wish for serjeant armstrong to be my serjeantmajor colonel i trust that would not go badly with the seniority rule he asked squarely sir ivo had shaken his head promoting armstrong would not go badly with the seniority rule he had replied that is it would not go badly if armstrong were with us still hervey was stunned the colour drained from him in an instant i i had no idea that when did he die colonel where is his family no no not dead not at all dead i mean that he was discharged these six months and more herveys relief was palpable but the very idea of armstrong unbooted was only a partial consolation why did he have his discharge colonel he had made a fine recovery had he not the lieutenantcolonel furrowed his brow i dont rightly know i had not been in command many months weeks indeed when he applied mr lincoln says he had become listless perhaps if he had returned to a troop instead of light duties with the quartermasters and how goes he now do we have word of his family again mr lincoln would best advise you i know that he keeps a posthouse near eton sir ivo knew because he had himself arranged for it though he did not say so hervey knew that it was not a time to explore his own culpability in armstrongs listlessness nor in armstrongs estrangement from the regiment which he had made his family when his own had been destroyed by a firedamp explosion fifteen years before but guilt pricked him hard nonetheless no matter how pressing his duty here and to his own family in wiltshire he must see for himself that armstrong was sound in soul as well as body he glanced at elizabeth with your leave colonel i should like to take a look at mr lincolns promotion lists and then make a start for wiltshire i should like if i may a fortnight in which to set affairs right at home and then to report for duty sir ivo smiled indulgently of course hervey of course take as long as you need theres no profit in having you begin before you can give it your heart hervey had known sir ivo but a halfhour yet he thought he had known him an age so thoroughly regimental was his view he could have been lord george irvine joseph edmonds or sir edward lankester for that matter how right lord sussex had been if not entirely fulsome with detail when he had said that he was certain the sixth were restored hervey rose and took up his hat and held out a hand to elizabeth i shall spend a little while with the adjutant and mr lincoln then colonel and afterwards drive west i cannot prevail on you to stay to luncheon hervey had glanced at elizabeth as a courtesy but he had then declined then while you are with asshetonsmith and the rsm allow me at least to show your sister the horse lines elizabeth had accepted without waiting for her brothers leave hervey left his sister to take in the sights of the berkshire countryside while he himself sat back to contemplate the reunion ahead he had no very clear idea of what it was he would say to armstrong a man he counted more than just his erstwhile serjeant there was so much he could say what he owed him what he had failed him in what he might do for him yet confused notions which swam before him as the chariot picked up speed on the windsor turnpike and what a very agreeable mode of posting was the travelling chariot had he but had one in italy where the full vision forward would have afforded them many a longer preview of the glorious sights of that country he knew full well it was an indulgence he was unlikely to be able to afford for many a year indeed he had only been able to engage the chariot for the two days which would mean their changing at andover or perhaps even newbury to something altogether more utilitarian they sped past fields of ripening barley empty now of the hoes which for months had tramped up and down the drills in a few weeks or so they would be filled again with scythes and rakes by men and women who like as not had known nothing other than husbandry and never would and yet seemed content that it was so it was from men such as these that hervey must find his recruits willing volunteers he could go to the courts and arrange with the bench for felons to be given the choice of being sent down or taking the kings shilling but all he had seen of that sort of recruit was trouble no not all of them not every one for was not private finch called chokey for the manner of his enlisting and could anyone doubt there was a truer man in a fight than finch but the effort in finding one good man was too great hervey had never been enamoured of those paying with the drum nor had any of the sixths officers or serjeants for that matter and armstrong had always added a practical as well as a principled objection if a man were caught at petty crime he would not have the wit to be a good light dragoon are you going to say what is on your mind matthew hervey sighed i had so hoped that the troop would be wellfound he would admit to no more elizabeth said nothing she could not be certain but she supposed her brothers despondency was caused not so much by the absolute state of numbers but because he would not have around him those who had previously been his succour his mind had been set on boot and saddle for a full month now and to find a troop of widows men as it was known was disappointment indeed that his serjeant and others of the like were gone was even greater discouragement to him and yet elizabeth was not so sure that this was necessarily for the bad for she had observed in her brother over many years that he was not content with things as he found them there was always the urge to adjust to change to improve in fact she was very much of the opinion that raising a troop recruits and remounts alike was just what her brother needed to engage every atom of mind and body these next five months it was a high price for her and their parents that she knew well enough for his time would not be theirs but it was a price which any who truly loved him would pay willingly and serjeant armstrong added hervey suddenly after a full minutes silence i cannot bear to think of him as diminished elizabeth looked puzzled by his taking a posthouse you mean no not that especially by the loss of vigour i suppose mental and physical when last i saw him he walked slowly and had fearful headaches and what did colonel lankester say of him now oh he has not seen him in many months it seems he went to ireland in the summer with caithlin to see her people and has not been near hounslow since well you could scarce blame him for wanting to put a little distance between himself and the regiment hervey raised his eyebrows didnt he of all people know about wanting that ay thats fair enough but armstrong so likes the company of his peers its difficult to imagine him he has his family matthew it was perhaps a little cruel to remind him of that but elizabeth considered it important that her brother should approach this reunion with a proper understanding he turned to her half smiling and placed a hand over hers you are very good to me i always was she insisted smiling back and see where it has got me i shall end an old maid in your service i should not mind that hervey teased indeed i shall call you dorcas for you are full of good works i suppose i would rather be called dorcas than tabitha replied elizabeth frowning hervey admired as well as loved his sister it was not just her public charity and her devotion to him it was the daily evidence of a good mind a selfimproved mind yet a mind that was prepared to sacrifice what it might become for the sake of the rest of her family whose needs had varied with the years and whose number had so lately seen increase and decrease he had left her with scarcely a thought when he was little more than a youth and had now returned in the unspoken expectation that she would accomplish whatever he required of her he had seen how commodore peto had been gladdened by her company and she by his and yet he had sped his sister away from rome the instant he decided to answer the colonels call and he would leave georgiana in her care just as he had jessye with private johnson exonerating himself by the notion that it was his own life that had greatest need of amendment but he was still half afraid the worms might eat at him from within for dorcas had died a maid doing her good works and he was not peter to raise her up again the spread eagle was a smarterlooking establishment than hervey had feared as the chariot hove into the yard a pair of ostlers ran out from the stables and had the leader out of the traces almost before the postilion had dismounted these were men practised with the mails whose proud boast it was never to touch the same strap twice but hervey wanted no relief team this minute he intended to dine here he said and then they would take four horses not two for the longer haul to newbury or if fortune favoured them andover and he wanted to settle the amount now before seeing armstrong three shillings per mile sir said the horsemaster with two postboys that is hervey groaned to himself posting to newbury let alone andover would cost him the best part of five pounds he had better reacquire the habit of thrift soon else the expenses of the sixth would oppress him sorely very well in an hour say they left the yard to the ostlers and headed for the postentrance inside a cherubfaced bootboy showed them to a private sitting room and hervey asked for the postmaster the boy bowed and tugged at his forelock enthusiastically but with a clumsiness that suggested he was still a novice after a fumbling encounter with the door handle he took his leave the armstrongs are evidently well set up here hervey ventured elizabeth nodded glancing about the room the wainscotting was newly polished a fair enough test she thought hervey was pleased for them pleased that they should have found so fitting a billet on the other hand he was displeased for himself for there was scant likelihood of armstrong leaving such a place for the uncertainties of the regiment within the minute the door opened again to caithlin armstrong her copperred hair was pulled back severely yet still not enough to make her face anything but as warm and welcoming as when hervey had first seen it those five years ago in kilcrea the time she had soothed his blistered hands with balsam captain hervey and miss hervey maam what an honour this is she did not curtsy but her pleasure was real enough caithlin armstrong even caithlin omahoney had never revealed a trace of guile in all the difficulties she had faced since first encountering the sixth hervey bowed a shade selfconsciously not so long ago he would have kissed her but things were different now elizabeth smiled full and easy although they had met but half a dozen times she admired her independent spirit her cheerfulness for it was plain to all that caithlin had wits far beyond the run of things and that these were scarcely tried and what was more elizabeth would concede that for all the difference in their respective traditions caithlins devout religion was heartening in the extreme good afternoon mrs armstrong she replied for them both i hope we do not call at an inconvenient hour not in the slightest maam replied caithlin my jack will be returned from windsor at any moment he has gone to the horse fair hervey was encouraged the more this sounded like armstrong restored in spirits as well as health and how are you he hesitated caithlin oh i am very well thank you captain hervey caithlin had reverted to the formal way as soon as she had become engaged to armstrong we have a son now too a son indeed hervey was very happy for her for them both his happiness was almost enough to ease the twisting in his gut elizabeth asked if she might see the children and caithlin consented proudly they left hervey to himself and ascended the stairs at the back of the posthouse to a simply furnished bedroom with pretty flowered curtains through which the afternoon sun came softly and warm son and daughter were sleeping as elizabeth and caithlin tiptoed to the bedside but elizabeth saw that they were fine babies in her heart she knew her brothers purpose here was futile indeed she wondered if it were at all honourable when they were back in the sitting room tea was brought and arrangements for a travelling dinner were made hervey and caithlin exchanged reports of italy with news of cork and then when they were finished with tea caithlin asked if they had just come from hounslow yes said hervey uncertain as to how she had concluded that would you be going back to the regiment then captain hervey her manner was as matter of fact as it was candid hervey tried not to sound hesitant yes yes i am caithlin smiled so you shall be but a short drive from here my jack will like that right enough and you too miss hervey no not i mrs armstrong i must stay with my parents i think elizabeth spoke lightly as if it were of little moment the regiment is for india soon explained hervey he thought how repellent it must sound to a wife and mother oh india she sighed when jack hears he will beg you to take him as your groom hervey laughed politely it is true i assure you protested caithlin there isnt a day goes by without his lamenting for a parade and when those life guards from windsor go by its like seeing an old horse prick up its ears at the hunt passing if this were so and caithlin had never been a one for exaggeration or idle gossip then hervey was dismayed true he had come to datchet with a halfformed notion of rescuing the armstrongs from penniless drudgery taking his erstwhile serjeant back to the regiment with him restoring his rank and more but here was neither penury nor menial labour he had no right to tempt this womans husband even for a moment better that he made his excuses now and left with his respects and good wishes for caithlins worthy provider but caithlin would have none of it perhaps she sensed herveys purpose she certainly spoke with fervour captain hervey you see us very wellfound materially and we are ever so grateful to colonel lankester for that but jacks heart isnt in it oh he does a fine job all right he does it for me and the bairns as he calls them but for himself he is dispirited and very deeply i think it has troubled me a very great deal these last months hervey could scarce comprehend that armstrong too had found himself thus for he had supposed that his own dispirits were occasioned wholly by his widowing armstrong with a wife he adored and two children with a fine mother could not pine so much for the sixth surely but is he recovered in body at least caithlin colonel lankester spoke of headaches and lassitude oh gracious mary hes as fit as when first he rode into kilcrea he throws himself into work just to tire himself out im sure of it but the headaches the colonel said his discharge papers spoke of neuralgia i think that was the word he has not had a headache in months captain hervey well not one whose cause was not manifestly apparent she frowned with a sort of mock disapproval caithlin wait a moment are you truly telling me that geordie armstrong landlord of a going place as this would exchange it for the ranks of the sixth i am on condition hervey looked quizzical on condition that i did not object six months ago i would have hidden all his clothes had he so much as mentioned it but i see now he is not the man i married and i cant be happy if he is not hervey recalled the selfsame words a year and a half before when henrietta had pleaded with him not to accept the sinecure of the yeomanry command the landlord of the spread eagle returned within the hour hervey heard his voice in the yard outside unmistakable them are two bonny mares me lad the best hay only for them he rose in anticipation caithlin me love i armstrong stood openmouthed as he saw his captain hello geordie said hervey holding out his hand well ill be damned said armstrong oblivious to all else but the reunion but then he saw elizabeth and reddened oh i beg your pardon miss ervey he stammered glancing at caithlin who was already frowning i didnt see nor me either jack armstrong said caithlin oh im sorry for you too love captain hervey here quite took me aback hervey was almost laughing it was not every day he could see a serjeant even one no longer serving so completely abashed its very good to see you geordie and so obviously at home armstrong grinned ay sir im at home all right and right pleased i am an all to see you and you too miss hervey youre looking proper well maam elizabeth smiled armstrong had charmed her from the first moment he had visited them at horningsham thank you serjeant armstrong or mister i should say either way maam either way most folks as know me round here still call me by rank misters too much like an officer for my ear have you had some tea by the way yes we have thank you replied elizabeth and seen your beautiful children armstrong beamed with pride ay theyre two bonny bairns as ever there were caithlin now determined to take charge of matters miss hervey would you like to look at the garden it is not very large but quite pretty yes i would indeed said elizabeth eagerly knowing full well the purpose in the invitation when they were gone armstrong bid hervey sit down something to drink sir in a minute maybe but i want to ask you something first can i ask you something first sir of course have you just come from hounslow yes hervey said it cautiously not sure what armstrong might be getting at then i know what youre going to ask how do you know oh theres always ncos coming here for a wet its e troop isnt it youre going back and taking over the chestnuts hervey smiled and nodded except that its d now that has the colour and you want me to come back an all as your serjeant hervey let the smile go no indeed i do not you are quite wrong in that armstrong looked perfectly crestfallen so much so that hervey at once felt heartless for the joke i do not want you as serjeant i want you as serjeantmajor armstrong now looked wholly taken aback though less pained good god sir i never thought id hear such a thing never in a lifetime hervey was puzzled promotion was never easy especially for an nco of armstrongs stamp but he never imagined it would not have been forthcoming had armstrong stayed with the colours i dont think i want to have command of e troop unless youre its serjeantmajor there isnt a man better suited its as simple as that can we have a drink now sir yes i should like that a little port if you have it to hand i do he went to the door port and a flagon potslad he called then returned to his chair i have two a day only that much is better at least than when we were serving hervey nodded perhaps i shouldnt say this but caithlin gave us to believe she would not be sorry to return to the regiment else i should never press you to it now armstrong sighed caithlins said it a dozen times if shes said it once that id only be happy wearing blue again you dont sound so sure armstrong shifted in his seat look sir every man in the sixth knows what went on in canada and before for that matter well youve nothing to fear in that respect im not afeard of anything least of all what the canteens are saying im just not sure itd be the same hervey was even more puzzled nothings ever the same but you and i are no worse soldiers for all that happened armstrong shook his head im not so sure about that that savage got the better of me from behind me not seeing him even that should never have been id have bawled out a recruit for not watching is back like that and they all know it at hounslow it wouldnt be fair on you he did not say that in that lapse he had let his captain down but armstrong believed it that no one else even thought it let alone believed it would never be consolation to him hervey pictured the scene of armstrongs undoing his raging perhaps for an instant losing that field sense which keeps the good soldier alive and he saw henrietta perhaps more terrified still by the invincible armstrongs destruction before her very eyes he shook himself look we had all this out a year ago theorys one thing but it cant always be i got that spontoon in my leg at toulouse in the same way but it didnt mean i was finished in the eyes of the troop everybody knows you went singlehanded at a bunch of savages and fought like a tiger thats what they think of geordie armstrong not that one of them got the better of him ay maybe look you used to admonish me when i said i couldnt be done with the shame of serjeant stranges death well its the same now with you the pot boy came in with a tray hervey took his glass in silence armstrong likewise a long time they sat without a word sipping occasionally this was not a matter to be rushed and hervey was not inclined to be the first to speak he would wait however long to hear the evidence of what had truly become of geordie armstrong chapter eight home truths salisbury plain a week later hervey eased himself into the ash dugout which daniel coates regarded as the chair of honour the room had moved on to oak and then mahogany over the decades but still that piece was coatess pride for he had fashioned it himself from windfall when first he had married it was all indeed that now materially remained of those days there was a way of sitting in it which was tolerably comfortable and hervey having bent to take off his spurs shuffled until he found it and then took the glass of purl which coatess manservant brought tell me what are the designs regarding your widows troop coates asked hervey looked at him quelling a smile they had just ridden the downs together and the old soldier had pressed him every minute of it to details of the regiment and his imminent fortunes yet even now there was more that coates would know it was the same daniel coates of his boyhood without a doubt the hair was white and thinned the cheeks sunken and the back a little bent but in all else coates seemed as he had always been matthew im sorry dan what how shall you raise the men and where shall the horses come from hervey sighed well the second questions a sight easier to answer than the first therell be no remounts until india and as for recruits im very much afraid it will be the usual fashion the colonels made a start sending out parties under the more active serjeants and hes offered a special bounty to any man wholl enlist his own brother hes very much of the opinion that brothers exercise a beneficent effect on each other i only ever saw one lot myself and they was the biggest pair of rogues in the regiment they were both in chokey at the same time at one point but i think they listed as a pair though nobody was to know hervey had no cause to dispute it but he supposed the colonel was a discerning man when it came to brothers well hes confident of filling the ranks ere the summers out he told me he believed my concern would be drill and not recruiting coates looked puzzled how are you to drill dragoons without troopers hervey raised his eyebrows i suppose the riding master must have sufficient to introduce them to the saddle but therell be no jockeys this side of india thats for sure it doesnt much matter says the colonel for were hardly going to the seat of war hindoostan has been quiet these past three years since the pindarees were seen to coates did not look entirely convinced its always a business taking over another regiments horses youre better off with roughs nine times out of ten and i think roughs are what well get for i gather the regiment there has been on a much reduced establishment ay well your workll be cut out matthew he took a match and relit his pipe letting the smoke rise a while before breaking the comfortable silence and hows that yearling of yours havent seen him in months hes as fine as you could want hell make a charger all right and jessye have you had her under the saddle yet we hackneyed through longleat park yesterday and she would have had a good run if id let her i should put the stallion to her again matthew never has the demand for roadsters been greater the mails are running up and down the turnpikes like quicksilver these days shed make you a pretty penny hervey nodded perhaps if i were staying that groom of yours going to india too then he is indeed private johnson would have preferred to keep his cosy billet in horningsham of that hervey was sure but as johnson himself had said when first hervey had told him of his intentions beggars could not be choosers johnsons only fear which was his only secret too was the workhouse i thought of attaching him to my father but i would take him if you like hervey smiled now youre gainsaying your earlier counsel dan i gave him the choice and he made up his own mind though it was probably hobsons choice coates inclined his head as much as to say there was more to herveys observation than perhaps he thought hobsons was not a bad choice matthew it was to spare his horses if you remember yes i do remember now both of them knew also that johnson had been as devoted to henrietta as a groom might be coates at least knew that this bound him more fast to his master now than ever shall you stay for a bite of dinner i thank you dan but no we have mr keble calling on his way back to oxford you remember him i do he made that pleasing sermon at your wedding i shouldnt forget im hervey looked forward keenly to seeing john keble again but he knew that wounds would probably reopen thereby it will be the first time since the wedding that we have met daniel coates was not for treading lightly about the subject and how are things at the big house matthew you mean with lord bath ay it cant help that son of is running off with yon harriet robbins the elopement of the marquess of baths son and heir with the daughter of the turnpikekeeper was the talk of west wiltshire and it had indeed made for greater strain in herveys own intercourse at longleat he was certain that lord and lady bath despite their solicitude when first he had come home from canada must hold him to blame to some degree for henriettas death she was a deuced pretty girl harriet as i recall and old robbins was an honest man theres every reason to suppose theres none at all matthew as very well you know ive a lot of time for bath hes as good a man as you might want in that house but hes proud too hervey could not gainsay it he had always supposed that his own connection with longleat had been viewed by the marquess more with resignation than approval even though henrietta had been his ward not blood youre right dan you go there every day i trust to the nursery yes but i dont always see the family coates nodded keep with them matthew hervey knew that he must and our prayers should be with his lordship for never was there a steadier hand at such a troubled time oh yes the troubles there have been these last months matthew but he is still of a mind to have a proper police in this country and speaks of it in parliament often he brought all the magistrates together a week ago these reformers are playing a merry dance about the country a lot of what they say is only right and proper his lordship himself agrees with much of it but the manner of it is very ill it leads only to trouble that hunt as i knew when the family was across the plain at upavon hes nothing more now than a rabblerouser he conceals it just sufficient to keep from arrest but his lieutenants do the dirty work his name draws the crowds now did you read of that meeting in london three days ago hervey nodded they wont recognize any laws passed from now on ay thousands there were at that meeting by all accounts hunt was waving a tricolour they say did you ever hear anything so damnable lord bath has the yeomanry prompt at hand for that sort of thing travels all too easily and theres too much distress in the county well i for one should never want a part in aiding the magistrates again said hervey very decidedly the yeomen are most welcome to it the dining room of the vicarage in horningsham was not large but neither was the party that evening consisting of besides the family the incumbent of upton scudamore his wife and the reverend mr keble it was however an occasion for the best china and glass as well as mrs herveys family table linen she had fretted that there had been no fish to be had in warminster save common trout and that the beef freshslaughtered off the high street the day before was not as tender as ought to have been but cook had done her usual best and there could be no cause now for fearing that her guests would be affronted and the candles were of the best quality too not the everyday ones that could whistle and spit at inopportune moments not that their light was needed at this hour of a summer evening but fashion required that they be lit and if the conversation detained the party more than a couple of hours which with mr keble and the vicar of upton scudamore present it might there would certainly be the want of it perhaps at this hour though the candlelight might have been better employed in illuminating the family portraits thought hervey for these being of clergymen were so colourless as to make them disappear he himself had no need of a candle of course for he knew each feature and fold of them their presiding presence had been both a comfort and a caution all his life like his parents indeed his father especially who had of late become as venerablelooking as the portraits canon hervey had joined the party last having returned late from the bishops palace he was eager to tell them of it i should have been very much later without that curricle it fair flies he explained with a distinct twinkle in his eye father bought the former archdeacons equipage mr keble explained elizabeth i wonder the former archdeacon didnt have a sulky declared mrs hervey for who would wish to drive with such a disagreeable man as he it is a very elegant carriage archdeacon said john keble i own to having but a very modest gig in my new parish hervey was as ever pleased that john keble found the opportunity to stay a night in horningsham keble had become a friend albeit for the most part in adversity if he did not yet freely confide in mr keble he had nevertheless a sense that if ever there came the time to do so he would find an uncommon understanding of the human condition far in excess of what might be imagined of a donnish young man in his first parish i never knew that our roads and carriages were so much better than any on the continent until our visit to rome said elizabeth hoping to draw her mother further from the subject of the former archdeacon of sarum we scarcely ever seemed to go at even a moderate trot by all your brother has told me miss hervey replied keble looking particularly earnest the continent is inferior in many respects of human endeavour and for that i believe we must be thankful for having seen nothing of an invading army these many years past just so keble agreed canon hervey laying down his glass it is a terrible thing to have to bury ones silver every other year there was an empty place at table mrs hervey explained that the new incumbent of upton scudamore was to have joined them but he had sent word only this last hour that he had a chill which had gone to his head and did not wish to share it with the family you would have liked harrison keble opined canon hervey he is lately chaplain at christs college in cambridge and a strong member of the intellectual party there i am very pleased to have him in the archdeaconry i may tell you hervey smiled at his father so now there is high ground to be of mutual support on both roads between salisbury and wells the table enjoyed the joke just so matthew just so agreed his father and you can signal to each other with incense smoke you see mr keble said elizabeth feigning despair my brother cannot speak but in military metaphors keble replied with equal gravity of course miss hervey your brother is a soldier to his fingertips how else must he be expected to speak matthew she replied with a note of challenge is not signalling with smoke dangerous can it not be seen by an enemy too yes he conceded at once but if the enemy already know you are there then nothing will be revealed so long as you employ a code mrs hervey looked alarmed no message can be concealed with incense we have had quite enough trouble with the diocesan to last a lifetime i beg you would not mention incense ever again it is an abomination unto me the late charges of romish practice against his father being evidently of present memory to his mother hervey felt obliged to deflect the conversation how does your work on archbishop laud stand father is it near ready for the publisher canon hervey sighed not in its complete form i fear for there is still too much to be done with it but i am preparing a monography on laudian decorum for the british critic hervey had deflected the conversation insufficiently however and mrs hervey needed further reassurance that her husbands scholarship would not lead to a recurrence of activity in the consistory court john keble was able to allay her worst fears i heard a sermon at oriel only last month on like matters there is little appetite i think for troubling over what is said or written if it is in the manner of scholarship oh i am very pleased to hear it mr keble declared mrs hervey earnestly and now if you please let us have no more talk of these things matthew tell us some more of italy what of its art and its music if you will added keble equally anxious to avoid further disputation on the church of england and its tangled rubrics did you see the opera elizabeth giggled mr keble you must know that matthew has no music in him save the drum and the bugle that is unfair and inaccurate we do not have drums in the cavalry not even kettledrums challenged elizabeth oh well yes but not drums as i supposed you meant them and i thought the bugle was what the infantry played added mrs hervey no the cavalry too for mounted calls it is pitched an octave higher than the trumpet so the call carries further we did go to the opera mr keble elizabeth assured him in rome and matthew sniggered the while hervey looked uncomfortable well it was a very singular business and i was not the first to laugh how so asked his father hervey looked at his sister and raised his eyebrows as if censuring her for what would be revealed it was an opera by an italian called rossini he is very famous there and he himself directed it from the piano he came into the orchestra wearing the strangest coat the colour of cream and it caused great hilarity then after the overture which was i must say very lively a tenor came on stage with a guitar to serenade his love and all the strings broke at the first chord the audience hooted with laughter and very many of them clericals i might have done the same said canon hervey and i too archdeacon added mr keble supportively elizabeth frowned at them both her brother emboldened warmed to his story soon afterwards the same happened to someone with a mandolin and then there came someone else who fell straightway onto his nose and there was blood all over his robe the hooting and catcalls were so bad that signor rossini fled the orchestra and the whole thing was abandoned we had our money back and went to a firework display instead which matthew liked because it looked as though the castle there was under siege i tell you papa he has no appreciation of anything but the sound of the trumpet and the thunder of the captains and the shouting added john keble oh i should imagine especially the shouting mr keble after dinner hervey and keble walked together in the garden there was a full moon and it was warm not unlike an evening in india i should suppose said keble looking up at the sky and the stars will be the same in those latitudes no doubt yes i believe you are right though i shall be further north this time in hindoostan and georgiana she will remain here with your sister hervey did not reply at once there were so many things he might say to qualify the simple yes i confess it will be harder than i ever supposed she is no longer a mere babe in arms she will have a christian upbringing that is more than most i fear ive settled all henriettas property in trust to her i was intending to ask if you might consent to be a trustee i am honoured it would mean your going to the attorneys in warminster tomorrow i see no objection in that you are very good and to my father too he prizes your counsel highly you know hervey your father has nigh on forty years cure of souls and i scarcely a tenth of that my counsel as you put it can in his respect only ever be from a standpoint of theory well without experience theory is the only resort that seems a good military precept will you write to me from india does the regiment take a chaplain there i fear i do not know who is to be this new bishop in calcutta i shall indeed write i dont know whether we take a chaplain nor even whether it is a good or a bad thing their quality is little admired we have spoken of this before you and i john keble stopped and turned full towards him you must be steadfast in your daily prayers my good friend now of all times i do not ask if you are hervey sighed to himself it was just as well that keble did not chapter nine the recruiting party hounslow a month later well sarntmajor we have a troop orderly room and an acquittance roll and scarcely more than a quarterguardsworth of names to enter on it troop serjeantmajor armstrong huffed them bringers have been about as useful as a sewnup arse ive a mind to go down there meself twentytwo in all not badlooking men on the whole and six that can read and write at least the bringersve not been sweeping the gutters we might have to do that yet sir said armstrong if we leave for india under strength itll be a year before the depot troop can send us the rest i reckon wed be broken up inside that time i well know it sarntmajor and im not sure i want every man that elects to stay from the regiment thats leaving half a dozen maybe but more would be a veritable combination they do say a married man in indias a better soldier but id take some convincing hervey allowed himself a smile id not trade you for a singleton sarntmajor and in truth sir i wouldnt ever want to be one not even to be shaved in bed of a morning like them charwallahs do i thought charwallahs brought them tea dont they probably that an all a punkahwallah cools them with a fan as i remember well if we dont get active sir theyll be fanning empty beds id like to send collins into london today hes a good eye that i grant you but londons yielded up precious few to the regimental parties we wont get the best there thats for sure but i dont see as weve time to be traipsing round the county looking for likely men and sure as hell we dont want to take any as is paying with the drum well at any rate not any that have a large payment to make the odd fellow whos fallen foul of the bench of a saturday night oughtnt to be too much of a problem hervey knew that his serjeantmajor was not wholly convinced of the corrective qualities of soldiering despite his rough and ready ways his quick temper and his fondness for a drink armstrong held strongly to the notion that character would out as soon as the guns began to play in the infantry this did not matter so much for the bad characters were held in line by the ncos close by them and all the line had to do was wheel and form and deliver volleyfire on command in the cavalry it was not so easy a dragoon was much more upon his honour as regards his horse doing outpost duty and going to it with the sword a rough could be redeemed by military discipline but a bad hat never and the trick was always to know which was the one and not the other hervey observed closely as his serjeantmajor took up the acquittance roll again and began examining the names armstrongs new uniform fitted handsomely showing off the barrel chest and powerful arms that had made him so formidable a fighter in a mêlée the regiment would not have been the same without him and how good did that fourth chevron look at last do you want to see those as came in yesterday sir hervey did so they walked to the pump in the yard outside e troops empty stables where dragoons were throwing buckets of water over half a dozen brought men it would have been the same in the depths of winter and the dragoons went at it with a will since they had no wish to share the lice and other vermin which recruits brought with them why ay exclaimed armstrong suddenly corporal mossop fetch that redeaded man over here mossop half dragged the man in front of the serjeantmajor trying to march him over would have taken all day sir turn im about corporal corporal mossop knew the order would be pointless he jerked him round to face rear armstrong pulled the mans long red hair roughly to one side i thought as much he snarled hervey too saw the bc brand on his shoulder why cant them bringers look properly about turn he barked the man spun rightabout like a top ending up with his hands at attention by his side and his eyes set distant exactly as if on parade and what might your former service be my bonny lad the mans voice faltered six years sir thirtyfourth foot and why did the thirtyfourth discharge you rather not say sir rather not say i bet you wouldnt he turned to hervey sir hervey knew his serjeantmajor wanted him to say throw him out of the gates for that was what the army intended when it branded a man bad character but he recoiled more from the notion of branding than from the letters themselves can we not see how he goes to his work while we try to find out why he was discharged armstrong suppressed a sigh i wouldnt want him messing with the others to begin with sir he can sleep in the guardroom can he not he can sir corporal mossop double this man away i want an eye on him at all times sir not a good beginning said hervey how did you know to look for a brand there were no lash marks just an instinct thats all but i only thought there might be a d trying it on for the bounty ay there was a man anged not six months back for it deserted and then listed again eighteen times before he was discovered well five pounds and four shillings is an attractive bounty but i wonder that someone on the take doesnt go to the infantry for the other guinea maybe weve a soft name sir hervey frowned yes weve both of us seen men who thought they were enlisting to an easier life because they rode to battle rather than walked armstrong screwed up his face but ill ave that bastard if e does prove a bad character and ill ave that maryanne mossop for not being sharper ill stop his bringingmoney thats for certain hervey was beginning to wonder if one more recruit was worth the trouble the others look cleanlimbed you cant fault corporal mossop for that ay they do right enough yon dragoon he shouted a smartlooking private man doubled over to them and saluted sir who are you lad ashbolt sir c troop the keen eyes said it all hervey sighed to himself he wished he had twenty like him well when youve finished dusting them with that evilsmelling powder line them up for inspection yes sir ashbolt saluted and doubled away in as straight a line as the keen eyes could manage with them the six recruits stood as upright as they could name barked armstrong at the first a wellmade lad harkness sir work cooper sir then there was insufficient so i was laid off broad shoulders told that he must have been useful when work there was read or write i can read a little if you please no if you please lad just plain sir yes sir and that sir is addressed not to me but to the officer on parade harkness looked confused youll learn soon enough said armstrong moving to the next name french sir id change that quickly if i were you lad please sir never mind work countinghouse clerk sir lost your character did you no sir the boy for that was all he looked sounded indignant his black curls bobbed as he shook his head i didnt like the city sir country are you do you know horses ive driven a pair sir his voice was not of the common stamp armstrong eyed him suspiciously and moved to the third name smith sir oh yes yes sir i was a boiler with the oakley i have a testimony from lord tavistock sir why did you leave i wanted to list in the horse guards sir but they said i was too short sir read and write no sir armstrong turned to the next your name lad sisken sir the words were barely audible armstrong looked down at the spreading pool by the mans left foot good he said simply and moved on name mccarthy sor hervey looked closer armstrong continued employ private man hundred and fourth foot sor armstrongs suspicions rose like storm cones i had my honourable discharge sor the man insisted the gentle cork lilt now plain the hundred and fourth were disbanded two years ago sarntmajor explained hervey stepping forward a pace we have met before have we not mccarthy we have sor armstrong looked at hervey for enlightenment in le havre a little affair of rebellious frenchmen private mccarthy has a cool head under fire thank you sor armstrong eyed him up and down taking his own measure and moved to the last man name mole sir occupation ireling sir mole looked to armstrong to be little more promising than sisken a harelip giving his face a permanent expression of alarm and rendering his speech awkward read or write no sir armstrong turned to hervey and saluted carry on sir please a word with them first sarntmajor he looked left and right at the six recruits somehow by the miracle of military training and discipline they would become handy dragoons in his new troop but at this stage he could be excused for doubting the existence of miracles i want no men who will not put their heart into their work he began for there is little time before we sail for india i will grant any of you a free discharge on repayment of the bounty only no smart money up to tomorrow midday thereafter i will expect you to bend your backs to it without complaint that is all carry on please sarntmajor corporal mossop had by this time returned to the yard corporal mossop carry on barked armstrong mossop saluted as they turned away i doubt theyd be able to raise one mans bounty between em armstrong opined theyll have pissed it against a wall by now that sisken or whatever his name is is pissing it still you know what hell do the first time he gets a real fright whos this irishman by the way sir mccarthy a cork man i think you ought to recognize the accent better than i ay id place him as a cork man right enough there was a riot of french prisoners in le havre when i was en route to india they broke free from the guard mccarthys regiment the officer was killed and the serjeant was a funk there was only mccarthy with any presence of mind i seem to recall he said hed been a corporal yes i remember because there were stitch holes on his coat where the stripe had been thats all we need a busted chosenpaddy i dare wager a days pay the charge was fighting aggravated by drink hervey smiled ruefully serjeantmajor have you become a methodist armstrong frowned determinedly i never said as i wanted a troop of armstrongs well i for one would settle for half a troop as things stand and i dont like wouldbe gentlemen in the ranks either if that french has driven a pair then why isnt he an officer hervey sighed some things were better not enquired into weve barely two dozen men for all the weeks the recruiting parties have been out why is it dyou think have they been going to the wrong place isnt the bounty enough well began armstrong sighing also there are too many parties fishing in the same bit of water for a start mossop said there were bringers from the second dragoons and three foot regiments in the same alehouse last night has india anything to do with it armstrong shrugged who knows whats it matter how far from home a man is if hes not there half these jackheads wont have the first clue where india is hervey supposed it must be true look were wasting our time here collins will find another half a dozen and choice men we hope but were going to have to do more ourselves ive a mind to take a party down to wiltshire the recruiters are not nearly so active there well anythings better than sitting and waiting the thing is there are always hirelings in warminster each week at the market and theres not much work to be had the price of wools dropped like a stone if we took the band we could make quite a go armstrong looked impressed id better go and speak with the major major eustace joynson was a much happier man these days he rarely had a sick headache and when he did he could alleviate it with the new morphium from leipzig though it cost him a pretty penny all the mess knew that the cause of the headaches was no more for in the new commanding officer joynson found an able and considerate man who knew how to use his second in commands strengths allbethey limited to painstaking administration and some of the mess suspected too that the death of the majors wife had come as a merciful relief for so addicted to laudanum had she become of recent years that she was to all intents and purposes an invalid so now major joynson could happily immerse himself in the regiments administrative detail to the gain of both parties and in the evenings he had the consolation and support of a daughter not yet one and twenty the band is a very good idea hervey the major agreed but im not clear how we might pay for it they couldnt post down to wiltshire thats for sure are there any stages he knew well enough that the band had been to wiltshire before but then it had been at lord baths expense to play at herveys wedding joynson was not going to be the first to mention that however i thought we might ride there sir im not sure that all the bandsmen ride and that would cost dearly too why not take three or four trumpeters theyd make a goodish noise they would but i thought some pretty tunes would draw people in i dont deny it and how many recruits would you expect to get id be disappointed with fewer than thirty thirty i dont see why not sir my part of wiltshire is much distressed there are many men paid outdoor relief my intention would be to get their names from the parishes and offer them the bounty major joynson looked thoughtful how will you get them all back here that im not sure of yet they might have to walk ill see what is to be done with the band hervey he got up and opened a cupboard would you care for sherry thank you yes joynson handed him a glass of very pale montilla and indicated a chair you find the regiment to your liking then hervey yes very much times change but i think the best of the old spirit is probably returned hervey took a good sip of his wine major joynson took off his spectacles and rubbed his eyes he hoped profoundly that the best of herveys old spirit as well as the regiments had returned from the day hervey had joined he had never shirked his duty regardless of what others said but although he had never been a yesman there had perhaps been a willing compliance with him that would serve admirably in field rank but take him no further joynson thought now that he detected a sterner core however he replaced his spectacles and looked directly at him hervey ive said this to you before but im more than a little conscious that had i acted more resolutely then things might not have happened as they did hervey nodded and i think i replied that if i myself had so acted then things very assuredly would have been different silence followed for a while you are content then to go alone to india content was not the word hervey would have chosen i am in two minds still about my daughter but i cannot see that to inflict a sea journey of six months and more and then the vagaries of that climate would be right no i am sure that must be so frances is to come with me though that will be pleasant sir i hope so for frances i mean do you believe india a proper place for her hervey hardly knew frances joynson she seemed a sensible enough girl i only know madras sir not hindoostan but i saw englishwomen there who were very content and altogether freer i should say than here one who is the sister of a company official who was at shrewsbury a little before me went about the country as she chose and with only a maid mm i do not say i could imagine allowing frances such licence but perhaps i shall become used to it once i have been there a while a week later the recruiting party left its lodgings at the bell in warminster high street and took post outside st laurences chantry the intention being to draw onlookers from the livestock market further up the street and taverners from the breweries and alehouses down the hill to their left although there were only four trumpeters for despite major joynsons best efforts no money could be found to send the band to wiltshire they were an imposing sight serjeant collins had had the five dragoons from c troop up half the night bringing their uniforms to a high order and the trumpetmajor had not spared himself or his three trumpets either they wore buff breeches and hessians instead of overalls collins would not have them taken for infantry silvered buttons epaulettes and sabres which glinted in the sunshine and pipeclayed crossbelts and sword straps that looked as white as the finest flour shakos topped with plume white over red sealed the impression of especial smartness and regularity hervey could not have been prouder as he rounded the corner on gilbert and returned the salute and gilbert could not have done them greater service in appearance than with the black sheepskin and shabraque and hooves which private johnson had brought to a high gloss with his fish oil private ashbolt stepped forward to hold herveys charger by the bridle as he dismounted thank you ashbolt good morning sarnt collins i see we have attracted a fair crowd already yes sir if we could put women in uniform we should have a troop by midmorning there was no denying it the onlookers were for the most part women and girls not that the dragoons minded there would be time stooddown this evening they supposed shall we see what answers to the trumpets then very good sir trumpetmajor would you oblige us the four unhitched their trumpets the trumpetmajor had checked the pitch before leaving the bell it was a warm day and he was confident the instruments would not have flattened they raised them as one and blew a short fanfare in unison followed by another in four parts a very pretty sound it was thought hervey not a note cracked or overblown the effect on the onlookers was favourable but momentary they thrilled but then shrieked and scattered as half a dozen oxen stampeded past them followed by the teamsters cursing the trumpeters for their caterwauling the indignity might have been fatal to herveys purpose had he not taken action at once again please trumpetmajor another fanfare with the same precision announced that the military meant business the evening before hervey had had bills posted up and down the town announcing his purpose and he would trumpet it now until he got results the sixth regt of lt dragoons commanded by that gallant and noble hero lieut general the earl of sussex young fellows whose hearts beat high to tread the paths of adventure could not have a better opportunity than now offers come forward then and enrol yourselves in a regiment that stands unrivalled and where the kind treatment the men ever experienced is well known throughout the whole army each young adventurer on being approved will receive the largest bounty allowed by government and may elect to serve in a newraised troop commanded by captain hervey of warminster a few smart young lads will be taken at sixteen years of age feet inches but they must be active and well limbed apply to serjeant collins at the bell inn the poster had been most carefully composed hervey had seen a good many which seemed contrived positively to make men take to their heels and some so ludicrous as to attract mockery he recalled one of the sevenths which had been put up derisively in many a barrackroom which announced that since the regiment is lately returned from spain and the horses young the men will not be allowed to hunt more than one day a week next season he had first consulted serjeantmajor armstrong armstrong had argued for command to be ascribed to the colonel rather than the executive officer the lieutenantcolonel for although titular he argued the rank of lieutenantgeneral and earl would reassure a recruit that he was joining a regiment which would not be too illtreated by government then there had been much discussion about whether to make the usual reference to being a hero but serjeant collins had argued that now the war with bonaparte was ended there was already quite evidently no regard for heroes in the country adventure might be a more useful appeal although he thought the bounty was probably the strongest inducement if distress in the neighbourhood was as great as hervey said armstrong had wanted reference made to the law that no man enlisted could be arrested for prior debts below hervey had been tempted but judged that the immorality of it outweighed the attraction the usual reference to smart uniforms was omitted since they would be able to judge that for themselves besides which hervey was not sure it was so great an inducement in the young men of that corner of wiltshire although had he imagined the animation among the townswomen on the first appearance of regimentals he would doubtless have included it and private johnson had later added the reference to hervey himself and the newraised troop ysee sir he had argued if i was a youngn wanting to advance thered seem more chance in summat new and theyd like to think they was officered by someone as knew a bit about where they came from unless they wanted to get away from that hervey had countered but johnson had persuaded him that for every man who stepped forward there would be another who could not quite bring himself to do so and the thought that he might be among friends at least that there was an officer who was not quite so remote might just make the difference you might even get somebody from orningsham as knows thi family that would mean from lord baths estate and i dont think that would do its a free world capn ervey of sorts the longest discussion had been on the question of india hervey had been adamant that the fact of their posting be advertised we cannot fail to declare such a thing again armstrong had countered that it would make no difference to the recruit himself but might set his family or sweetheart against it we should tell a man once he comes to us before he takes the shilling then its his own doing he might be looking for an excuse to leave the girl hervey pulled a face come on sir this is the army not new lanark and what if the news gets around wont it seem we cant be trusted the arguments were finely balanced hervey was adamant that he would not trick any man into joining armstrong was equally adamant that the bounty itself was a trick we pay him five pounds and then make him spend ten on clothing thats hardly fair is it at length hervey agreed to the compromise recruits would be told about india before they took the shilling hervey left serjeant collins to his duties and rode to upton scudamore to see daniel coates he had no intention but to pass the day with him an unexpected pleasure but it did indeed prove fruitful to his recruiting coates had sat the day before on the westbury bench and had had to deal with as he described it a particularly distressing case involving a shepherd he had once employed but who had left for a better position it appears he had a wife in common law but she had taken to another man on account of the nights he spent with his sheep when he discovered them together he struck the man and did him no little damage and although he wanted his wife to stay with him she left that night im surprised a case should have been made for the magistrates dan it would hardly seem the other party received more than he deserved ah replied coates suggesting hervey was right but it was not that simple for the other man turned out to be a son of his employer hervey sighed the social order in west wiltshire was thus threatened that is what sir george styles seems to have imagined herveys jaw dropped you mean ay the very same as if his brother was not trouble enough god rest his soul hugo styles had courted henrietta ineffectually commanded the warminster troop of the yeomanry just as ineffectually and died at waterloo very probably in a state of terror what did you do with him dan i couldnt bring myself to do anything i adjourned the court and first thing this morning i went to see styles senior to ask that the evidence be withdrawn the shepherd has no position now hes lost his socalled wife and their cottage what more punishment might there be but i cant very well set him free it would scarcely be exemplary i suppose styles refused would hardly hear me out hervey sighed again youre thinking of inviting him to pay with the drum coates returned the look grimly would you take him matthew would you recommend that i should now coates sighed the lord only knows whether hed make a soldier for i dont but theres nothing for him hereabouts now and i fear for him he was a good shepherd i dont think hed let you down willingly then if hell come ill take him hed have to attest before i released him well youre the magistrate dan he can attest before you i can have a dragoon bring him back to warminster straight afterwards thank you matthew let us pray he sees sense then ill warn my serjeant this afternoon what is his name william stent your father buried his at imber as i recall very likely well its not a bad connection by the way i didnt say as i have some officers at last seton canning will be my lieutenant again which im right pleased with i may tell you and the cornet will be lord huntingfields younger son i knew his brother in the eighteenth in spain he ought to have the makings im glad of that for you matthew youll want good officers by the sound of things coates now paused seeming to contemplate something else matthew im pleased youre come i cant tell you how glad am i to see you back in regimentals you were not your true self without them he reached into his pocket we may not have a chance to make proper farewells i want to give you this hervey was taken aback by the sudden reminder of his transience on the plain he took the leather case and opened it carefully i sent to london for it it has hands which luminesce i scarcely believed it but they do hervey examined the watch closely but in vain it showed no sign of luminescence but he saw the makers name george prior the same as darcey jessope had given him five years earlier and he was at once confident that come the evening the hands would somehow be visible and in that name he saw too the extent of coatess generosity as well as his thoughtfulness dan this is so very good of you i and this added coates enthusiastically reaching into the other pocket see this matthew hervey looked at the instrument curiously he had not seen a compass outside of a binnacle and certainly not one as small the strangest thing i was sat at the devizes bench a month ago and a man entered it in lieu of payment of his fine the clerk wouldnt have it at first but i gave him sufficient to pay his fine and a good deal more i reckoned i might have use of it on the downs of a night but then i thought you would make more of it in the indies hervey smiled gratefully dan you are the most solicitous friend a man might have why do you not follow to india in a year or so i ought by then to know the safe ways coates clapped his hands together and laughed he had ever had a mind to see the east but herveys caution on his behalf sounded like the wheel turning full circle matthew a very handsome offer that is but if i should come i should not want to see only the safer ways and i might say captain hervey neither should you hervey laughed and assented with a nod a few moments of contented silence passed and then coates spoke quite gravely and everything is right with you otherwise matthew right otherwise dan ay are all your affairs put in order hervey balked at the directness but daniel coates had picked him up when first he had fallen from a pony dan coates sat down hervey half sank into the ash dugout and with a further sigh elizabeth will take georgiana to longleat just before i leave theyll stay there until im gone i should think thats very wise of her matthew hervey remained silent for a while trying to think how best he might explain it she is not two years dan and yet she has everything about her that is her mothers coates nodded the silence returned shes not henrietta of course matthew no that i understand when i am able to reason that is oh matthew never surrender that power to reason hervey smiled no i dont believe i shall not willingly at any rate and then he frowned i should have liked a little more time though perhaps its better you hadnt matthew it would go harder with yon infant and with himself hervey knew late in the afternoon at the time that canon hervey was saying the evening office hervey strolled with elizabeth through the village it was warm perhaps as warm as an evening in india early in the summer swifts swallows and martins were everywhere jinking and diving and a continuous stream of rooks headed west towards longleat park there were labourers about the fields still but not nearly so many the work of haymaking done for a week or so and cottage tables were claiming the menfolk at this hour how do you persuade a man to leave this for the barrackroom and india elizabeth looked at him puzzled you dont yet we have to fill the ranks somehow well theres little profit in trying to persuade a man with a wage and a sound roof therell be one or two who might like the thrill of it i dare say but in truth you had better look elsewhere youre right of course we had a fair bag today but not as good as id hoped elizabeth raised her eyebrows she could never fathom the town why dont you go to the common hervey looked at her pained were recruiting for the cavalry and india elizabeth not a penal battalion for the west indies elizabeth smiled youre not recruiting very much for anywhere by your own admission brother didnt your duke of wellington say that his men were the scum of the earth hervey did not answer at once elizabeth you go to the workhouse and i admire you much for it but can you have a true notion of what the common is why do you suppose otherwise hervey looked at her quizzically father has forbidden your going there has he not father forbade me to visit there he furrowed his brow again he did not say i could not go about workhouse business are you saying you go into those hovels i do but i do not visit with them hervey said nothing but his look betrayed his disapproval matthew someone must attend there last monday we took in an unwed girl and her child from a single room in marsh street the childs father was her own father yesterday the constable arrested a young woman not one and twenty who was carrying on her trade while her commonlaw husband lay three days dead in the room upstairs and this morning he turned out a young man who slept in the same bed as his unmarried mother a singular week in numbers perhaps but not otherwise shall i say more hervey was speechless there is life there which cannot be any worse in the london rookeries in the main i grieve only for the children now but some of the young men might have redemption the methodists are doing fine work but they must break through so much with the younger men elizabeth said hervey muted i cannot do gods work with these men all we may do is make soldiers of them i have seen enough to know what that would do yes but you cant make a good soldier out of a bad character and i am not suggesting you try to only that you look for young men whose character is not yet formed elizabeth you astonish me said hervey the admiration evident but im afraid that nothing could induce me to go to warminster common in search of recruits chapter ten the scum of the earth in the course of the next three days the recruiting party enlisted fourteen men including william stent lately shepherd to sir george styles of westbury a dozen more had presented themselves to serjeant collins at the bell but these he had rejected on various grounds two were so punchy sir that between them theyd have stood no higher than a noseband reported collins carefully consulting his notebook one was badly scalded about the face there was another with leg sores that stank very ill two had crooked spines one was an idiot one was taken off by his mother before i could do much more than take his name mores the pity for he was a smart lad hervey cocked an ear one had eyes that were very blear continued collins one was too close to forty for me to pretend he was under thirty and two were dead drunk and havent returned hervey shook his head were any put off by the notion of india not one sir it is disappointing indeed to have only the fourteen when it might have been double but i will say the ones we attested look promising sir that stent has the makings of an nco without a doubt but hes an unhappy man at the present he told me he was missing his sheep not his wife mind sir his sheep hervey simply raised an eyebrow and who was this lad whose mother took him away rudd a wellmade lad about your height sir and smart as a carrot newscraped i reckon hed put on his best clothes and his mother just came and took him away you say ay sir shes a milliner premises in silver street the lad said reckon she has better things in mind for him than going for a soldier you spoke to her no she gave me no chance but i made enquiries afterwards and went to her shop but she threatened to bring the constable did she indeed well serjeant collins were going to have to make one last effort tomorrow youre going to westbury for the fair this afternoon ay sir but ive been told there was a company of foot there for a month and more and took a fair number of men with them yes id heard that too which is why im contemplating going onto the common to see what we can find collins looked wary sir there were men in here last night and not preachy types who said that the best thing that could happen to warminster common was for the plague to take a hold and then the flames are you saying we should not go sir with respect its you who are from these parts my sister believes there are some likely men serjeant collins accepted without question that his captains sister could properly know such a thing has she names sir that would be a start three yes and how would you wish me to do it sir with the trumpets as here we could try that yes but i shall come with you sarnt collins i cant very well ask you to go to the biggest fencing crib this side of bristol while i sit at home waiting hervey expected a protest but collins was of quite the opposite opinion its bound to have an effect ill warrant they never see a gentleman there other than the parson hervey stayed an hour with him but no fellows wanting to tread the path of adventure came to the bell in that time and at eleven he left to go to the milliners in silver street he was not content to leave so promisingsounding a recruit to the protective clutches of a respectable mother hervey wore plain clothes this morning and was doubly glad of it since he supposed he would not therefore be immediately barred entry from mrs rudds shop she smiled at him indeed when he entered and asked him to take a seat while she attended to another customer he sat looking about him at the lace the ribbons and all manner of fancy goods that might brighten a townswomans day there were hats too in various stages of construction here was a skilled and artistic trade and it was evident that mrs rudd was a true proficient he wondered if elizabeth had ever come here when mrs rudds customer was gone hervey made himself known at once this put the milliner in a difficult position as he had gambled since in her trade she could ill afford to be abusive and dismissive of a gentleman even if she were inclined to be mrs rudd i may call you that may i she nodded guardedly i understand that your son expressed an interest in joining my troop he had decided to make his approach as personal as he could the boy is very young sir and does not know his own mind hervey saw how to deal with both objections my serjeant was most impressed with him although he may be young my serjeant who is but seven and twenty himself believes he has the makings and if you are in any degree troubled that he might not be suited to the profession then i give you my word that he may have his free discharge at any time during his training i am obliged sir but it has always been the intention that stephen continued in this trade he has made a very good start hervey judged it better not to try to counter a mothers hopes they are beautiful hats mrs rudd thank you sir she managed a sort of smile and there seems no reason why stephen should not continue in the trade after serving the king he judged her loyalties to be firmly tory mrs rudd looked uncomfortable at the inference which might be drawn if she persisted may i speak freely sir and i mean no offence and we are all grateful and proud of what was done in the wars but you see sir to have a son go for a soldier is not that is families in respectable trades such as ours hervey smiled as benevolently as he could of course mrs rudd i perfectly understand but we are light dragoons you saw what sort of man my serjeant was and those about him it was perhaps fortunate at this exact moment that armstrong had not been in charge of the party there could be misunderstandings with serjeantmajor armstrong we attend divine service every sunday at the minster sir i myself am a clergymans son mrs rudd and a bible and prayer book are provided for every soldier by the naval and military bible society he sensed he was beginning to overwhelm her objections and he would be properly treated hervey could answer with absolute assurance the officers have as close a feeling for their men as any in the service mrs rudd he judged it now the moment to make a personal guarantee you would be most welcome to communicate with my father the vicar of horningsham at any time next morning hervey rode early to the bell to find serjeant collins looking troubled have you seen the news sir about manchester hervey had not collins handed him the daily courant manchester august th slaughter of innocents this day in manchester has been witness to scenes so infamous as to beggar description at one oclock pm a large but peaceable assembly of respectable men together with their families was at st peters field to hear the radical speaker henry hunt address them on the propriety of adopting the most legal and effectual means of obtaining a reform of the common house of parliament the magistrates had sworn in four hundred special constables to serve on the day of the meeting and also had at their disposal a military force composed of cavalry infantry and horse artillery shortly after one oclock mr hunt arrived to great acclamation and bands playing and began addressing the crowd which by various estimates were in excess of fifty thousand persons but no sooner had he begun but the magistrates ordered a troop of the manchester and salford yeomanry to arrest the speaker and thereupon the corps charged the crowd with great violence so that within a short time there were many dead and dying on the field and divers more cruelly maimed and the exigency was made the worse by the appearance soon afterwards of troops of regular cavalry namely the fifteenth light dragoons who disported themselves with no less restraint than the yeomanry that is very ill news indeed serjeant collins ay sir half the town will think were heroes and the other butchers i cannot believe the fifteenth would have behaved so what does the times say i have not heard tell sir we had better get along to the common before this becomes street tattle did the milliners son return yesterday by any chance collins smiled he did sir he is coming here this afternoon to attest before one of the notaries it was some consolation at least hervey had still not seen the lad but collinss recommendation was enough that and the respectability of the mother thirty or so onlookers watched the recruiting party file out of the bells stable yard hooves ringing on the cobblestones beneath the arch the little crowd seemed to no degree different from the day before and hervey was relieved that they could go about their business without abuse in the high street for they would surely meet with it on the common it took but ten minutes at the walk hervey had never been to the common before but the stench on this hot summers morning alerted him to the rank nature of the place from a quarter of a mile as they neared the first dwelling a dismal hovel with a broken roof and a wall which could never stand another winters storm he saw that the rehoboth stream whose plentiful sweet water had first been the draw of the squatters was now but a trickling midden children stood all about barefoot in filth dogs cats pigs poultry a cow and even donkeys wandered freely adding excrement to the mud and ash that was the main street a foul faecal mulch which the dragoons would curse when it came to boning boots that night in what manner this was superior to the meanest villages he had seen in india hervey would have been hard put to it to say serjeant collins looked about disdainfully what adult males were abroad at this hour did not impress by their appearance over there looks about best sir he said indicating the chapel the only substantial building to be seen hervey agreed they halted and dismounted calls please trumpetmajor children appeared some evidently delighted by the colourful sight amid the drabness of the settlement others wary recognizing perhaps the ingress of authority to their free and easy camp a few women came one or two owning to motherhood by taking charge of their offspring with a cautionary slap to the ear some of the children came closer wanting to touch the horses the dragoons received them willingly but one by one they were hauled away before long the party was without an audience except for two young women who stood by the corner of the preaching house and for a purpose which its sparse congregation of a sunday would vehemently condemn do you want me to begin looking for these three men miss hervey has named sir collinss voice carried neither enthusiasm nor reluctance hervey sighed to tell the truth serjeant collins i little imagined squalor such as this i cant see how any halfdecent recruit might come out of here a good hosing and a weeks drill and any of these could look likely sir its all a question of whether they want to lift themselves out of this sink you never know there might be such as have been waiting the opportunity for years without even knowing it hervey nodded well well take no recruits by waiting that much seems certain sound off again please trumpetmajor and you and i had better begin visiting he said to collins grimly the dwellings had no numbers and although the streets had customary names they were not displayed but elizabeth had provided directions for each of the three good directions too for the first they found very quickly collins knocked at the door closed as were the windows even on so warm a morning as this it opened to reveal a single foulsmelling room with a dirt floor partly covered by furze cut from the edge of the common and on it a sleeping woman with next to her like piglets at a sow half a dozen infants no older than three collins bent to the doors opener does jobie wainwright live here love the little girl stared turned to seek assurance from her mother who slept soundly the while and then looked back at serjeant collins without a word is jobie wainwright your brother collinss tenderness was unpractised but effective the little girl nodded do you know where he is the little girl wanted to help her expression said it but she shook her head will he come back soon do you think she nodded collins stepped past her carefully to take a better look at the room hervey stepped forward gingerly and looked in too the walls had no plaster there was not a stick of furniture and in the corner was a pile of ragged and filthy linsey evidently the entire wardrobe of the brood family seemed so inapt a name this is a job and a half sir said collins as he came out shes soused in gin by the look of it and them babes is probably too sick to stir my sister said it was a wretched household theyre one step from the workhouse id say did you see any food no nor i the little girl suddenly pointed and called out happily jobie hervey and collins turned to see a boy of seventeen or eighteen approaching with a small sack under his arm his step did not falter as he approached the cottage good mornin he said as he came to the door jobie jobie jobies face was clean unlike the little girls or indeed any they had seen since arriving at the common and shaven too he had bright blue eyes and hair the colour of horse chestnuts and a ready smile for his halfsister he gave her the sack and she ran inside with it only bread he explained to the visitors i go for it evry mornin he showed no apprehensiveness on account of seeing strangers in uniform i am serjeant collins of his majestys sixth light dragoons and am authorized to enlist young men of the best character collins had not wanted to introduce confusion in the lads mind by speaking of his officer but jobie wainwright glanced at hervey and then back at the serjeant even to an uninformed eye the difference in quality of uniform was apparent hervey smiled i am captain hervey of the same corps i reckoned as much sir i saw the posters in the town and its your sister as comes here steady on young un said collins checking his instinct to bark that he would speak to an officer only when given permission but hervey saw an opportunity it was my sister who told me you might care for a soldiers life jobie did not hesitate that i would sir if only for a regular wage serjeant collins now sensed further opportunity are there others who think the same jobie two or three serjeant well if you bring them and they enlist you are entitled to a bringers bounty will you do that ay serjeant ill bring them but i wouldnt want the money for it they must have that for themselves you shall have the money jobie and you may give it away as you please for that is the procedure come to the chapel within the hour we cannot be here all day ay serjeant i shall do that hervey and collins walked back to the chapel pleased with their easy success and after so unpromising a beginning as decent a lad as ever i saw declared hervey clean wellmade he reads and he has an honest stamp or at least he would not try to profit from his friends ay sir a very satisfactory sort you sound unsure oh no sir im sure right enough that little lasss face told you he was a goodn i was just thinking how contrary it all is heres the filthiest place youll see outside a london rookery and out of it comes a lad like that gives a lie to poverty being the breeding bed of sin dont it sir dont lets begin on that sarnt collins i had ample of it last night at home you would not imagine so many opinions there might be in one family well sir therell be plenty more in the days to come no doubt after that business in manchester oh yes indeed sighed hervey you may be sure of it threequarters of an hour later jobie wainwright and three others of his age came to the chapel and asked if they might know the bounty and pay if they enlisted five pounds and four shillings replied serjeant collins and pay is one and twopence a day for the infantry a shilling only and there is one penny a day beermoney too the potential recruits looked encouraged hervey sitting in a corner lowered his copy of the times and all our keep is found serjeant asked jobie wainwright on their behalf here was the rub thought hervey and here was when an unscrupulous bringer would dissemble or even lie better that he himself speak to it than leave collins to have to apologize for the subsistence and offreckonings which would take away so much of their pay threequarters of a pound of beef and one pound of bread every day that or its equivalent he said reassuringly the four looked even more encouraged and for this you pay no more than sixpence a day they looked disappointed and you must of course buy that part of your uniform and necessaries which would be a mans everyday working dress whatever serjeant collins has a list of these he will show it to you only jobie wainwright made to look at it to the others it would have been no more helpful than a page of greek s d flannel drawers flannel waistcoat shirts worsted stockings stable trousers forage cap stock and clasp shoes boots gloves hair comb razor shaving box and brush shoe brush cloth brush curry comb and brush mane comb and sponge water sponge per oz horse picker turnscrew and worm corn bag oil tin scissors black ball valise saddle blanket braces night cap sir it comes to more than the bounty said jobie anxiously the usual way is that a recruit is given twentyone shillings at once and the remainder is kept back for these necessaries the difference is advanced to the man and from his basic pay instalments are made until the advance is paid back hervey did not say that it was the troop captain who lent the man the cash and on very disadvantageous terms to himself jobie looked a little relieved serjeant collins judged the catch was ready to land you will receive a free issue of overalls a stable jacket and a dress coat annually and an allowance of six shillings for boots and three for gloves they seemed encouraged again there are other clearings said hervey but you shall receive not less than three shillings each week and in india you may live much higher than ever at home india sir said jobie his voice suggesting neither favour nor otherwise yes the regiment is for india soon i have been there it is the place for adventure the four looked at each other jobie spoke for them if we enlist sir can we stay together you will all serve in my troop hervey reassured them serjeant collins sealed the affair bring the measuring stick prax lets see if these likelylooking lads stand sixteen hands and a half they all did though hervey could not suppose there was more than a leathers thickness to spare with any of them not to worry regular meat and riding school would do its work here is a shilling each for you then declared collins gravely the kings shilling that is his token of trust in you come to the bell at nine oclock prompt tomorrow morning and the magistrate will swear you in once the doctor has certified you fit for service jobie jobie called the little girl from the other side of the street mam says didnt you get her gin jobie looked uncomfortable can i go now serjeant ay lad be there at nine sharp though jobie are you going for a soldier asked the little girl as he took her hand collins turned to hervey christ sir what do you do i know serjeant collins i know try not to think about it i suppose the following day a special edition of the warminster miscellany carried a further report of the disturbances in manchester the herveys manservant brought it just before midday to the dining room at horningsham where hervey and his father were sitting with the remains of a pot of coffee and a salted mutton ham peterloo casualties we are informed by the manchester observer that the affair of the th instant dubbed peterloo has accounted for the deaths of sixteen persons including a special constable and four hundred injured with no fewer than one hundred and fifty suffering from sabre cuts it is further understood from the officer commanding all of the troops that day one colonel lestrange that sixtyseven of his own men received slight wounds while twenty cavalry horses have been hurt either by striking or by being stabbed his royal highness the prince regent has sent a letter of strong approval to the magistrates for the firm way in which they dealt with the lawbreaking the archdeacon read the report again carefully i should say that notwithstanding the title the paper is indifferent in its tone while the stabbing of the horses cannot be compared with the sabre cuts to the people the two being juxtaposed in the report serves to ameliorate the shock that is felt for it suggests a predisposition on behalf of some in the crowd to do mischief i suppose the prince regent had to commend the poor magistrates but i cannot help but feel it would have been the better to hold silence until the facts were established i wish it made some distinction between the regulars and the yeomanry said hervey i am afraid that if you are at the receiving end of a sabre stroke it matters little whether it be regular or otherwise though i agree it is dispiriting for those who are proficient in the business of soldiering its the very devil of a business keeping a troop in hand in the face of a crowd the horses sense their riders unease im sure of it i still hold a picture of poor wymondham being thrown to his death in the street in london is there any more father the archdeacon nodded there is and it troubles me i confess six measures to be enacted we have it on the most reliable authority that lord sidmouth will announce in parliament six measures to be enacted which shall permit of the most summary dealing with the radical agitation which now disturbs the greater part of the country assemblies of over fifty persons shall be prohibited magistrates are to have powers to search private dwelling houses for arms drilling and military training by civilians except the yeomanry and the militia shall be strictly prohibited the laws against blasphemous and seditious libel shall be strengthened there shall be a limitation on the right of an accused to adjournment of trial to prepare his defence and there shall be an increase in stamp duty on newspapers and pamphlets to four pence the archdeacon took off his spectacles and shook his head by any standard taken as a whole these are repressive measures though three are reasonable in themselves i suppose hervey assented with a nod daniel coates told me that lord bath intends proposing a measure to form veterans battalions to act as police well that has merit for they would be men used to discipline declared canon hervey replacing his spectacles and taking up the newspaper again ah he said after reading more lord bath is to embody the warminster troop that wont be greeted well in some parts but its only prudent the hindon people are a combative bunch by all accounts i shall be happier leaving you knowing there are a few sabres about the place even if they are yeomanry canon hervey looked thoughtful but he withheld any fears for the peace of the parish and his familys safety we shall see you again before you embark matthew you may depend upon it father then he frowned and it will be very much harder than ever before canon hervey nodded and rose and not only for you matthew will you come to evening prayer hervey stood but his brow was still furrowed i beg you would excuse me this once father there are things i ought to be about hervey sat for a halfhour alone when his father was gone the house was silent but for the ticking of two clocks and there was nothing but his thoughts to disturb him five years the house would not change in that time the garden perhaps a branch fallen here and there plantings come to maturity his parents it were better not to imagine elizabeth he became fearful and georgiana he rose hesitantly then hurried to the stables in a quarter of an hour he was at longleat he entered the house unannounced and went to the nursery the door was open but hearing the sounds within he stood to one side to observe without being seen elizabeth sat with her face halfturned from the door contentedlooking happy even georgiana shuffled towards her on a little wheeled horse gripping its woollen mane her nursemaid by her side ready to support with an outstretched hand the child giggled when she reached elizabeth and threw her head back hervey swallowed hard he had never imagined he might look on alone like this next time when he returned from india the horse would not have wheels georgiana might even be free of the leading rein and he would have missed all of it and he had not imagined until now what it was that he would miss chapter eleven roughriders hounslow three weeks later keep them eels down bellowed the roughrider serjeant at the six recruits as they attempted to complete a circuit of the riding school without stirrups a sack of flourd look better in yon saddles the old commands the old quips hervey smiled to himself as he left the school and walked to regimental headquarters in another five months the riding master and his staff would make dragoons of these greenheads as they had done many times before the trouble was they didnt have five months in seven weeks they were due to sail for calcutta and there would be little they could do aboard ship by way of training save for musketry and sword practice he would land with a halfdrilled troop at best but that should not trouble you said the commanding officer indicating a chair and pouring two glasses of sherry you have done admirably in filling the ranks i had not thought it would be so difficult the adjutants efforts in that direction were commendable but his bringers netted a very feeble catch in the end and your enlisting so many from one town must be a strength i think there ought to be a quicker fellow feeling i believe there will be colonel and three of them are already showing well one that is paying with the drum too though it was scarcely much of an offence sir ivo lankester nodded approvingly youll have time enough when we get to india ill not expect your troop at regimental drill for a full six months that will be sufficient colonel theyll come on capitally as soon as theyve passed out of riding school good good how many have you lost by the way one only sir he coughed up blood each time they did anything strenuous lankester sighed hell be dead sooner outside than in but it cant be helped now im afraid im going to ask you to do one more thing and its only right that i should ask and not joynson since it is my notion and it may vex you to be distracted by it the commanding officers courtesy was such that hervey was already disarmed what could possibly vex him i have decided that we shall take three dozen or so troophorses to india as well as all the chargers i want the noncommissioned officers to be properly mounted i know it will be a month at least before theyre used to the climate but better in the long run we begin with a wellmannered horse out of condition than what the indian garrison might leave us i saw some fine horses in india colonel but i agree there is no certainty of our having them at once it seems to me that the whole business will come to nought however if the horses dont travel well lord knows how many you and i have seen that were served ill by foul transports indeed colonel barrow says you took your charger there and back hervey smiled i did we sailed both ways in a frigate with an uncommonly obliging captain then you will know better than any what is to be done to a ship to make her fit to transport horses over so great a distance and i should very much deem it a favour if you would supervise the making ready of the indiamen which are to take us as i understand it theyll be at tilbury in a fortnights time for refitting hervey saw now why the colonel had been so concerned to make the approach himself for tilbury took him away from his troop such that it could be called at this stage but also and more important from his family in horningsham yet the military necessity colonel lankester had spelled out with perfect sense and it was to herveys advantage too that his own charger be carried in best condition of course i shall be able to do it colonel i know you would have liked a lengthy furlough before embarkation as the rest of us but there is no reason why you should not take leave when the job is done and make the passage by a later ship hervey was much encouraged by the commanding officers solicitude thank you colonel i am mighty grateful but unless something untoward occurs i should want to sail with the others besides ought else calcutta will be he smiled a heady place i think and if i am not there with my troop from the outset all manner of things might happen admirable hervey admirable i should not have thought of you any the less however had you opted for the other course and if circumstances change between now and then you must adjust your plan without fear that any shall think ill of it again thank you colonel well then let us to the mess joynson says he has found some very fine burgundy and theres woodcock the general will be joining us next morning as he was busying himself for the journey to tilbury hervey received an envelope bearing on the reverse an embossed ducal coronet inside was a doublethick demioctavo card field marshal the rt hon the duke of wellington requests the pleasure of the company of captain matthew hervey at dinner at apsley house on rd september at oclock pm hervey wrote at once to accept sent for private johnson to arrange despatch of the letter and then took the regimental phaeton to the red lion in order to post to tilbury his journey overnight was a not altogether comfortable affair but on arriving at the port he was soon restored by the arrangements he found the honourable east india company being an institution of longer lineage than the army had at least as many regulations but as it was a company of merchants the purpose to which all the regulations were drawn up was commercial the arrangements put in hand by the company for the regiments shipping to india for it was the court of directors who paid the costs of a kings regiment in india were in the main sound two goodsized ships had been engaged one for the major part of the regiment the other for the horses and their attendants but the surplus capacity was to be filled by general merchandise and therefore any additional space requested meant a corresponding diminution of that profitable extra not a matter the agent would be inclined to let pass easily hervey asked if he might first look over the transport assigned to the horses this was arranged without too much difficulty although the captain was not in port and all questions were therefore dealt with by the first officer who was clearly in fear of his masters wrath she seemed a wellfound ship and clean hervey asked if he might see the plans for the stallage i think you will find they comply with the horse guards usual requirements said the agent hervey did not know the regulation size of a stall those he had seen in the peninsula hardly seemed to have the stamp of any sort of order six feet by two feet six is the allowance here is the plan for the lower deck which is where they are all to be had hervey sighed to himself jessye had had twelve feet square on the nisus he studied the plan carefully i see there is a gangway between the backs of the stalls and the side of the ship yes replied the agent without needing to check the drawing two feet as specified in order to permit of cleaning out droppings and soiled bedding hervey considered how best to make his proposal when i took my mare to india she had a loose box which could be turned into a standing stall in case of foul weather but we soon found that she chafed badly fore and rear as the ship rolled so we let her have her full length back and trusted to her own balance and she did not suffer in the slightest i think it would be very much the better for them if we did away with the gangway and extended the stalls to the side it would be cheaper to build that way too i would think the agent heard this last with interest but then remembered the regulation my understanding is that the gangway is absolutely necessary to do the work of cleaning captain hervey not absolutely necessary with a few free stalls in each section it is perfectly possible to move the horse and then muck his stall that would be a matter for the regiment you would not need to trouble yourself over it then so it shall be captain hervey would these spare stalls need slings too none of the stalls need slings they cause far more damage than good four or five only for sick or injured horses with the extra length of stall theyll keep themselves up well enough believe me the agent was all delight at the further economy hervey judged it the moment to drive the bargain a little harder in respect of the spare stalls four per every twelve animals then and built so that they can be turned into one loose box that way a sick horse may be allowed space to lie down and stretch the agent checked the plans and agreed that it was not unreasonable the negotiation of gangway space in which to exercise proved a little harder but the agent and the second officer saw how it could be done some of the orlops capacity had to be sacrificed all of the hay would now be stored there rather than some on the horse deck but the savings overall were still considerable there were numerous details to be agreed but both parties were well satisfied only the question of windsails and ventilating shafts was unresolved hervey judged it better to wait a little while there were bound to be savings he could suggest to offset his demands in this direction and so in the next few days hervey found himself as much afloat as ashore it was not a disagreeable state but six months at sea in an indiaman would not be the same as being guest of a frigates captain he decided he must turn his thoughts to the days routine on the horse deck and who best should be there for without doubt sir ivo lankester would next ask his opinion of that the more he thought however and the more he wrote the more he wished the six months could be past now he had been gazetted captain since july and still he could not rightly say he was returned to the saddle this he would not be able to claim until they reached india and even then only when he could take the head of his troop and have them wheeling and forming behind him as one body in truth he sighed he would not be in the saddle before next years summer was out chapter twelve number one london the anniversary of the battle of assaye hervey rose before dawn and took the morning stage to london he intended being in good time for the duke of wellingtons dinner with sufficient in hand that if the coach were to meet with any delay he could engage a saddlehorse to complete the journey however the quicksilver was true to her name she covered the distance not very greatly slower than the post by virtue of being exempt from the prohibition on galloping to which the government mails were subject what she lost in the leisurely teamchanges and indeed the quality of the roadsters she partially made up for in celerity over the macadamized turnpike for more than six months now the duke had been master general of the ordnance with a seat in the cabinet and the signal honour of this invitation had given hervey much pleasure in the anticipation as much indeed as the consolation which the dukes letter of support had given him eighteenth months before doubtless the invitation was but a formal conclusion to his earlier employment which had ended somewhat unceremoniously the duke being preoccupied with affairs elsewhere than paris yet even if this were the case it was a handsome gesture still he would savour the occasion speak only when spoken to and drink only very moderately having spent what remained of the afternoon with the regimental agents seeing to various advances and allowances at ten minutes to seven he climbed into the elegant dress chariot which he had engaged for the evening and left the united service club for apsley house charles street to hyde park corner was a walk of but ten minutes at most but in that short distance the edge could be taken off his ball dress darcey jessope of late lamented memory had once regaled him with the story of how similarly accoutred he had been passing whites club when the contents of a fish kettle were hurled into the street and over him and so while hervey told himself it was to be his last extravagance before india it was at least to a practical purpose a large crowd had gathered to see the arrival of the guests and there was a steady parade of carriages to the porticoed entrance to the yard at the front of the house they deposited their elegant occupants female and male and then drew away through the toll gates at the top of knightsbridge to wait in hyde park at once hervey knew that the expense of his equipage saved him at least from disappointing the crowd there had been times enough of feeling the country cousin indeed as he stepped down and rather to his surprise he noticed several men raise their hats but then if regimentals did not receive a cheer outside number london where in the land might they inside the walled yard he was able to get a better impression of the house bought only recently by the duke from his elder brother the former governorgeneral in india hervey was disappointed he had imagined something more imposing next door was an altogether grander affair twice as large stonefaced instead of brick with classical columns and pediments but the disappointment did not dull his anticipation in the yard the band of the grenadier guards was playing a merry tune and in front and behind him were officers and their ladies who were also taking evident pleasure in the invitation he recognized no one and so contented himself with observing what he could without making it obvious the queue advanced steadily until hervey stepped into the entrance hall which although painted rather drably was brilliantly lit he handed his hat and cloak to a footman together with his card and followed the other guests towards the spiral staircase which would take them to the principal floor but at the foot of the stairs several of the guests had stopped to examine the towering statue of a nude bonaparte presented to the duke by the prince regent hervey stopped too is it a fair representation do you think came a female voice behind him hervey turned for the question sounded as if it were directed at him a tall woman in her thirties strikingly handsome and very elegantly dressed glanced from the statue to him and then back again her smile suggesting amusement in the obvious difficulty her question posed twice life size i should estimate madam replied hervey it was as good a response as any might make he looked about for the womans escort but could see none i had not thought of napoleon as so athletic hervey was doubly cautious i believe the artist exercised some licence the woman looked at him with the same smile still and inclined her head i believe i have rankled sir hervey was not without practice in this sort of conversation no not at all madam i merely relay what i heard in paris where the statue was set up originally oh she said in a delighted sort of way you have been in paris yes i first saw the statue in the louvre palace and who is it by hervey paused im afraid i do not recall madam well it is of no matter not a michelangelo that is for sure he would never have dissembled with a fig leaf hervey counted it fortunate that at that moment the guests began again to ascend the stairs allowing him to follow without need of more words at the top was a footman to whom he handed another card which was in turn passed to the master of ceremonies captain hervey your grace came his announcement the duke wearing the levee dress of the royal horse guards of which he was colonel nodded approvingly and held out his hand i am very glad you are come hervey all is well with you yes indeed thank you sir replied hervey taking the dukes hand for the first time i am glad to see you returned to the colours in all the circumstances it is the place to be hervey bowed appreciatively lady katherine greville announced the master of ceremonies the signal for hervey to move on and into the piccadilly drawing room but not before he saw the dukes face light up with pleasure at hearing the name inside the drawing room with its classical friezes and ceiling an altogether finer affair than the exterior of the house would lead to suppose hervey took a glass of champagne and looked for a face he might know here and there he recognized one from the peninsula general officers all not least the unmistakable profile of sir stapleton cotton now lord combermere his face even browner after two years as governor in barbados than when he had commanded the cavalry in spain but there was not a face he might present himself to and so he made instead for a painting of lord uxbridge new done and by sir thomas lawrence he surmised it would both engage him agreeably and cover his knowing no one however scarcely had he time to verify the portraitist when a field officer in rifle green approached him captain hervey he turned as ever with the rifles the rank was difficult to make out at first sight but the man was about the dukes age and his face more weatherbeaten sir i am colonel warde the dukes secretary hervey bowed good evening colonel we have a little time before dinner is announced i wonder may we have a word privately hervey looked surprised but of course colonel he glanced about the room now becoming quite full colonel warde drew him away to a corner taking another glass of champagne as he did so this affair of peterloo a damnable business it has already caused the duke great embarrassment i imagine so sir the duke had sent a letter to the magistrates commending their action just as had lord liverpool and there was much popular resentment at both it was of course a noble and brave thing to do hervey the duke was mindful of the clamour there would be against him and yet he was of the opinion that if the manchester magistrates were not publicly supported then others would shrink from their duties hervey nodded but by heaven he is disturbed by what he reads general byng the same that was with us at waterloo has the northern district but his despatches have only an immediate account by the military the duke believes there must be more to things than in the official despatches but is not inclined to support a public inquiry he wonders if you would go there and judge the various reports i yes you have experience of these things do you not and the duke trusts you well sir greatly flattered as i am by the dukes trust i do not consider that i am qualified the duke is of the opinion that you are replied the colonel a shade testily hervey sighed to himself he ought to have seen that coming but in only a few weeks i sail with my regiment to india i am sure you can be spared hervey sir ivo lankester will not object when i have spoken to him there was a moment perhaps no more than a second or so though it seemed an age when herveys mind rested in the balance eighteen months ago he would have received a request from a senior officer as an order from the duke of wellington it would have commanded his instant unquestioning obedience but not now he had his judgement percipient judgement the duke had once called it and he had seen the consequences of disregarding it no sir i am afraid i must insist that i have my prior duty mm colonel wardes eyes narrowed the duke said you might be recalcitrant well then you can at least give your opinion of various statements that have been made sir i really do not see that that would be of any merit since i have no special insight for me to express a worthy opinion i should have to do more than merely read what might any other officer you really are most obdurate captain hervey with respect i trust not colonel i think it would be wrong for me to undertake an assignment that the duke believed would yield some particular result when i am not in a position to do so and a wrong opinion by me would be greatly to the dukes discomfort in no time at all colonel warde sighed most displeased i cannot think what the duke will make of this he was most adamant we had your opinion the master of ceremonies announced that dinner was served colonel warde sighed again huffed almost come then we had better take our seats the dukes sisterinlaw acts as our hostess this evening in case you are presented hervey looked uncertain in the circumstances sir would it not be more proper for me to make my apologies and leave dont be an ass hervey snapped the colonel beckoning him on behind ill show you your place you have very agreeable company better than you deserve i dare say colonel warde made his way to the centre of the room to the woman who had questioned hervey at the foot of the stairs lady katherine may i introduce captain hervey who shall be your companion at dinner hervey this is lady katherine greville hervey bowed and his dinner companion made a partcurtsy by return but with the same knowing smile as at the statue colonel warde eyed hervey sternly again after dinner we must resume our conversation as you please colonel said hervey offering lady katherine his arm i see i have intruded on affairs she said i have a mind that dinners such as these are mere interruptions to the serious business with which men concern themselves not at all lady katherine protested colonel warde they are most necessary to the cultivation of proper society which in these times we must not take for granted he glanced meaningly at hervey they passed through a mirrored lobby in which hervey noticed that his face had reddened somewhat we are the first to dine here explained colonel warde who seemed anxious to keep up his conversation the duke has had the room made only this year that much was at once apparent to hervey for it was a most masculine room most military indeed the walls were a buff colour not unlike his own facings the doors dado and cornice were oak the chairs red leather and the table almost groaning with silver was mahogany polished to a high gloss so that countless candles reflected from silver and wood alike they arrived near the far end of the table i shall leave you in the hands of captain hervey then lady katherine said colonel warde bowing again what a delightful prospect colonel she replied inclining her head slightly colonel warde bowed more formally until later hervey a footman held the chair for lady katherine as she sat allowing just enough time for hervey to introduce himself to the aidedecamp seated on his left a captain of foot guards he turned again to his companion colonel warde seems most anxious that you speak together captain hervey said lady katherine you are evidently of some consequence hervey smiled oh i think not lady katherine i am a regimental officer indeed lady katherines smile seemed fixed in a bemused disbelieving fashion which hervey was beginning to find slightly unnerving as a regimental officer you could tell me what all this silver signifies hervey was relieved but still inclined to be guarded i confess i do not know it intimately but the centrepiece was presented to the duke by the portuguese a year or so ago the ornament in the middle of it shows the four continents paying tribute to the united armies of england portugal and spain it is quite magnificent if perhaps rather severe for my taste when i first saw it in paris there was a chain of silk flowers linking those dancing figures about the base it was then a little less formidable lady katherine inclined her head as if to say she might have further questions on the matter colonel warde tells me you are to go to india soon yes madam my regiment is posted to bengal in two months time and does this please you yes yes it does please me i was there three years ago though in madras which is much further to the south and for only a very few months a footman leaned between them to serve a plate of soup my husband spent some time there though he never speaks of it i do not know your husband lady katherine over there sir peregrine greville she nodded to the other side of the table further towards where the duke sat to lady combermeres left she in the blue hervey saw a general officer who looked twice lady katherines age forgive me madam but what is your husbands appointment he is governor of alderney ah hervey was not a polished conversationalist he knew all too well but even so this was an appointment that did not make for a ready reply and of sark added lady katherine mischievously hervey returned her smile involuntarily her eyes caught the candlelight and for an instant tempted him to some equally mischievous reply he had had only the one glass of champagne though and he thanked god for it too that must be very agreeable madam the climate especially oh i dont know about that captain hervey i visit there but very infrequently and then only for a very short time hervey knew he was making a poor show of it and the knowledge did not improve matters your husband is not resident there then indeed he is this is one of his few returns he says that since the war there is little to engage him from a military point of view so he can indulge his passion which is fishing there is nothing he likes more than to spend the day in a little boat among lines and pots and i know not what sole only half warm had followed the soup and then there was partridge and all the while lady katherine pressed hervey to reveal his exploits in the war explaining that her husband had nothing to tell her of but the toings and froings of ships past his islands and all the while hervey tried equally to deflect the conversation to something less sanguinary the effort was so great that he ate little sipped his wine perhaps too often and was altogether relieved when at last the arrival of the sweet confections allowed the officer on lady katherines right to engage her attention and him to seek relief with the adc however the adc was engrossed in conversation to his left so hervey instead occupied himself with a survey of the room they were thirtyfour at table besides two or three junior officers such as him there was an equal number of generals in their braid and ladies in their finery hervey mused that each in his or her own way had dressed to please or gain the attention of their host there was no end of pleasing him at the most exalted and the most personal levels alike the fruits of victory at waterloo were bountiful indeed the gifts alone spoke volumes the marble nude of bonaparte from the prince the portuguese service a thousand pieces of silver and gilt the saxon service finest meissen the prussian service berlin green china with its magnificent obelisk centrepiece depicting the dukes orders and titles perforce incomplete for the honours still came the deccan service the egyptian service paintings furniture statuary porcelain of every description field marshals batons of half a dozen nations and more and many hundreds of thousands voted by parliament so that the duke might acquire a country seat as marlborough before him had acquired blenheim hervey could scarcely believe that he himself had refused the duke what little he had to offer do you enjoy your evening captain hervey he turned to the adc and smiled yes i do very much let us hope his grace does for he has been in high dudgeon these past three days hervey knew it was not a rare occurrence for the duke to be discomposed but he had had no intimation of ill humour on arrival quite the opposite in fact indeed how so do you know what day it is no i think you must the dukes time in india now that he was given the hint the answer came quickly enough the battle of assaye just so the duke had invited sir john vandeleur to be guest of honour as colonel of the nineteenth light dragoons whose victory it was in large part but he declined in protest of the disbandments hervey was intrigued he had heard that the twentyfirst were to disband the twentieth had gone already but nothing more in any case the nineteenth the heroes of assaye had only lately become lancers with the sixteenth the first in the kings service i am very sorry for it on all accounts there were evidently other men then who were not disposed to obliging the duke in every particular indeed so we must hope that the ladies are sufficiently diverting this evening hervey glanced up and down the table for the main part i should say there is no doubt of it the adc smiled and nodded while tucking into a cheesecake with surprising gusto after all that had gone before lady katherine is engaging company he suggested between mouthfuls yes yes said hervey a little unsure we have had plenty of conversation she greatly enjoys company when she rides every day hervey heard the suspicion of a warning but before he could press the adc to more lady katherine turned again to him we ladies are being bidden to retire will you attend upon my husband and me afterwards captain hervey when that is colonel warde has done with you with great pleasure madam he rose as a footman drew back her chair she smiled warmly at him until later then hervey turned back to the adc but that officer was already moving to attend on the duke as it seemed was the officer who had been on lady katherines right so he himself closed further towards the middle of the table to begin an interesting discourse with a peer whose name he did not catch about the prospects of reform but soon the several conversations deferred to the dukes in which he expressed himself glad to see so many of rank and distinction at his table that he considered it a worthy inauguration of his new dining room and that he intended hereupon to hold a banquet each year in commemoration of the battle of waterloo the unreforming peer on herveys right evidently wanted some association with waterloo too if only in conversation for he did not have the look of one who had ever served but he sadly misjudged his subject did you have a good view of the battle duke the dukes benevolent smile turned at once to a look like an angered hawk hervey felt himself trying to lean as far away from his neighbour as he could i generally like to see what i am about came the icy reply it fair chilled the company hervey did not relish an encounter with the duke in such a humour the day was saved by the only man at the table who could do so and thank the great god that you do see what you are about duke for i am in no doubt england would not have triumphed without you the great man turned to his right thank you bathurst he said it gravely rather than with any surprise or gratitude he had heard as much many times earl bathurst secretary for war and the colonies for the past seven years had been raised in apsley house indeed had sold it to the dukes elder brother but it was not the time to make any reference to it and we thank you for your magnificent hospitality this evening there were tentative hear hears from around the table the duke nodded then he rose suddenly the gentlemen were to rejoin the ladies and sooner than both had expected in the drawing room hervey refused any more wine and began to contemplate instead his opportunity to take leave colonel warde had not sought him out and he had just judged the moment right to approach the duke but to his considerable surprise he saw lord combermere himself striding across the room towards him captain hervey i fear i did not recognize you at first it is a long time since that day at toulouse and indeed paris do you recall hervey smiled broadly at the recognition and at combermeres engaging humility indeed i do sir of course i do youre back with the sixth i gather yes sir he presumed back referred to the assignment in india lankesters a good man the towcester business dreadful quite dreadful hervey was astonished that combermere should know of it but he had not time to reply before a hand grasped the generals arm what do you say to this officer combermere he refuses an order combermere threw his head back hah i should think he has very good cause duke hervey felt the same hawklike gaze on him as he had seen at table that is just as i told my secretary i shall say good night then hervey i wish you fortune in the east he turned again to his former commander of cavalry a word with you combermere before bathurst leaves of course duke said lord combermere and then holding out his hand good fortune to you hervey when they had turned hervey placed his coffee cup on a side table and made to leave but he felt a tap on his shoulder you did not keep your word captain hervey he turned to find lady katherine oh i am sorry madam we were overlong in the dining room i fear i was about to leave you do not have to leave london this minute do you no madam but it has been a long day and of course i would not detain you captain hervey i know how hard is an officers day in service why do not you accompany me in the park tomorrow i ride most days there you will find it most invigorating i i did not bring a horse lady katherine then i can certainly provide you with one where are you staying hervey saw there was no way out of it save by the severest measures but lady katherines eyes twinkled very appealingly and her face had a most tempting blush the united service club maam i shall have one of my grooms there at eleven captain hervey and you shall join me for luncheon afterwards oh and you must call me kat hervey did not sleep well that night his pleasure in lady katherines eyes her entire form indeed was intense for they were charms which even prodigious effort could not have ignored and then in the middle hours when the wine had begun to lose its effect he had been visited by remorse in succumbing to her attractions repose came only after four but he was woken as arranged at seven whereupon he rose and penned a letter to lady katherine explaining that duty would prevent his keeping their luncheon appointment he considered that riding in the park need have no improper tendency and craving that she would forgive him he called a steward to have an express boy run with the letter to holland park then he shaved and ate breakfast before walking to mr hatchards bookshop in piccadilly to buy the new edition of clators farriery he was greatly discomposed when he learned that it would cost him twelve shillings and he returned to his club to meet lady katherines groom in even poorer spirits than in which he had left when he took the post to tilbury that evening he thanked god that his duty called him away for such had been his pleasure in lady katherine grevilles company in the park that he was glad of not being put further to the test she had however extracted a promise from him to write to her with a description of calcutta and that he now saw was indeed a perilous pledge part two india the european power which is now established in india is properly speaking supported neither by physical force nor by moral influence it is a piece of huge complicated machinery moved by springs which have been arbitrarily adapted to it under the supremacy of the brahmins the people of india hated their government while they cherished and respected their rulers under the supremacy of europeans they hate and despise their rulers from the bottom of their hearts while they cherish and respect their government abbé dubois a description of the character manners and customs of the people of india and of their institutions religious and civil chapter thirteen the bay of bengal calcutta six months later the calcutta journal yesterday there were received at fort william lieutenantcolonel sir ivo lankester and the officers of his majestys sixth light dragoons who are to augment the companys bengal establishment and in their honour there was given a fêtechampêtre by the governorgeneral and lady hastings the gardens were brilliantly illuminated with many thousands of coloured lamps an eminent operator in fireworks had been brought from lucknow to display his talents the company appeared in fancy dresses those that chose it wore masks ranges of tents were fixed in different parts of the garden wherein tables were laid covered with all the dainties the best french cooks could produce for the accommodation of three hundred persons besides which every room in the fort was stored with refreshments of every sort and kind different bands of martial music were stationed in several parts of the gardens and also in the house with appropriate and distinct performers for the dancers the road approaching the fort was for the last mile lighted up with a double row of lamps on each side making every object as clear as day in short nothing could exceed the splendour of the preparations and this being the first such occasion after the conclusion of the thirty days of official mourning for his late majestys passing many were the opportunities taken to drink to the long life and health of his majesty king george the fourth for hervey however nothing could have made the evening more agreeable than the inclusion of two particular names in the governorgenerals list of guests he had been able to call on them the afternoon before but only for a short time so active were his duties with horses and men alike a card had awaited him at the regimental agents in the city delivered promptly with letters from home brought by the overland route through alexandria mrs eyre somervile was engraved on pearlwhite card struck through by the pen with emma written below and in the same neat round hand wishes you would call on us at number fort william on the earliest occasion almost the last letter hervey had written from england had been to eyre somervile at fort george madras with the payment of a considerable premium so that it should go overland too the card came as no surprise therefore except in locating its sender in calcutta for the marriage of the collector of guntoor and philip lucies sister had long been a presumption in madras but it did not diminish herveys delight at the early prospect of seeing them again to both he owed at the least the preservation of his reputation and very probably his life and now the day after the fêtechampêtre he was dining with them both as their sole guest his duties done until two days following and thus with an easy repose before him you are the toast of council hervey said somervile refilling his glass and passing the decanter to his wife likely as not theyll vote you half a lakh next week it is a prodigious achievement five horses only agreed emma somervile the native cavalry lost that many last summer in one day when the hooghly was in spate hervey smiled with satisfaction we were fortunate in having a landing at the cape but the saving was in the arrangements aboard the transport the captain was uncommonly obliging there are half a dozen troopers with wounds and sprains though my own grooms mare is still on the sick list all the same hervey to bring ashore so many fit horses is truly remarkable said somervile emphatically emmas ears had pricked at the mention of herveys groom is he the dragoon who was with you before the one who spoke so strangely the same a good and faithful servant indeed she replied smiling i shall look forward to seeing him again do you recall him eyre it had been three and a half years since last hervey had shared a table with eyre somervile and with emma lucie as she had then been but the years had fallen away in as many hours this evening and the fellowship born of those few but strenuous months in madras and chintal was now returned in full and easy measure time played its tricks in india the rajah of chintal had once told him and in the silence that somervile took to light his cigar while emma somervile cast a sharp eye over the khitmagars clearing away the last of the company china these bengalis were not to be compared to her trusty madras telingas hervey imagined himself once more in that comfortable dining room at fort george the day he had swum ashore through the coromandel breakers with jessye that was indeed where he would have wished to be with all that then lay before him and he was surprised when it next occurred to him that henriettas death was closer in time to that day than to this so often he could barely remember what had filled the months since her passing so that it now seemed only as yesterday six months at sea had served to dull a little more of the ache but such was the ships routine its monotony often as not that the passage might have been one month or twelve on good days he could go for hours without even the remembrance of henrietta these were usually days when the weather was ill or the horses distressed and the body was so active that the mind was somehow uncoupled but there were other days when suddenly his thoughts vacant a black cloud of despair would settle over him and only the knowledge that he must face his dragoons could shift it and once but only once he had leaned long on the rail watching the atlantic swell wondering what release the cold depths brought to those who were cast one way or another into the ships foamy wake smoke billowed ceilingwards from where sat the erstwhile collector of guntoor now fourth in council of the bengal presidency he had put on weight a stone hervey thought perhaps more and he had less hair than before but with these gains and losses had come an evident increase in contentment there was none of the disputatiousness of that first dinner where he had seemed at pains to challenge hosts and guest alike emma especially on each and every matter hervey thought it the contentment of the man whose standing in the world was growing and his fortune likewise above all it was the contentment of the married man that he could recognize assuredly emma for her part had not changed to any appreciable extent she had ever been content or at least at ease with herself and her faith her hair was perhaps a shade lighter but she did go about without a hat the colour of her skin was little different from many a native girl from these parts hervey i shall leave you a quarter of an hour said somervile looking at his watch i am lieutenantgovernor of the fort this evening and have to certify that the gate is closed and barred hervey was much diverted by the notion of somerviles doing picket duty and liked the idea of some exercise following their ample beef dinner ill come with you if you like no no its a turgid affair the khansamah will bring more port sit fast since emma looked set to take more port hervey gave way when her husband was gone emma suggested they walk in the garden it is nothing by day im afraid a poor affair of pots but by night it is very pleasing the stench of the city is not so bad for one thing everyone in the sixth from colonel to private had been complaining about the calcutta stench and colourful had been the comparisons private johnson had thought it worse than fargate of a saturday night which hervey learned was a place of singular olfactory torment but the somerviles garden was a delight to the senses at this hour there were thuribles about the place from which a constant stream of incense smoke sweetened the air the days heat becoming oppressive even now in midmay had given way to a gentle balminess and in the sky were familiar stars again which for a full three months in the middle of the voyage they had not seen there is an owl too said emma taking his arm a scops owl eyre says eyre is very knowledgeable about birds but i have only seen it once by day he has little tufts above his eyes he looks very arch hervey was charmed at this moment they might be in wiltshire does it make any noise oh yes but not like the owls at home for he seems to have but one note only and very soft and he just repeats it at intervals it sounds as if he is speaking direct with one then i hope we shall hear him i suspect we have scared him away oh no said emma shaking her head he is very assured if he were here hed be watching us yet he prefers the middle branches of that cedar there hervey peered unsuccessfully into the semidarkness for the lantern lights about the place lit only the ground emma pressed a hand to his arm matthew this is the first occasion i have had to say anything to you but on paper concerning henrietta he had known it must come he tried not to stiffen you spoke very generously in your letter of you both i hope you will think the owl called there said emma nothing shrill as an english owl hervey silently thanked the bird for his intervention i am a brother to dragons and a companion to owls i remember in madras how the night noises seemed so muted after the days tumult emma smiled tumult indeed and yet nothing to those days in chintal the owl called again oo ooh the same note just as soft they said nothing listening instead for a third oo ooh it came after a while and just as before hervey sighed perhaps inaudibly you know i lay sleepless in my berth on the ship night after night without her i just lay there thinking about her not being there and then i would think about my not sleeping for thinking about her there seemed no way out of thinking and its the same still no matter which way i try to go its the same at first it was like fear as i felt before battle and then just an awful ache and i had no will to do anything nothing seemed worth it i must force myself even now to believe that anything is worth it and things do seem worth it for a while and i begin to be as before and then the futility of it all comes back on me emma had never heard him speak from the heart indeed she could not recall hearing him talk of any interior matter save religion and that in the sense of theology rather than faith but it did not discomfit her and although she had no direct experience of the condition he described she had a sense of the despair at his core and she saw at once the danger in the belief that nothing mattered yet she was almost as heartened as she was troubled it was now a full two years since henriettas death and the practice in india was for such rapid remarriage months sometimes only weeks afterwards that she had begun to doubt whether a man could be truly constant in life herveys constancy was so admirably apparent matthew you have not spoken of god in this it had not been emmas intention let alone expectation but the mention of the divinity had at once a most salutary effect hervey stiffened braced himself up it was as if his commanding officer were approaching with a captain hervey you have duties to attend to emma pressed him to the point you remain faithful i trust matthew i could not suppose it otherwise and he must have been a light through these last years as before how could he explain how could he begin to explain how could he tell her that each time he had looked for that light it had been in vain that at times it was like going to the house of an old friend to find the gates closed the door locked the shutters fast and then the bell unanswered how could he say that it was only job who spoke to him from the page and at times contrarily but again this she sensed you had an admirable practice of reading a psalm each day as i recall hervey smiled to himself as if at some distant happy memory the psalms appointed for the day yes and i do still occasionally to hear a familiar voice i think silence descended once more then the owl called again viewhalloo came somerviles voice from the house imitating the bird a dozen paces to your right second branch up there indeed it was how in heavens name did you spy him from there i can see him only against the sky exclaimed hervey i couldnt that is where he always sits hervey smiled then i wish you had met the dukes chief of intelligence you would have had much to speak of in the question of humbug you cannot be sure that i have not hervey narrowed his eyes mockingly but he was largely hoist on his own device for secrecy in such matters was the very essence of intelligence work no you are right i cannot be sure calculation and just the right degree of humbug that would be the essence of intelligence work would it not i suppose so and am i to calculate now there is nothing to calculate matthew insisted emma turning to her husband really eyre i think there must be more to the skills required than being an ornithologer at dinner hervey had noticed how much of a teasing dominance emma had achieved it appeared to be in direct proportion to somerviles own diminution in dispute and left the impression of a thoroughly happy balance theirs was indeed an altogether admirable union two days later hervey was standing at the rails of the sandy arena which served as the summer riding school in the cavalry lines in a couple of hours time midmorning the place would be a great cloud of dust if so much as a single horse trotted its four corners but the bhistis had been at work from soon after dawn and would bring their watering cans in continuous relays to damp down the manège until the sun drove all to seek the shade hervey knew it would get hotter too this may heat was nothing compared with the heavy air that would settle on them before the monsoon broke although being close to the sea their discomfort would be minor compared with the garrisons on the plain further west it was difficult to imagine that the calcutta garrison would have need of the big whitewashed stone school which served all three regiments during the winter not that the regiment was labouring greatly in the heat hervey had been pleased to observe the weeks coming up through the indian ocean had served to acclimate both men and horses well he had five men sick this day probably no more than would have been the case in hounslow although the surgeons prognosis in the case of private carrow was not good poor carrow had not seen india other than the inside of the isolation hospital he had been laid low with a fever since the transports had entered the hooghly and had been taken off by stretcher in a delirium as soon as anchor had been dropped it was the last thing that hervey had wanted for the smiting of carrow as soon as they had come within breath of the land had put a terrible fear into the troop even chokey finch old indiaman that he was had been unable to shake off the dread that they would all be taken by the hooghlys notorious miasma before laying a foot ashore but finch had rallied after a few days and with chokey finch in decent spirits once more the others had soon followed suit hervey congratulated himself on persuading b troops captain to give him up to e for an old sweat had good tricks to teach as well as questionable ones watching his troop at riding school and with a heavy heart hervey wished he had a dozen more sweats before leaving hounslow the new men had had a rude introduction to military equitation at the hands of the roughriders just enough to make them secure at the trot but now they looked like raw recruits again three months at least before a field day i reckon opined serjeantmajor armstrong taking off his watering cap and mopping his brow with his cuff but some of them have the makings for sure boiler smith can sit secure as youd expect and rudd has a good seat and wainwright too and neither of them had been on a horse before it was worth going to wiltshire just for those two and shepherd stents at home in the saddle except that he wont do as hes told look at that leg it was not where it should be that much was certain yet hervey observed that he had his mount in hand get them eels down number three and the leg where the girth is bellowed roughrider serjeant smollet this is his majestys light dragoons not a flock of sheep drovers six months was what the colonel said we could have it certainly wont be a handy troop inside of that you just missed french id be the first to say i judged him too hasty that lad puts everything he has into it hervey agreed no one had worked harder than french on the voyage out it could not have been easy for a youth of evident education to be below decks he seems very content in his lot yet i believe him to have ambition oh i hope so sir mind you its your credit for things getting him to teach the likes of mole to write have you seen how they look at him as if hes a corporal already hervey smiled a little with satisfaction but i was wrong about sisken armstrong sighed ay well i couldve insisted more they watched a while longer in silence half the trouble is those remounts said hervey after the second of the warminster pals had dismounted involuntarily theyre as green as the recruits well i doubt well see better this side of christmas no matter what the rm says them indoo orse next door reckon theyve scoured the country from here to lucknow and still havent enough without a doubt thought hervey these were the poorestlooking troophorses since the peninsula and very disobliging i dont understand it i saw more quality in the rajahs stables in chintal than ive seen in years word in the bazaars is that the agents got the option on every screw in bengal hervey sighed itll be a sorry affair if we have to go and find our own remounts as well as recruits they watched as the ride changed reins a third pal slid to the ground bringing a welter of expletives from the roughrider serjeant the sixths methods were thoroughly modern but a dragoon who would not keep his horse between himself and the ground must be put in no doubt as to his delinquency you missed the best sir indeed mccarthy the footiest man on a horse you ever saw but by god hes determined as soon as hes proficient we should make him corporal collins says hes like lightning with firearms and caithlin likes him she does i think it settled then he said with a smile but hardly surprised that affair in france the only cool head in the company id dearly like to know how he lost his rank fighting for sure like every other paddy what id like to know is how bc lost his name hes kept his nose clean so far i grant you as far as the barrackroom was concerned private dodds might as well have been christened bc as branded it well it will out sure enough and probably soon and you can tell me you warned as much before armstrong could protest hervey saw the commanding officer approaching and with him the rsm when the colonel had closed with them the officers exchanged salutes and the serjeantmajors stood to attention as was the sixths custom some way to go i think said colonel lankester with a bemused look i think so too colonel replied hervey managing not to frown too much we shall need our six months mm hervey looked at lankester uneasily i shall need to borrow your troop shall we say somewhat earlier than that indeed colonel nothing too serious hervey i shouldnt worry about it the governorgeneral wants to stage a demonstration as he puts it the last of the pindaree forts was overcome last month and he wants to send a message to all the spies in the city when colonel we have two weeks herveys mouth fell open it cant be done lankester eyed him warily but was not inclined to take his dissent to task the entire brigades to turn out a sort of mock battle the governorgeneral intends it to be a great tamasha as he puts it last one before the rains come you need have no worry though as soon as the brigadier makes his intention known i shall arrange for your troop to be put in a place whence it doesnt have to manoeuvre colonel i fear even that is asking too much see this ride and theyre by no means the worst if we had schoolmasters it would not be so bad but these have no manners whatever sir ivo looked again at the ride there was not a horse on the bit very well hervey he said with a sigh we must think of something that keeps them out of things altogether meanwhile keep at riding school you may have all the roughriders too and there are more remounts arriving in a day or so you shall have first choice im obliged colonel said hervey he would have done all in his power to accommodate sir ivo a man of such evident integrity and so wholly lacking in vanity but he would have been true to no one not least to sir ivo himself if he had simply said yes to an infeasible task but for all his disappointment sir ivo seemed in excellent spirits he turned to armstrong good morning serjeantmajor how is mrs armstrong i have not seen her since we disembarked she is very well thank you colonel and busy i hear she has the wives combining every morning colonel im grateful to her the quarters are better than i dared hope but the better still for some organization what say you mr lincoln i have never seen their like in all my service colonel declared the rsm i might wish we had come here years ago only the adjutant knew to what lengths the commanding officer had gone to secure habitable married quarters lankester had written to the court of directors and then to mr canning president of the board of control and had forced their hand ultimately by pledging a sizeable sum of his own to the provision of separate lines twice the number normally allowed and as soon as he had become aware of how many more wives there were beyond even that number he had sent by the express route a further requisition the meanest dragoon and his wife had a room of their own in consequence quite a turnabout isnt it said armstrong when lankester had gone it is agreed hervey but he was disinclined to dwell on it the memory of lord towcester was made all the worse by comparison with such a man as sir ivo well either way the rms going to have a hell of a job getting yon clodhoppers to pass out of riding school this side of the monsoon i reckon our best bet might be the leading rein for this do of the generals hervey nodded it may yet come to it and what a sight we shall then look eh the cavalry lines stood on the northern edge of the city so that dry fodder could be had in plenty from the plain beyond and so that horse and rider would have easy access to exercise ground however in the years since the building of the lines there had been a steady encroachment of squattings the dwelling places of the little army of syces bhistis bearers and sweepers and all the other untouchables who eased the labour of the cavalrymen or who provided them and their officers with comforts their ramshackle huts stood in singular contrast to the whitened stone of the cavalry lines the verandahed barrackhouses offices stores and stables just as their occupants in their drab homespun stood in contrast to the dragoons in their blue yellow silver and gold in the case of the females on the other hand the bright colours of the native women easily eclipsed those of the gora log whose quality preferred white or pastels and whose others still wore the dark cloth of the tenement or the cottage when the lines had been extended in anticipation of the sixths posting many of the squattings had been dismantled and moved half a mile further onto the plain or had simply been swept away however they had still increased in number as the agents began engaging labour for the new regiment so that almost immediately on leaving the lines and even for that matter the officers lines where stood the officers house and its surrounding bungalows and the married officers quarters the rider was presented with the sights and sounds the tastes and smells of native india this morning the sun just up the air still fresh and the cooking fires making yet only a little smoke hervey was content his gelding was getting back to hale condition summer coat through and shining muscle regenerate gilbert had endured the voyage as well as jessye had three years before his mouth was as soft as when the bridoon had been taken off at tilbury and his manners had deteriorated not a jot but that was nothing compared with private johnsons delight his roan mare the atrophy of the muscles over her near scapula had been truly alarming but it had disappeared quite spontaneously almost overnight indeed the veterinary surgeon had predicted that it could but no one had had any expectation of it for the ridge on the shoulder blade had been so prominent that it suggested some malignant growth rather than muscle damage what did tha say it were called sir sweeny thats what the americans call it at least the ones we met in michigan dont you remember that admirable farrier in detroit who treated the serjeantmajors mare johnson did well i cant wait to get my old girl out for a walk thats all ill say tvetinarys seeing er this afternoon i reckon ell pass er fit lets hope so but it was a very nasty fall nellie had fallen in a squall off madagascar and evidently taken her whole weight on her shoulder for the damage had been massive the veterinarian believes it may be something to do with the nerve in that part rather than the tissue said hervey is that why its come all right he says that nerves can become snared and just as suddenly theyre released itd be a real shame if they didnt shes tbest trooper ive ad hervey did not doubt it but this was india whats wrong with the one youre riding johnson looked surprised what this ive seen bigger pit ponies shes going forward nicely ay but well what else do you want johnson looked indignant well id like summat wi a bit of reach that i grant you but ill warrant that pony will carry you a deal further in this country than your irish mare and i think id trade a hand or two for that johnson was doubtful the first remounts arrive this afternoon continued hervey brushing a particularly large horsefly from gilberts neck i shall look them over with mr sledge and choose thirty at once the sooner those recruits are in the saddle as one body the better he looked thoughtful for a moment i ought to stop calling them recruits i suppose johnson agreed i wonder ow many dragoons as spent as long in tranks wiout an orse afore hervey smiled youre right we must be the footiest dragoons in the line but their musketrys good mind being so long cooped up you didnt see harkness bring down that goose at the cape es all right is arkness sir yknow french as taught im to read proper and write has he indeed harkness as well as mole then french has doubly earned his pay yknow is fathers a parson an all sir the short a in johnsons father still took hervey by surprise from time to time his ear for the peculiarities of sheffield vowels indeed for the whole structure of the speech of those parts was now finely attuned but father always sounded peculiarly alien alien and rather cold especially compared with the gentle fayther of caithlin armstrongs cork and private mccarthys for that matter yes i do know but he seemed disinclined to speak of his family when first i broached it so i didnt press him to details someweer in wales e said an e said that folks there used to say them as were on tparish were as poor as church mice but not as poor as tparson hervey could believe it his own fathers living may have been a poor one but by the standards of the welsh dioceses he knew it to be comfortable is french liked by the others oh ay sir e used to write letters for their sweetearts in ounslow an es a godfearing man an all most o ttroop respects im for that but mind e wouldnt ave owt to do with corporal sandbache when e came round johnson lashed out at another of the early horseflies they had attracted hervey smiled at the thought of preacher sandbache believing he had a readymade accomplice in french sandbache did little enough harm that was the general opinion and from time to time it was acknowledged that he did good at least the chaplain had no complaints that a wesleyan was at work in the ranks for the chaplain was by any reckoning a good man and the first to acknowledge that his ministry beyond the church parade was largely ineffective french was evidently a man to watch then hervey had thought as much from the beginning but favouring a dragoon who might be a gentlemans son would hardly have been a kindness especially in the confines of a transport better then that he had left him as he had to earn the trust of his comrades for once french had won it hervey could use his talents keenly what do you think of mccarthy johnson did not reply at once it was not that he ever paused to think how best to express something he spoke entirely as he found rather that he had no perfect opinion of mccarthy e keeps imself to imself tothersve been biding their time wi im i think but ill tell thee this sir i cant see as ell ever be appy on an orse hervey was all too fearful of this latter but mccarthy had his talents for sure if he could not learn to ride then there were other places he could serve though it was sabres the troop had need of most the sisken business was a miserable affair the first time in the regiment johnson screwed up his face e pissed imself that often everybody wondered if e knew where t eads were johnson but hervey knew it was little use protesting even mildly at the soldiers black humour it was in any case equally the soldiers strength when times were bad but whatever had driven private sisken to hang himself in the ships heads it was a poor thing that a dragoon even one only partially trained should reach such a state of mind without his fellows or his superiors knowing it armstrong for all his rough tongue had felt the unstated rebuke as keenly as had hervey but why sisken had made a crude noose of hemp for himself when drowning was the easier and surer way had been the question on everyones lips a watery grave was anyway what the man got the following day the chaplain commending himself to the dragoons by ignoring the statutes against christian committal of those who had taken their own lives indeed the chaplain preached as perhaps he had never done before calling upon the assembled company to give thanks to almighty god that he has given us his unworthy children the strength to endure where his servant jeremiah sisken had insufficient so that next day for the first time he was received below decks with some regard rather than with mere toleration i should like you to come with me to look at the remounts said hervey suddenly determined to change the conversation you can ask mr seton cannings groom to stand evening stables for you johnson saw no cause to object he trusted lingard better than any man in the sixth to stand his duty with the chargers where will they be the adjutant says theyll be corralled somewhere out here hervey scanned the plain around him shading his eyes against the low eastern sun as he turned to north and west the country was empty but for the odd scrubby tree the earth was baked and fruitless for there were no cuts from the hooghly here by which a ryot could irrigate a little patch for his maize and beans and no grass that even a goat might subsist on east of them lay the military lines and the chitpore road which ran north from the companys city to the official native quarter with its temples and the prominent houses of grand bengali merchants they were whitepainted like those of the company sahibs and a curious mix of styles mahommedan chiefly the inheritance of the moghuls and grecian the influence of the portuguese but im dammed if i can see a solitary fence post said hervey lowering his telescope which way are they coming hervey pointed lucknow theres a veterinarian whos set up stud farms all over the companys territory apparently lucknow is his best would that be mr moorcroft hervey was impressed yes how had you heard of him one o tsutlers used to work for im e said that e used to keep goin off into tills an comin back wi orses an evry time they got smaller what do you mean every time evry time e came back wi smaller orses johnson sounded disapproving you dont think he might have been prescient in his breeding policy then said hervey trying to suppress a smile at his grooms absolute determination in the matter of size johnson merely shrugged by late in the afternoon the part of the plain where they had stood that very morning was transformed into a sight reminiscent of many a horse fair in england not exactly as i had imagined sighed the commanding officer casting his eyes left and right dispiritedly im not sure that any of them are up to weight threescore horses stood tethered in running lines a tail swishing here and there at the odd persistent fly but otherwise motionless they were tired from the march and from the sun which though low now in the west had not lost quite all of its formidable strength the syces had brought them south from jessor in five days eighty miles of flat lush country at least to begin with but with two sizeable rivers and a dozen smaller ones to cross had the horses been copers stock the syces would have rested them another day to let them pick up sufficiently to win the buyers eye but these animals were the progeny of the companys stud department they were for issue not for sale they appear tractable at least colonel suggested hervey colonel lankester nodded and then smiled but hugh rose wont like it much especially not when youve had first pick that captain hugh rose had come with his troop to india had been a surprise to many for it had been assumed he would exchange with some impecunious officer in another regiment and pay the difference the price of his troop had plummeted as soon as the sixth had been warned for the posting but rose had regained his appetite for the field in canada and now wanted to see the east for a year or so at least he said leaving his bays behind had not been easy however though d with its chestnuts had been unquestionably the prettiest on parade a troop had been the more striking especially when coats were shining with sweat and there was nothing that hugh rose had liked better than to trot them past at a review and hear the admiration of the onlookers especially if they were female he had after all put no small sum of his own into his troops horses well sighed hervey to himself the leader of a troop was not going to enjoy that acclamation with these for remounts i think i will leave him the biggest though colonel from what i observed before the smaller breeds are the better doers here and that is what i have heard too said lankester sounding hopeful but as the company expects us to make an impression i am rather perplexed hervey did not respond big men on big horses might impress the country powers at a durbar but that might not be enough instead he turned his attention to a dozen or more little marwaris at the end of the line a mixed bag of colours none of them standing much above fourteen hands pit ponies johnson was no doubt thinking ive seen these before colonel theyre very tough colonel lankester looked at them curiously what extraordinary ears the marwaris ears were turned in so much that when they were pricked they almost touched giving the appearance of horns i dont know why it is so replied hervey theres a lot of arab in them but that can hardly be the cause what is your opinion mr sledge the veterinary surgeon stepped forward still minded to speak only when spoken to even with so agreeable a commanding officer as sir ivo lankester i know nothing of their ears colonel but i would not be inclined to regard it as an unsoundness i would be more troubled by what i am given to understand is their tendency to sickle hocks and their reputation for uncertain temper hervey was as impressed as the commanding officer by sledges research but sickle hocks you can recognize easily enough can you not sir ivo suggested oh indeed colonel anyone may and if i were buying for myself i should not take such a case the risk is not worth it but a fault of conformation is not necessarily an unsoundness sledge was of the new stamp whereas veterinarysurgeon selden the sixths sulphurtinged veteran of the peninsula had turned to the fledgling science from a guys hospital dissecting room david sledge a son of the manse was a product of the new veterinary college in camden town why he had eschewed a lucrative civil practice in england for the indignities of one in the service was unclear for his prospects even under a colonel like lankester could not have been greatly appealing although he was classed as a cornet for the first ten years of his service he was on a par with that rank only for the purpose of allotting quarters and it would be a full twenty years before he could be classed as a captain for the time being however mr sledge was an active and diligent veterinarian and had won an unusual degree of respect among both officers and the ranks alike the commanding officer turned to hervey am i to take it then that you would have these as first preference subject to sledges approval yes colonel there seem to be a score or so of them the rest i should have to search the lines for but there look to be some promising types the commanding officer now turned full round to private johnson and what is your opinion johnson did not hesitate for a moment well colonel it wont be so far for trecruits to fall thats for certain but capn ervey says these things is right good doers so i reckon we should be pleased johnsons display of both independence and loyalty pleased captain and commanding officer alike hervey was especially heartened to hear a private man speak up so and use colonel to his commanding officer as had long been the sixths custom until the late unhappiness i fear there shall be some ribbending in this however cautioned lankester smiling still you may yet be known as the pony troop hervey handsome is as handsome does colonel youre right of course but you may wait a deal of time before you have a chance to prove them handsome doers hervey knew it all too well the review was closer at hand than they could possibly manage chapter fourteen a great tamasha two weeks later that fortnight was a time of backbreaking toil for both men and horses herveys troop got the last of their remounts more marwaris only five days before the brigade review they looked puny even before they stood next to those of the other troops who could at least form a decent front with their english troopers but if any dragoons in the other troops had taunted them e troop could not have heard for they were roused a full hour before the rest of the regiment and turned in a full hour later yet even by such means a working day of sixteen hours the troop was scarcely able to advance in column of threes at more than a walk and the leading rein about which armstrong and others had joked looked more and more likely to be their deliverer and the sick list had grown no malingerers these for the ncos would only let them report sick if the farrier had first given his opinion and only a week ago poor smith the boiler as all and sundry had called him had fallen to a fever after evening stables and was dead by first parade next day theyre so small we could walk next to em and at three undred yards itd look as if we were mounted johnson had opined early on hervey had replied that it was not so bad an idea we are dragoons after all the day of the review was on them however and finely run it was for the gathering clouds spoke of the southwest monsoon which would before long engulf this last dry corner of india on the cusp of what seemed bearable and what was not the quality and the fashionable of calcutta were driving out onto the plain northwest of the city to see the review of the st bengal cavalry brigade there could not have been a nabob or a potentate anywhere in the bengal presidency who would not be there as well as many from the adjoining princely states that at any rate was lord hastingss intention and it seemed that the governorgeneral had likewise deported from the city every piece of canvas for a week and more bullock carts and elephants had trudged back and forth to the review ground by a different road so as not to rut the one to be used by the guests with marquees and rugs and hangings tables cushions and chairs and all manner of little comforts so that the princes and powers might see the wealth to which the honourable company had resource and the bengal sappers had constructed a canvas pavilion where the guests might ease themselves served by fresh running water the like of which no ryot could imagine the whole bedecked with streamers and bunting so that it might have been the marching pavilion of the great moghul himself what choice food and wine was to be served hervey could only guess but the whole regiment knew that since midnight the elephants had been porting yakhdans filled from the fort william ice houses the dragoons themselves at this minute would have pledged themselves to hefty stoppages of pay for the contents of those hayboxes for although their canteens were full the water in them was warm they would enjoy the same spectacle of the review as the nabobs albeit from not so good a vantage point but without shade or punkahs they could scarcely hope to enjoy it nearly so much orders for the review itself had come at dusk two evenings before and sir ivo had assembled his troopleaders to discuss how best to expedite them a sensible course the captains agreed afterwards and one which only a commanding officer secure in his own position would have contemplated the scheme was straightforward enough compared with some of the field days they had known at hounslow it was indeed easy not to mention the real evolutions many of them had performed for the duke of wellington that memorable day five years ago save for one thing the state of training of the remounts for the first four troops it was not perhaps so great a problem since the dragoons themselves were seasoned but hervey faced a compound difficulty of greenhead dragoons and greenhead horses more than once during the two weeks which had passed since that conversation with sir ivo he had found himself wondering why the colonel had not spread the new recruits of both species across the regiment from a commanding officers point of view it was better probably to be sure of four troops than to be not so sure of five but hervey had felt the price of that surety very keenly as he realized that all e troop might do was stand and watch the plan which emerged from the colonels colloquium was for the first four troops to form two squadrons as the masse de manoeuvre on the right of the line the two other regiments of the brigade were after all junior in close order they would be an impressive sight with their blue coats and pipeclay crossbelts white shakos and plumes the brigadier wanted plumes most emphatically the trumpeters were good and well practised and the officers were confident they could carry out the expected evolutions herveys troop on the other hand were to remain within sight of the noble spectators dismounted and in reserve and would mount only when the battle was won so that they could retire from the field as the squadrons rallied there was no distinction in that hervey rued but by the same token there was no danger of his dragoons being overmatched and so here the day of the review e troop were mustered thirtyeight strong standing easy sweat glistening on horses and men alike the ncos were chafing at being nursemaids when they might have been galloping with their fellows in the other troops and hervey was trying hard to conceal his own mixed feelings the sixth had worked into the silent hours on their equipment so that it shone now in the bright sunlight whether steel or leather and none had worked harder than e troop who though they were to make themselves scarce at the earliest opportunity knew nevertheless that eyes would be upon them from the moment they led out their horses in the regimental lines in troop columns of threes the sixth had marched onto the exercise ground behind the bengal horse so that when the brigade turned into line they should be on the right as their seniority required with the artillery to their right in turn at any distance it was an imposing sight speaking of order and discipline and a disposition for concerted action which must be the envy of the country powers at the canvas pavilions the assembled potentates were watching to a commentary by the major of brigade as relays of khitmagars served iced champagne and sherbet the brigadier having received word that the enemy is approaching has sent out scouts to range beyond the ridge explained the brigademajor through a speaking trumpet pointing out the direction mindful that the enemy may deploy his own scouts forward a line of vedettes will be established to counter them the brigademajor handed his speaking trumpet to the officer who was to continue with the commentary and rode down to the brigade commander the signal for the vedettes to deploy and the horse artillery to unlimber according to the carefully worked scheme there would be a quarter of an hour before the vedettes would signal the enemys approach and so the brigadier concluded he had time for one small innovation he cursed himself for not thinking of it before hervey observed him through his telescope majorgeneral sir mortimer massey a man of whom no one had heard until new orleans when he had parleyed successfully with the americans to take the wounded from the field he was an impressive figure tall in the saddle plumed scarletcoated riding a grey arab that would have made bonaparte himself envious sir ivo said the general as he trotted up to the sixth seeing the ground this morning i am much taken by the possibilities of that nullah over to your right sir ivo looked to where the general was indicating i believe it ought to be possible to get a troop along it unseen to all the nabobs to come up on the flank of the vedette line sir ivo glanced about the field to the points of reference i see it general to what advantage may i ask the general frowned by heavens youre slow this morning lankester as the enemy come over the ridge and the vedettes pull back the troop can take them in the flank it will be the devil of a surprise to the nabobs the proposition was entirely fair though sir ivo wondered why since this was a day to impress they had not rehearsed it herveys troop might be in want of riding practice but the other troops had scarcely had much opportunity for field drill but he could hardly balk at so elementary a manoeuvre very well general shall you give me the signal no you may judge it for yourself sir ivo theres no point in waiting for my off when youll see the vedettes signalling as well as i shall a sensible decision thought sir ivo if late in the day the general reined about and trotted to the centre of the brigade captain rose and mr asshetonsmith please the commanding officers voice was raised no higher than if he were speaking to his charger but the word was passed at once to a troops leader nearest the guns and the adjutant in the supernumerary rank gentlemen the brigadier has determined a change in the manoeuvres said sir ivo as they rode up he explained the intention ill take a look then if i may colonel said rose yes but do it covertly rose saluted and returned to his troop a pity we did not have more time before today said sir ivo to the adjutant it would have been a fair question of e troop bands played for the entertainment of the spectators meanwhile as the enemy a regiment of native infantry advanced to the ridge in full view of the pavilions but concealed from the brigade the design was that when the infantry reached a bullockcart track which ran obliquely across their front some five hundred yards short of the ridge the vedettes would start to signal their approach the general a prudent man had also placed a galloper to observe from a flank so that he could be warned independently the infantry had rehearsed the manoeuvre twice but in the early morning the heat was now unexpectedly slowing their advance so that the general was becoming anxious when he saw his galloper approaching dust rising behind him and exaggerating his speed he was half convinced that something was amiss the infantry have reached the track sir said the lieutenant saluting pleased that he had been able to bring the report his general wished to hear but general massey was disturbed by the news he turned to his brigademajor why in heavens name arent the vedettes signalling neville cant they see brigademajor neville could have no more idea than the general he turned to the galloper you saw with your own eyes they had reached the track sir with my own eyes the general looked about anxiously he saw herveys troop standing dismounted a furlong away good god neville whats sir ivo doing hes not moved that troop into the nullah yet the brigademajor turned round in the saddle to see for himself if the vedettes havent reported anything general sir ivo has no notion he should move them the general now very agitated turned back to his galloper go and tell herveys troop to get into that nullah at once what are they to do there sir i did not know of this part of the scheme tell him neville snorted the general the brigademajor obliged them both the galloper lost no further time hervey saw him approaching the trail of dust indicating more speed than his descent from the ridge hallo shawe he said returning the salute bemused by the apparent urgency who are you looking for you sir the general says you are to get into the nullah at once the enemy are approaching the ridge hervey looked astonished shawe i havent the faintest idea what you mean he looked again towards the ridge then lowered his telescope and the vedettes are stockstill lieutenant shawe his artillerymans coat more earthcoloured now than blue was equally perplexed you have no orders at all for the nullah no were to stand here looking alert that is all lieutenant shawe rattled off the brigade commanders intention hervey understood perfectly but those were not sir ivos orders and i am under his direct command i think you had better go and see him and then hare back to the general the galloper saluted reined about and kicked up even more dust than before as he spurred away hervey turned to his trumpeter storrs bring me the officers and sarntmajor please it took less than a minute to assemble them hervey told them of the exchange and what they would have to do if it came to it he had no idea what the nullah was like how wide it was or how steep its banks they would have to lead the horses and mount at the last minute though how much time they would have he couldnt say the officers had just retaken post when another cloud of dust signalled the return of the brigadiers galloper looks like you were right said armstrong i wish i had not been replied hervey handing his reins to johnson and taking his telescope from the saddle pouch again theres no sign of movement in those vedettes captain hervey brigademajors compliments and would you execute the orders at once with no sign from the vedettes hervey could not see the necessity of such urgency have you spoken with sir ivo captain hervey sir those are the brigadiers express orders and they were most imperative yes but have you spoken to sir ivo the general himself has sir really hervey theres no time to lose hervey had received an order in front of his troop and he was not in possession of more information than was the brigadier very well mr shawe johnson handed him back the reins e troop right incline for column of route dragoons shortened reins to lead and hervey took post at the head of the column forward it took only a few minutes to reach the nullah and as they began to descend the shallow bank hervey glanced at the ridge the vedettes were circling once the troop were all safely down hervey shortened his reins again and called double march for the enemy was supposed to gain the ridge ten minutes after the vedettes began signalling their approach and he had no idea how difficult the bed of the nullah would get e troop sweated and blew as they struggled over the shingle bed but they made progress a good hundred yards in the first minute hervey thought they must be in line with the squadrons in another two if they could keep this up they would make the ridge with a couple of minutes in hand but in two more with no warning whatever hugh roses troop plunged into the nullah in line checking not the slightest from a fast trot so that neither a nor e troop could do anything to evade collision men shouted horses squealed many of both fell for the most part herveys dragoons cursed each other some lashed out ncos bellowed to regain order loose horses raced back down the nullah and knocked over dragoons who had survived the first collision they would have floored armstrong had he not already sprung into the saddle officers looked stunned over to their left the horsegunners opened blank fire and in a few seconds smoke was pouring into the nullah to add to the confusion what the deuce are you about hervey shouted rose as he came on him struggling to get his mare up trying to follow orders hervey almost spat the words what are yours to get up to the ridge and take them in the flank coughed rose the smoke engulfing them mine too but theres damn little chance of that now youd better get on hervey looked back down the column he could not recall any greater disorder by daylight there was nothing for it now but to lick their wounds real and imagined the brigadier was first on the scene a quarter of an hour later by then hervey had the troop back in column but two horses with a broken leg apiece lay with bullets in their brains private mole sat supported in the saddle his leg splinted with his sabre harelip accentuating his sorry state private parkin one of the pals stood holding a bloody bandage to his right eye half a dozen others had burst lips missing teeth or broken ribs and two horses were still bleeding severely from severed arteries hervey what in the name of god the brigadier looked about incredulously your orders sir said hervey seton canning and cornet vanneck looked away i beg your pardon we were executing your orders general when a troop plunged on us with the same orders it seems general massey had not the faintest idea what he was talking about what do you mean with the same orders hervey knew at once what had happened perhaps he had the advantage of a quarter of an hour on the brigadier but he was not sure that that was masseys handicap his anger he kept in check but only just sir i surmise you gave sir ivo orders to send a troop into the nullah of course i did but not two but that indeed was the effect you assumed sir ivo would order my troop to the nullah had you sent the hastening order to him general there would have been no confusion i dont like your tone one jot hervey the brigadier sounded more dismayed than angry herveys anger now matched the brigadiers dismay and i with respect sir do not like having my troop cut about like this had we been in action the brigadier had heard enough captain hervey you exceed yourself sir i imagine you lay this blame on me but i might remind you there is a level of command between the two of us serjeantmajor armstrong had closed to herveys side soon after the exchange began he now grasped his captains arm from behind and squeezed hard hervey made no reply to the brigadier i fancy we shall have all this out on return to the lines said general massey gruffly you had better take your troop back captain hervey armstrong released his grip and hervey saluted chapter fifteen extra drill next day i do not say the brigadier is an unreasonable man eustace sir ivo paused and then sighed but i do believe he might have had the grace to withdraw on the matter for the nonsense was his doing no one elses late in the evening after stables and the colonels preliminary inquiry into the affair of the nullah the brigademajor had come to the sixths headquarters bearing unwelcome news while he said the brigadier did not hold hervey to be responsible for events he held his manner to have been insolent and required his apology in writing at once sir ivo having no means by which he might dispute the brigadiers judgement had had no option but to instruct hervey to comply hervey had received this order by protesting that he did not believe a general officer ought to take refuge in his position when attempting to discover the truth of a misadventure he might have added that neither did he think it fitting that a general officer should imply that his herveys commanding officer bore the responsibility but sir ivo had persuaded him to write for as he explained he saw no merit in giving the brigadier a cause which might in the end eclipse the issue of culpability in the botched orders and hervey had acquiesced because he saw the logic and held sir ivo in absolute respect but the letter of apology had not requited the general does the brigadier say in what measure he considers herveys letter to be insufficient asked major joynson reading again the fair copy it would seem that his necessity for establishing the lessons of the affair and his reference to a real not imagined enemy are the offending portions yes said joynson nodding i can see that would go hard with massey and he presumably is not best pleased with you for forwarding it in the first place sir ivo raised his eyebrows that much was implied yes he sounded philosophical but everyone knew that his pride was still hurt by the rebukes which had followed the review the squadrons had manoeuvred well and even the brigademajor had reported that the fracas at the nullah had remained unseen by the spectators if i may speak colonel said the rsm of course mr lincoln it is causing a deal of resentment in the ranks even though they all know captain herveys troop were ordered into the nullah they know too it was never your intention that they be there i am afraid colonel very contrary though it is the view is that e troop should not have gone into the nullah and it does not help of course that they are largely so raw sir ivo sighed it is quite perverse but thank you mr lincoln you will no doubt be speaking to your mess on the subject yes colonel directly after orderly room good armstrong behaving well exemplary colonel i gather he was a model of restraint in the nullah perhaps he can stroll through the lines at evening stables with serjeantmajor bowker and hervey and rose the same a comradely show the rsm returned sir ivos ironic smile indeed colonel sir ivo turned to the adjutant thomas my compliments to captain hervey and inform him that hed better pick up his pen again he nodded to the rsm and that will be all too mr lincoln your counsel as always is appreciated the rsm matchless in his turnout even though the heavy air would have made sweatscrapes busy on them all saluted and left the office as he closed the door joynson took off his cap and sat down colonel i worry about hervey he seems his old self a lot of the time but the anger burns still sir ivo nodded it can sometimes be a powerful force for action eustace i saw many an angry man in the peninsula carry a place with the bayonet or the sabre the major knew that if he himself had had more anger he might have remained with the regiment longer in spain he nodded slowly of course of course he said as if still measuring the proposition but i wonder is it conducive always to good judgement in hot or in cold blood hot blood is probably the lesser to worry about its the slowburning anger the brooding the resentment the loss of reason which sets all the factors in a decision in their proper perspective the earl of sussex had warned sir ivo that his major would serve him at all times faithfully and in matters of administrative detail well but that beyond this he should expect nothing yet sir ivo had a growing regard for joynsons general wisdom not least his modestly perceptive estimates of character in the sixths officers they might all still call him daddy joynson but sir ivo had observed that his opinion was sought increasingly by them and that was ever a sure sign as indeed was the virtual absence of sick headaches a glass of madeira eustace thank you colonel sir ivo took a decanter and glasses from a cupboard you dont think hervey has lost anything of his touch do you i mean it just occurs to me that the hervey of whom id heard might have seen that confusion before it happened the major took his glass and considered the proposition in truth ive thought the same i know that i should never have seen it nor i said sir ivo with a wry smile indeed the notions probably absurd but i too worry we must keep a special eye who are his friends though eyre somervile i suppose hervey would count all the officers his friends but none would own to knowing his thoughts not even strickland and i dare say that somervile neither has ploughed too deep but hes a shrewd man a good man id have him with me in a fight any day ill speak with him unless you think it better it came from you the major thought about it for a moment i think let me try first it might not do for somervile to think he were being asked to spy on him in some way which it might well seem if you approached him sir ivo smiled quite so he pushed the decanter back across the desk tell me eustace to change to happier matters how is frances i have not seen her these past two weeks the major smiled too she is more the attention of the garrison officers than ever it seemed in england sir ivo nodded it was ever thus im told eustace at ten that evening serjeant collins the regimental orderly serjeantmajor entered the wet canteen as his orders required to instruct the sutler to close it it was always a tricky moment a time when abuse had to be differentiated from goodnatured banter in a splitsecond collins never looked forward to the duty but he was one of the more practised rosms in the art of dealing with bibulous dragoons who fancied themselves as wits his art was tested this night however by a barrage of opinion from a troop men on the question of e troops proficiency it was taken up in turn by groups from b c and d troops collins stood his ground perhaps a little too long as if challenging one of them to more than words he looked about to see where were the e troop men to nod to them to beat a retreat before it was too late but a swaying pug from a troop was already making his determined way towards the bar i want another fookin nog and thous not gooin to stop me the jabbing finger left no doubt about who was not to do the stopping collins braced himself e troop continued the pug i wouldnt piss on em lancecorporal mccarthy sitting in direct line between the pug and his objective put down his tankard and stood up time for bed brummie the pug looked at him in disbelief what was a piece of tape compared with his brawn fook off yo thick paddy corporal mccarthy sighed wearily clenched both fists feinted with his left then drove his right into the pugs nose it was the last thing that serjeant collins would be able to give any clear account of to the rsm the following morning majors compliments sir and would you attend on him at once scarcely had first parade finished but that hervey was being summoned to regimental headquarters on account of the wet canteen he thought it a little unfair that he had not yet had advantage of his serjeantmajors reports in their entirety armstrong had been summoned to the rsms office even before muster but in any event he did not expect to be given much of an opportunity to speak sit down hervey said the major distinctly tired of the business already youll have heard of the events of last night i take it yes sir in short in short eh i dont suppose any shorter than the brigadier has heard hervey looked astonished the brigadier how might he have come to hear because the skinners quarterguard had to come and relieve our own while they cleared the canteen hervey grimaced is the colonel very dismayed not yet he was at a ball last evening i dont expect him back until tomorrow what is there to do have you written that letter yet i was just about to start it well this is what you do hervey you write it as if you had offended against holy writ is that clear perfectly the major took off his spectacles and held them up to the light before polishing them vigorously with a silk square your irishman will be reduced to the ranks of course collinsll be lucky too if he scrapes clear sir were not going to make any great affair of this are we e troop was the butt of every dragoons joke yesterday theyd become pretty resentful encouraged no doubt by their captain that is deuced unfair sir is it hervey i freely admit to my anger but i thought to have it in good check others may not agree oh i have no very great trouble with a fray in the canteen and neither i should think would sir ivo the paymasters clerksll be the busier for a few weeks with stoppages but thats of little moment the major took off his spectacles again and began rubbing them once more with the silk are you not owed any leave you might think of taking hervey say a month or so hervey looked pained almost affronted if i were owed it sir i should not dream of taking it now the major looked quite shamefaced no of course not silly of me hervey said nothing you know the trouble with these little regimental quarrels is that after a while resentment is turned towards the man at the head your dragoonsll weary of having to answer on these barbs hervey was well aware of it but still made no reply then he took up his cap will that be all sir yes yes i think so said the major apparently absently but hervey do be a good fellow and write that letter major joynson called on eyre somervile that afternoon they had met only twice before but somervile was pleased to receive him the majors note in advance had not been entirely specific but somervile had heard already of the affair of the nullah over tea joynson explained to him the extent of his and the commanding officers concern for their mutual friend somervile nodded from time to time approving the estimation he will not take leave at this time and very understandably but he might be inclined to do so if you were to invite him said joynson in conclusion somervile thought for a moment i should have said major that once matthew hervey had determined where his duty lay nothing would induce him to do otherwise i am flattered that you think i might have some influence but if he has determined that leave is contrary to his duty then i very much fear he will be immovable the major nodded slowly and i fear that he has formed that notion very surely might i ask you however to do what is in your power to divert him these coming weeks it will not do to have him in the lines every minute of the day somervile smiled of course major joynson made to rise i do have a thought added somervile appearing to be turning over an idea your object is principally to remove our friend from the garrison for a time not from his troop the latter to my mind would be desirable but yes the principal object is to distance him from the garrison the brigadier especially well an opportunity arises i am to leave calcutta next week for chittagong i shall be there some months possibly i see no reason why i should not apply for a troop of cavalry to accompany me that would be capital said joynson much animated by the proposition indeed i believe it might be altogether better than his taking leave for the change of air would serve his troop well too yes apply do i shall speak with sir ivo the minute he returns three days later hervey learned of his assignment to chittagong the opportunity to bring his troop to a proper efficiency was at once welcome but he knew also that the talk in stable and canteen and not least in the officers mess would be of being sent away however that would be shortlived tattle he told himself and when they returned they would be ready to take their place on the left of the line are you able to tell me why you are sent to chittagong asked hervey of eyre somervile that evening of course said somervile holding out his glass to be recharged with a very wellchilled champagne lord hastings has asked me to see what can be done with respect to the burmans and arakanese who have fled there hervey thought he detected that somervile was not altogether enthusiastic does that please you somervile shrugged lord hastings is of the opinion that someone must do it lord hastings considers eyre to be his most knowledgeable official added emma hervey could believe it although emma would be loyal to the end she was no mere distaff in madras somervile had been wholly absorbed by the language and manners of the native peoples as fluent in tamil as he was in telinga which hervey understood had by no means been the rule in the company for some years but madras and burma were very distant from each other is this oxford learning again for you never said you had been in those parts not even oxford replied somervile nodding to the khansamah whose appearance signalled that dinner was ready when i came here to calcutta no one seemed to know anything of the situation in the east so wholly absorbed were they by the extirpation of the pindarees but the outcome of that campaign was wholly foregone so i began a study of the eastern question which seems to me indeed to be very grave would you tell me of it somervile said he would and long and serpentine would that account be occupying the five courses of dinner and ending only with the second circulation of the port hervey was appalled and thrilled by turns when he returned to his quarters at that time of night but an hours drive he was so animated by what somervile had told him that he set pen to paper at once fort william calcutta via the hnble e india co leadenhall street london june my dear dan the month since i wrote to you has been of very mixed fortunes which i shall forbear to relate in any detail since they shall like as not seem petty and inconsequential with the passing of time it is now so excessively hot here that i feel i am melting away although i think i recall its being hotter in madras and the old company hands say that it is nothing compared with dehli and will in any event get hotter as july proceeds until the monsoon restores our comfort at least for a little while each day mourning for the late king has now ended although we observed it strictly all our duties of course continued there is here a good deal of speculation and general gossip as to what shall now obtain for besides the question of queen carolines position it is much rumoured here that king george is in a very bad way with dropsy and that we shall soon have king frederick who would of course be exceedingly popular with the army as well as the navy do write with the countys opinion dan so far as you can tell it my purpose in this letter however is to inform you of a further though temporary change of station a few days ago i was instructed by my colonel to accompany mr eyre somervile to the east of the country abutting the kingdom of ava and there to bring my troop to a state of efficiency apart from the distractions of this station which are too many you will no doubt recall my telling you of mr somervile and also of his wife the sister of philip lucie with all of whom i spent such eventful days in madras in the three years which have passed since my leaving it seems the governorgeneral lord hastings has taken the most vigorous and concerted measures to destroy the pindaree menace and there is now such peace in the whole land of india as has never before been this much is certain that whatever is said at home about the iniquities of the companys policy here the consequence for the meanest ryot as the peasant farmer is called is a freedom from the ravages of the bandits to which he has been too long a prey everyone says that there should be a peace for a decade or more in the interior at least but there are still those who would take advantage from their positions beyond the companys borders or its dominions and one such is the king of ava whose brutish regimen has driven very many thousands of the people of that land to seek the protection of the company in its territory along the coast east of the mouth of the great ganges these people in their turn have sometimes carried out raids into the kings territory and there has been a deal of resentment on the part of the avan or burman king as some have it bagyidaw a proud as well as cruel man lately he has sent letters to the king of assam and to lord hastings demanding that all those who fled from ava be returned lord hastings is not of course minded to comply with such a demand mr somervile is therefore to proceed to chittagong to see what may be done to stop the raids by the dispossessed burmans and to ease generally the discord which obtains there i have no great wish to be separated from the regiment at this time but they have their duties in connection with the various treaties which are being concluded with the country powers in the wake of the pindaree war and i do not suppose that it will be longer than six months before mr somerviles mission is accomplished as well as mine and my troop shall then be able to take its place in the line alongside the others for the season of the winter manoeuvres the journey is all by sea but it should be accomplished without trouble since chittagong is not greatly more than two hundred miles by coastal water and we shall have the advantage of two steamdriven vessels to tow the transports if winds are unfavourable which of course they may well be in this season the more he wrote the fewer were his misgivings about leaving calcutta the country about chittagong sounded ideal for his purpose and somerviles mission would be instructive to observe he penned a few more paragraphs soldiers gossip of which daniel coates never tired and closed by promising to write from his new station chapter sixteen the edge of the sword the cavalry lines chittagong october serjeant collins stood properly at ease facing the dozen dragoons of the first class he wore forage cap coat fully buttoned overalls and swordbelt the dragoons were in watering order overalls shirt but no coat and no hat but they too wore swords it was more than a year since they had taken the shilling and yet today was their first sword exercise hervey had tried to arrange for it aboard ship from england but it had been a perilous business soon abandoned in favour of carbine and smallarms drill class atten shun bawled local lancecorporal mccarthy a dozen pairs of boots closed together corporal mccarthy marched up to serjeant collins halted and with only slightly diminished volume announced there are twelve men on parade awaiting instruction serjeant officer on parade corporal rasped collins now himself at attention corporal mccarthy glanced left to the corner of the square where he saw his troopleader and serjeantmajor watching and a lady too sor there are twelve men on parade awaiting instruction sor collins nodded fall in corporal mccarthy turned to his right paused to a silent count of three instead of a salute the hatless salute had ceased to be the regimental practice then took his place as flugelman on the right of the dragoons serjeant collins surveyed the class right he began as he walked the length of the line you have been chosen as the first class because captain hervey has observed that you have made the most progress at riding school corporal mccarthy would not have recognized the accolade in his own case shepherd stent would not have thought himself worthy of any but the first class private rudd would write home proudly to inform his mother jobie wainwright was relieved only that spreadbury parkin and needham the warminster pals were in the class too french his dark curls as thick as a sheepskin was the best of riding school as everyone acknowledged harkness his broad shoulders occupying the space of one and a half of the smaller dragoons had found sitting to the trot a great trial to begin with but had mastered it in the end and had lately become a true proficient especially at the gallop the remaining four had shown steady application right said collins again as he retook his place in front of the class stand at ease stand easy listen attentively there are only six ways of directing the edge of the sabre the action of the wrist and shoulder alone directs the blade and they admit but six movements from which every cut is derived wherever may be its particular application to the body hervey found his thoughts returning to the first time he had heard the words as a young cornet at the canterbury depot of the six cuts four are made in diagonal directions and two horizontally the whole are equally applicable against cavalry and may be directed on either side of the horse but their application must depend on the openings given by the adversary and be regulated by judgement and experience in the use of the weapon any questions there were none right then how many ways are there of directing the edge of the blade collins paused for a few seconds stent six sir said the shepherd coming to attention correct of the six cuts how many may be directed on either side of the horse another pause wainwright the whole sir jobie replied feet together correct i shall proceed then now to make a cut with effect and at the same time without exposing the person there are two points which principally demand attention the first is to acquire a facility in giving motion to the arm by means of the wrist and shoulder without bending the elbow for in bending the elbow the sword arm is exposed a circumstance of which the opponent will ever be ready to take his advantage collins drew his sword demonstrated the points which demanded attention then glanced up and down the line is that understood yes sir came the reply you dont sound so sure is that understood yes sir bellowed the class very well he growled returning the sword to the position of rest on his shoulder the next object is to attain correctness in applying the edge in the direction of the blade otherwise it will turn in the hand and as in that case the flat part must receive the whole force of the blow it will in all likelihood be shivered to pieces hervey turned to armstrong a long time coming but i think we may soon have it accomplished we can begin the second class in a week and the third a week after ay sir theres nobody better than collins for this emma somervile was still watching intently you say it is straight from the manual of sword exercises captain hervey but your serjeant makes it sound as if it very much comes from the heart that too madam collins once engaged a french colonel in a most ferocious duel in sight of hundreds on both sides and overcame him by superior swordsmanship though the colonel a count as i recall must have been very practised in the art from an early age he thought it unnecessary to declare that the deciding blow had been a cut to the frenchmans head which had cleft his skull in two with your leave then sir said armstrong stepping back yes thank you sarntmajor i shall attend at stables armstrong saluted and strode away do we watch any more asked emma sounding eager if you wish said hervey willing to oblige her but i had rather not watch for too long it will only distract them in that case said emma let us take a turn about the civil lines i like to see the gardens at this time of a day when there is no one about this was the time when shutters were closed affording the occupants their privacy before callers for tea and then the long evening of dinner and cards it was by no means too hot to be abroad as the sword class hatless demonstrated but the customs were observed nevertheless chittagong was nothing compared with calcutta in the extent and magnificence of her buildings wood as well as or in some cases instead of stone was more in evidence and her civil as well as military garrison was but a fraction of that of the capital of the bengal presidency but it had a healthier climate all agreed and was a pleasant enough place to serve on temporary duty there is a big blacknecked stork which sits on my roof sometimes of an afternoon said hervey as they came to his bungalow but evidently not today emma was intent on the little garden at the front i envy you the tamarisks the pink is so naturally pretty my pots are full of things but they look as though theyre the work of a paintbrush hervey stopped held up a hand to bid emma to do likewise and pointed to the fence post a dozen feet away emma just saw the orange spots before the object of their attention scurried off along the rail and down the further post into the scrub grass yes i think it the same as we have in our bathroom the colours here are so much more vivid than the madras geckos i wonder why it might be must there be a reason god surely has a purpose in creation matthew yes i suppose he had not before imagined it extended to such details there is a most interesting theory about it all eyre was speaking of it only last week there is a naturalist called lamarck a frenchman eyre has collected all his work he suggests that living things adapt to their surroundings and then pass on the changes to successive generations how do they do that emma smiled broadly in the usual way i suppose hervey looked somewhat abashed in what way does he suggest an animals surroundings exert an influence his exemplar is the giraffe which lengthened its neck over successive generations through its habit of grazing the tops of trees hervey frowned i had imagined that it grazed the tops of trees because it had a long neck he replied not altogether facetiously we pass on characteristics of our own family do we not herveys home thoughts in that instant told him it was so and painfully he almost checked in his stride emma did not appear to notice ask eyre to show you his books when you come to dine with us tonight you are able still to come yes yes indeed he replied a shade absently but i beg you would forgive me if i leave earlier than usual i have letters which i must finish if theyre to go to calcutta tomorrow theres a packet for england at the end of the week of course said emma brushing away a persistent dragonfly now i must show you the aviary the collector here has built you will not have seen it i think when hervey wrote home that night there was an unusual degree of contentment in his letters chittagong may have been restricted in its society but that which there was was entirely agreeable to him he liked the country with its wooded hills within an easy days ride and the climate was very equable its people both country and city seemed contented and there was not the clamour of calcutta and certainly not the stench above all his troop was making progress the horses were in better condition than before and the dragoons seats were becoming altogether securer in sum hervey was confident that by the beginning of december they would be ready to rejoin the regiment as the manual had it fully trained in the weeks that followed serjeant collins worked tirelessly to have each class in turn master the six cuts and eight guards against cavalry and too the point and the cut and guard against infantry he drove them hard and they cursed him when they got to their beds but collins had many a time had to parry a sword and wield his own with deathly intent and he had seen what happened when a man lost his nerve or misjudged his distance and bent his elbow it would be over in an instant the cut disabling the sword arm like the serpents strike and the mortifying edge following when a man had seen his fellows or even his antagonists fall because of their unproficiency he was not inclined to stint his charges in their instruction and when the dragoons were not at stables or skill at arms they were at troop drill every day but sunday when they paraded for church they rode out onto the wide flood plain of the karnaphuli and manoeuvred to the bugle so it was that one morning in early november hervey recognized that before him was a handy troop not a recruit ride very well sarntmajor well have one last turn trumpeter sound front form line private storrs breathed a sigh of relief it was perhaps the easiest of all the calls nine notes all the same gs only the triplets at the end to worry about he had blown so much in the last two hours and his lips were cracking he blew the call perfectly into line the forty and more dragoons trotted then halted on the marker hervey nodded contentedly he could not have asked better of them private storrs turned his head towards him expecting to hear that his troopleader would ride to the front to dismiss the parade trumpeter sound retire a moments surprise delayed the call a fraction of a second retire was tricky storrs cracked the last e semiquaver hervey hardly noticed and certainly didnt show it the troop turned about as one and struck off at the walk in a very fair line but storrs knew what to expect next although the heat of the summer had long gone and the dust with it his mouth was still dry he began slaking it with all the spittle he could summon trumpeter sound front demisemiquavers this time but no repeats storrs just managed it the troop fronted with only the merest hesitation here and there and dressed quickly hervey smiled that will do very nicely sarntmajor he rose in the saddle and looked down the line yes it would do very nicely indeed he could now dismiss them fall out the officers carry on sarntmajor armstrong saluted and hervey turned his horse away followed at the regulation one length by trumpeter storrs seton canning trotted up his face a picture of satisfaction to equal his captains my god hervey but that was fine i wouldnt have thought it possible even a month ago theres a long way to run yet harry we could scarcely call this a field day herveys smile however said that perhaps it might not be too hard a race we have another month perhaps two it should be enough if we can keep up this progress they needed a day or two for making and mending though for interior economy as it was known in the sixth hervey would give over the rest of the week to the saddler and farriers it would be good for seton canning to have the charge of things too there were ever more letters to attend to and he felt the need of a break from the routine of the troop from the cantonment indeed perhaps he could persuade somervile to ride with him along the coast it was by all accounts an easy country of sand dunes scrub and salt jheels a haven for greenshank and tattlers and for spoonbills when the tide was high on the forests edge there was plenty of game tigers were not unknown his bearer had told him their guns would not be idle johnson came out of the stables at the sound of hooves on the hard ground he wore no hat for the sun had lost its strength but his stable jacket made up from stonecoloured local cloth was stained with the signs of his exertions with body brush and curry comb parade all right capn ervey there was no one else within earshot now hervey could speak his mind very well johnson very well indeed by the time were relieved id pit the troop against the others any day ttroops appy ere sir an its not as sticky an theres not so many sick reckon theyd be glad if we stayed a bit longer johnsons report was not surprising detached duty was always preferred the eyes of the troop serjeantmajor were one thing but those of mr lincoln were another we need to do some regimental drill we cant call ourselves a real troop until we can manoeuvre in squadrons thought yer said all that was done for now sir not the business of working as a regiment what i meant was that the drill book needs rewriting theres not enough about work other than in close order and the evolutions just arent quick enough not for welltrained squadrons that is it will do us very well for a fair while yet though ell need shoein soon said johnson content that drill matters would never be his concern again and nodding to gilberts forefeet im going to take leave for the next two days i thought id ride along the coast towards manikpur and take my gun do you want to come you can bring your mongoose hervey vaulted from the saddle and handed over the reins johnson made a snorting noise useless bloody thing that ferret i ad in orningsham wouldve put up a better show an e were next to useless an all hervey took off his cap and frowned i havent an idea what youre talking of that mongoose that i paid two rupees for yes that much i understood what is its problem its frightened o snakes hervey could hardly blame the animal improbable though the idea of a mongoose afraid of snakes sounded nonsense they fight cobras dont they well thats what we all thought an so alf a dozen clubbed together an bought one an put im in one o tstalls an when we put tmongoose in e saw tsnake an shot straight out through an ole in twall hervey had to laugh cant you get your money back for the mongoose ive tried already but i cant find im as selled it me and what about the snake ay well we caught im and selled im to somebody else an made a rupee on it i wonder you couldnt have made more suggested hervey smiling quizzically now a snake that can see off a mongoose must be something of a curiosity i didnt think o that replied johnson sounding vexed so shall you come with or without the mongoose johnson nodded still frowning at having missed a trick good well i shall take a bath and then pay a call on the rissalahs officer and then i shall dine with the somerviles ill send word about tomorrow not too early a start the bhistis had drawn his bath before he could take off his boots after four months they had the routine timed to perfection a boy kept watch on the exercise ground and as soon as he saw the serjeantmajor salute and take over the parade he would run back to herveys bungalow to alert the bhistis they would draw off water from the copper boiler fired before dawn and fill the big tin bath to a line which allowed the sahib to get his shoulders under water without displacing any over the side hervey still looked about and checked before committing himself to the bathroom as the old india hands warned and as he had done in madras but now with diminished expectation of finding anything he had concluded that the things that creepeth upon the earth heard him coming and preferred other company he took his bath more content than he could recall in a long time he bade his bearer wait outside as usual and poured water over his head with a big conch shell half a dozen times he languished longer than was his custom enjoying a soak so well earned and with an afternoon free of duties he called to his bearer in another five minutes just as the water was beginning to lose its heat and the wiry little bengali brought him towels and then his dressing gown if deadly danger were always close at hand here the pleasures were real nonetheless perhaps even more so because of it once dry he sat down in the cane armchair from which he always had so pleasant a view of the country beyond the lines took his glass of freshmade nimbu pani which would take the skin from his teeth at first sip but revive him even better than brandy and dismissed the bearer for an hour he had not written to daniel coates since coming here he could do so now with real pride having turned three dozen raw recruits and as many unpromising native remounts into a troop which was steady and exact on parade next week they would begin on scouting and picket duties and then from nowhere came tears he had no one to share his triumph with but a sheet of paper and the words would not be addressed to henrietta he did nothing to fight back the tears for they made him feel a little closer to her it was all he would ever have the tears just ran no sobs and when they were finished he felt the better for them something told him they would not come again he picked up his telescope to watch a kite hunting the plain beyond the civil lines and he studied it intently for several minutes it was curious he mused how he wished luck to the bird rather than to its prey hervey went early to the somerviles he and they had no definite time of meeting they dined together several times each week the evening was cool and the air fresh a light breeze having blown off the sea for most of the afternoon there was no one about so he sat outside facing west the bungalow being verandahed on all sides in an hour he could watch the sun fall into the mouths of the ganges it seemed and listen as the night noises replaced the cicadas a khitmagar brought him champagne the glass misted he did not at first sip it intent as he was on a flock of hoopoes grubbing at the far end of the somerviles shortmown lawn the birds were at ease their crests down almost tame pretty birds henrietta would have liked them it was a happy thought hervey came somerviles voice behind him enough almost to make the hoopoes take flight by heavens im glad to see you what a perfectly appalling day its been i dont know whether im more angry with my fellow countrymen or with that damned barbarian over the hill that damned barbarian over the hill as somervile was wont to call the king of ava had been so frequent a topic of their conversation that hervey supposed the latest complaint to be routine the other sounded much more interesting what have your fellow countrymen done to offend you not me nothing to offend me theyve offended against every decent principle thats all hervey raised an eyebrow two indigoplanters from just this side of bangamah two brothers flogging ryots putting them in irons and the same with their wives and then of all things parading them through the district sitting astride donkeys looking arseend putting them in fear of their lives is it pertinent to ask why oh for some indolence or other but i shant have it the magistrate up there says the villagers refused to proceed against them at the trial theyre so terrified of them but that theres enough evidence notwithstanding i shall send them to calcutta to stand trial and i shall recommend they be expelled hervey was not surprised by the strength of somerviles opinion many a time in madras he had railed against the new breed which saw indians as somehow inferior undeserving of either justice compassion or simple respect what becomes of people here they think their christian religion elevates them somervile sighed but we have had this out many times before you and me he pulled a bell rope for the khitmagar he hated the practice of clapping or shouting bring the captain and me a bottle of champagne please rama he said in confident bengali ill sit with you a while hervey and then have my bath ill not trouble you with the burman affair as you please said hervey with a wry smile king bagyidaw was tiresome in his demands in every respect the khitmagar returned with a wine cooler poured somervile his champagne replenished herveys glass and then retired to the end of the verandah somervile took a good measure breathed deep and pushed his legs out straight last case lets hope theres more on next weeks packet how was your day very satisfactory i could report the troop ready for review i thought to take a couple of days leave to ride down towards manikpur seton canning says theres bustard there somervile emptied his glass and the khitmagar advanced at once to fill it halfsize bustard yes the bengal florican to give it its proper name black front and head dozy birds not much sport in them but good to eat i thought you might like to come too somervile sighed again i should like that very much but not until i have a better sense of what bagyidaw is up to emma will go with you take the man from the rissalah as well hes decent enough company hes bedded down well then take emma by herself im not sure that would look proper proper be damned why dont i wait a few more days until your burman business is resolved if you can yes that would be much the better i owe manikpur a visit in any case that decided on they returned to ornithology and the behaviour of the hoopoes but at length and after a third glass of champagne somervile changed his tack suddenly you know hervey it isnt right that a man lives as a monk hervey made to speak but somervile raised a hand no hear me im talking only of the primary urges the want for comfort nothing more permanent hervey we all had our bibis i dont mean something dirty from the feringhee bazaar here some decent girl in the paterghatta that you can talk to with a bit of portuguese in the blood send word to my babu he knows everything and hes discreet hed never breathe a word not even to me hervey made to speak a second time but somervile turned and beckoned the khitmagar one more glass and then my bath i say look at that night heron night herons were hardly so remarkable hervey understood the cipher at dinner the conversation soon turned to king bagyidaw emma had read her husbands evening despatch before joining them the problem is it seems to me that the king has some cause for exasperation she began it is not many years since that we permitted hostile acts from company territory hostile acts by those dispossessed of their own soil in arakan countered somervile hostile acts nevertheless my dear we cannot escape the consequences if we permit it that much is true he conceded refastening a persistent button on his straining waistcoat but it was five years ago at least and since then there has hardly been raiding on a great scale nothing certainly to threaten the crown indeed we have almost recognized bagyidaws suzerainty in arakan but he will demand that we surrender the mughs the arakan refugees and that lord hastings has made clear we could never do i am surprised it has not come to a fight long since said hervey glancing at emma to know her opinion she raised her eyebrows as much as to say she agreed the candles though many and bright still could not light her face fully so thoroughly bronzed was it by the sun more so than she would have permitted in calcutta even not for the first time hervey envied somervile his fortune in the constant company of so intelligent and handsome a woman it almost did said somervile hervey blinked im sorry i said it almost did eight years ago the late lord minto in his last year as governorgeneral put a scheme to the court of directors in london to make a punitive war on the court of ava but that was hardly the best of times and the government opposed it i cant but feel that it might have spared us loss of blood in the long run and certainly a great deal of native blood of one sort or another you think it will come to a fight eyre somervile paused for a second or so there is a restlessness about bagyidaw he marched into manipur last year because the rajah didnt pay homage quickly enough and i still believe he would have gone on into cachar had we not sent a force there and taken the place under protection that was eyres doing matthew explained emma proudly he pressed lord hastings to it very forcefully for the governorgeneral was yet preoccupied with the pindaree campaign the trouble is continued somervile that such preemption shall we call it if successful invariably brings questions as to its necessity in the first place i made some enemies in calcutta why was cachar important to the company you mean besides the moral duty of standing by a neighbour i stand rebuked but who is my neighbour in the companys terms somervile smiled youre quite right we cannot stand against each and every outrage the truth is that from cachar bagyidaw would have been well placed to attack through the river plains into the companys territory we would have stopped him of course but not before hed had a fair run at dacca probably and was it really likely that he would have invaded you of all men should know that capability often spawns ambition there was no disputing it hervey nodded im not sure youre answering my question about its coming to a fight eyre protested emma isnt this fish good by the way it is my dear and i was what i intended saying was that i believe he will move against assam first and if he is successful there chittagong will appear so much like a salient in his empire that it will then come to a fight that is a very ill appreciation eyre i trust there will be a frigate to take us off at once somervile laid his forks together and finished his glass of chablis truly my dear an excellent piece of fish shall i make a prediction in two years unless assam seeks subsidiary status of the company the kingdom will be annexed and then bagyidaw will give the company an ultimatum which of course we shall decline and will then attack chittagong where he will be defeated said hervey oh yes but not at once we shall have to move half the army of bengal across the bay to evict him what do you advocate then somervile smiled thinly the minto medicine unlike many i do not rate the burmans so highly when it comes to fighting they can be brave yes but theres more to it than that as i dont need to tell you theyre so supremely arrogant that a blow at their vitals would stun them they have a good general in mahâ bundula that i grant you though not a great one as his name suggests in hindoostani but rangoon their principal port is vulnerable and so is ava for its up a very sluggish river albeit quite a long way up hervey was impressed as ever by the thought which somervile had so evidently invested in his eastern question nothing the lieutenantgovernor said was in itself remarkable perhaps rather was it his masterly uncoiling of the serpentine factors in the appreciation of native affairs he immersed himself in language and manners and then applied the universal impulses of human conduct both base and noble and saw what others did not of course such men were not the easiest of associates in the councils of the honourable east india company have you spoken with the military authorities of this tried hervey uneasily somervile was very temperate in his reply sir edward paget profoundly disagrees with me he believes we should fortify our borders and take no offensive action hervey took a deep breath the commanderinchief was a fighting general of the peninsula what is his principal objection that the country would kill an army without the burmans needing to fire a shot hervey shuddered at the thought shall we have our partridge now eyre said emma thinking the conversation had reached as far as it should hervey looked across at her somervile was indeed a fortunate man when they had finished the perfumed curds and candied sweets which the cook had laboured over for a good part of the day emma rose and said she would retire good night matthew let us hope that eyre will find the time soon so that we may ride to manikpur she stood on her toes and kissed her husbands forehead not too long my dear and she drew her fingers lightly down his arm a gesture of intimacy which jerked deep at herveys vitals they remained at table for perhaps a quarter of an hour after emma had gone somervile declined more port unusually and changed subject three or four times almost distractedly at length he put down his glass and stood hervey my dear fellow you must excuse me i have not the appetite for our usual diversions this evening stay though take some more of this port its a deuced fine vintage and theres plenty laid down and there are newspapers from calcutta there too he said gesturing towards the drawing room do not trouble in the slightest somervile its exceedingly good of you both to extend such frequent hospitality to me retire do my days been easy compared with the affairs you must address yourself to ay perhaps well then ill bid you good night until tomorrow evening somervile took his leave brushing the crumbs from his waistcoat hervey let the khitmagar pour him more port and then went to find the calcutta papers he saw half a dozen of the journal on a sideboard and settled himself into a low comfortable armchair by an empty fireplace he sipped appreciatively at his wine as he turned the pages of the most recent a week old but he could find nothing to detain him he reached for another and found the same perhaps there truly was nothing of moment mere gossip only but perhaps his attention was not to be had for the persistent image of somervile going to emma his friends contentment the very reverse of his own agitation he put down the paper and the glass it was the comfort of the embrace he missed as much as anything he got up he could not decently remain there next day he sent a note of thanks to the somerviles as he had on every occasion he had dined with them but this time he also sent a note for the babu in english for it was not long and its content was straightforward within the hour a note came back saying that a boy would meet him at the suhrawardi gate at three oclock hervey would have preferred the evening of course but he would then have had to make his excuses with the somerviles he bathed and then dressed inconspicuously as if intent on a buying visit to the bazaar and slipped away from his bungalow unobserved except for the chowkidar who made low namaste but did not speak in less than half an hour hervey reached the suhrawardi gate and met the boy it was the sleeping time and the paterghatta was uncrowded he felt awkward but no one seemed to take any notice as they walked purposefully through the gate and along drowsy streets to a house like any other distinguished only by a blue door the boy pushed it open and gestured him on hervey gave him a few annas and muttered a thankyou inside seemed dark after the bright sun an old woman appeared from behind a painted screen looked at him and then beckoned to a young woman to come from behind it even in the dimness hervey could see she was as promised a handsome girl clean and shapely and he could see what she was not nothing which recalled henrietta the only thing he had really feared they sat awhile drinking tea speaking a little english and even less bengali when there was nothing more to say they rose and she led him up rickety stairs to a small room with white walls long muslin curtains at the shuttered windows and a bed with clean white linen her skin was lighter than the madrasi girls he had so admired but her eyes were darker and they were big she was perhaps twenty he said nothing though his heart hammered and she likewise made not a sound with a modesty that only increased his desire she began taking the slides from her hair chapter seventeen rumours of war next day hervey stood at the front of his bungalow taking in the glories of another bengal daybreak fuller in promise perhaps than any he had known elsewhere a sun low but already warming a mist in the distant hills the civil lines coming slowly to life there were gentlemen at home in england he considered whose crabbed lives would be made immeasurably the better for just one of these mornings he felt better than he had expected to maybe the guilt would come later the girl had been tender to him and for a while he had not been quite so alone he wondered how long the feeling would last how long it would be until he had to renew it and whether guilt would overtake it before then mornin capn ervey sir hervey returned johnsons salute and took the reins from him he sprang easily into the saddle compensating for gilberts habitual sidestep as he did so and collected him onto the bit how good it was to be able to ride with a simple snaffle for relaxed though the regimental regime was in comparison with its predecessor a bridoon was still the regulation i thought wed ride over to see skinners horse at exercise i heard they were tentpegging this morning before johnson could reply the orderly serjeant hailed them from across the maidan captain hervey sir there was just a note of urgency in it corporal mossop was doubling but that said nothing an nco would not keep an officer waiting on any account nothing serious i hope corporal mossop said hervey with a smile as the orderly serjeant came to a halt before him not that im aware of sir mr somervile sends his compliments sir and asks if you would call on him at once serious or not it was clearly urgent very well corporal mossop thank you come on johnson wed better see what agitates the lieutenantgovernor somervile did not so much look agitated as troubled come in hervey come in he said hardly looking up from his desk as he wrote take a seat call for some coffee ill be finished in a moment hervey did as he was bid there was no sign of emma just the babu and a bearer when the coffee came he took his cup and asked somervile if he wanted any no later perhaps he replied briskly waving a sheet of paper about when the ink was dry he gathered up the other two sheets and put them unfolded into a large envelope which he sealed with wax and placed in a leather despatch case locking it with a key attached to his watch chain the hircarrah mohan he should still be in the cantonments he said simply handing the case to the babu then he rose dismissed the bearer and moved to the other side of the table to sit in the armchair next to hervey i take it that somethings amiss somervile shook his head and raised his eyebrows i can scarcely believe it bagyidaw must be insane hes marched into cachar somervile shook his head again no hes making threats against here hes sent a letter to the governorgeneral demanding we send back all the arakanese who have fled into east bengal and it seems laying some sort of claim to sovereignty sovereignty in chittagong yes i had a despatch from calcutta in the early hours by governorgenerals messenger hes taking back my assessment i just dont understand why bagyidaw sees it opportune now to make such threats assam ought next to be his objective as i said last night do you think hes testing the companys resolve then that is what ive suggested to calcutta although we cant proceed on such a supposition alone ive asked for a brigade at once we must at least make a show yes said hervey standing up and going to the map on the wall that much would serve both needs where should they best go i was going to ask your opinion of that replied somervile frowning hervey was a little taken aback my purlieus these past months have been the exercise ground i could only hazard an opinion from the map my own knowledge is not extensive hervey and your opinion from a map will be better than mine hervey returned to his chair do we know anything of burman dispositions or their equipment and how they fight i dont believe my office does no but the arakanese will it goes against the intent of my own mission here but we shall have to enlist their support at least their intelligence i wish their chin payan were still alive for all the trouble he gave us how long do you suppose it will take for calcutta to despatch a brigade ive asked for immediate advice in that respect i have a fear it will not be as prompt as is necessary theres no standing force in east bengal at present as far as i know theyre all deployed hervey had thought it might be the case he knew his own brigade would be in the field still colonel piven will be back next week thats something he has a very good knowledge of the frontiers that much is certain he would have an idea about where to strengthen our patrols i suppose somervile sighed what i need is two brigades of cavalry and horse artillery if we surprised the burmans with a prodigious amount of fire we might well drive them back hervey nodded that relies on very fine intelligence we were humbugged at waterloo and that was with some of the best officers at work we had better make a start then ill send word for the leaders of the arakanese here in the city to come at once and the more distant ones we shall have to see as they show let us meet here again at noon johnson waved his hand violently across his face bastard flies these are worse than them in madras hervey agreed what their provenance was he could not conclude there was not a living thing in miles on this plain lets trot again he sighed perhaps theyll give up this time they had come a good way from the lines but it had been worth it to see the sowars of colonel skinners regiment of siladar cavalry their skill with the lance was breathtaking equalled only by their horsemanship both johnson and hervey admitted they had never seen the like but they had been paying the price since with the flies this time however the flies were evidently more tired than the horses falling away after the second furlong hervey pressed on for a third and then pulled up to a walk five minutes later they were still without their tormentors so he presumed they could walk the remainder of the way in peace and peaceful the land looked to be at this hour the hills to the east were still shrouded with the mornings mist it was hemanto herveys bearer had told him the misty season and the country looked even greener than in the days that followed the august deluges an unruly flight of brahminy duck passed high overhead their funny clanging call seeming to protest against the intrusion johnson was pleased to be able to resume the earlier conversation and so this ere king baggydrawers reckons wed just give im tcountry an go ome thats about the long and the short of it said hervey not imagining there was any point insisting on respectful pronunciation and mr somervile says that bagyidaw would not stop until he reached calcutta ows e think ed get across all them rivers i think hed go by sea they have a lot of war barges apparently e wants tipping a settler thats what e wants just so johnson but how theres the rub fore es art o is pit mutual comprehension was by now a matter of context rather than knowledge of vocabulary especially since johnson when aroused to indignation reverted to a particularly impenetrable strain of sheffield yes but how shall you find the pit youre right though mr somervile says that the governorgeneral a few years ago wanted to do just that march into burma and teach them a lesson not that bagyidaw was king at that time daft name mebbe if is men knew what it meant theyd pack it all in hervey smiled i think they would be parted from their heads first hes a very brutal man it seems sounds as if theyd be pleased if we did knock im abaht a bit perhaps anyway we might get to know a bit more from these arakanese in an hour or so he checked his watch come on wed better not dawdle all about eyre somerviles study were papers and ledgers boxes and maps did you have an agreeable ride he asked without looking up hervey felt rather guilty yes i watched the native horse at drill they go very well mm was the reply what has engaged you the bengal secret and political consultations and they would have engaged far less of my time had they a proper index i found what i was looking for by a most circular exercise in volume ninetyone no less hervey had learned to tread gently when somervile was in his scholarly frame of mind as he thought of it may i ask what were you searching for after you had gone this morning i remembered that lord wellesley had sent an officer to ava to treaty with the then king bodawpaya bagyidaws grandfather a colonel symes it was and it occurred to me that his reports must include some military assessments and so i have been searching them out and do they contain that information in admirable detail you must read him the papers are on yonder table he gestured without looking up again hervey turned but at that moment somervile looked up and took off his spectacles you know the real danger is these war boats there are five hundred of them every town or village near the rivers has to supply a certain number of oarsmen and soldiers a hundred or so for each boat and they mount a gun in the bows these could swarm on chittagong and calcutta for that matter and thered be the very devil of a fight hervey made rapid calculations the results were indeed ominous then the answer would be to destroy the boats before they discharged their cargo but that too might be easier said than done though i dare say commodore peto would know how somervile raised an eyebrow i have a sense that we shall feel his want very keenly before too long he took out his watch let us go and see who of the arakanese is come there were a dozen of them men who hitherto had been regarded as at best troublesome and at worst practitioners of dacoity now they all sat in the lieutenantgovernors audience room as if they were waiting for a wedding i have called you here today began somervile in confident bengali to ask you for information on the activities of the burmans there was at once a hubbub with keen looks of anticipation on the faces of the arakanese somervile halted it magisterially i must warn you however that this does not mean we are contemplating any hostilities it is simply that the company in calcutta wishes to know what movements in general are there none of the arakanese looked convinced but that suited somervile he wanted their help and it would be the more vigorous for believing that the fight might be taken to their old enemy he pointed to the map several times as he elaborated on his requirements unsure as to its usefulness in that company but the place names he mentioned especially the rivers brought eager nods at length he promised them the company would meet all reasonable expenses but i must warn you that the company cannot extend any protection and i will not condone any offensive action whatever indeed i shall deal with it with infinitely greater severity than hitherto this latter was unwelcome news but the manifest disappointment was soon replaced by enthusiasm for the covert action to come and the meeting was ended with somervile shaking each of the arakanese by the hand and bidding them khuda hafiz and expressing his hope that he would see them again soon abar dekahobe when they were gone he asked hervey for his opinion hervey smiled he had understood barely a word id wager those men will bring you your intelligence and severed heads too to prove their word somervile nodded and frowned that is my fear i wanted them keen but i warned them there was to be no dacoity hervey nodded as well what shall you do now there is nothing more to do ive sent word to the town major telling him to put the border patrols on alert such as there are he ought just about to manage that any more and i should have little confidence hervey sighed he is certainly past his prime hes close to his military dotage they both smiled ive heard tell there are seven ages of the military man said hervey i believe we might examine such a theory but let us do so at table i think that emma will be eager to hear of the mornings work when hervey returned to his quarters in the afternoon he found letters from england carried from calcutta by the same packet as the governorgenerals messenger he settled to read them at once they were filled with good news and much cheer his infant daughter was strong and healthy and showed spirit and intelligence elizabeth likewise enjoyed excellent health and uncommon contentment his father and mother it seemed were more active than ever there were no reports of depredations by the squatters of warminster common nor of violence by the hindon luddites nor of pestilence in the town workhouse nor any of a dozen things which periodically threatened the repose of the honest citizens of the neighbourhood there were not even malevolent clerics and yet these letters brought about so palpable a dejection that even private johnson would be moved to remark on it for there was no henrietta in their pages and nor could there ever be of course the finality of it was never more apparent to him than by her absence from these modest records of daily life it tore at his gut like the eagle of shelleys masterwork perhaps more than anything he was dismayed by the suddenness of his descent from sunny spirits to dark discouragement how much he wished to see that villainous poet again if only his hand in a letter he would tell him all even that of which he was half ashamed only half ashamed though for had he not prayed for a year and more for the strength to endure what was his true fault therefore if he could not bear things as he ought he was as close to slipping away to the paterghatta now as he was to falling to his knees but he would not go to the bibi khana neither would he pray he would not even pick up his pen to reply at once to horningsham as had always been his practice for he had not the right to put his own desires first it was not a question of christian morals but of his soldiers duty he had spent the last hours with somervile considering the possibility of war with the burmans there was no other word for it and he had done nothing since with regard to his own troop parttrained though they were there would be calls on them for such skills as they possessed guarding escorting the occasional undemanding patrol perhaps and he might accelerate or in some other way modify his plans for the completion of their training this was what his duty required and he felt wholly ashamed at having to remind himself of it chapter eighteen casus belli four days later hervey drew his sword and brought the pommel to rest on his foreleg the morning sun at his back warmed him in a most comforting way as indeed did the sight before him serjeantmajor armstrong rode up from the centre of the ranks opposite halted and brought his sword upright from the shoulder good morning sir there are nine noncommissioned officers and thirtyeight private men on parade sir hervey returned the salute with a nod of his head thank you serjeantmajor take post please it had been the sixths custom for many years to invite its serjeantmajors to take post on formal parades and many had been the time that the troop captains had done the same in the field as a defiant gesture of composure in the face of the enemy e troop was not in review order this warm november morning but campaign dress for it was their first field day since somerviles alert hervey had worked tirelessly in the troops instruction picket work on the first day patrols and escorts the second and yesterday the crossing of defiles and rivers dry work first in the classroom and then demonstrations dismounted using the ncos to represent parts of the troop or the enemy and buckets ropes and all manner of commissary things to portray the features of the terrain in the afternoons while the troop was at stables hervey had ridden the country to lay out in his mind the course of the field day the culmination of which was to be a crossing of one of the tributaries of the hooghly a stream deep enough to have the horses swim and yet not so wide as to unnerve the unpractised dragoons the river was sluggish and the banks were low making for easy entry and exit they would be lucky to find so accommodating a crossing site on campaign that much was certain he had seen men and horses come to grief in spain in rivers not much trickier than here but it was a start fall in the officers seton canning and vanneck pressed their chargers forward hervey glanced up and down the line he saw dragoons now not recruits here and there he picked out a face and remembered what it had been when first he had seen it he saw french that day in the barracks when they were being sluiced down indignant at armstrongs suggestion that he had enlisted after losing his name he saw harkness at the same parade looking confused when armstrong said he must answer sir though it must not be addressed to him there was mccarthy flugelman his rank restored by virtue of herveys powers as detachment commander but local rank limited and unpaid hervey recalled mccarthys awkwardness when first he had sat astride a horse he saw shepherd stent when first he had come to the bell in warminster a silent brooding wounded man and rudd in that same place smart eager but answerable to his mother in the millinery shop and there were the warminster pals themselves in the squalor of the common wainwright above all a lad to whom others looked for the lead a year had made dragoons of them all but another month and off to his right hervey saw a mounted orderly approaching he nodded to his trumpeter to intercept him the troop will return swords retuuurn swords by the time the drill was complete and they had formed two ranks trumpeter storrs was handing hervey the orderlys message its terse contents startled him come at once to my quarters imperative es mr seton canning if you please his lieutenant raised a small trail of dust as he trotted up sir the formalities were always observed on parade even without earshot of the ranks take the troop out to the exercise ground and put them through skirmishing drill the lieutenantgovernor wants to see me ill join you directly hervey turned without waiting for an acknowledgement and put gilbert into as unhurried a trot as he could manage at the somerviles he found the lieutenantgovernor in his study and still in his dressing gown as hervey came in somerviles look of anxiety turned to one of near relief ive been up since the early hours again i almost sent for you a dozen times i wonder you did not what has happened two reports that is what and notice from calcutta that it will be the best part of two months before the brigade arrives the burmans are assembling a force within reach of the headwaters of the karnaphuli theyll deliver an ultimatum before the month is out and then march on the city splitting the country in two hervey peered at the map lying on somerviles desk this is very precise intelligence it is and ive paid handsomely for it we have a burman fugitive from the court of ava and the intelligence of the force assembling has been corroborated by the chakma tribesmen from the hill tracts what say the arakanese ive heard nothing yet but they wouldnt go into the hill tracts alone you had better ask the town major to take defensive measures then we shall at least know their route i shall summon him shortly what do you think his force can do two battalions of native infantry and guns well sited they might stop five times their number my agent says there will be twelve thousand and war barges with guns then they can do little but inflict losses and delay on them but not i think for two months no nor i ive sent word this very morning to calcutta to hasten the brigade they might at least send them in whatever groups they muster hervey frowned that could be a scheme for losing them piecemeal i doubt the commanderinchief would commit anything less than in battalion strength thats why ive sent for you hervey you shall have to take charge of the defences of this place you have experience of these things and youve seen the way of war here in the east we both agree the town majors a dear enough man but not a match for this hervey narrowed his eyes if rank is the problem i can give you a local colonelcy thats well within my powers no rank is not the problem said hervey shaking his head a kings officer always takes seniority over one of the companys the problems topography the countrys too flat to make defences its only numbers of men men able to manoeuvre that could tell somervile looked dismayed i have to do something hervey hervey did not have to think what that something must be it was in his view obvious to the newest cornet you shall have to forestall the attack somervile looked at him uncertainly we have spoken of it the burmans must be defeated before they can fall on us from those boats before they embark in them indeed somerviles look of astonishment was sufficient truly theres no alternative at last the lieutenantgovernor found his tongue but how in heavens name do you propose we do it i dont know we did something of the same in chintal but that was a madness i thought never to repeat and five years past do you have licence to attack the burmans by the way in their own country i mean i have plenipotentiary powers yes but as far as the company goes we should be licensed ultimately by success hervey frowned my dear somervile we must face the possibility that if we undertook such a thing you are more likely to be arraigned in failure and i courtmartialled somervile sighed hervey i have no wish to prompt you to rashness to any adventure that might bring such a thing to you he scratched his head and called for his bearer no wish at all would you therefore make an assessment a thorough measured affair it might reveal some course we have not imagined it was reasonable in one sense thought hervey but the facts were unpromising and time was not on their side an assessment could only betray how desperate were their straits and that was too evident already his own troop was still scarcely better than halftrained unpractised at least i shall make a very measured assessment he replied and in a tone intended to reassure somervile that he would have his best efforts but directed only towards an attack on those boats with all the promptness to be had somervile though defied looked surprisingly relieved i think i should first like to hear all that there is of the burman force are your agents here yet at four oclock as the suns strength was fast diminishing hervey left his quarters and went to the stables his neck was aching from holding his head too long in the same position as he pored over books manuscripts and maps in order to make his measured assessment somerviles burman agents had not appeared however and so all his calculations were based on a supposition that the scant intelligence of the enemy was accurate this worried him it was one thing to go baldheaded for a rabble of mutineers as he had done in chintal quite another to undertake an expedition against an organized force which was itself preparing an offensive expedition and then there was the problem of the maps he could hardly expect that they would be as faithful as the ordnance sheets with which the most part of england was served nor even the military surveys of bonapartes legions which had tramped over the best part of the continent however those with which he was obliged to make his assessment were sketchy in the extreme its the rivers which give me the greatest trouble confided hervey as armstrong listened to the summary of the appreciation there are too many of them and theyre too unpredictable armstrong shifted his weight on the sack of gram pushed his legs out straight and reached into his pocket for his pipe rivers are rivers arent they to another the remark might have meant nothing to hervey who had consulted many maps and negotiated many rivers in armstrongs company there was no need of elaboration not here by all accounts ive been reading the natural history of the country and strange it is too only thirty years ago the jamuna shifted its course a full fifty miles armstrong was not overawed but if these burmans is coming down a river to attack then they must know where it leads and in that case we just hunt the heel line thats what youd call it isnt it hervey smiled armstrong had never followed hounds but he had always studied his officers pastimes to advantage we need guides though and from what mr somervile says they dont much travel in these parts ive yet to see these burman agents who brought him the intelligence they ought to have some idea of the country between here and there even if theyve not seen the assembly area for themselves ive always distrusted guides ever since that time in spain a searing experience that had been hervey could see it now armstrongs ferocious strength unleashed on the spanish guides who had proved treacherous the night before corunna never again had he had much trust in men who did not wear a uniform mr somervile places great faith in the hill tribes the chakma especially they know the forest well and theyre no friends of the burmans armstrong made a face as if to say they would have to prove it first and what do your books say about the weather sir thank god its over the worst at least hervey knew that if bagyidaw had threatened invasion but two months before there could have been no thought of an anticipatory operation the humidity at that time induced a torpor which would have prevented any expedition the monsoon which battered them daily made the going so treacherous that no man was permitted to leave camp except in the company of two others it had been a time when the stoutest hearts had begun to wonder how long they could endure yes its surely over the worst we must hope the rivers are falling private johnson appeared oh there thee is capn ervey mr somerviles mans been lookin for thee what does he want johnson took off his forage cap and wiped his brow with his sleeve somethin abaht some blackies that needs to talk to thee this sounds promising said hervey where is mr somerviles man now he asked turning back to johnson waitin outside shall i fetch im in no no ill be along shortly would you ask mr seton canning to take evening stables for me and tell my bearer to expect me late and to leave some collops or whatever ay sir johnson replaced his cap glanced at the serjeantmajor and nodded his respects then turned to leave the feed store nearly got his name in the incident book last night did johnson said armstrong when he was gone really hervey thought johnson long past the orderly serjeants notice armstrong blew out a great cloud of sweetsmelling smoke from the last of the tokaysoaked leaf he had bought in calcutta he put bc on his back with a left hook too did he indeed do we know why disputed ownership of a woman none of emd come to blows over that theyd share em quite happily well what then a razor great heavens seems theres been a bit of lightfingering of late thought was that it must be one of the darkiewallahs there are so many of them that come and go and dodds was found with johnsons razor seems so but the circumstances sounded a bit queer dodds swore blind it mustve been put with his kit by mistake is that likely its possible half the troops shaved in bed of a morning so rather than make anything formal of it johnson tipped im a settler hervey smiled with a certain pride though the inference of doddss recidivism worried him i thought hed been treading a straight path you yourself said so i did and he had to start with he needs chasing though that sort just cant stick with it hervey sighed but even if he needed chasing dodds was still a sabre he could only hope that he was not a prigster as the men had it i have a feeling that between them corporal mccarthy and that subdivision will keep his hand to the task they better had armstrong muttered what about dhoolies and syces and the like hervey shook his head no dhoolies no syces no gramgrinders no anything but what we would have had with us in france half a dozen cacolets perhaps and pray god we shant need them armstrong made notes and boy porrit porrit had come with four other boys at the last minute in chatham sons of the gun or dockyard foundlings he and another had been mustered with e troop though his twin had died of a fit not long out to sea its a year since he was enlisted at sixteen sarntmajor the farrier will need him sir he was nowt but a bairn when he listed barely fourteen id reckon his papers say otherwise and nows not the time to be counting hed want to go anyway armstrong kept his peace porrit would be another that he would have to keep an eye on albeit a paternal one as if there werent enough already one more thing who should be my coverman armstrong turned the question over in his mind for a moment stent or harkness not mccarthy not with that seat not yet id go for stent harkness is stronger with a sword but stents the better jockey and hes more of a thinking head hervey stood and brushed the dust from his overalls put on his cap and made his excuses one way or another well have something by morning ill say whatever at first parade good night armstrong rose too ay and ill keep my peace no matter though god help us if it ever comes to a fight the imprecation was more than the soldiers casual profanity armstrong had seen hervey in his determination many a time before but there was a distinctly new edge to the steel now an edge he feared might cut both ways chapter nineteen fully trained november next day stand aaat ease stand easy herveys command put the halfhundred on muster parade next morning into an attitude at once relaxed and yet full of anticipation muster was normally a prompt affair little more than a count of heads the serious business of inspections began later with boot and saddle so that the order for standing easy presaged an announcement it might be good news or bad it was the practice in the sixth to announce defaulters punishments at muster or there might be a court circular to be read at the head of all troops hervey had been dreading the despatch which would give the report of their erstwhile colonelinchiefs trial for the arraignment of princess caroline had been long spoken of with very decided views in the regiment or it might be that as this morning the officer commanding would have some instruction for them which could not be trusted to the written page of routine orders being either too oppressive without fuller explanation or else too portentous to be conveyed from the noticeboard there was a buzz of expectancy now barely audible but a buzz nevertheless you will have heard talk about the lines these past weeks regarding the warlike antics of king bagyidaw of ava began hervey glancing from right to left along the front rank and into the rear rank as best he could all eyes were alert and turned to him the lieutenantgovernor has therefore concluded that it shall be prudent to reinforce the regular patrols along the borders of the companys territory and to obtain reinforcements for the security of chittagong and the other principal settlements accordingly a brigade is being assembled at this moment in calcutta to augment the garrison and we have orders to proceed to the border this day hervey paused to let the announcement take its effect the earlier buzz returned even stronger and it was the sound of approval hervey wondered what it might be if he were able to tell them the whole truth but that would have to wait until they were gone from earshot of any who would retail the intelligence to the burmans however impossible the act might seem the remainder of the morning is to be spent in preparation for taking to the field in accordance with standing instructions the troop is to muster at two oclock in campaign order and in all respects ready to march that is all for the present carry on please serjeantmajor sir snapped armstrong and with a relish that made some of the dragoons shudder e troop he barked the two ranks snapped back to the braced at ease atteeenshun armstrongs right hand shot to the peak of his shako as hervey and his two officers turned away dont ask of me anything more at this time said hervey when he saw seton cannings mouth open therell be fuller orders when we march just keep a close eye on things theyll need the jaldi putting into them thats for sure even with the likes of armstrong and collins chasing it was strange thought hervey even as he said it how in a matter only of months they had adopted so much of the bengal armys cant do you want me to take boot and saddle asked seton canning if you please said hervey without a glance and go to it this morning on the assumption that well see action before the weeks out his lieutenant seemed surprised do you really think so hervey dont be a bloody fool harry id not say so if i didnt think it seton canning was taken aback it was the first time hervey had spoken thus to him shall you give us orders before we march no said hervey keeping up his pace im not trusting myself to say a word youll learn why soon enough the lieutenant could still feel the edge in his captains tone and he decided to withdraw anything more sir no replied hervey briskly his mind now intent elsewhere i have to see skinners horse about something carry on hervey walked alone to the native horse lines he had no clear idea how he would secure his intent for he had no warrant from the lieutenantgovernor and moreover the skinners commandant had yet to return from his long furlough to hervey the other british officer the adjutant was a man of uncertain temperament he was no gentleman and therefore inclined to some resentment but he was diligent the commandant had said and he had the respect of the native officers he had dined with e troops officers several times but none had found him a boon companion although the hospitality ought at least to make for civility now as hervey approached the skinners lines the daffadar of the quarterguard began shouting and soon sowars in yellow kurtas and furedged lungis were doubling from the guardroom snatching lances from the rack on the verandah and falling into line in front of the yellowpainted boundstones the daffadar called them to attention and a dozen pennants fluttered then fell uniformly to the right side of each vertical lance he marched up to hervey halted and saluted then he spoke in a high and melodious voice hindoostani clear and measured as if he were not a native speaker so near was it to urdu that hervey grasped its purport the daffadar had sent a runner to inform the orderly jemadar and the daffadar would conduct him to regimental headquarters is the adjutant at orderly room daffadar asked hervey the urdu simple enough yes sahib very well the daffadar saluted again and turned to lead the captainsahib to the headquarters hervey looked at each sowar as he walked past the guard they were big men fullbearded from the country west of bengal he would wish them with him if it ever came to a fight he had no doubt they would sooner come with him across the border than stay here but that he could not risk at regimental headquarters the white dressed stone was brilliant in the morning sun the guttering downpipes and fittings painted the same yellow as the kurtas and guardroom boundstones the hand of the commandant and the presence of the rissaldarmajor were at once evident to the visitor as indeed was the intention the adjutant appeared on the verandah booted and wearing the kurta rather than the regulation kings pattern short coat bareheaded he pulled his arms to his side and bowed good morning captain hervey unheralded is there some alarm the salutation was friendly even if it suggested a chiding hervey touched the peak of his forage cap and smiled good morning captain pollock no no alarm i am sorry there was no nakib i have set every last man to work the adjutant smiled you had better tell me of it then he turned and called inside to his assistant woordimajorsahib out came the woordimajor as martiallooking a man as any but wearing spectacles yes sahib he asked in english bowing also to hervey an english bow rather than namaste please have my bearer come to my bungalow with beer and limewater very good sahib he turned to hervey and bowed again good morning captain hervey sahib good morning woordimajorsahib replied hervey with a smile touching his peak again very well hervey let us be along whatever it be it be better done with iced beer and limewater hervey would only too gladly concede that that was true in general and not just this morning im afraid you will not like what i have to tell you and just as little what i have to ask he warned as they set off for the officers lines you had better begin then replied the adjutant sounding more curious than troubled he laid a hand on herveys arm to stay him as a halfrissalah back from morning exercise turned into the camp road from the direction of the guardroom horses and men as sweatstained as e troop had been the day before hervey found the sweat reassuring im sorry weve not had an opportunity to drill together yet youre not leaving are you hervey had already decided that he could not practise any deception on the skinners adjutant for to do so would be tantamount to practising it on the commandant himself and that he could never contemplate not at least when he was to ask for men who might have to risk their lives even if he did not imagine it to be in any degree likely he therefore told him of the intelligence on which they were to act and his general design by the time he was finished they had reached the adjutants bungalow they sat down in deep cane armchairs on the verandah and in not many minutes the punkah began to swing and the bearer brought them iced beer and salted limewater at length the adjutant the acting commandant expressed his opinion i cant see that you will get one league into those forests hervey was dismayed are they so much worse than elsewhere the adjutant frowned i have no taste for the jungle hervey i have never seen what was so diverting about collecting tiger skins directly it seemed thought hervey that he himself might be pollocks superior in affairs of the forest though his experience in chintal had been precious little there are good tracks and we shall have guides dont mistake me hervey your scheme is admirable its only that there are not the troops to execute it i dont follow you yourself have said you have a troop in the making and such a scheme as this would need a made troop for certain hervey saw no advantage in debating the point you will not give me a galloper gun i didnt say that but i do not see what use they would be to you however good are the tracks theyll scarcely admit a gun i had thought to carry them broken down chapmanfashion the adjutant was silent he had evidently not considered it at least lend me the guns and have your men instruct mine in how to use them now the adjutant looked dismayed hervey these men would do anything i asked no matter how perilous sahib bolta the sahib says but i should not hazard to disarm them hervey fixed him with a steady look they were at a fork in the road then i must ask if you would have them accompany us the adjutant paused long hervey taking cavalry into the forest is as desperate a scheme as ever i heard i might say foolhardy hervey continued to look him in the eye but without guns it would be madness he paused again as if to emphasize the narrow margin of sanity you shall have my best men hervey nodded in gratitude the faintest smile upon his lips a knowing confiding grim smile come said pollock getting up ill turn out the daffadar and his guns and ill tell you of the forest in those parts what little of it that i know where have you been asked somervile anxiously your groom said youd left parade not long after seven to see the skinners commandant replied hervey matter of fact pouring limewater for himself from a large glass jug somerviles jaw dropped you havent told him what youre about hervey turned with a look like thunder somervile you trust me to embark on a foray which some would call harebrained and then you think i would tattle it about the bazaars somervile was clearly angered by his own ejaculation though not entirely disposed to remorse it is a deuced tender time for me too you know hervey that it was hervey saw at once for whereas he risked but his life somervile hazarded his reputation i have told captain pollock the design yes but let us not quarrel over it i had a tricky mission with skinners i wanted their galloper guns they have two somervile looked dismayed again but stayed his protest have you got them oh yes theyre readying them at this moment could you not have had them without letting your intent be known hervey drained the glass and poured himself more there was nothing in honour i could say to the adjutant but why i had need of his guns and that i confided that he would tell no one somervile looked at him anxiously for further assurance you need have no fear on that account i would trust his pledge with my life you have indeed done so by all accounts pollock is an efficient officer but you mean he would not have secured a kings commission just so and in these circumstances it is hardly something one may overlook with impunity i dont gainsay it somervile but pollocks a soldier to his fingertips somervile raised his eyebrows and of the yellow circle hervey nodded with just the degree of mock solemnity that the question had implied just so somervile the fellowship of the sabre is felt most keenly somervile frowned indulgently you fellows you feast on malory no doubt fancying yourselves all sir gawains hervey returned the frown and you civil servants of the crown have ever need of questing knights for your ambitions a khitmagar brought in a tray of coffee somervile gestured towards his guest shall not the guns be a hindrance in the forest indeed shall you be able to traverse the country at all with them hervey took a cup of blisteringly hot coffee stronger even than somerviles normal taste required then sat down we shall dismantle them at the forest edge and port them on the horses like woolpacks somervile nodded at this evidence of herveys ingenuity but he still wore an air of concern what then in general terms is your intention hervey sipped at his coffee the intelligence we have is quite precise although how reliable we cannot tell the burmans are assembling just inside the country on the river where a road appears to lead all the way from ava and to the middle of nowhere though perhaps it is the other way round either way it seems curious has the road some significance do you know somervile answered at once i think you need not concern yourself on that account the road leads from there to ava the story goes that a great white elephant was found in the forest and the local zamindar took him as a gift to the king making the road as he went hervey was gratified there was no more complicating detail than this the only difficulty is finding the road on our maps the river divides near the border and its by no means apparent which is the place you say the arakanese know how to get there and the chakma guides know the border well but i prefer to know where im about it is what fourscore miles nearer the hundred i should say theres a diversion of some dozen or more in order to avoid one of the settlements i intend we march twenty this day and then make camp and then strike it well before dawn tomorrow so that we shake off any followers theres a good place for such a halt your arakanese say just beyond a fording place on the karnaphuli on the bandarban road and thence its into the hill tracts somervile looked unsure i doubt you will find a ford so low on the karnaphuli even at this time of year hervey was not greatly perturbed the arakanese said there might be a little way to swim but this doesnt trouble me its a torpid stream and the horses will know what to do even if half the dragoons dont it will be good practice i would have had them doing it in a month or so in any case had we not been stoodto to this the arakanese say its called the bandarban ford so the chance of our needing to swim seems very low somervile nodded so be it and what are your intentions for the assault that i cant determine until ive seen for myself the assembly place im trusting to the intelligence that there will be more boats than fighting men i shall want to secure the site against surprise and then set to with the breakingup of the boats im inclined to think we might fire them except that i cant risk setting alight the forest no that would be most hazardous somervile agreed nodding with some disquiet but what shall you do if there are more men than the intelligence suggests hervey raised his eyebrows so much depends on their attitude if they are without much discipline in their security we might yet be able to prevail over them but if theyre alert we shall give them a fright and make good our escape you would want me to make a demonstration failing all else oh yes indeed it risks a casus belli of course but they are at any rate intent on an attack of that we are quite sure and a check such as that might unsteady them a considerable degree but i do urge that you have a care i should not ask you to throw away any mans life in mere speculation hervey i leave to you absolutely how intent you press your attack thank you somervile you may be assured i have a proper regard for the dangers but im grateful to have your trust reposed in such a manner hervey made to stand now let me show you the difficulties as far as i can discern from this map dodds is absent hervey said seton canning as they walked to the stables before the two oclock mustering hervey stopped dead when where he didnt parade for boot and saddle ill have dodds hanged if we have to set off without him no one could be sure if the threat were more than just exasperation but the edge was such as to make seton canning start the sarntmajor has sent people out looking for him but he couldnt spare too many and doubtless armstrong was not much grieved by the loss thought hervey beyond the affront to discipline i suppose we must own that bad character will out he hissed seton canning said not another word at the stables johnson stood holding the little marwari which his captain had taken as his second charger hervey took the reins and mounted at once gilbert is seen to ay sir i told yon cripple id lame im good an proper if there was as much as a stable mark on im when i got back private hickss leg was all but mended after his fall a month before but he had limped about the lines for so long that he could be sure st giles would remain his nickname for as long as he wore uniform hervey frowned hed better believe it he rasped leaning forward to pull up a keeper on the bridle and you told him a pectoral morning and evening that cold came on so quickly i dont want it turning to anything worse i told im sir hervey nodded grimly where dye think dodds is hiding by the way in trear rank if es any sense hervey looked at him puzzled then johnson realized tha doesnt know es back then no i did not how so corporal mossop found im in a cunnywarren in ttown a syce led out johnsons own horse together with herveys new second hervey frowned at his groom wanting more from him e were too fuzzed to stand mossop said a hint of a smirk betrayed johnsons pleasure at the pun hervey was not inclined to share it johnson you do realize he would have been hanged for his absence ay sir replied his groom the smile gone and to tell thee ttruth thered not be any asd put in a good word for im hervey fumed but at himself it was he who had wanted to enlist dodds and since then he had seized on any sign of amends to his bad character and in the face of armstrongs continuing doubts for a moment the lash seemed appealing he tried to put it from his mind as he rode with seton canning to the maidan he halted at the edge to let his lieutenant go forward to take over the parade from armstrong and then he in turn took command as he rode along the front rank and then the rear his humour was much restored by his dragoons appearance green his troop might be but they looked likely enough this day just so long as they went to it with a will and luck went with them they would manage dodds is with the bathorses sir in open arrest said armstrong as they cleared the rear right marker for my part id have him nowhere near except that he should stand his chances like the rest of them hervey could not help wondering even now if dodds had truly intended to absent himself are we sure he was at first parade unless hed heard the warning for the field he couldnt very well be charged with desertion armstrong had not considered it the troop had been reported present or else accounted for ill get is corporal to vouch sir he replied doubtfully hervey checked in front of one of the warminster pals are you quite well parkin he asked seeing an unusual amount of perspiration about his face and neck not feeling too good sir i expect itll pass though sir hervey glanced at private wainwright next to him he were all right until last night sir but he didnt want to report sick after what you said at first parade sir report now to the surgeon parkin parkin saluted a shade awkwardly thought hervey as if his arm were constrained and fell out to his right youll find him with the bathorses lad said armstrong as he passed what did he have to eat last night wainwright asked hervey mutton sir same as us and drink just a measure of rum sir thats all he never has more sir hervey pressed on down the line looking into faces more intently now determined on seeing any sign that parkins ailment might not be entirely his own but all looked none the worse than usual they rode round behind the rear rank to where the two galloper guns were their teams each of three sowars sitting like ramrods in the saddle the kurtas as vivid as sunflowers hervey had asked for a daffadar who could understand some english and the adjutant had assured him that he would oblige but he tried a few words of his urdu if as no more than a courtesy the daffadar braced in acknowledgement hazoor there was a strange noise from beyond the guns a bleating hervey peered between the sowars to see what was the cause rations sahib said the daffadar with a grin now he could see it one of the packhorses carried two live goats strapped either side of the saddle hervey nodded to the daffadar as much in amazement as approval then reined about trotted to the front of the troop and faced he looked left and right along the ranks all eyes were still front and horses heads were steady the regiment did not draw swords for inspection in campaign order so his command was merely sit easy he stood in the saddle to address them e troop i am well pleased with your appearance as serviceable as anything i saw in the peninsula it is a good beginning we march from here presently some twenty miles in the direction southeast towards bandarban after fording the river thereabouts we make camp for the night and there i shall give a fuller account of our mission for the moment it is as well that you understand that as always your first duty is the care of your mounts to that end we make no show of pushing off we shall cover the first half of that distance at the walk leading the first halfhour he turned to his lieutenant and asked him to carry on then beckoned johnson over go and see what the surgeon says about parkin will you i want every man i can have on parade but we cant carry sick ten minutes later with the troop dismounted and drawn up in column of route two native guides leading johnson returned mr ledley says e thinks it could be just a chill but e cant be sure parkin were swearin blind it were nowt but a sweat so tsurgeon as dosed im an es fallen in again hervey nodded ledley had no worse a reputation than any so he might as well trust to his optimism very well trumpeter walkmarch chapter twenty column of route later that day e troop had never marched twenty miles before for the first halfhour they tramped the road from the cantonment to the river at times in no better order than a train of tinkers hervey set too fast a pace to begin with the dragoons at the rear of the column finding it difficult to get into their stride with gaps suddenly opening up and then having to be closed rapidly at the trot and some of the horses would not take to long reins so that there was a deal of napping which in turn opened more gaps after twenty minutes the ncos were hoarse with their efforts to keep a semblance of soldierly appearance and more than one dragoon was looking as though he would not stay the distance but at last the troop settled to a rhythm of sorts sustained by each man in turn taking up the pacecount no mean achievement hervey and seton canning agreed considering that at least half of them had not been able to count reliably beyond half a dozen when they enlisted and then they had tightened girths and mounted and ridden for the next hour at a steady trot and very creditably together hervey thought from his perspective at the columns head more than one dragoon found the exercise a powerful thirstmaker but hervey had given orders that on the march a strict water discipline was to be maintained at the first halt after an hour and a half several men at the rear of the column believed themselves to be so parched as to be close to expiring and corporal mccarthy was obliged to seize with some force a canteen from one of them mccarthy though he knew nothing more of horses than what every man had learned since enlisting was nevertheless entirely convinced of the necessity of discipline his best cork horses first you heathens stung wouldbe defaulters with its obvious appeal to duty as well as with the native authority which an irish nco possessed the river was slow by the standards of those they had known in spain and the colour of earth at the first halt it was set about by tall rain trees and the grasses at the edge were not so high as in the open stretch from the city no higher than a mans knee and in places grazed shorter or uprooted altogether by cattle and game preferring to drink in the rain trees shade by sections mouths into the river and then straight out again called armstrong handing his own horse to his groom and taking his whip in hand as he began to walk along the line rapping the other hand with it in a manner that signalled there would be no mercy for the idle dragoon just enough to wash their mouths with and then a wisp of a hay one quarter of one hour hervey slipped the bridle off his little marwari and put on the head collar he was pleased to note how little she had sweated and how light was her breathing he led her to the rivers edge and let her drop her head she swallowed twice and he pulled her head up again quite easily she did not struggle she was as fit as ever jessye had been he turned her away and walked back to where johnson waited with a handful of hay armstrong came up how are the gallopergunners asked hervey picking up each of the marwaris feet to check for stones not a bead of sweat on any of them sir horses or men hervey smiled to himself i wonder what they make of us sarntmajor i wouldnt rightly know sir but lets wait till weve done what were doing before we ask em hervey smiled again youre quite right well stand judged by our effect not our appearance ill warrant that if they knew how little time wed had theyd never believe we could have come this far armstrong looked puzzled bloody ell sir weve come nought but ten miles on a warm afternoon i reckon my caithlin could manage that hervey frowned armstrong knew well enough that his captain was speaking of more than the days march but the latter knew his serjeantmajors proposition was undoubtedly true an hour and a half into a campaign was a deal too early to be drawing any conclusions favourable or otherwise very well then five minutes more by my watch at your order sarntmajor then two leagues at a good trot and with that he began replacing the bridle the next leg they covered at a flying pace the ground had a spring in it neither too hardbaked as in the early part of the year nor yet soaked by the heavy rains of the middle months horses were fit enough and riders too at least for a sixmile trot on good level going hervey glanced behind him from time to time and was pleased by what he saw the jingle of bits and the striking of hoofs fell into a rhythm which in turn served that regular order which was the mark of seasoned cavalry so good a rhythm indeed that many a head could have nodded a while in perfect safety hervey judged it by his watch fortyfive minutes at such a pace two leagues he held up his hand and ceased rising in the saddle the sixth in common with many another regiment had for some time given up bumping in the trot then brought the marwari to a walk for a full five minutes more before holding up his hand again for the halt in a trice he was off and unsaddling his little mare patting her neck and making much she was sweating a bit under the saddle blanket and along her shoulders but scarcely more than a hunter on an english autumns day he pulled the stable rubber from the carryall on the saddle and set to removing the worst of it he picked out her feet nothing troubling her there either he pulled her funny little ears turned in like horns and spoke keenly to her again before taking off the bridle and slipping on the halter now was the time to let her take a good drink he led her to the rivers edge and let her drop her head awhile not too much though not enough to bring on the colic and then again a little longer and then once more until it was safe to hold the leadrein loose he looked down the line of dragoons as they watered by halfsections so as to be under the eye of an nco perhaps not all the ncos were the best of that breed but they were adequate he felt sure he thought back to those corporals and serjeants who had crossed the pyrenees all of seven years ago was it so long would there ever be their like again how could there be surely they would never see a campaign the like of the peninsula and without its like how could such men as they be forged he knew it to be true of himself especially a godfearing home he had had and a soldierly tutor of exemplary quality in daniel coates and the best of learning at shrewsbury but it had been the winter of corunna and the summers afterwards on the spanish plain that had made him no longer a boy captain hervey sir came the voice of serjeantmajor armstrong upon his reveries as it had done innumerable times before in less exalted rank yon parkins a sick man ive a mind to turn him back hervey frowned at him shall i take a look i think youd better surgeonll take a look when hes put a stitch or two in rudds bonny face hervey raised an inquisitorial eyebrow that nappy little lass of his threw her head up a bit sharp when hed taken her bridle off hervey sighed handed his reins to johnson and set off back down the column he came on parkin sitting with his head in his hands with private wainwright next to him holding both horses what is it parkin its nothing sir replied parkin struggling to rise no keep where you are said hervey squatting on his haunches to take a proper look at parkins face it was undoubtedly worse than at muster beads of sweat trickling almost continuously down his cheeks and neck but they had since been in a brisk trot and for the best part of an hour do you have any pain no sir wainwright evidently considered the reply incomplete hes got the cramps though sir his joints are aching bad the surgeon had by now come up he too squatted by parkins side and laid the back of his hand on the dragoons forehead a fever all right and a sight worse than at muster do you have any head pain parkin hesitated a headache sir yes and his joints are aching sir added wainwright is that right parkin ill be all right sir just need a bit of a rest the surgeon stood up then hervey what is it i dont know hervey it could be any number of things his tone was not optimistic whats the worst it might be he has the symptoms of breakbone fever though i must say i have never witnessed the condition myself hervey looked blank well it wont kill him but the aches will become so bad that hell not be able to stay in the saddle i dont want to be fell out sir insisted parkin albeit limply no parkin im sure you dont it does you credit but i cant risk it let me just go on to the camp tonight sir ill sweat it out then and likely be better in the morning hervey glanced at wainwright i can see to him sir said wainwright reluctant but resigned he knew parkin would never want to go back to warminster common without the same tale of action to tell and after all the surgeon had said it would not be fatal even if it were the worst very well then said hervey briskly but i shant risk taking you beyond the nights camp if theres no amendment it was not a difficult decision after all he would still have to send another man back with him whether it were now or then armstrong was not convinced of the logic when hervey told him however youve been in these parts a sight more than me sir but yon parkins going to get a whole lot worse before he gets better itd be kindness to send him home now with less of a distance to do hervey knew that armstrong was right in one sense at least but he was disappointed nevertheless to hear it how things had changed armstrong the hardest of men now speaking of kindness how had it come about moreover how far would it go these are green men sarntmajor im not going to discourage an instinct for the fight they were sufficiently out of earshot for armstrong to voice his opinion further aw come on sir parkins a babby still hes no more idea of a fight than a brawl on a saturday we cant afford to carry anybody as cant look after themselves send him back with one of the syces hervey was angered thats a judgement ive got to make this side of the river theres hardly a risk armstrong looked equally black of course its a judgement youve got to make sir but what good am i supposed to be if i dont give my opinion hervey did not reply at once and youd trust one of the syces i would while parkins still able to do for himself we cant afford to send one of ours with him hervey could not make things out armstrong if he were indeed going soft was as determined as ever well ive told him he can stay with us now if i have to leave him at the river then it will have to be with a syce i think therell be a dak bungalow there anyway private johnson led up herveys marwari parkin looks proper poorly to me capn ervey is tha gooin to send im back armstrong answered johnson youll look a sight poorlier than parkin if you dont keep that potatotrap of yours shut and who said to unbutton that coat johnson knew he was vulnerable on both counts and did not even glance at hervey for support he braced up instead and turned away armstrong smiled a little you know when i kept that place at datchet i was of a mind to take him on if ever as they say youd dispensed with his services hervey relaxed and smiled too that might come as a great shock to him oh im not so sure sir its water off a ducks back to our johnson he knows his worth thats one thing hervey shook his head and thats the problem with half the poor beggars who showed for the shilling they thought so little of themselves armstrong took out his pipe there was no time to light it but he could prick at the bowl in the familiar way its a queer place this most of these indoos as does for us sleeps on the floor and yet i dont see em cringe for all of that and as for them skinners men youd think they were maharajahs the way they carry themselves and what conclusions do you draw from these observations sarntmajor armstrong paused lets just say that when this lot is shot over the first time well have our work cut out hervey hoped profoundly he was wrong we can thank god at least that by all accounts the burmans are not famous fighters armstrong tapped out his pipe on his boot ay well weve heard that afore hervey knew it but it was time they began resaddling and he stood up a couple of leagues at most and then well see what their spirit is when i tell them our orders armstrong rose too ay crossing yon riverll leave em in no doubt weve work to do the karnaphuli river at the point where they were to pick up the bandarban road was not quite as hervey had imagined in one respect it was familiar enough tall rain trees interlocked their canopies so that the sun could not penetrate in any strength just as in his memory of the chintal forest they were indeed at the edge of the great jungled wilderness that stretched as far as ava itself and this much his maps told him but the arakanese had described the place as a ford or that at least had been the translation through bengali if it was a ford it was a deep one hervey sat contemplating the river for some time had he come to the wrong place the native arakanese guides seemed sure enough and after all they had merely had to follow the river upstream to where the only road crossed it this here was undoubtedly a road of some importance for there on the far bank was a little ferry whose ferryman would in any case be able to confirm it was the place then it tumbled to him a ford it might be but for whom the elephants and their mahouts now wading into the middle from the far side were his probable answer their days work done it was the hour for a cooling soak and here it seemed was the timehonoured place where they came to a mahout it was indeed a ford some of the troophorses became unsettled at the sight and smell of the halfdozen elephants although they were hardly a novelty some of the dragoons likewise showed their unease as they saw the river reach halfway up the flanks of the great beasts hervey put on a brave face well the currents pretty slow nows as good a time as any to try it it was probably true swimming was the last drill they had to practise and although they would first have tried it without saddles they were not nearly so encumbered as they might have been and the little rope ferry would take the galloper guns and the farriers packhorses ill get them to start waterproofing then sir said armstrong dyou think we can get them elephants to stand sentinel downstream in case we have a few fallers i think we may well take a rope across too it took a full halfhour to make waterproof the firelocks and cartridges binding carbines and pistols with oilskin and wrapping cartridges in waxed paper when they were ready hervey had the troop remount and face the river in line then he rode to the centre and cast his eyes left and right i have just two things to say and you will do well to remember them first your horse will swim across without any help from you all you need to do is to let him have his head and sit tall in the saddle second your carbine you will have no greeting from me if you emerge from the river without it hervey paused to let the message be understood some of the ncos added their own warnings though muttered those elephants will stand in line in case anyone is unseated hervey went on and then slowing his delivery to emphasize the point added which there is no reason to be he nodded to serjeant collins collins rode out of the ranks halted and drew his carbine from its bucket and clipped it to his crossbelt in the approved fashion then he took the coil of rope the end of which the serjeantmajor had secured to a tree looped it in the crook of his right arm took the carbine in the same hand and rode straight for the rivers edge see how he holds the carbine up to keep it dry called hervey glancing left and right again along the line all eyes were on collins he rode straight into the river as if it were no more than a field of barley his horse not hesitating a fraction for half a minute the water came no higher than collinss toes then his knees and then there was no longer a footing and the horse struck out into the peculiar lunging motion that was its swimming method head pushed forward flat on the water see how he has let his horse have the rein and keeps his back straight and carbine hand raised continued hervey for another half a minute collinss horse paddled powerfully until its feet touched bottom again when the horse first gets a footing hell lurch a bit until he gets his stride dont let your weight be thrown forward or youll unbalance him the water was now back to collinss knees and soon to his toes and then he was riding up the shallow bank and out of the river serjeant collins will secure the rope and that shall be to save the unwary but i say again i do not expect any one of you to have recourse to it he nodded to armstrong who took up post at the entry point right you dryfeet from the left begin barked the serjeantmajor armstrong had numbered off the ncos carefully so that there would be a good spreading of experience first in went private french no harder than driving a pair lad said armstrong encouragingly probably a lot easier french rode in confidently keep that carbine up hell be up to his neck in no time next went corporal mossop go on eli show em how its done mossop was by no means the best but armstrong knew he would be better for a good word then came mole the hireling and shepherd stent then corporal ashbolt and harkness and corporal mccarthy look careful there paddy said armstrong with a smile its not the river jordan no sor it isnt and i was baptized an infant already mccarthy had crossed rivers before many a time and by no means as warm and sluggish as this but always on his feet he looked gingerly ahead but he had been trained and he trusted his officers a dozen more entered as regularly as those in front clambered out on the far bank johnson took his own mount and herveys second across knotting his reins and holding his carbine high and with no more trouble than if he had been crossing the parade ground parkin and a clutch of warminster pals came next armstrong eyed him fiercely parkin you keep that carbine hand up mind that was going to be the least of his worries armstrong knew but this was not the time for second thoughts he fixed corporal tait following with a glare tait knew what he meant and nodded and if there was a better corporal than tait in the saddle then he wasnt in the sixth then came wainwright and rudd eager to ride up close to parkin but armstrong held them back awhile it was no use too many in the stream at once parkin was doing well sitting upright if a little hunched struggling manfully to keep his carbine up by his shoulders corporal tait was alongside wainwright and rudd a couple of lengths behind in less than a minute they would be in the shallows and then the very worst happened so quick that none saw it coming the ferry rope straining to hold the raft with its two galloper guns snapped with a crack like a rifle it startled the horses on the near bank and even unsettled the elephants the raft swung free as if propelled by a paddle and bore down at once on the swimmers there was nothing they could do tait was struck first and knocked clean from the saddle but he managed to grab the side of the raft then it hit the packhorse carrying the goats the horse lost balance and the current though weak began to take the drowning animal towards the elephants the goats bleating frantically then the raft swung round and caught parkin still struggling manfully to keep his carbine dry he disappeared beneath the big teak logs with a shout of jobie jobie wainwright did not calculate he threw himself from the saddle towards the raft but he fell well short he had swum many a time in the rivers and ponds about warminster but the weight of all he bore was too much and he too sank like a stone corporal tait threw his crossbelt and carbine onto the raft and slid below after them armstrong likewise threw off all his equipment and coat and raced powerfully to the middle of the river bellowing at rudd to stay in the saddle serjeant collins plunged in from the far bank astride his gelding and shepherd stent dived headlong after him hervey shouted for the remainder to stand fast and then put his own horse into the river the skinners daffadar struggled to hold the galloper guns on the raft as it swung towards the rope which collins had paid out tait surfaced gasping struggling desperately to bring up his man armstrong reached him first and managed to pull up wainwrights head collins was close enough now to reach out and grab hold of his crossbelt tait exhausted seized the rope coughing and trying to catch his breath parkin sir just under armstrong dived once more then shepherd stent after half a minute armstrong came up for air then stent and then both went under again it seemed an age the raft went over the rope but the mahouts were already moving the elephants towards it up came armstrong and stent together gasping worse than tait and with a lifeless parkin hervey grabbed his crossbelt and took the weight from them so they could both make for the rope and in a minute it was all quiet the river empty but for two of the elephants the others having edged the raft to the far side the surgeon had been the last out he had never so much as ridden his horse through a dewpond before but he had put him straight at the far bank as soon as he had seen cause and now he worked frantically to revive parkin even as the crowding knot of men saw there was no life in him a full five minutes did ledley pound at parkins chest to have him cough up the water never would hervey have believed a surgeon had such faith but it was to no good at length he rose and pronounced him dead two hours it took to dig private parkins grave the troop carried only a few entrenching tools and hervey wanted it deep so that the scavengers at the jungles edge should not disturb parkins resting place the pals wainwright spreadbury and needham dug alone for the first hour until finally they relented and let rudd the milliner join them needham cried quietly for a lot of the time he and parkin had lived cheek by jowl on warminster common since they could remember longer even than had jobie wainwright for he had come with his mother from the parish when he was full five years old only once did anyone speak when spreadbury exhausted sat down and said danny should have been let off sick but jobie had simply taken up the pick and quietly explained no billy wes all soldiers now and the others had accepted it because jobie had said it but even jobie could not rest for he had told parkins mother he would look after him and he hadnt what would he say to her she was as good a mother as any there was on the common when it was done the pals brought parkins body wrapped in his cloak and laid it beside the grave where the rest of the troop was drawn up hatless i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die hervey spoke the words with sad assurance though the rubric of the prayer book required that the office was not to be used for any that died unbaptized he had not been minded to enquire of parkins status he wanted to commend a stouthearted dragoon to his maker and to show to the others that the sixth honoured its dead we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out the lord gave and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord the words settled on the troop like a chill evening mist all movement ceased then hervey read psalm with its promise of a longer span of life than parkin had enjoyed and probably than many of those gathered could expect there were few grey hairs in a regiment and even fewer in a troop afterwards came saint pauls epistle to the corinthians long and bewildering and the ranks were not now so statuelike hervey sensed it and hammered out its concluding questions o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory and he raised his voice in authority at its final command therefore my beloved brethren be ye steadfast unmoveable always abounding in the work of the lord forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the lord hervey nodded to armstrong who in turn nodded to the pals who took the ends of the knotted reins by which parkins body would be lowered into the earth man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live and is full of misery began hervey again as the pals played out the reins and then the body at rest and the reins recovered hervey threw a handful of earth into the grave and the pals did likewise forasmuch as it hath pleased almighty god of his great mercy to take unto himself the soul of our dear brother here departed we therefore commit his body to the ground hervey had always liked the appellation brother applied to a fellow dragoon irrespective of rank and hoped that it would strike the same chord beyond just the pals for it was the strength of the regiment that a dragoon would fight for his friends would lay down his life even and that those friends those brothersinarms numbered many more than might ordinarily be the case indeed at its principled best the regiment was a body of friends whose connection was no more than the sharing of the roman vi in their headdress the rest of the order for the burial of the dead hervey abbreviated leading next the lords prayer and hearing a respectable rendering of it by many of those present and then pronouncing the grace but amen could not be sufficient to a military occasion and so he ended with a peremptory parade dismissed he turned away and closed his prayer book it had been the first time he had opened it in many months chapter twentyone the leafy labyrinth later the noise of the river crossing and then the solemnity of the burial service had masked the peace of a rainforest afternoon from dawn until late morning there was a procession of sound some of it such as the birdsong was entirely obvious in its origin but much of it was far from so cicadas were easy to tell like crickets in some vast echo chamber but what started quite evidently as a chorus of cicadas would then metamorphose in the strangest way so that it was not clear whether the cicadas had changed their tune or whether another creature had taken it up in imitation and begun its own development sometimes especially at night the noise seemed as if it were made by machine hammering and drilling and rasping like a saw drawn across wire and all the time there was whistling whooping growling screeching snarling terrible otherworld noises that could chill the marrow even as the flesh ran with sweat but not in the afternoon then as in the early hours of the predawn the forest became progressively silent as if every creature had flown or slid away this was the time that hervey knew the time he had ventured a little way into the mysterious jungle it had been silent that afternoon in chintal five years ago nearly when the raj kumari had tempted him and it had been silent that night when he had crept with the rajahs sowars through the tangled blackness to fall upon the mutineers so imprudently asleep at their post hervey had not heard the rainforests fullthroated chorus he knew of it only from what men had told him usually men wideeyed with the telling with little more than an hour to darkness there were many things for officers ncos and dragoons alike to attend to but hervey was determined to speak to them about the march ahead and indeed of the ultimate purpose of that march he therefore ordered the campfires to be built high so that he could address the troop in full view of them even if they for the most part would be in the shadows it was a joy to watch armstrong at field duty this time of the day was his and he knew precisely how to fill it his eye missed nothing nor his ear his whip swished jabbed and pointed this way and that without ever making contact with a man and certainly never a horse an nco considered himself well worthy of his rank if he escaped wholly without censure hervey could think himself in spain once more when death was an almost daily affair and as he sat alone beneath a magnolia tree he found it easier than he had expected to lay aside thoughts of private parkin and to apply himself instead to his maps such was the worth of a serjeantmajor of armstrongs line and service five minutes sir said armstrong hervey looked up the light was failing and he could no longer make out the detail on his maps such as it was very good alls well as youd expect sir theyre just getting on with things surgeons got his work cut out trying to stop em pulling them leeches straight off though hervey nodded a very noble effort of his with parkin armstrong sighed it was scabby luck parkin of all people to be in its way and that was the only way to look at it hervey considered but he knew he had yet to bring the occurrence to a close in the minds of many of the troop the greenheads especially when they were assembled standing easy with carbines piled hervey began at once on the task of putting the spirit back in them he knew how a frenchman or perhaps an italian would go about it with soulstirring rhetoric and appeals to patriotic sentiment but the english soldier in his experience responded best to something simpler private parkin died today because he was too good a man to go sick when his companions were embarked on something hazardous i have to tell you now that many of you all of you perhaps will be put to the same test as parkin in the days ahead the silence was now absolute we shall strike camp tomorrow morning two hours before dawn and shall be taken by the native guides north to the burman border through thick forest a march of perhaps two or three days we shall rendezvous with tribesmen from the hills who know that border well and we shall cross it and enter burman territory and we shall seek out the force which is at this very moment assembling with the intention of bearing down upon the place we have just left he paused to judge the effect the silence held as acutely as before having discovered their location we shall attack them with the greatest ferocity and destroy their capacity to do this vile thing the promise of action was too much just as he had hoped and there was a murmur of approval he must now encourage it do not ask me what is the plan of action for until we know where is the enemy and what his dispositions such plans are futile only remember this surprise is our shield and our spear but without our horses we can have no advantage once surprise is lost we shall struggle therefore to take them through the forest in the expectation that their appearance alone will shock the enemy he had toyed with the idea of reference to hannibal but the allusion would have been absurdly highflown and much worse understood and we should be grateful they are good little tats all of them he saw the nodding of heads now was the time to promise and to challenge very well you new men are to become soldiers full and good see to it that you do not dishonour private parkin parade is dismissed he delivered this last as fact rather than an order which allowed the challenge to carry over into the conversation that at once arose and he would stand aloof from it but ready to respond if approached it was not yet the time to go among them armstrong knew it from old and busied himself with the roster of sentries seton canning sensed it and sought out the quartermaster to discuss some matter of provisions even johnson found other things to be about eventually some nco would come and share his enthusiasm for what hervey had promised but for the moment he would watch the little knots of men alone and he could think of what he might be able to say to the skinners men who had stood loyally but uncomprehendingly throughout it was cold that night even near a fire and wrapped in his cloak hervey felt the earth giving up its warmth to the sky and taking with it his own for they were bivouacked in a clearing he had turned in at once after rounds at last light the night noises just beginning the men would have to bear them for themselves and he had slept fitfully he had not risen at all leaving to his lieutenant instead the job of picketofficer for he knew it was no advantage his having a man like seton canning if he didnt use him when he did wake the silence surprised him with only here and there a whicker from the horse lines or a grunt from a sleeping dragoon nothing sounded the passing of the early hours in the forest in spain there had always been something the cockcrow a tocsin or a watchmans call he imagined that he had not slept this far from habitation in three years he could look at his hunter if he wished by the light of the dying fire or the luminescent one which daniel coates had given him but he had seen no point instead lying still keeping what warmth remained to himself an hour later as hervey dozed johnson shook him gently by the shoulder tea capn ervey an a good mashin it is an all tea at this time and in these circumstances had always had but one important quality as far as hervey was concerned that it was hot whether or not it was strong or sweet or had milk was of no moment compared with this requirement and it had been johnsons singular ability in this direction which for some years now had marked him out in herveys mind as a special sort of man since coming to him in spain johnson had never failed to bring him tea at reveille even on the morning of waterloo when the rain had poured all night johnson had brought a good mashing before standto so welcome a drink that hervey truly believed he would choose to give up all other before he would give up tea its four oclock sir added johnson without having to be asked hervey would record in his journal later that day that the dawn standto went passably well except that the troop made too much noise and he would be pleased with the days march too the going was easy and they met with no setback in the forty miles they covered most of it by midday the camp that evening therefore had an altogether different air from that of the one before the ncos were agreeably surprised by the way the march had gone and were now giving their orders with not quite so much of a snarl armstrong especially had been pleased to be able to march and ride for long periods without having to open his mouth the private men for the most part were very tired for to those unaccustomed to such a distance in one day the bodily and moral exertion was prodigious but a tired soldier was almost invariably a contented soldier a maxim hervey had learned from joseph edmonds when first he had joined and which he had confirmed for himself in no time at all and so it would be a propitious time for him to go about the troop in their bivouac as fires were beginning the work of making their supper just to show himself just to be there to let the private men share their contentment with him it would make it so much the easier when he needed to go among them when things looked perilous hervey walked the horse lines by himself in the main content with what he saw but the mosquitoes were back and the men were occupied in rubbing a foulsmelling liquid about their horses faces and ears and indeed their own which the commissary in chittagong had dispensed hervey had brought some citronella from calcutta which seemed to work just as well as the camphor or whatever was the other but had the advantage of a pleasant scent if the disadvantage of a hefty price at the end of the line he came across private mole sitting on the ground who when he saw hervey approaching began struggling to pull up his overalls to stand he looked more doleful than usual even taking account of his lip are you quite well mole hes got a leech on his pennis sor said corporal mccarthy taking an ember from the fire blowing it redhot and handing it to mole hervey kept the shiver to himself the surgeon had warned them all about the jungle leechs habits and preferences but this seemed uncommonly early proof of it sit yourself down then mole would it not be better to call mr ledley corporal mccarthy ah theres no need sor that emberll do it ive done it meself many a time afore though i must say never with the crown jewels hervey watched as mole braced himself and applied the ember to the engorged worm it curled up at once and in another second let go its grip falling wriggling to the floor where moles angry boot finished the job just as mr ledley told us sor said mccarthy with a look of satisfaction an embers the thing that or salt ive seen em pulled off in a panic and the wound become very pussy afterwards mole looked unhappy still hervey thought it best to leave him to recover his humour as well as his modesty he turned and walked back along the line contemplating his good fortune in having mccarthy it was clear the man was possessed of something in his field habits which commanded the dragoons to imitate him he had recognized mccarthys fighting spirit in an instant when first they had been hurled together in france but he had for long months retained a suspicion that an nco who had once lost his stripes might ever be doing so again mccarthy was probably no more impulsive a pugilist than armstrong and probably no more enamoured of a drop or two than he but armstrong had never been reduced to the ranks that was the difference was it perhaps that discipline was in some way administered differently in the infantry he wished he had been able to enquire of the th what had been the circumstances but there was no denying now that mccarthy was an exemplary corporal hervey didnt even have to trust to his own judgement in that armstrong was certain of it it was not the same with corporal mossop though mossop did not do anything wrong he did it indeed to the best of his ability and there lay the problem mossop tried but nothing came easily or naturally mossop was awkward even in conversation he would have thrown himself into the flames for his captain but hervey would dodge the other side of a horse so as not to have to pass the time of day with him and that he knew full well could not but convey itself to the man and so he would make himself go through the motions of bantering if only to display his confidence in him in front of the dragoons but mossop would never be a serjeant that was certain with mccarthy on the other hand there could be no such certainty when hervey looked at collins though he wondered how any other corporal might aspire to serjeant how might they measure themselves against him his celerity in action his composure in routine it was collinss misfortune however to be a serjeant at this time for the wait would be long for the fourth piece of tape he needed the toast to a short war and a bloody one but india looked unlikely to oblige him even with forays such as this it was a sorry thing to wish for dead mens boots thought hervey but he hoped very dearly that collins would not be spent before his time came for a troop of his own however it was the little knot of warminster pals that intrigued him most they were three now the original pals but rudd was messing with them this evening his mother would have been appalled at the notion of her sons associating with the roughs of warminster common and in ordinary the son too would never have had occasion to speak with them but the bond of a shared home place when so far distant from it was ever strong even shepherd stent although an imber man by birth felt some kin with rudd and wainwright and spreadbury and needham indeed he had been more welcome in the high street at the sheep markets with his father than ever the roughs of the common had been hervey stood watching them for some time unnoticed stent was the older by ten years perhaps and by experience and temper should have been the chosen man in their case but he seemed always to want nothing of it to want that nothing extra be required of him other than honest duty as a private soldier hervey still had his doubts about him as coverman as for rudd he was a shiny dragoon no doubt about it but as yet there seemed no edge to him that would make him fit for command it was wainwright not yet twenty who held the pals esteem indeed the more hervey saw of him and the more he thought about it the more he was convinced that wainwright had singular promise what was beyond doubt was that yesterday both jobie wainwright and shepherd stent had shown instinctive and selfless courage england bred her heroes rough mused hervey but breed them she did they were late striking off next morning hervey had been expecting a rendezvous with the chakma guides the evening before but there had been no sign of them by eight oclock the troop having breakfasted and done an hours making and mending there was still no sign of them hervey spoke with seton canning and armstrong i dont like just sitting and waiting the track were following is clear enough and the chittagong guides say theyre certain it leads to the border the chakma will have no difficulty finding us if theyre as good as they say i intend pressing on and making up lost time armstrong made as if to turn but seton canning looked mildly troubled why might the chakma not be here hervey youre not inclined to see any mischief hervey grimaced to himself no im not inclined to not yet there are any number of reasons why they mightnt have shown the haste with which we mounted things to begin with these folk work to a different clock from us mr seton canning sir added armstrong it were just the same in spain there youd wait days for some bandit to leave off what he was doing and in any case i dont see any alternative herveys voice had an edge to it again seton canning made no reply just after midday with close on four hours of marching behind them the troop halted for the second rest the going had become harder than the day before the ground now climbing towards the tribal tracts but the way was wide enough still to permit two horses to go abreast this was important for it allowed the ncos to patrol the column although as yesterday they found remarkably little dereliction or inactivity to reprove the troop had taken longer than prescribed at the first halt since they had ridden for longer the way being too steep to pull up for some miles and it had been the same with the second halt for hervey had wanted to draw closer to the river by his calculations they were now within three hours of the border the chittagong guides seemed sure of it too although they conceded that their knowledge of these parts was sparse there was still no sign of the chakma however and hervey knew that soon the guides would be wholly beyond their reach not that they had shown the least hesitation so far quite the opposite indeed one of them an arakani boatman whom somervile had said knew the rivers well seemed positively fired with the notion of the coming blow at his peoples oppressor he told hervey in broken urdu that he knew the country well enough to take them to the boats and hervey could but admire the mans determination to be at them and he reasoned he was not himself entirely without resource in navigation the way they had come had been the way of the karnaphuli and that was the essential detail even if for much of the time the river had been out of sight hervey leaned back against a tree where johnson had placed a blanket for him to sit and peered again at his map that morning he had checked constantly by his travelling compass and he was as confident as any might be of their position and course he decided to press on as soon as the rest was up but he judged it time to make packhorses of the troopers pulling the galloper guns for if the way deteriorated much more wheels would be an encumbrance also he did not want to be disassembling guns in a place not of his own choosing he sent word for the daffadar to make ready as soon as he could in a quarter of an hour he got up and walked to the back of the column there he was surprised to find wheels and trunnions barrels and trails already stripped down and distributed between the two gunhorses and the four spares he hoped they would be as quick if not quicker reassembling them when the time came a ball and a bag of grape would be a powerful blow to the enemy not for its material effect so much as for the shock of cannon fire in so wholly unexpected a place the afternoon was the hardest for the most part the dragoons had to lead not only to spare the horses but because the way was ever more overgrown saj trees crowded the way their grey bark like crocodile skin and bhorla creepers coiling like snakes about their trunks soon the horses were being led singlefile so heavy were the vines and creepers that here and there a branch and sometimes a whole tree had collapsed across the way and the farriers axes would be called up and while the axes swung the dragoons stood the respite welcome they had shed their coats at the second halt on command but the sweat ran freely still some swore there was less air to breathe others feared that trees might fall behind them like coffin lids some thought secretly of flight but what chance might they have in this green prison and with ncos like armstrong and collins ay and mccarthy after them only a very few of them could take pleasure in what the jungle offered their eyes orchids little dabs of colour in the gloom or the strange shapes of the dhak trees dark crooked skeletons which in two or three months time would burst into flower orange and red the flame of the forest jobie wainwright could jobie saw pleasing things in the most wretched of places it was why the common had not made a felon of him as it had many another for the rest there were not half a dozen who might share jobies pleasure in the forest they might be sons of the crowding streets of a great city but cities werent forests they were not haunted by all manner of beasts that might kill in an instant whose strike was sudden and unseen and at night even in the drearest foggiest rookery there were not ghostly creatures that slid or shuffled as here about the forest floor that darted between the trees or crept about their branches hervey could see their unease all too well as he walked back along the column when they were halted to clear a third tree but at the rear was armstrong looking for all the world as if he were merely at stables at hounslow even armstrong was neither fearful of nor partial to the forest he was entirely unmoved by it the forest was there and he was in it that was that this is chatty country all right he opined as hervey pushed past the last dragoon and getting chattier by the looks of it hervey took off his shako wiped his brow with his sleeve and raised his eyebrows the guides say it will get no worse well not much worse do they know what theyre about well theyre putting on a good show if they dont they say we should reach the river again before six it was now a little after three and thats the border and then we can ride its length for about a mile and that will place us to advantage above where the boats are where do you want to make camp for the night then just short of the river we can water and then retire a furlong or so to bivouac youll be wanting to push out scouts then i think id better is all well with you ay sir them packers have been struggling a bit of late but theyre sticking with it the gunhorses or the quartermasters both but them skinners men are good hervey nodded a cheering report was ever welcome the struggle past the column was worth it for that alone he replaced his shako and made to turn well the river will be a fine thing again the canteens are getting empty it was fortunate that the third saj had lain where it had for within half an hour the scouts signalled alarm corporal ashbolt first scout hurried back to report finding hervey now at the front of the column just behind the pointmen trivers ahead sir three hundred yards but there are voices what sort of voices asked hervey his unease at once apparent to the guides beside him difficult to tell sir replied ashbolt highpitched like women but they might not be corporal mccarthy reckons there are three different ones at least hervey was even more dismayed women meant a village the guides had said they would encounter no settlement he decided he would tell them nothing for the moment mr seton canning and the serjeantmajor please he said to his trumpeter and serjeant collins it took a full five minutes to assemble them the scouts have come on the river and heard voices which might be female said hervey as matteroffact as he could i want to take a look for myself with you serjeant collins collins nodded mr seton canning to have the troop stand to if you please his lieutenant nodded likewise how are the packhorses serjeantmajor theyre managing all right sir good well lets make a start storrs will come as relay and sarntmajor i want a close eye on the guides ay sir mine itll be an all hervey took his carbine from the saddle bucket a sudden thought of the repeater falling from henriettas hands made him hesitate the first thought of her in days he recovered himself quickly by shaking his head at private johnson johnson didnt need to ask aloud if he could come he always wanted to and the answer was always no stent did not even look his duty it was to go with him they had gone not more than a few dozen yards when a noisy flock of lorikeets took off from a tree to their left a whistling whirl of red and blue and bright green hervey swung round carbine raised to face whatever would be the manifestation of the enemy just as suddenly all was stillness again they waited a while hervey now more aware than ever of just how vulnerable was the troop the jungle offered cover from view but at a price once discovered the troop would be an unwieldy body overwhelmed in an instant they had practised a little in the time they had had between the warning order and leaving chittagong but it had not been much more than picketing front and rear if they were assailed from a flank there was little they could do nothing indeed but draw sabres and fight hervey signalled the others to follow they trod slowly and carefully eyes searching left and right into the thickening undergrowth it took a full ten minutes to come up to corporal mccarthy he looked relieved to see them it could not have been more than half an hour since ashbolt had left him but the forest had a way of stretching time well said hervey voice lowered gesturing for him not to stand up as he approached voices went about five minutes ago sor replied mccarthy rising to a crouch they didnt stop sudden though just trailed off an intelligent observation thought hervey have you been forward to look again no sor i was going to give it a few minutes more in case they were coming back hervey nodded approving but another thing sor he added sounding puzzled the river doesnt run as youd expect it to hervey narrowed his eyes well sor i expected it would run from our right to our left but it runs the other way hervey was astonished he looked at his watch there was but two hours light left wed better take another look they rose and began to advance halfcrouching after fifty yards they heard voices angry ones hervey looked at mccarthy and ashbolt they nodded same ones sir whispered ashbolt hervey dropped to one knee and motioned the others to do the same he listened intently not knowing for what only for some clue to inform his next move then the voices sounded closer he strained every nerve to hear there was no doubt the voices were coming towards them he waved his hand at the others to get into cover on the left then he himself backed a couple of yards into the undergrowth all that was needed to conceal them he had less than a minute to calculate he had no idea if the voices were hostile he could let them pass and rely on the pointmen but they might have no warning he dared not draw his sword for fear of being heard how many times in the past had he lamented the steel scabbard he could not risk a shot suddenly there were men in coloured shirts on the track in front of him and a woman with a rope around her neck in that instant he judged them to be false he leapt forward with his carbine at the port the others followed drawing swords as best they could the woman screamed and dropped to her knees one of the men drew a knife but collins gave him the point under the breastbone and the man fell squealing like stuck pig another lunged at the woman his eyes wild corporal ashbolt cut the knife from his hand with a deft flex of the wrist then drove the point into his side the man fell without a sound eyes even wilder legs and arms thrashing the third took off back down the track collins and hervey gave chase but he was too fleet shoot bellowed hervey collins dropped to a knee took aim with his carbine and fired the shot felled the man and at once set the forest alive with noise christ hissed hervey but what choice had he they ran to the body and collins began searching i reckon this is probably illgotten sir he said holding out a bag of gold coin youd better put him in the undergrowth sarnt collins said hervey shaking his head ill go and see how the others are the other two men were dead and their bodies too had yielded up gold the girl was now silent though she looked fearful her features were not those of the men which were the same as any about the bazaars in chittagong hers was a face of some refinement the nose smaller than the chittagong women and her eyes turned up a little her salwar kameez a deep blue silk was quite unsuited to the forest hervey tried his urdu but to no avail seton canning and armstrong arrived breathless with the guides in tow was that your shot hervey hervey nodded it will have put every man on his guard for miles what can the guides tell us about these two i wonder he gestured at the bloody bodies the guides did not need long dacoiti badhja seton canning looked at hervey for enlightenment bandits and gypsies hervey thought it some relief at least to know they had not despatched innocent men and the girl added seton canning she was indeed not long out of her teens if at all hervey asked the guides but they couldnt speak to her either he cursed to himself youd better get the surgeon up pretty little thing said armstrong approvingly ill get the daffadar to try talking just stepped out of a pallerquin by the looks of her i wonder how thats not the half of it sarntmajor hervey told them about the river im going to take a good look wed better expect the worst too keep the troop stood to till i return what about burying these sir asked armstrong shallow graves only was the reply almost casually hervey groaned as he saw for himself the worst the river looked the same as before but it flowed the wrong way he took out his compass and laid it on the ground a carbine daniel coates had given him had once been his saving coatess compass might yet prove as valuable the needle settled in a direction he had not expected indicating north much further to the left the track had evidently been veering and so gradually he hadnt noticed he cursed for not having checked in more than an hour what do you reckon sir asked serjeant collins weve come more to the east than we ought thats all i know those guides im just not sure all weve done is follow the same track sir it was true the guides had led them nowhere but along the same welltrodden track i wonder then what the chakma would have done i suppose they would have led us off the track there was no undergrowth to speak of for a lot of the way collins looked at him for the next move it was at such a moment that the privilege of command could almost be measured by weight hervey was thinking for all he was worth im trying to picture the country without the trees sarnt collins but its strange for all that this river cant join the karnaphuli there isnt any junction between where we crossed and chittagong he picked up a stick and started to draw in the earth it must mean theres high ground between here and where we should be do you see ay sir so if we follow the needle due north and the ground rises we should recover ourselves theres no chance your compass is false sir the thought had occurred to hervey too well i cant picture the ground any other way the river cant be the karnaphuli we cant have crossed it without noticing we bivouac here then sir i think wed better a strict rule of silence was the order of the bivouac that evening hervey posted sentries well forward towards the river and he allowed cooking fires only in pits the tethering lines were cramped the track being so narrow but the horses were quiet enough indeed it seemed to hervey that they had taken to the forest extraordinarily well unmoved by its strange noises and content to chew its green shoots whenever there was a halt his admiration for the marwaris grew daily not least for what fine doers they were seeming happy with a few handfuls of gram of a morning and evening rations on which an english trooper would soon have lost condition in the case of the dragoons their appetites were not in the least diminished hervey had gone to some trouble to find good salt beef before they left and it boiled up well in the surprisingly sweet river water of which they had had ample since leaving chittagong only the skinners sowars were less than content for no amount of salt mutton could altogether replace the live goats even so the instinct for fresh rations remained strong with the dragoons for hervey watched with admiration as one of the warminster pals plucked a coucal which had fallen to the slingshot as it clambered too sluggishly in the branches above after he had looked at every horse with the farrier hervey called together seton canning vanneck and armstrong and told them his intentions for the morning he began with his assessment of how they had come too far to the east and what action they must take to remedy it he confessed freely that the absence of the chakma guides now worried him for whereas the chittagong guides had previously given him confidence that they could proceed without them he was no longer so sure not least because he wondered if he could trust them but he declared resolutely the avan war barges astride a river such as the karnaphuli could not be concealed from those determined to find them even in jungle like this seton canning asked what should be done about the woman little more than a girl indeed to which hervey confessed also that he neither knew what to do with her beyond entrusting her to the surgeon nor what her presence signified the daffadar had been able to have but few words with her concluding that she was as respectable as her rich silks suggested beyond the general intelligence that her people were avan there was little more he could discover hervey saw no necessity to deviate from his course however especially since collins had scouted some way along the river and found no sign of habitation but he wanted the dragoons to know what difficulties lay ahead and he said he would be obliged if they his officers would be as candid with the men as he had been with them in spain once he told them after a day in which everything that might go wrong had joseph edmonds then captain had spoken frankly with his troop the men cast down by the events had been visibly stiffened by their captains confidences and their spirits restored on hearing what was his plan for the morning as a consequence added hervey he himself had come to trust more than many in the innate good sense of the private dragoon even when his instincts sometimes told him otherwise as ever theory was not wholly justified by practice at standto in the morning armstrong was beside himself with anger as he reported to the troop lieutenant hervey standing close by could scarcely believe what he heard absent sarntmajor ay sir absent gone hervey felt a wrench at his gut when how hes been gone since before midnight thats all i can tell mossop couldnt find him for the sentry change then but he supposed he was bedded down somewhere else it was as black as pitch last night damned fool mossop armstrong did not at heart disagree theres not much we could have done about it even so theres no fear hes lost himself in the thick of all this i couldnt say for certain sir but the orders were that no one was to leave the lines even to ease himself if it were anybody but dodds i might be inclined to give it a thought there was no rebuke in armstrongs voice but hervey presumed there was one in his mind the bad character is out at last sarntmajor i fear so sir hervey fell silent for a moment i shall see him hanged he almost spat the words he pronounced sentence so very determinedly indeed that seton canning shivered armstrong stood silent awaiting orders very well mr seton canning sarntmajor stand down rounds in five minutes if you please a morning round should not have been necessary after the inspection the night before but hervey wanted to look each man in the eye in truth he doubted them less than he doubted his own judgement and that indeed was the reason for the rounds to restore his own pride and his authority perhaps for it was well known that it had been he who had championed the reform of a known bad character against all the usages of the service and the instincts of his ncos he need not have troubled though there was not a man who appeared in the slightest degree dismayed by doddss desertion doddss flight earned the contempt of the bold and showed to the most timid that they possessed more courage than did another whereas before they might have thought that none could be possessed of less a discovery to fortify their own resolve indeed hervey was much brightened by the round he wished he could get the whole troop back into the saddle now to parade in threes and have them in a brisk trot to put the swing into them again rather than another mornings plodding as yesterday but that would have to wait if his calculations were right it would be a day before they broke cover then they could go at it with a swing all right he felt his hand twitch to be at the sabre but for now he could not even give an animating word of command to advance let alone sound the trumpet only a hand signal a wave to have the troop set off in single file and it could not be a wave that set them off as one as on parade rather it had to be the french way each man in turn so displeasing to an english eye if hervey disliked the jungle as much as did his men it was for different reasons in an hour to his immense relief the ground began to rise as he had calculated and with that change in inclination he felt a general rise in spirits the pace was slower the sweating men and horses even more prodigious but with each step came the satisfaction of nearing the quarry if any dragoon were anxious of what was to come his fear was dulled by the anticipation of at last being able to swing his sabre to a purpose and to discharge his carbine at more than a roundel that and the standing he knew it would bring when they returned to calcutta a fearful cry broke the toiling silence hervey swung round who in gods name is that he cursed reaching for his sword as if he would inflict his own punishment the column faltered for an instant then struggled on with anxious glances over shoulders a short while later garbled word reached hervey that private french had been attacked by something and could not move he halted the column and pushed his way back roughly past two dozen dragoons and more until he came to the unfortunate french lying motionless his face swollen beyond recognition his arms across his chest and his fingers puffed up like cucumbers what in gods name snake sir it must have been suggested corporal mossop the nco nearest beggin yer pardon sir piped private rudd the rank behind it were bees bees hervey knelt to feel for frenchs pulse he could see the rise and fall of his chest well enough ay sir im sure of it they just seemed to be rushing at him thats not bees said mossop certain of the symptoms plain to see bees dont do that hervey shook his head i wouldnt be too sure english bees perhaps not but here french remained silent and immobile hervey searched for the obvious clues well theres no sign of any bite and i cant see how a snake could have bit through those overalls armstrong and the surgeon arrived ah ledley bees or a snakebite i can find no sign the surgeon made a tutting sound as he saw his patient hows his pulse it seemed weak but i couldnt tell for sure the surgeon took up frenchs wrist not troubling with a watch im not surprised his hands so swollen its hard to find the pulse at all who saw the snake i didnt actually see it sir replied mossop his confidence only slightly diminished then dont speculate said ledley brusquely worse than useless corporal mossop looked crestfallen who saw the bees then i did sir ledley turned to see his patient of a few days ago those stitches can come out tomorrow by the look of them you saw these bees i didnt exactly see the bees sir just french flaying his hands about his head as if he were being attacked by em mm said ledley thoughtfully not definitive but good enough in the circumstances bee stings then asked hervey anxious for confirmation so that they could decide their course near enough by now the surgeon had had a close look at frenchs face plumped and red like a gourd on a scarecrow not bees though said ledley shaking his head hornets jungle hornets brutish little devils by all accounts and the evidence before us even armstrong looked appalled at the transformation of the dragoons features by so small an agent and in so rapid a manner only the thick black curls gave away its owner will he live sir i dont know said the surgeon briskly if he lives the next quarter of an hour then he ought to be safe he reached into his saddlebag water if you please private rudd unslung his canteen and handed it to the surgeon ledley poured a cupful into an enamelled bowl and added five drops of clear liquid from a glass phial he lifted frenchs head with one hand and put the bowl to his lips drink this my lad all of it french who had hitherto shown no sign of sentience began at once to sip what is it asked hervey digitalis to stimulate the heart thats his greatest need at present hervey took armstrong to one side ill leave one man with him rudd and a surgeons orderly but even them we can scarcely spare armstrong nodded but rudds too good a man when were short already the orderly ought to be able to mind him on his own why not make the woman stay an all if dodds had not stolen away in the night like some hervey bit his lip and nodded youre right just the orderly and the woman and boy porrit youd better see to it then ill get the troop moving at the next halt frenchs misfortune was retailed through the ranks from the back of the column to the front and by the time it reached the pointmen hornets were no longer the culprit but giant batlike creatures which tore at the flesh and sucked blood more voraciously than a dozen bull leeches hervey had to walk the length of the column again to allay the consternation with some difficulty he managed also to inform the skinners sowars of the affair but they knew full well what had been the cause and revealed that they had left powdered cow dung with the orderly to be made into a paste and applied to the swollen parts hervey whose respect for native medicine had been settled during his previous sojourn in india hoped the orderly would not scruple to use it at three oclock at the scouts bidding they halted hervey went forward to see what had prompted them the covers changing sir said serjeant collins its getting thicker it must mean were coming to the edge hervey smiled thankfully to himself there were but half a dozen men in the troop who would have drawn such an inference he checked his map and his calculations it was certainly possible and its been flat going for a full two hours he said pleased to be able to corroborate collinss observation i think id like to scout forward a little more sir can the troop hold a while i think ill gamble on a bivouac sarnt collins said hervey sensing they might make contact with the burmans sooner rather than later but how he wished the chakma were with him for it was now that their intimate knowledge would be of most use to stumble on outposts or make camp too close would be the devil of a thing after all they had been through he turned to his trumpeter storrs my compliments to mr seton canning and well bivouac where they stand now i shall go forward with serjeant collins to spy things out have the pointmen sent up to join corporal ashbolt here as picket and have the daffadar reassemble the guns very good sir said storrs closing his notebook hervey laid down his carbine and pistol and yours too he said to collins and stent if we come upon an outpost we shall have to carry it with steel one shot and it might be the death of us all chapter twentytwo immediate action later its a finebalanced thing sarntmajor but i think it best to attack at first light the camp had the look of receiving troops at any minute but theyre not likely to be marching in during the night so theres nothing to lose in that respect hervey sipped gratefully at the hot sweet tea which johnson had waiting for him he took out his watch again they had been gone for the best part of two hours and there were but two more until darkness armstrong relit his pipe sat back on the fallen tree which served as the troop orderly room and put his heel on a tiny scorpion emerging from under a dead leaf about half a mile you say sir we could just about do it before dark at least wed have the night to burn the boats hervey was conscious of going against every cavalry precept we couldnt be sure theyd not march in once we began the fight though no matter how afeard they were of moving about the jungle by night if they heard the sound of a fight theyd surely make for it you would ay and its as well never to suppose the enemys any less canny just so in daylight we surely have a better chance of holding them off if only to make good our escape ay youre right sir how many do you reckon there are there now three hundred perhaps four most of those are bargees but there are lines laid out for a thousand more and i reckon the boats will carry twice that number armstrong did not so much look dismayed at the numbers as incredulous and they would assemble that many men in the forest and paddle em all that way to chittagong what a business when they could be on the place from the sea with not a fraction of the trouble hervey had rehearsed the same doubts with somervile they couldnt do it unnoticed though and if there were one frigate in sight then theyd be blown from out of the water no sarntmajor i think this is a deuced clever plan and i think we have come on it not a day too soon armstrong took his pipe from his mouth and looked at the bowl in despair he hoped the troops powder was drier than his tobacco just so im sure which side of the river do we come out of the forest on hervey smiled to himself armstrong the worldweary nco resigned to whatever his officer had embroiled him in the avan side sarntmajor just as wed always intended no more wet feet then i cant promise that but there is a bridge armstrong was not inclined to dispute it further and so how shall we go at them hervey had yet to finish writing his orders the whole assembly area is open grass and planting nothing that i could see above four feet high and firm going its not rice planting or the like he cleared the ground of leaves in front of where they sat and took up a stick to make a sketch in the earth drawing two lines like the letter x heres the river he began pointing to the line which ran right to left its not much more than a chain across two dozen yards at most and no deeper than an elephants ears armstrong raised an eyebrow are there many of them im coming to that but no half a dozen and i should say the waters no less sluggish than where we crossed he now pointed to the other line in the earth this i surmise is the white elephants road its certainly running in the right direction there is north he added bisecting the right quadrants angle we are here he pointed to where the line representing the river would project explaining that it turned southwest not far below the assembly area and here he pointed to where the lines intersected theres a bridge of sorts i couldnt get a good look but all i saw on it were men on their feet so ive no idea if it will take the weight of a horse let alone a bullock cart or a galloper gun armstrong nodded silently hervey then made marks either side of the line representing the river below the intersection this is where the barges are pulled up on the banks either side and most of them on logs so they can be launched the more easily the elephants seem to be used for hauling them out of the water but their work looked done for the most part a pity theyre on both sides said armstrong just so we cant avoid a crossing now the burman fighting men are all in tented lines here added hervey pointing to the northern quadrant so theyre all on our side of the river they must be our immediate objective for if they get under arms therell be the very devil of a fight we should attack in darkness then said armstrong without hesitation youre right but how might we ever keep the troop in hand we both have the memory of that beach at brighton indeed they did yet armstrong would still have reckoned it the only course except for one thing we have the guns of course this time exactly so said hervey with a faint smile a whiff of grape i dont see why it shouldnt work for us and i shall want you to have command of those guns i shall want you to have them play wherever theres need of them without my even having to think of it armstrong had not a moments doubt all the burmans who surrender are to be driven across the bridge and held there by corporal ashbolt like horatius who it doesnt matter cornet vanneck will take half a dozen men to picket the road where it debouches from the forest and the rest of us will set about destroying the barges also the bridge and then well withdraw the way we came sounds easy enough hervey smiled wryly it is easy until the first shot armstrong raised his eyebrows ay always first shot and bets are off how much kindling did you see by the way they had brought four gallons of lamp oil with them enough for a pint to each barge but each would need packing with combustibles to guarantee a good blaze theres a fair amount of tentage and a good stack of hay replied hervey confidently and the oars he had already decided to fire the barges off the water rather than risk having them recovered if they sank only partially burned private johnson came up and ever wary of armstrong saluted leave to speak sir theres some snap ready when thas a mind thank you johnson said hervey throwing aside the stick and wiping his hands on his overalls five minutes more armstrong resumed his questions taking out his notebook what time do you want reveille then four oclock that will give us two hours of darkness to get close we should move off sharp at five and there was a terrible squealing from the middle of the tethering line made worse by the surrounding silence hervey sprang up christ theyll hear that a mile off he rasped reaching for his carbine armstrong was already on his feet they hurried to the noise broken like a dry stick said corporal ashbolt crouching by the troopers foreleg yours no sir stents the horse one of the marwaris stood silent now sweating heavily her cannon bone hanging limply the kicker had already been slipped from the tether line and taken away that other were being proper riggish cursed stent just come up i should have kept mine apart hervey thought it pointless to agree or otherwise wheres the farrier here sir came the reply from an equally sweating farrier brennan i was at the back tightenin them skinners shoes this one to despatch then im afraid said hervey shaking his head not with the pistol though sir good god no silent work if you please brennan a dragoon was sent to fetch the farriers axe meanwhile they unslipped the horses either side of the doomed trooper to make space not an easy job at the best of times hervey did not know whether brennan had despatched an animal in this way before but he did not think it the time to ask instead without a word but with a great deal of care they pulled the little mare onto her side she kept her head up though and stent put his knee on her withers to discourage her from trying to rise bring her a couple of pecks of oats please corporal he said stroking the mares neck the axe was brought a minute or two later by then farrier brennan had cut away the mane just behind the poll to expose the occipital depression where the axes spearpoint could most easily penetrate and sever the cervical cord shepherd stent gave his mare a handful of oats and pulled one of her ears fondly hold er ead steady said brennan raising the axe stent crouched with his knees either side of her muzzle as she ground the oats in her mouth brennan swung the axe down powerful confident the mare squealed then grunted lashing out with her legs though the shepherd held on brennan put his foot to her neck to get enough purchase to pull out the axe there was remarkably little blood again said hervey anxious the mares eyes were wide and her legs were still kicking no sir replied brennan stent would not let her go mick no said brennan simply and in a few seconds more she was motionless stent closed the mares eyes and got up thanks mick hervey saw the look too the first sign of emotion he had detected in the shepherd ive butchered a good many sheep mick but i couldnt have done that brennan looked satisfied rather than pleased with his skill ive not had to do that since corunna but you didnt flinch when i swung the axe mind shep well done farrier said hervey we could not have afforded the noise otherwise right private stent take one of the led horses and look sharp bonny lad added armstrong with just enough of a bark to put an end to the condoling ive stoodto the front section sir he added hervey nodded well just have to wait then perhaps one more beast calling in the jungle wont raise the alarm but a gun at the point would be prudent i think ill go forward to the pickets to see how strong it carried to them ill do that sir said armstrong you have something to eat and then give them orders out yes geordie youre right thank you after standdown when it was dark hervey went round the troop and spoke to every man the sowars too not of things of any moment just a few words whatever seemed appropriate if only whether they knew the password sometimes it was a thought about home sometimes about india it did not matter just as long as he spoke to each man and thereby assured them of his own peace of mind about the morning as seton canning put it to cornet vanneck a little touch of hervey in the night every man knew that their captain had found the burmans without the aid of the chakma guides and most of them knew in their hearts that they themselves would have given up long before they liked their captains determination it made it so much the harder to do anything but follow him when he was done hervey found his way to the place where his groom had laid his blanket and sat down tired yet content ive kept thi snap warm capn ervey sir but itll be nowt like it were johnson i could eat he almost said a horse but it was not the thing i could eat that wretched bird i saw spreadbury plucking last night johnson sensed rather than saw herveys frown they didnt eat it in the end they chucked it away it tasted so bad they found a length o snake in its gizzard hervey could have retched ive just discovered im not hungry thall be all right sir its taties and beef but its a bit of a squash ill make a fresh mashin o tea that was what hervey would prize above all now more so even than the whisky in his spare canteen he slept well checking the picket he left to seton canning and the serjeantmajor that was their job his now was to rest to find the sleep that had eluded him these past three days just before four oclock johnsons hand shook his shoulder as it had more times than had henriettas but as hervey took the enamelled cup he could see the steam rising even in the darkness he thought of her and it was the first time since chittagong that the thought had been more than momentary what made him hold it now he did not know but he puzzled over her absence from his mind for so many days and he did not know whether to be discouraged or the very opposite ill be glad to be gone from this place right enough grumbled johnson i were bitten alive by mesquitoes last night now that johnson mentioned it hervey too found himself scratching at bites about his hands and face because were nearer the river i imagine bastard things they is i wonder ow frenchs gooin on wi them bee stings say your prayers that we see him later today replied hervey in a supplicatory tone at five oclock the troop stepped off hervey with the pointmen and no scouts he knew what lay ahead the men had put rotting leaves from the forest floor in the backs of their shakos the curious phosphorescence as on the hands of his watch a useful beacon in the pitch dark of the jungle predawn standto and breaking camp had been a model how quickly these men had mastered the game he mused would older dogs have been so quick to learn new tricks perhaps after all the ncos had done the teaching as well as the jungle and this morning they had all eaten hot a rare achievement indeed in a bivouac by six they were close enough to the forests edge to see fires burning in the burman camp hervey felt the thrill that at last their progress was over from now on it was battle and the fortunes of battle and the price of battle he did not doubt the outcome for he did not think of it pass the word ball cartridge load guns make ready he heard the ramminghome of charges in carbines behind him but no louder than it need have been and he peered towards the east for the signs of lightening in the sky the dawn came quickly on them in these parts and five minutes made a difference he wanted a sign before they broke cover he took out his watch how practical a contribution to killing the kings enemies had daniel coatess presents been the old soldier would revel in its telling when he received herveys letter after this was all over it was so accurate a watch too it told him there were but ten minutes to the first rays of the sun and thereafter he knew he would have six more before there was sufficient light to see a white horse at a furlong pass the word mount he heard the jingle of bits the creaking of leather the whickering of horses keen for the off the thrill of it never palled draw swords the chilling chafing of steel on steel it sent a shiver down his spine as if he had touched rubbed amber troop will advance out they came at the walk so as to make no more noise than they need he could feel their eagerness somehow though and wanted as much as they to lower his sword and gallop at once on the burman lines he waved the sabre to left and right above his head those immediately behind him would see it and repeat it and begin the movement into line just as he had told them last night the first wisps of sunlight broke the line of the forest canopy to their right almost to the minute of his calculation auguries of success dared he hope the nearest campfires were only fifty more yards would this spell the end of their stealth on they walked the fires were dying untended there was no one afoot just a huddle of sleeping figures by the first of them collins and two others jumped from the saddle and made sure they would never rise again swift silent execution hervey was proud of them the line had scarcely slowed but collins and the other sabrists were back in the saddle and in their places before another twenty yards the next would be easy no sentries no alarm they might go through the burman lines and sabre every one of them in their sleep except that no luck ever held so long hervey knew he must stick with his plan even if it meant surrendering some of the surprise that was his for the reaping the light was now enough to make out the whole of the camp the white tents standing like snowcaps see your opportunity sarntmajor herveys voice was hushed but his exhilaration evident armstrong beckoned his guns all in lines like regulars on chobham common a shame were loaded with grape nevertheless they could wring havoc in minutes and the skinners sowars knew it wheeling full about and unhitching the guns with the fervour of hounds on to a fox there were no orders portfires went to touchholes just as soon as the gunners dropped their hands to signal on the guns belched flame and a thousand pieces of iron at the first tents not a dozen yards away their reports becoming as one roar in that forest arena all the louder for the enforced silence of the past days the nearest tents and the ones just beyond blew down like corn stooks in a sudden squall then came the screaming a terrible devilish noise that unnerved many a dragoon as he sat contemplating the gallopers work for hervey it meant nothing more than his prevailing over the enemy it was what he wanted to hear the sowars almost bayed as they reloaded urged on by armstrong waving his sword and shrieking every kind of profanity hervey urged them just as fervently but below his breath the righthand gun beat the left by barely a second another two angry explosions louder than before with increased charges for the double shot sent four twopound balls bowling down the tent lines doing untold slaughter within out from those still standing tumbled halfnaked burmans dazed not even able to take up their muskets from the armpiles with the sun rising above the forest it was time to test the ageold business of cavalry and we shall shock them said hervey aloud bible again capn ervey came the voice at his left no johnson only shakespeare trumpeter sound charge he would never have done it against formed troops not put untried dragoons into a charge from the halt but he didnt need weight only the noise of hoofs and the sight of sabres lowered the burmans ran this way and that like rabbits scattering before greyhounds one or two ran into swords but for the most part the dragoons had not the skill to despatch their prey it did not matter the burmans were broken go to it harry called hervey to seton canning then looked about for his trumpeter storrs he bellowed sir called storrs struggling to remount the other side of a tent what in gods name didnt see the guyrope sir corporal ashbolt and johnson closed to help him look sharp storrs i hope that bugle of yours is whole sound rally storrs back in the saddle blew it well octave intervals by no means easy when winded good man cheered hervey mr vanneck the cornet was close by there was blood on his sabre well done myles take your picket off drive well up the road to begin with ill send the guns up when i can very good sir he turned and started gathering his halfdozen hervey rode back to the guns which the sowars had already hitched up shabash sipahi shabash armstrong looked impressed very good shooting indeed the quartermaster had not been idle during the skirmish hervey saw him and his men already piling oil and kindling into the barges the sooner they could get the canvas in the better hervey told seton canning to have the burmans begin the work for them the surgeon had difficulty bringing his horse to a halt he had work to do and was keen to be about it have a care ledley called hervey and then turned to johnson go and help the surgeon dismount he said despairingly ledley made straight for the stricken tents from the shrieks and groans he knew that his skill was sorely needed though he feared he would not be able to do much but staunching and binding he was the only man in the troop who wished the burman battalions would come soon for they would be the only hope for their fallen comrades hervey watched as the surgeon set about the carnage with his assistants coolly assessing the scale and priorities of his task after days of moving at a snails pace through the forest the sudden liberation made everything seem as if in double time and the exhilaration of the assault and the utter rout gave each man an ardour that the duke himself would have been proud to see but hervey knew this might change at any moment with the arrival of the burman battalions he looked at his watch it was half an hour since they had crept out of the forest and not much less since the first gun had fired if the burmans were encamped anywhere within five miles he could expect some of them here within an hour for the noise of the galloper guns had surely carried that distance even through the forest he surmised the burmans would not have made camp closer than that for would they not have pressed on the extra hour or so to where canvas awaited them if they had cavalry they would be so much the quicker but somervile had not spoken of it why indeed would they have cavalry if they could not embark them hervey took his compass from the carrying case on the saddle the needle swung to where he expected but he wanted to make sure beyond the influence of the iron and steel about him out of the saddle he climbed unfastened his swordbelt and handed it and the reins to johnson then walked ten paces before he was satisfied that the compass reading was a true one is it all right capn ervey sir enquired johnson confident equally in his officer and in officers apparatuses yes its all right johnson yon other road into the forest goes just as it should id be powerfully tempted to take it homewards were it not for french and the others johnson handed him back his swordbelt and reins ill ave a prog around if tha doesnt mind ill peg thisn an let im ave a bit o grass hervey had no objection his second charger had its head down already he climbed back into the saddle search those bigger tents first maps letters anything ill take a look myself when ive had the guns moved the quartermaster and armstrong had got all but five of the barges on their bank ablaze another quarter of an hour and all would be done this side some of the burmans were already taking canvas across the bridge their double time prompted more by the sabres of seton cannings men than natural ardour hervey wondered if their spirit would return once the troop were gone if they would try to follow and harry them that was another reason to have them all on the far side of the river and the bridge burned when the time came he glanced over to where the surgeon was working he would not go to him though he would not trouble himself with the sight of dead and dying men when there might be more yet to add to the butchers bill he had never been qualmish of such things well rarely but he had never been indifferent to what the ball and the cutting edge did to a mans flesh guns ready sahib reported the daffadar his yellow kurta begrimed with black powder smoke very good daffadar follow me if you please hervey reined right towards the white elephant road but before he led them away he would speak with his lieutenant mr seton canning the lieutenant spurred at once from the bridge see to it sharp harry every minute makes me keen for the off of course hervey he replied half the troubles that bridge it creaks and sways in a crazy fashion with only half a dozen on it hervey nodded well at least it wont take much chopping at when the time comes ill leave storrs with you he can sound recall when youre ready seton canning saluted as hervey dug his spurs into the marwaris flanks johnson lifted the pot from the fire and poured boiling water into an enamel cup hervey meanwhile studied the papers and map in the leatherbound portfolio whats tha think sir hervey furrowed his brow i cant make out a word i dont know if the guides could but the maps suggestive id say it seems to have chittagong and the river at least johnson lifted the muslin bag from the cup and laid it to one side he poured in sugar and arrack and stirred the liquid with a twig hervey took it without looking up and there seems to be a list of some sorts whats tha think o tflag hervey sipped his tea and smiled i shall send it to mr somervile just as soon as we have fired the last barge it and these papers pity there were nowt else shiny things you mean i suspect they thought theyd be garnering plenty enough of that in chittagong is tha gooin to ave a look for thisen hervey looked to where he had posted the galloper guns by the debouch from the forest three hundred yards off and then to the other side of the river he saw armstrong torching the first of the barges there no i think ill stay here it cant be many more minutes before a sudden fusillade in the forest beyond the guns made him spring up johnson rushed to unpeg the horses hervey leapt into the saddle and galloped towards the guns without once looking back stent his coverman and johnson hard behind him vannecks picket was half a mile up the white elephant road hervey reckoned there would be scarcely a minute before the contactman galloped out he reined the marwari to an abrupt halt by the guns no firing mind daffadar first out shall be vannecksahibs men acha sahib hervey turned back to the river and took his telescope from its saddle case he could just make out through the smoke ashbolt corralling the burmans on the far side just as hed ordered lest the firing embolden them but the smoke was too thick to see how many barges still awaited the torch seton canning was assembling the remainder of the troop perhaps two dozen men no more on herveys side of the river he saw them extend into line at the halt and draw swords well done harry he said to himself theyll be the keener for coming up sabres drawn a minute later they were with him walkmarch called seton canning they bumped from the trot haaalt up went his hand trumpeter storrs took his place next to hervey serjeant collins rode at once to the middle your leave sir seton canning nodded now listen you men listen hard began collins in a voice that set every nerve on edge that we did this morning was about as hard as bobbing for apples dhobiwallahs fast asleep and pissing themselves this lotll mean business youd better remember everything you was taught you keep them arms straight no matter what a man on is feet can cut as bad as one astride arms straight he bellowed thrusting out his sabre infantry give point front he leaned forward and lowered his sword to reach beyond his horses head and follow through up swung the sabre behind him his arm straight as a die there was another fusillade it sounded much closer some of the dragoons now looked apprehensive collins was undaunted if those burmans come out astride then dont be in too much of a hurry to cut at them if we go with the point remember your flank sword pressed against the shako to keep it steady and mind your horses heads not a minute later corporal mossop galloped out of the forest as if the hounds of hell were at his heels he had to snatch hard at the curb to pull up his little mare her flanks were in a worse lather than hervey had seen in months sir he gasped saluting once he could afford to free his right hand mr vannecks compliments and theres a column of burmans coming along the road and at the double like light infantry sir we cant tell the numbers for we cant see beyond the front ranks sir we fired on em but they didnt check even to pick up them that was hit we fired on them another twice i think sir i heard so what do they carry muskets of some sort sir they fired on us but no one was hit hervey turned to johnson gallop to the serjeantmajor and tell me how many of the barges have still to be set alight ay sir said johnson calmly not even forgetting to salute he reined about and sped off daffadar shot loaded yes sahib his voice betrayed no emotion but resolve hervey wished he were standing now by mercers troop as he had at waterloo now was the time for sixpounders and shell rather than half that of solid shot he toyed with the idea of putting them where the road debouched from the forest like a cork in a bottle and firing grape it would be much the more destructive but he knew the gunners would not be able to reload quickly enough two discharges at most before being overrun if he could hold the burmans at arms length with shot for a while they could not know at once how many guns there were then the quartermaster and armstrong might just complete their work another fusillade and not more than a hundred yards off hervey braced himself do not fire daffadar it will be vannecksahib first acha sahib hervey looked back to the river he could see johnson galloping towards him but the smoke was so great he could see nothing beyond how much longer could it take to fire those boats daffadar we shall hold our ground until the barges are all alight and then withdraw to the forest whence we came acha sahib hervey had explained the orders well enough before johnson pulled up beside him just as the picket five strong not a man lost galloped out of the forest cornet vanneck at the rear another five to fire yet sir johnson reported not enough oil to prime with though theyre using powder serjeantmajor says theyll need another half an hour hervey grimaced have we not burned enough sir they could scarcely invade chittagong with half a dozen boats asked seton canning those boats have got to burn out harry and the others theres no saying what they could do with them if they put out the flames but is that likely its a possibility hervey snarled that is the point cornet vanneck pulled up hard in front of him his charger throwing its head about wildly he saluted while struggling with the reins in good time mr vanneck said hervey calmly returning the salute there are so many of them sir no sooner did we do our execution but those behind took their place and they came on the while in double time very well we shall see if hot iron and cold steel shall check their ardour herveys manner was so composed as to make his cornet look at him askance as indeed was partly his intention take post please cornet vanneck reined away and with a sheepish look for the little line of dragoons appeared so calm compared with his own agitation not many minutes more and they saw their adversary for the first time but only for a moment fire bellowed hervey startling his own horse the galloper guns thundered enveloping them all in black smoke thicker than the grapeshots for the twopound ball needed more powder to see it the distance hervey trotted forward a little way to see the effect the burmans had checked another volley might see them withdraw if only he could have it now the sowars worked methodically swab to damp the barrel and make safe powder charge rammed home ball tamped with the other end of the swab then the struggle to realign the pieces and the gunner relaying then the prick of priming powder and slow match both guns fired as one again more smoke billowed over them once more hervey trotted forward to see the effect there were even more burmans now but so many dead or dying and the confusion looked the greater he drew his sabre and pointed charge out of the smoke galloped thirty dragoons swords lowered the burmans had no time to deploy they knew it and they turned for the forest but herveys men were on them before they could clear the line of their own dead it was easy no need to guard protect or parry first the point and then the cut and simple cut one nearside cut two offside every sabre was bloodied many of them several times over ragged shots from the forest edge checked their ardour and hervey rallied them to a flank thankful he could see no horse riderless as soon as herveys men cleared their line the guns fired again it would surely make the burmans fall back he thought but no out they poured again still in an illordered fashion for the debouch was too narrow to permit otherwise hervey formed his men into line as best he could then charged again from the flank with only fifty yards a bigger horse might have done greater damage but the little countrybreds were into their stride quickly and sheer momentum broke up the burman ranks with scarcely need for the sabre this time but the pressure did not slacken out of the forest poured more and more of the enemy no matter that they were illordered force of numbers must soon tell hervey turned to rally the line he saw private spreadburys horse tumble fifty yards off spreadbury himself thrown clean from the saddle and dropping his reins a dozen burmans rushed him jobie wainwright saw and spurred at them at once in seconds he was among them turning in the saddle for each cut just as collins had taught him swinging his sabre for all he was worth cut one nearside to the rear two offside to the rear three offside to the front four nearside to the front each time he felled one of the pals attackers and each time he recovered the sabre from side to side above his shako in the manner prescribed collins reordering the line watched in admiration but bayonets jabbed at jobie and his mare too many of them so that soon he could only protect and parry corporal mccarthy galloping back to the rally saw the fight and turned hervey looked over at collins and gave him the nod mccarthy got there first leapt from the saddle and ran at the burmans grasping his sabre by handle and blade as if it were a musket and bayonet collins was there a second or so later and made three cuts so fast that it scarce seemed possible those untouched began to run paddy you dumb cursed irish bastard what the hell dyou think youre doing yelled collins its just a bit easier to me still serjeant replied mccarthy equably picking up his troopers reins and making for private spreadbury christ alive paddy never again no serjeant will ye help me up with private spreadbury please jobie meanwhile hervey had rallied the rest of the troop taking them back at the trot to where the sowars were calmly serving the guns and forming line to the rear ready daffadar ji sahib how long they could keep this up he had no idea if the burmans came out each time the same way they ought to be good for another dozen goes but they would surely not keep hurling themselves on guns and steel so willingly the field went silent now it ought to have been welcome the sign that they had done their work well but not knowing what would follow was unsettling hervey considered dismounting and having them make ready with the carbines but the range was too great to guarantee the effect he looked back at the river there was smoke and fire the length of it but he could still see boats unburned he looked at his little command well done e troop he called smart work we may yet have more of it not many minutes later e troop saw the work to be had out from the forest burst as one a dozen horsemen the guns fired the shot arched and plunged beautifully into the defile but by the time it fell there was no target seconds later more horsemen began pouring out the burmans had the measure of the time to reload the collective inrush of breath behind him left hervey in no doubt of what chance the troop believed it had jesus muttered collins to himself hervey counted quickly fifty of them had they stopped coming the guns fired again no more appeared daffadar grape load ji sahib came the reply as cool as ever the burman horse took their time they were so regular that hervey reckoned it would take the same number at least to prevail over them now remember began collins trotting forward his voice as matteroffact as the daffadars guard he thrust his arm straight and front sabre across his chest parallel with the ground left protect he flexed his wrist upright and to his left the sabre perpendicular right protect he swung it back across his chest and out to his side st george and up went the sabre to protect his head those are the ones youll want then make your cuts hervey knew the guns were useless for the burmans would not ride at them he could stay close and be safe therefore indeed if he didnt the burmans would ride the guns down from a flank but that would leave the field open for them to take the bridge there was only one thing he could do daffadar guns to the bridge troop advance e troop marched forward a dozen paces to mask the guns then halted hervey could only pray the burmans were not as quick as an english cornet was expected to be it took the sowars less than a minute to hitch up the guns but it seemed more as they made to gallop back hervey knew he had at least saved them a minute more and he could retire too but the burman horse began to advance at the trot hervey looked back at the galloper guns it was still too close troop will advance walkmarch he did not want them to cover too much ground every yard they advanced was another painful one to withdraw he had to judge the speed of collision though a fair gallop was what theyd need trot some of the horses broke into threetime instead collinss curses took their riders minds off the enemy for the moment hervey raised his sword above his head gallop every sabre went up arms straight curse you bellowed collins close up close up charge the ragged line of sabres dropped to the guard an instant later they crashed into the burman horse flesh on flesh steel on steel steel on flesh hervey parried an artless cut from a tulwar and sliced its sword arm with a cut two as he swept past he looked behind as he reined about and saw two dragoons unhorsed by the violence of the collision he saw mole brought to a halt and bend his elbow in the instinct to protect his face the tulwar sliced his forearm mole dropped his sabre then the tulwar sliced his neck he fell sideways from the saddle his face contorted with terror hervey raging made straight for his executioner and took him between the shoulder blades with the point he cut left and right at burmans who had not yet turned he saw collins duelling and mccarthy hacking artlessly but bloodily he saw seton canning in a desperate fight with two burmans at once and then lingard and vanneck coming to his aid he saw armstrong then the burmans were wheeling and trying to fight back the way they had come rally rally he shouted storrs breathless and his own sword red just kept sounding the g and the c somehow the troop battered and very bloody formed line and fronted armstrong and collins chivvying them straight and cursing those who had not sloped swords properly one or two of them could barely stay upright corporal mossops sword arm hung limp like a rag dolls needham had lost an ear but every horse was on its feet one way or another i brought up all we could spare when i saw what was happening sir called armstrong as he closed to herveys side but only the halfdozen of us gutless bastards them burmans hervey looked at him askance did you not see sir half of em sat still on their arses back there when the others came on hervey took out his telescope theres a very pretty flag there that was their trouble they wouldnt leave whoever was bottom of it well thank christ for flags another dozen and wed have lost it hervey looked at moles lifeless body thirty yards or so in front of them troop will advance jesus jobie not again gasped needham i reckon weve got to sammy haaalt they stopped just short of where private mole lay if you please corporal mccarthy said hervey simply thank you sor replied mccarthy as if it were a favour to him give me a hand boys he said nodding to harkness and rudd hervey watched as they lifted their fellow dragoon across mccarthys saddle troop will retire at the trot they aboutfaced three times in the first furlong to the river each time hervey expected to see the burmans pressing them but each time he saw the distance between them only lengthening were they really gutless or merely artless the third time he decided it was probably the latter for now he saw them extending and a far longer line than his the burman horse could not outrun him now not take his flanks but if he judged it badly they might give him another mauling he tried to calculate if it was worth standing long enough to give them a round from the carbines to check their zeal he would lose men to theirs if he did and it would do little to slow their advance he could now see corporal ashbolt at the bridge with half a dozen men dismounted the led horses trotting along the rivers edge behind the line of burning barges ashbolt could hardly have had the best view of the field but he had judged at once that their withdrawal could no longer be by the way they had come hervey was relieved he had feared he might have his force divided two more fronts and they were close on the bridge but hervey saw to his dismay that the second gun was still not across the sowars struggled desperately to remove the pin that held fast the barrel to the trail seton canning looked hard at him what do we do hervey hervey was only certain of what he would not do i could never abandon a gun harry he saw corporal ashbolt mount and gallop towards him that bridge wont take any more horses sir called ashbolt from a dozen yards the deckings broken away and the supports are gone the farriers breaking the pin on that gun now and well have it across in a minute the other can fire grape id like to put my burmans in the river if its all right with you sir hervey looked back to where ashbolts prisoners sat more than a hundred of them for the moment quiet you would only be able to drive them in with the point and there are too many for that are they bound yes sir then cover them with the other gun and give no quarter if any try to break free ashbolt raced back to the bridge to drive the sweating sowars and dragoons across before setting to with the charges he had made enough he hoped to destroy the centre of the span at least in two more minutes hervey saw the burman flanks turning to pen him up against the river and behind the centre of the line a column of infantry coming on at the double he glanced over his shoulder again the second gun had made the far bank it was time for them to do the same but how would he then check the burmans for they could surely swim the karnaphuli as well as the troop could he glanced back again ashbolt had a dozen men along the bank carbines ready and the second gun would be in action soon he wondered if one more sabre charge might demoralize the burmans it was not unknown in india indeed it had been the sole tactic of many a campaign he looked at the burman line and then at his own troop will retire he called as calmly as he might he thanked god they had swum the karnaphuli once before at least he was asking nothing new of them now in they plunged needing no urging ashbolts men began their covering fire and then the gun thundered hervey heard the whistle of grape above his head just like the night at brighton except that there it was so dark he had no idea how many or how close the enemy was his mare jumped from the bank and struck out confidently the current was stronger than the first time but nothing to worry about she swam freely seeming to enjoy it not long now to the far bank another ten yards at most she gained a footing lost it then stumbled almost throwing him he looked right and left to see how the others were faring well enough some were even ahead of him he let her get her footing again one more try and then hed slip from the saddle but she got all four feet firm and up the bank she struggled until hervey jumped off near the top to let her clamber up the overhang the easier he turned about johnson was just behind him almost out too but his mare couldnt get the measure of the overhang and johnson was a fraction too slow in leaving the saddle the mare fell on her side pinning him under the water she couldnt shift for all her flaying and now shots were ringing out from the burman bank ragged at first but close hervey scrambled back down the bank the mare squealed as a musket ball struck her quarters but still she lay thrashing shepherd stent followed him down and storrs and then corporal mccarthy last across the bridge with private moles body the firing increased though fortunately not its accuracy hervey would himself have put a bullet in the downed mares head had he not thought the dead weight would impede them greater but somehow slipping and sliding with ball flying about them and the frantic mares legs liable at any second to propel them into the river they pulled johnson free and dragged him up the bank and there he lay like parkin before him reliant on the skill of the surgeon the firing slackened and then stopped altogether hervey couldnt for the life of him think why for the burmans now had every advantage perhaps they were gutless as well as artless after all then came the cheering behind him loud and hearty himmatimardan and the gun sowars faint by comparison but fullthroated madadikhuda himmatimardan madadikhuda hervey stood up the sight astonished him the skinners men debouched from the forest as if trotting to exercise he lost count at fifty there must be half that number again lance pennants fluttered then out came the carbines as the sowars slung their lances over the shoulder the line of yellow stretched the length of the bank it was a sight he would never forget like the solid walls of red at waterloo and all the time the cheering himmatimardan madadikhuda chapter twentythree nemesis chittagong two days later eyre somervile stood by his desk in the lieutenantgovernors new residency on the hill north and west of the sadarghat it was a fine building of white stone in the classical manner the interior of which though unfinished spoke of the permanence of the honourable east india companys investment in the country somervile wore a dark blue coat and a cream stock and around his neck the order of knight companion of the bath a military honour of which he was at the same time both proud and abashed for the circumstances of the honouring had been peculiar in the extreme nevertheless for his coming encounter to wear it this morning suited his purpose very well indeed as the clocks began striking eleven his secretary entered and announced his excellency wundauk maha thilwa envoy of the viceroy of arakan somervile turned to face the envoy and bowed the viceroy of arakan was king bagyidaws vassal there was no doubting the reason for the envoys calling wundauk maha thilwa bowed by return he was an arresting figure if shorter than somervile cleanshaven and with searching eyes he wore a long green robe fastened about the waist with a wide cummerbund and carried an ornately carved ivory staff he came alone having no need of an interpreter to what do we owe this honour your excellency asked somervile gravely wundauk maha thilwa lifted his head so that his eyes could look down at his interlocutor rather than up i bring you an ultimatum from his highness the viceroy he began making a small bow at the mention of the rank for many months now the domains of his majesty the king he made another deeper bow have been violated by fugitive subjects of his majesty here in chittagong on numerous occasions his highness the viceroy has asked for the expulsion of the fugitives for their return to face justice but this has been refused he paused for an effect of greater portent i am therefore commanded to inform your excellency that unless by the going down of the sun today i on his highnesss behalf receive word that the fugitives will be delivered up to his majestys justice an immediate attack shall be made upon chittagong and the territory annexed somervile did not flinch indeed he would play the envoy for further intelligence he made himself speak with an air of cool detachment laying aside for the moment the propriety some would say impudence infamy even of such a threat how might you be able to execute it there is a squadron of frigates in the bay a brigade will arrive within the fortnight from calcutta and on the border with arakan is a force of cavalry wundauk maha thilwa looked at him contemptuously how could this high representative of the british be so dullwitted as to think that these were the only ways by which the superior troops of ava could come and how careless of his own secrets was this mere man of government somervile was satisfied now was the time your excellency i beg you would accept my compliments for your faultless command of english wundauk maha thilwa inclined his head condescendingly the avan court is superior in every respect to those of the outer world indeed you would not say then you will be familiar with the phrase that you had burned your boats in coming here wundauk maha thilwa smiled like a jackal how unfortunately apt was this functionarys choice of words no excellency he replied shaking his head pityingly we have by no means burned our boats somervile pulled open the drawer of his desk and took out a bundle of silk he flung it down so that its royal emblem was at once apparent no your excellency but we have at one oclock eyre somervile rode back to his bungalow in the civil lines and told emma what had transpired with the burman envoy i do wish you had let me observe secretly she said pouring him a glass of claret not so much to see the envoy but you oh i was nothing i assure you ive played wilier fish on the nagari anyway the honour is all herveys emma sighed i shall only be able to rest when we see him what else did the serjeant say nothing more than you heard yourself at breakfast except that there was a man of his who had deserted before the action and that he would not be surprised if hervey didnt want to hunt him down himself where is serjeant collins now i should very much like to hear more of their time in the jungle somervile smiled sleeping i shouldnt wonder the poor devil had ridden day and night two days and nights well i shall send word for him to come here to bathe and take his ease the minute he wakes i beg you would but i also believe the native horse are due high honours captain pollock emerges from this a considerably stouter man than id imagined oh yes said emma a little uncertainly i didnt rightly understand the circumstances of their being at the river it was deuced resourceful pronounced somervile holding out his glass for emma to refill all their orders said was for them to patrol the forest edge nothing about the border but pollock it seems heard tell of the chakma guides whod arrived at the rendezvous with herveys troop two days late well not late theyd got there as soon as they could they just hadnt received word in time so pollock took it upon himself to go with them after hervey but hed taken a more roundabout route so they met only at the river how in gods name pollock could make himself understood with the chakma i cannot imagine his glass was empty again emma shook her head i think were bidden to luncheon somervile put his glass down id better summon a hircarrah and send off a despatch to calcutta this afternoon they can have a fuller one when hervey returns with any luck well see him by tomorrow evening hervey angrily brushed away a barbed attap frond which hooked into the sleeve of his tunic the jungle was becoming thicker did these chakma guides really know where they were going yet for all the trouble he was having they were making faster progress now than they had on the wide tracks at the start of the expedition it was just one of those imponderables six men and horses with tribal guides made quicker headway than forty on uncertain bearings even on better going he wondered again about johnson not a rib unbroken said the surgeon how could a man be half drowned and have every rib broken and the surgeon say he would live he wished he had allowed some dhoolies to be brought they had fashioned a decent makeshift one but johnsons ride back to chittagong could not be comfortable but ledley had said that he wouldnt feel a thing or know a thing by the time hed had the laudanum it was just the worst time to leave him that was the trouble he had to recover french though but poor french might be dead would the surgeons orderly and boy porrit make their own way back in that case then there was the girl thank god thank all their gods that pollock and his men had come when they had he didnt want to think what would have happened had they had to limp back fighting all the way a rearguard of skinners horse he could scarcely have hoped and not a shot after the first hour the burmans had undoubtedly given in seton canning would have the troop back in chittagong tomorrow night and if these chakma really knew their business he would not be long behind them and then what a tamasha theyd have a celebration with skinners the like of which the sixth hadnt seen since theyd got to paris another attap frond struck him in the face he broke it off and gave it to his mare behind him she would eat anything and then suddenly there were no more attap fronds just a track the hoofmarks plain to see as the chakma turned left captain hervey sir private french now more recognizable than when hervey had last seen him and certainly more mobile came towards them with a look both relieved and anxious dont sound so surprised french im not in the habit of forgetting people said hervey drily do those buttons up young french came corporal ashbolts voice from behind and wheres your carbine porrit has it sir porrit said ashbolt disbelieving hes guarding dodds sir hervey pushed past him roughly and almost doubled to where boy porrit otway the surgeons assistant and dodds sat porrit and otway scrambled to their feet but dodds remained seated his back against a tree eyes closed his thigh was bandaged and bloodstained hervey turned back to french well sir dodds came yesterday morning he said hed got lost going for water we told him which way youd gone but he said hed better wait with us then yesterday evening he tried to take the food youd left us and wanted the girl to go with him then it came to a bit of a fight sir and dodds threatened his pistol and grabbed the girl and thats when the boy fired sir hervey glanced at porrit who lowered his eyes you did well boy he said grimly he would not quibble about his aim at this time and where is the girl she she went for some privacy a few minutes ago sir said french with admirable decorum hervey raised an eyebrow glanced at dodds and then the surgeons orderly hes been unconscious an hour and more sir said otway he bled a lot corporal ashbolt took a closer look youd better check im again ottie i reckon es gone the surgeons orderly felt in vain for doddss pulse then opened an eyelid ay es dead hervey cursed then hes cheated the gallows just as hes cheated in everything before chapter twentyfour under authority the maidan chittagong a week later e troop carry swords up from the slope went the points of forty sabres in whitegloved hands horses threw their heads about as if to add their own salute gilberts throat plume danced as hervey shouted the command skinners horse atteeenshun echoed captain pollock four hundred heads atop yellow kurtas braced up lance pennants caught the breeze and the sun glinted on the gleaming barrels of the galloper guns an uneven parade but an apt one thought hervey as he rode up to the dais and dropped his sword in salute eyre somervile was dressed the same as when he had faced the avan envoy in his hand were a few notes in hindoostani and english he would alternate between the two and leave both kings and native horse in no doubt of the great service they had rendered and the esteem in which the presidency in calcutta held their actions gentlemen i stand before you humbly in the face of courage and resource beyond what it is common to behold thats nice said johnson painfully from a chair at the edge of the maidan his chest swaddled in bandages i was sure itd end up a lagging matter hicks frowned i just wish id been there therell be no talking to anybody now bloody leg it were no place for a cripple i can tell thee somerviles hindoostani found its mark just as surely among the ranks of yellow where heads nodded approvingly he sang the praises of kings troops and companys fulsomely though he warned that the king of ava was a predatory and corrupt man and that the day might be sooner than they thought when an altogether bigger expedition would have to be mounted to put an end to his designs on the lawful territory of the honourable company see hicksy thall soon ave a chance to get thi own back said johnson almost smiling somervile said that he had recommended to the council of the presidency that some pecuniary reward be given there were murmurs of approval everywhere and that he was pleased even now to be able to announce that the companys gold and silver medals would be awarded respectively to captain hervey and captain pollock the approval of both yellow ranks and blue was at once apparent bloody right an all said johnson nodding his head too vigorously for his own good i bet there isnt another officer as could have done better than capn ervey not even as good as i am pleased meanwhile to grant three days furlough added somervile at the end of which i shall deem it a privilege to hold a tamasha to honour both gallant regiments god save the king the response was hearty if dominated by the sowars hazoors and then as at the river himmatimardan madadikhuda himmatimardan madadikhuda later at lunch with the somerviles hervey expressed himself grateful for the words on parade it was after all the reason we came here was it not to restore our selfregard you think the words were not too cautious then hervey smiled no indeed you have a very noble way with them you think i was too florid not in the slightest i envy you your eloquence the men appreciated it of that im sure somervile nodded content and beckoned the khitmagar to bring champagne i have a mind too you know that that girl you rescued all sir gawainlike will turn out a handsome investment once returned to her father emma picked up her glass i must say for my part i thought her very handsome even without her father what say you matthew hervey smiled back at her yes very handsome the men call her the china doll somervile looked puzzled though she is shan emma smiled again punctiliousness in these affairs was one of the things she so admired in her husband hervey raised his hands we are far from home you should speak with her hervey said somervile dabbing at his forehead with his napkin she is the most engaging of company hervey frowned with you to interpret for us somervile looked puzzled im surprised you didnt try portuguese with her hervey felt deflated almost foolish he remembered how well just a very little of the language had served him in the peninsula he smiled missionaries again i suppose and merchants hervey no i tell you we have made a most grateful and gratifying connection there you are being most abstemious matthew said emma feeling a little sorry for him can we not tempt you to more champagne no thank you maam i intend riding out this afternoon he drained his coffee cup and accepted more then returned to somerviles speculation you believe i imagine that she and her father might be a grateful source of intelligence on events in ava no doubt of it ive seen it before many a time hervey took another sip of his coffee tell me somervile you were very frank on parade in your views on the prospects with bagyidaw what is your true estimation somervile sat back in his chair and sipped at his champagne two years three perhaps the problem is assam until calcutta decides what its connection is to be with the king there the whole of the presidency will be hostage to ava and as soon as were drawn into a fight with ava every little nabob in hindoostan will think he can make mischief believe me hervey before your regiment sees the english coast again youll be deep in the thick of fighting on one side of bengal or the other perhaps even both and it will be no mere troop affair hervey raised his eyebrows it can feel devilish hot even in the middle of a troop affair yes yes hervey i know said somervile waving his hand dont lets confuse matters hervey smiled perhaps just a very little champagne before i ride hervey took off gilberts saddle and handed it to private hicks then he unfastened the headstall and slipped the reins over the geldings ears taking off the bridle and putting on the halter in one movement ill rub him down hicks bring his flysheet if you will and hicks sir you made a good job of looking after him thank you thank you sir in the adjacent stall emma somervile attempted the same with her mount but met with a firm refusal no maam she can be a mite rancorous lingards words carried conviction and though emma would count herself a proficient sidesaddle and astride she readily deferred this evening she can indeed hervey affirmed going hard at gilberts saddle mark with the curry comb but shes been as handy as jessye almost these last weeks high praise indeed smiled emma but you thought her worthy of it did you not of course i said so before i dont think my mare would jump ditches so freely hervey stood aside to let hicks put on the flysheet thank you for riding with me it would have been a dull affair otherwise it was good for me too i havent been able to tempt eyre to ride out in weeks hervey nodded to hicks to say he was finished then turned to emma again come or we shall be late for the lieutenantgovernor dinner as well as luncheon i am excessively honoured she smiled again and he is excessively proud of you i read his despatch to calcutta but to him is due the real honour to decide to act was the truly courageous thing any soldier should have been able to do what i did emmas smile halfturned to frown matthew hervey can you possibly believe your conduct was commonplace he would not answer at first they walked a little way parkins death goes heavier for not being the burmans doing you know she took his arm drownings so casual a thing and played out before your eyes in spite of every exertion and likely as not he was unfit to be at duty emma gripped his arm a little tighter im sorry i didnt mean to imply no of course not said hervey touching her hand in return im being recalcitrant as my sister would say the truth is it could so easily have been three to the river emma nodded private johnson was in cordial spirits this morning i came across him watching the parade he kept calling me miss that was what johnson always called henrietta thought hervey but he wouldnt mention it today the surgeon says hell be at light duties within the month but he swallowed so much of that foul river that i should have thought it weeks before he was purged emma nodded again he said it was nothing at least that is what i think he said hervey smiled oh indeed indeed johnson would be the first to tell you its nothing compared with what he suffered in the workhouse theres bound to be a river in sheffield at least twice as noxious as the karnaphuli you are very fortunate to have such men as he and your serjeants so devoted hervey knew it though devotion would not have been his word that is why im anxious to return to calcutta a troop doesnt fare well on its own for too long although theyre mightily pleased with themselves at present and with very just cause and your regiment will be equally anxious to welcome you there too that was a very handsome letter from your colonel yes agreed hervey a little bashfully they walked on a few paces in silence it was emma who broke it and with a change in her tone to something less assured you are content to be in these parts then matthew i mean in the companys domain hervey sighed to himself was it possible to give a complete answer to such a question you are the sundayschool teacher emma or were in madras you should know there cannot be perfect contentment here on earth but i know we must strive for it we cannot be content until the kingdom of god is come on earth she hesitated again and shall you find here do you think the complete society for contentment hervey smiled a little indulgently my dear emma i am a soldier the past ten years have set their seal on things i have ever found the centurions a sure voice though for i also am a man set under authority having under me soldiers yes and each element derives from the other you told me how it cheered you so much when serjeant collins reported that i had gone back to search for those dragoons but i could not imagine it any other way dont mistake me i have no excess of sentiment in this had he lived i would have had that dragoon who deserted brought to the regiment and hanged and just as surely i will never be a slave to authority so powerful a testament required a respectful silence at least for a while but when they reached the point where the path divided one way to his quarters the other to hers emma put her hand on his arm again matthew you will ever have loving friends in eyre and me and we shall resume our intimacy at calcutta soon you will be fêted for your feats of arms and rightly so but do have a care for not everything in india can fit so exacting a pattern as yours he smiled again how well did she understand him a trumpet sounded in the lines beyond at once commanding his attention emma looked dismayed a trumpet and at once you forget where you are how do you know it sounds for you and not the native horse hervey smiled the more madam every dragoon recognizes his regimental call the end historical afternote the burmese were not to be deterred in they reduced the kingdom of assam and the principality of muneepore the following year they demanded the surrender of the island of shaporooree in the estuary of the teek naaf which formed the boundary between chittagong and arakan incidentally the karnaphuli known more usually at this time as the chittagong river follows a very different course today the new governorgeneral lord amherst sent troops to dislodge them but also a letter to the king of ava which convinced the burmese court that the british had no stomach for a fight the burmese general and national hero mahâ bundoola was despatched with a large army to arakan with orders to drive the british from the whole of bengal lord amherst found himself with no alternative but to declare war on the king in february the commanderinchief lieutenantgeneral sir edward paget had profound misgivings about offensive operations for in burma he said we should find nothing but jungle pestilence and famine he therefore favoured a maritime and riverine strategy and accordingly a combined naval and military expedition was assembled in the andaman islands under command of another peninsular veteran majorgeneral archibald campbell to the inexpressible surprise of the burmese the flotilla arrived off the great port of rangoon on may thereafter the expeditionary force illprepared in so many ways was to discover the truth of the commanderinchiefs foreboding skinners horse the regiment of irregular cavalry founded by james skinner the son of a scotch officer in the honourable east india company and a rajput woman of rank is today second only to the presidents bodyguard in seniority in the army of india skinners horse wear the yellow kurta still the colour chosen by colonel skinner from rajput legend a rajput prince riding out to fight would vow that if he could not win he would die his men accepting the commitment put saffron on their faces and a yellow cloak over their armour these were called the clothes of the dead and the warriors were known as the yellow men who would not return from battle unless victorious they were sworn to die in skinners horse at one time better known to the world perhaps as the st bengal lancers celebrate the bicentenary of their founding it is certain that the words given them by james skinner will ring out on parade that day himmatimardan madadikhuda the bravery of man by
